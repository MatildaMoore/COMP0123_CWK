TI Three-Josephson junctions flux qubit couplings
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We analyze the coupling of two flux qubits with a general many-body projector into the low-energy subspace. Specifically, we extract the effective Hamiltonians that controls the dynamics of two qubits when they are coupled via a capacitor and/or via a Josephson junction. While the capacitor induces a static charge coupling tunable by design, the Josephson junction produces a magnetic-like interaction easily tunable by replacing the junction with a superconducting quantum interference device. Those two elements allow to engineer qubits Hamiltonians with XX, YY, and ZZ interactions, including ultrastrongly coupled ones. We present an exhaustive numerical study for two three-Josephson junctions flux qubit that can be directly used in experimental work. The method developed here, namely, the numerical tool to extract qubit effective Hamiltonians at strong coupling, can be applied to replicate our analysis for general systems of many qubits and any type of coupling.

TI Efficient Backcasting Search for Optical Quantum State Synthesis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Gaussian states are essential for many optical quantum technologies. The so-called optical quantum state synthesizer (OQSS), consisting of Gaussian input states, linear optics, and photon-number resolving detectors, is a promising method for non-Gaussian state preparation. However, an inevitable and crucial problem is the complexity of the numerical simulation of the state preparation on a classical computer. This problem makes it very challenging to generate important non-Gaussian states required for advanced quantum information processing. Thus, an efficient method to design OQSS circuits is highly desirable. To circumvent the problem, we offer a scheme employing a backcasting approach, where the circuit of OQSS is divided into some sublayers, and we simulate the OQSS backwards from final to first layers. Moreover, our results show that the detected photon number by each detector is at most 2, which can significantly reduce the requirements for the photon-number resolving detector. By virtue of the potential for the preparation of a wide variety of non-Gaussian states, the proposed OQSS can be a key ingredient in general optical quantum information processing.

TI Photoluminescence line shapes for color centers in silicon carbide from
   density functional theory calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Silicon carbide with optically and magnetically active point defects offers unique opportunities for quantum technology applications. Since interaction with these defects commonly happens through optical excitation and deexcitation, a complete understanding of their light-matter interaction in general and optical signatures in particular is crucial. Here, we employ quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations to investigate the photoluminescence line shapes of selected, experimentally observed color centers (including single vacancies, double vacancies, and vacancy-impurity pairs) in 4H-SiC. The analysis of zero-phonon lines as well as Huang-Rhys and Debye-Waller factors is accompanied by a detailed study of the underlying lattice vibrations. We show that the defect line shapes are governed by strong coupling to bulk phonons at lower energies and localized vibrational modes at higher energies. Generally, good agreement with the available experimental data is obtained, and thus we expect our theoretical work to be beneficial for the identification of defect signatures in the photoluminescence spectra and thereby advance the research in quantum photonics and quantum information processing.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB We present a comprehensive literature review and comparative study on the deployment strategies of quantum key distribution (QKD) networks for global coverage. The state-of-the-art deployment strategies, including terrestrial QKD via optical fibers, free-space QKD via ground-based fixed links and ground-to-air dynamic links, and satellite QKD, are reviewed and compared in terms of channel loss, interference, distance limit, connection topology, and deployment cost. Selection criteria and deployment strategies are developed to enable a global coverage of QKD networks from intercontinental, long-haul, metro, to access networks.

TI Side-Channel Free Measurement-Device- Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution Based on Source Monitoring
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can remove all detector side-channel attacks. However, there are still some assumptions on source preparations in MDI-QKD protocols, which are too strict to achieve in real-life implementations. To remove those assumptions, here we construct a scheme on characterizing the source modulation errors with Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferences. Furthermore, we combine it with the decoy-state method and present the security analysis. Besides, finite data-size effects are taken into account as well. Simulation results verify the feasibility and practicability of this scheme. It thus seems a very promising candidate for constructing high-security network in the near future.

TI Argon-Milling-Induced Decoherence Mechanisms in Superconducting Quantum
   Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The fabrication of superconducting circuits requires multiple deposition, etching, and cleaning steps, each possibly introducing material property changes and microscopic defects. In this work, we specifically investigate the process of argon milling, a potentially coherence-limiting step, using niobium and aluminum superconducting resonators as a proxy for the surface-limited behavior of qubits. We find that niobium microwave resonators exhibit an order of magnitude decrease in quality factors after surface argon milling, while aluminum resonators are resilient to the same process. Extensive analysis of the niobium surface shows no change in the suboxide composition due to argon milling, while two-tone spectroscopy measurements reveal an increase in two-level system electrical dipole moments, indicating a structurally altered niobium oxide. However, a short dry etch can fully recover the argon-milling-induced losses on niobium, offering a potential route towards state-of-the-art overlap Josephson junction qubits with niobium circuitry.

TI Exactly solving the Kitaev chain and generating Majorana-zero-modes out
   of noisy qubits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Majorana-zero-modes (MZMs) were predicted to exist as edge states of a physical system called the Kitaev chain. MZMs should host particles that are their own antiparticles and could be used as a basis for a qubit which is robust-to-noise. However, all attempts to prove their existence gave inconclusive results. Here, the Kitaev chain is exactly solved with a quantum computing methodology and properties of MZMs are probed by generating eigenstates of the Kitev Hamiltonian on 3 noisy qubits of a publicly available quantum computer. After an ontological elaboration I show that two eigenstates of the Kitaev Hamiltonian exhibit eight signatures attributed to MZMs. The results presented here are a most comprehensive set of validations of MZMs ever conducted in an actual physical system. Furthermore, the findings of this manuscript are easily reproducible for any user of publicly available quantum computers, solving another important problem of research with MZMs-the result reproducibility crisis.

TI Temporal Entanglement in Chaotic Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The concept of space evolution (or space-time duality) has emerged as a promising approach for studying quantum dynamics. The basic idea involves exchanging the roles of space and time, evolving the system using a space transfer matrix rather than the time evolution operator. The infinite-volume limit is then described by the fixed points of the latter transfer matrix, also known as influence matrices. To establish the potential of this method as a bona fide computational scheme, it is important to understand whether the influence matrices can be efficiently encoded in a classical computer. Here we begin this quest by presenting a systematic characterization of their entanglement-dubbed temporal entanglement-in chaotic quantum systems. We consider the most general form of space evolution, i.e., evolution in a generic spacelike direction, and present two fundamental results. First, we show that temporal entanglement always follows a volume law in time. Second, we identify two marginal cases-(i) pure space evolution in generic chaotic systems and (ii) any spacelike evolution in dual-unitary circuits-where Renyi entropies with index larger than one are sublinear in time while the von Neumann entanglement entropy grows linearly. We attribute this behavior to the existence of a product state with large overlap with the influence matrices. This unexpected structure in the temporal entanglement spectrum might be the key to an efficient computational implementation of the space evolution.

TI Nonlocality sharing for a three-qubit system via multilateral sequential
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocality sharing for a three-qubit system via multilateral sequential measurements was deeply discussed. Nonlocality sharing based on the multiple violations of Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality in the trilateral sequential measurements scenario can be observed, where all of eight MABK inequalities can be violated simultaneously. Nevertheless, the genuine nonlocality sharing based on the multiple violation of Svetlichny inequality can be only observed in the unilateral sequential measurements scenario. Compared with two-qubit cases, the nonlocality sharing in a three-qubit system shows more fruitful characteristics.

TI Phase Compensation for Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   Based on Convolutional Neural Network
SO PHOTONICS
AB Phase drift extremely limits the secure key rate and secure transmission distance, which is non-negligible in local oscillation continuous variable quantum key distribution (LLO CV-QKD). In order to eliminate the impact caused by phase drift, we analyze the phase noise of the system and propose a phase compensation method based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, the compensation is performed on the signal according to the estimated value of phase drift before coherent detection. In numerical simulation, we compare the performance of phase compensation methods based on CNN and Kalman filter (KF), and the results show that CNN-based phase compensation has higher accuracy and stability.

TI Universal noise-precision relations in variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are expected to become a practical application of near-term noisy quantum computers. Although the effect of the noise crucially determines whether a VQA works, the heuristic nature of VQAs makes it difficult to establish analytic theories. Analytic estimations of the impact of the noise are urgent for searching for quantum advantages, as numerical simulations of noisy quantum computers on classical computers are heavy and quite limited to small-scale problems. In this paper, we establish analytic estimations of the error in the cost function of VQAs due to the noise. The estimations are applicable to any typical VQAs under Gaussian noise, which is equivalent to a class of stochastic noise models. Notably, depolarizing noise is included in this model. As a result, we obtain estimations of the noise level to guarantee a required precision. Our formulas show how the Hessian of the cost function, the spectrum of the target operator, and the geometry of the ansatz affect the sensitivity to the noise. This insight implies trade-off relations between the trainability and the noise resilience of the cost function. We also obtain rough estimations which can be easily calculated without detailed information of the cost function. As a highlight of the applications of the formula, we propose a quantum error mitigation method which is different from the extrapolation and the probabilistic error cancellation.

TI Frequency-multiplexed entanglement for continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum key distribution with continuous variables already uses advantageous high-speed single-mode homodyne detection with low electronic noise at room temperature. Together with continuous-variable information encoding to nonclassical states, the distance for secure key transmission through lossy channels can approach 300 km in current optical fibers. Such protocols tolerate higher channel noise and also limited data processing efficiency compared to coherent-state protocols. The secret key rate can be further increased by increasing the system clock rates, and, further, by a suitable frequency-mode-multiplexing of optical transmission channels. However, the multiplexed modes couple together in the source or any other part of the protocol. Therefore, multiplexed communication will experience cross talk and the gain can be minuscule. Advantageously, homodyne detectors allow solving this cross-talk problem by proper data processing. It is a potential advantage over protocols with single-photon detectors, which do not enable similar data processing techniques. We demonstrate the positive outcome of this methodology on the experimentally characterized frequency-multiplexed entangled source of femtosecond optical pulses with natural cross talk between eight entangled pairs of modes. As the main result, we predict the almost 15-fold higher secret key rate. This experimental test and analysis of frequency-multiplexed entanglement source open the way for the field implementation of high-capacity quantum key distribution with continuous variables.

TI Tight finite-key analysis for mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) is a potential protocol that is not only immune to all possible detector side channel attacks, but also breaks the repeaterless rate-transmittance bound without needing global phase locking. Here we analyze the finite-key effect for the MP-QKD protocol with rigorous security proof against general attacks. Moreover, we propose a six-state MP-QKD protocol and analyze its finite-key effect. The results show that the original protocol can break the repeaterless rate-transmittance bound with a typical finite number of pulses in practice. And our six-state protocol can improve the secret key rate significantly in long distance cases.

TI Efficient Criteria of Quantumness for a Large System of Qubits

AB In order to model and evaluate large-scale quantum systems, e.g., quantum computer and quantum annealer, it is necessary to quantify the "quantumness" of such systems. In this paper, we discuss the dimensionless combinations of basic parameters of large, partially quantum coherent systems, which could be used to characterize their degree of quantumness. Based on analytical and numerical calculations, we suggest one such number for a system of qubits undergoing adiabatic evolution, i.e., the accessibility index. Applying it to the case of D-Wave One superconducting quantum annealing device, we find that its operation as described falls well within the quantum domain.

TI Higher-Dimensional Communications Using Multimode Fibers and Compact
   Components to Enable a Dense Set of Communicating Channels
SO OPTICS
AB Higher-dimensional communications are of interest for multiple reasons, including increasing the classical transmission capacity and, more recently, the quantum state transfer through fibers using the many modes within the fiber. For quantum communications, this enables an increase in the number of bits per photon, increasing quantum fidelity, increasing error thresholds and enabling hyperentanglement transfer, among other possibilities. A high-dimensional quantum state transfer can be transported through multimode fiber using the many modes available. However, this transfer of information through multimode optical fiber is limited by attenuation and mode coupling among the various spatial and polarization modes. Here, we consider how this mode coupling impacts the transfer process. We consider the fiber's modal properties, including orbital angular momentum, modal group numbers, and principal modes. We also investigate and propose input and output optical components, as well as fiber properties, which better mitigate the deleterious effects of mode coupling. We use the WKB approximation to the scaler wave equation as a guidance to quantify this coupling and then implement corrections to this approximation using exact solutions to the scaler wave equation. We consider methods to circumvent this mode coupling using optical fiber designs, holographic optical components and devices that are commercially available today. Some of these components, such as the holographic gratings and lenses, could be implemented using flat optics.

TI Quantum key distribution rates from non-symmetric conic optimization
SO QUANTUM
AB Computing key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD) numerically is essential to unlock more powerful protocols, that use more sophisticated measurement bases or quantum systems of higher dimension. It is a difficult optimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function: the (quantum) relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for a long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a non-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones. Recently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing over non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this algorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient technique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has the advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.

TI Quantum information perspective on meson melting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose to use quantum information notions to characterize thermally induced melting of nonperturbative bound states at high temperatures. We apply tensor networks to investigate this idea in static and dynamical settings within the Ising quantum field theory, where bound states are confined fermion pairs-mesons. An equilibrium signature of meson melting is identified in the temperature dependence of the thermal-state second Re ' nyi entropy, which varies from exponential to power-law scaling. Out of equilibrium, we identify as the relevant signature the transition from an oscillatory to a linear growing behavior of reflected entropy after a thermal quench. These analyses apply more broadly, which brings new ways of describing in-medium meson phenomena in quantum many-body and highenergy physics.

TI Information-theoretic perspective on performance assessment and
   fundamental limit of quantum imaging [Invited]
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Performance assessment of an imaging system is important for the optimization design with various technologies. The information-theoretic viewpoint based on communication theory or statistical inference theory can provide objective and operational measures on imaging performance. These approaches can be further developed by combining with the quantum statistical inference theory for optimizing imaging performance over measurements and analyze its quantum limits, which is demanded in order to improve an imaging system when the photon shot noise in the measurement is the dominant noise source. The aim of this review is to discuss and analyze the recent developments in this branch of quantum imaging.

TI Review of some existing QML frameworks and novel hybrid
   classical-quantum neural networks realising binary classification for
   the noisy datasets
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the most promising areas of research to obtain practical advantage is Quantum Machine Learning which was born as a result of cross-fertilisation of ideas between Quantum Computing and Classical Machine Learning. In this paper, we apply Quantum Machine Learning (QML) frameworks to improve binary classification models for noisy datasets which are prevalent in financial datasets. The metric we use for assessing the performance of our quantum classifiers is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC-ROC. By combining such approaches as hybrid-neural networks, parametric circuits, and data re-uploading we create QML inspired architectures and utilise them for the classification of non-convex 2 and 3-dimensional figures. An extensive benchmarking of our new FULL HYBRID classifiers against existing quantum and classical classifier models, reveals that our novel models exhibit better learning characteristics to asymmetrical Gaussian noise in the dataset compared to known quantum classifiers and performs equally well for existing classical classifiers, with a slight improvement over classical results in the region of the high noise.

TI A universal quantum circuit design for periodical functions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a universal quantum circuit design that can estimate any arbitrary one-dimensional periodic functions based on the corresponding Fourier expansion. The quantum circuit contains N-qubits to store the information on the different N-Fourier components and M + 2 auxiliary qubits with M = left ceiling log(2) N right ceiling for control operations. The desired output will be measured in the last qubit q(N) with a time complexity of the computation of O(N-2[log(2)N](2)) , which leads to polynomial speedup under certain circumstances. We illustrate the approach by constructing the quantum circuit for the square wave function with accurate results obtained by direct simulations using the IBM-QASM simulator. The approach is general and can be applied to any arbitrary periodic function.

TI Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a
   quantum computer
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by applying the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transition frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.

TI Universal quantum control with dynamical correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Error correction is generally demanded in large-scale quantum information processing and quantum computation. We provide here a universal and real-time control strategy to dynamically correct the arbitrary type of errors in the system Hamiltonian. It yields multiple error-resilient paths for the interested system which are activated by the von Neumann equation for ancillary projection operators. With no extra control fields and precise designs, the path-dependent global phase alone suffices to mitigate the error-induced transitions among distinct paths as long as it varies faster than the other parameters. The corrected paths can also be regarded as the approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schr & ouml;dinger equation perturbed by errors. Our dynamical-correction strategy is practiced with the cyclic transfer of populations in a three-level system, showing a superior error resilience to the parallel-transport condition. It provides a promising idea for advancing control methodologies in imprecise quantum systems.

TI Charge qubit in a triple quantum dot with tunable coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The energy landscape of a single electron in a triple quantum dot can be tuned such that the energy separation between ground and excited states becomes a flat function of the relevant gate voltages. These so-called sweet spots are beneficial for charge coherence since the decoherence effects caused by small fluctuations of gate voltages or surrounding charge fluctuators are minimized We propose a new operation point for a triple quantum dot charge qubit, a so-called CQ(3)-qubit, having a third-order sweet spot. We show strong coupling of the qubit to single photons in a frequency tunable high-impedance SQUID-array resonator. In the dispersive regime, we investigate the qubit linewidth in the vicinity of the proposed operating point. In contrast to the expectation for a higher-order sweet spot, we there find a local maximum of the linewidth. We find that this is due to a non-negligible contribution of noise on the quadrupolar detuning axis not being in a sweet spot at the proposed operating point. While the original motivation to realize a low-decoherence charge qubit was not fulfilled, our analysis provides insights into charge decoherence mechanisms relevant also for other qubits.

TI Impact of receiver imbalances on the security of continuous variables
   quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) provides a theoretical unconditionally secure solution to distribute symmetric keys among users in a communication network. However, the practical devices used to implement these systems are intrinsically imperfect, and, as a result, open the door to eavesdropper attacks. In this work, we show the impact of receiver device imperfections on the estimated channel parameters, performance and security of a CV-QKD system. The presented results show that, due to the erroneously estimated channel parameters, non-monitored imbalances can pose a security risk or even reduce the system's performance. Our results show the importance of monitoring these imbalances and hint at the possibility of compensating for some receiver imbalances by tuning other components.

TI Quantum entanglement and top spin correlations in SMEFT at higher orders
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present the first analysis of top spin polarizations, t (t) over bar spin correlations, and t (t) over bar spin entanglement at the LHC in the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, that goes beyond Leading Order QCD accuracy. The complete set of independent dimension-6 operators entering t (t) over bar production is identified, and their effects on all top spin observables are extracted at linear and quadratic order in c/Lambda(2). By comparing results at LO and NLO, we note that the inclusion of higher orders, while not dramatically changing the picture, often amounts to notable numerical differences, that are not fully captured by LO scale variation. We also find that the expected deviations from the SM have an intricate phase space structure, and show up predominantly at large top pT. For this reason, we advocate for the measurement of spin observables differentially or doubly-differentially in the t (t) over bar phase-space. We show how the inclusion of present and future top spin measurements will improve global fits to top LHC data, by also addressing the issue of flat directions.

TI Fast Quantum Simulation of Electronic Structure by Spectral
   Amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The most advanced techniques using fault-tolerant quantum computers to estimate the ground-state energy of a chemical Hamiltonian involve compression of the Coulomb operator through tensor factorizations, enabling efficient block encodings of the Hamiltonian. A natural challenge of these methods is the degree to which block-encoding costs can be reduced. We address this challenge through the technique of spectral amplification, which magnifies the spectrum of the low-energy states of Hamiltonians that can be expressed as sums of squares. Spectral amplification enables estimating ground-state energies with significantly improved cost scaling in the block encoding normalization factor Lambda to just root 2 Lambda E-gap, where E-gap <<Lambda is the lowest energy of the sum-of-squares Hamiltonian. To achieve this, we show that sum-of-squares representations of the electronic structure Hamiltonian are efficiently computable by a family of classical simulation techniques that approximate the ground-state energy from below. In order to further optimize, we also develop a novel factorization that provides a trade-off between the two leading Coulomb integral factorization schemes-namely, double factorization and tensor hypercontraction-that when combined with spectral amplification yields a factor of 4 to 195 speedup over the state of the art in ground-state energy estimation for models of iron-sulfur complexes and a CO2

TI Quantum algorithm to simulate Lindblad master equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a quantum algorithm for simulating a family of Markovian master equations that can be realized through a probabilistic application of unitary channels and state preparation. Our approach employs a second-order product formula for the Lindblad master equation, achieved by decomposing the dynamics into dissipative and Hamiltonian components and replacing the dissipative segments with randomly compiled, easily implementable elements. The sampling approach eliminates the need for ancillary qubits to simulate the dissipation process and reduces the gate complexity in terms of the number of jump operators. We provide a rigorous performance analysis of the algorithm. We also extend the algorithm to time-dependent Lindblad equations, generalize the family of Markovian master equations it can be applied to, and explore applications beyond the Markovian noise model. A new error bound, in terms of the diamond norm, for second-order product formulas for time-dependent Liouvillians is provided that might be of independent interest.

TI Unscrambling Quantum Information with Clifford Decoders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum information scrambling is a unitary process that destroys local correlations and spreads information throughout the system, effectively hiding it in nonlocal degrees of freedom. In principle, unscrambling this information is possible with perfect knowledge of the unitary dynamics [B. Yoshida and A. Kitaev, arXiv:1710.03363.]. However, this Letter demonstrates that even without previous knowledge of the internal dynamics, information can be efficiently decoded from an unknown scrambler by monitoring the outgoing information of a local subsystem. We show that rapidly mixing but not fully chaotic scramblers can be decoded using Clifford decoders. The essential properties of a scrambling unitary can be efficiently recovered, even if the process is exponentially complex. Specifically, we establish that a unitary operator composed of t non-Clifford gates admits a Clifford decoder up to t <= n.

TI Experimental Constraint on an Exotic Parity-Odd Spin- and
   Velocity-Dependent Interaction with a Single Electron Spin Quantum
   Sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Improved laboratory limits on the exotic spin- and velocity-dependent interaction at the micrometer scale are established with a single electron spin quantum sensor. The single electron spin of a near-surface nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is used as the quantum sensor, and a fused-silica half-sphere lens is taken as the source of the moving nucleons. The exotic interaction between the polarized electron and the moving nucleon source is explored by measuring the possible magnetic field sensed by the electron spin quantum sensor. Our experiment sets improved constraints on the exotic spin- and velocity-dependent interaction within the force range from 1.4 to 330 mu m. The upper limit of the coupling g(A)(e)g(V)(N) at 200 mu m is vertical bar g(A)(e)g(V)(N)vertical bar <= 5.3 x 10(-19), significantly improving the current laboratory limit by more than 4 orders of magnitude.

AB The possibility of interaction-free measurements and counterfactual computations is a striking feature of quantum mechanics pointed out around 20 years ago. We have designed simple quantum circuits that realize both phenomena in real 5-qubit, 15-qubit and 20-qubit IBM quantum computers. In particular, counterfactual computation in its simplest form (Jozsa protocol) cannot be directly implemented in present quantum computers, requiring the design of a modified quantum circuit. The results are in general close to the theoretical expectations. For the larger circuits (with numerous gates and consequently larger errors), we implement a simple error mitigation procedure which improve appreciably the performance.

   Based on Discriminator
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The remarkable advancement of quantum steganography offers enhanced security for quantum communications. However, there is a significant concern regarding the potential misuse of this technology. Moreover, the current research on identifying malicious quantum steganography is insufficient. To address this gap in steganalysis research, this paper proposes a specialized quantum steganalysis algorithm. This algorithm utilizes quantum machine learning techniques to detect steganography in general quantum secure communication schemes that are based on pure states. The algorithm presented in this paper consists of two main steps: data preprocessing and automatic discrimination. The data preprocessing step involves extracting and amplifying abnormal signals, followed by the automatic detection of suspicious quantum carriers through training on steganographic and non-steganographic data. The numerical results demonstrate that a larger disparity between the probability distributions of steganographic and non-steganographic data leads to a higher steganographic detection indicator, making the presence of steganography easier to detect. By selecting an appropriate threshold value, the steganography detection rate can exceed 90%.

TI Amplifying Magnetic Field Effects on Upconversion Emission via Molecular
   Qubit-Driven Triplet-Triplet Annihilation
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) enables photon upconversion by combining two lower-energy triplet excitons to produce a higher-energy singlet exciton. This mechanism enhances light-harvesting efficiency for solar energy conversion and enables the use of lower-energy photons in bioimaging and photoredox catalysis applications. The magnetic modulation of such high-energy excitons presents an exciting opportunity to develop molecular quantum information technologies. While the spin dynamics of triplet exciton pairs are sensitive to external magnetic fields, the magnetic field effects (MFEs) associated with these pairs are generally limited by spin statistics to at most 10% at low fields (<1 T), making them challenging to apply in technological advancements. In contrast, MFEs on spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) can be significantly greater, surpassing those on triplet pairs. By using SCRPs-based molecular qubits as triplet sensitizers in the sensitized TTA scheme, we can magnetically modulate TTA and consequently, the delayed fluorescence of annihilators. In our current system, we have achieved more than 70% magnetic modulation of delayed fluorescence, effectively harnessing and even amplifying magnetic modulation within SCRPs to influence high-energy excitons. This work opens new opportunities for advancing spin-controlled chemical reactions and molecular quantum information technologies.

TI Constraints on Gaussian error channels and measurements for quantum
   communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Joint Gaussian measurements of two quantum systems are important for quantum communication between remote parties and are often used in continuous-variable teleportation or entanglement-swapping protocols. Many of the errors in real-world implementations can be modeled by independent Gaussian error channels acting prior to measurement. In this work we study independent single-mode Gaussian error channels on two modes A and B that take place prior to a joint Gaussian measurement. We determine the set of pairs of such channels that render all Gaussian measurements separable and therefore unsuitable for entanglement swapping or teleportation of arbitrary input states. For example, if the error channels are loss with parameters lA and lB followed by added noise with parameters nA and nB, then all Gaussian measurements are separable if and only if lA + lB + nA + nB ?, 1.

TI Quantum computing and neuroscience for 6G/7G networks: Survey
SO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Recently significant effort has been invested in studying commonalities of human brain operation and advanced algorithms for machine learning to answer the question: Can the learning mechanisms, identified in the operation of the brain, be mimicked in artificial neural networks to enhance the learning efficiency with simultaneous reduction in complexity and power consumption. At the same time, machine learning algorithms, on their own, become increasingly complex, resulting in complex neural networks. To speed up the machine learning algorithms, research on 7G networks will be looking for new computing technologies, like quantum (q-) computing (QC), and new models for complex networks that will enable us to efficiently control/optimize the processes run on them. In this paper, under the umbrella of well-established complex networks theory, we provide a unified presentation of how quantum computing, implemented on near-future computers, can enable solving various problems in the above disciplines, otherwise difficult to solve by using classical (c-) approaches. The emphasis is on the commonalities in QC applications and modeling for the different systems listed above. For 7G network designers, the survey is expected to provide an insight into how much the research results in natural, QC based sciences can be integrated into new network paradigms to support above initiatives.

TI Intensity correlations in measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The intensity correlations due to imperfect modulation during the quantum-state preparation in a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) system compromise its security performance. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of intensity correlations on the practical security of MDI QKD systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that quantitatively analyzes the secure key rate of MDI QKD systems under intensity correlations. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical model to a practical MDI QKD system with measured intensity correlations, which shows that the system struggles to generate keys efficiently under this model. We also explore the boundary conditions of intensity correlations to generate secret keys. This study extends the security analysis of intensity correlations to MDI QKD protocols, providing a methodology to evaluate the practical security of MDI QKD systems.

TI Student attitudes toward quantum information science and technology in a
   high school outreach program
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Investigating and Improving Quantum Education through Research.] With the current growth in quantum information science and technology (QIST), there is an increasing need to prepare precollege students for postsecondary QIST study and careers. This mixed methods, explanatory sequential research focused on students' affective outcomes from a one-week, 25-h summer program for U.S. high school students in grades 10-12. The workshop structure was based upon psychosocial theories of self-determination and planned behavior, where QIST aspirations may be facilitated and viewed as achievable choices if students acquire disciplinary knowledge, self-efficacy, normative expectancy of their capacity in the field, and awareness of vocational roles. The program featured lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experiences in classical and quantum physics and quantum computing. Students' attitudes toward QIST (N N = 77)-including self-efficacy, self-concept, relevance, career aspirations, and perceptions of quantitative fluency-showed improvement with a medium effect size, even though treatment students entered the program with more positive QIST attitudes when compared with a control group of high school physics students (N N = 65). Postprogram interviews with n = 12 participants identified several explanatory themes: (i) Students tended to comprehend classical and quantum topics taught through multiple representations, regardless of whether they had taken physics previously; (ii) students experienced some challenges with mathematics and science concepts that support quantum understanding, yet they revealed a willingness to learn new concepts outside of their comfort zone; (iii) students expressed motivation for pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and/or quantum-related careers in the future, as well as increased QIST self-concept, largely through understanding the relevance of QIST in solving technological problems; and (iv) students reported increased self-efficacy in understanding QIST topics and performing related tasks. This informal summer program showed promise in promoting positive student attitudes toward QIST, a critical emerging field in advancing technological solutions for global challenges.

TI Designing Robust Quantum Neural Networks via Optimized Circuit Metrics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, the robustness of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) is investigated in comparison to their classical counterparts, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), against two adversarial attacks: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), for the image classification task on both the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) datasets. To enhance the robustness of QuNNs, a novel methodology is developed that utilizes three quantum circuit metrics: expressibility, entanglement capability, and controlled rotation gate selection. This analysis shows that these metrics significantly influence data representation within the Hilbert space, thereby directly affecting QuNN robustness. It is rigorously established that circuits with higher expressibility and lower entanglement capability generally exhibit enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions, particularly at low-spectrum perturbation strengths where most attacks occur. Furthermore, these findings challenge the prevailing assumption that expressibility alone dictates circuit robustness; instead, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of controlled rotation gates around the Z-axis generally enhances the resilience of QuNNs. These results demonstrate that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% greater robustness on the MNIST dataset and 40% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset compared to CNNs. Collectively, this work elucidates the relationship between quantum circuit metrics and robust data feature extraction, advancing the field by improving the adversarial robustness of QuNNs.

TI Vibrational Entanglement through the Lens of Quantum Information
   Measures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We introduce a quantum information analysis of vibrational wave functions to understand complex vibrational spectra of molecules with strong anharmonic couplings and vibrational resonances. For this purpose, we define one- and two-modal entropies to guide the identification of strongly coupled vibrational modes and to characterize correlations within modal basis sets. We evaluate these descriptors for multiconfigurational vibrational wave functions which we calculate with the n-mode vibrational density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies. We investigate the entanglement signature of the Fermi resonance and discuss the maximally entangled state arising from the two degenerate bending modes.

TI Continuous-mode quantum key distribution with digital signal processing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) offers the specific advantage of sharing keys remotely by the use of standard telecom components, thereby promoting cost-effective and high-performance metropolitan applications. Nevertheless, the introduction of high-rate spectrum broadening has pushed CVQKD from a single-mode to a continuous-mode region, resulting in the adoption of modern digital signal processing (DSP) technologies to recover quadrature information from continuous-mode quantum states. However, the security proof of DSP involving multi-point processing is a missing step. Here, we propose a generalized method of analyzing continuous-mode state processing by linear DSP via temporal modes theory. The construction of temporal modes is key in reducing the security proof to single-mode scenarios. The proposed practicality oriented security analysis method paves the way for building classical compatible digital CVQKD.

TI Calibrated transmission and reflection from a multi-qubit microwave
   package
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We report calibrated microwave transmission and reflection measurements of a qubit sample holder at millikelvin temperatures. The methodology we present extends our previous work on one-port cryogenic short-open-load (SOL) calibration to a two-port SOLT measurement by implementing an unknown thru (T) standard. We report the resulting calibrated transmission and reflection at millikelvin temperatures through a printed circuit board that is installed into the sample holder. Finally, we consider a cascade of components at the end of a qubit drive line that includes (1) a cryogenic attenuator, (2) a coaxial cable, and (3) a qubit sample holder. Using experimentally determined parameters for return losses for all three components, we calculate the negligible state-preparation error in the frequency band of 5-7 GHz due to control pulse distortions arising from reflection at the coaxial launches. Taken together, our results highlight the utility of calibrated cryogenic scattering parameter measurements for the validation of qubit packaging and the wiring in its immediate vicinity.

TI Quantum key distribution with basis-dependent detection probability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising technology for secure communication. Nevertheless, QKD is still treated with caution in certain contexts due to potential gaps between theoretical models and actual QKD implementations. A common assumption in security proofs is that the detection probability at the receiver, for a given input state, is independent of the measurement basis, which might not always be verified and could lead to security loopholes. This paper presents a security proof for QKD protocols that does not rely on the aforementioned assumption and is thus applicable in scenarios with detection probability mismatches, even when induced by the adversary. We demonstrate, through simulations, that our proof can extract positive key rates for setups vulnerable to large detection probability mismatches. This is achieved by one monitoring whether an adversary is actively exploiting such vulnerabilities, instead of considering the worst-case scenario as in previous proofs. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for basis-dependent detection probabilities and provides a concrete solution for improving the security of practical QKD systems.

TI Switchable and tuneable high-performance acoustic modes in the L-X band
   using ferroelectric thin film on sapphire
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB High overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBAR) are advantageous for on-chip quantum acoustodynamics (QAD) system as it gives access to stream of phonon modes with high lifetime in the microwave frequency range while retaining low power consumption and microscale footprint. In this paper we present a HBAR based on barium strontium titanate (BST) thin-film mounted on sapphire with modes exhibiting frequency quality factor product (fQ) of 1.72 x 1015 Hz which is the highest reported for a bulk acoustic wave resonator utilizing polycrystalline ferroelectric material as a means for acoustic wave excitation. Unlike other piezoelectric based HBARs, the DC field-induced piezoelectricity utilized in this work offers multiple on-chip tuneability of resonator's dynamic parameters such as phonon lifetime, frequency modulation and coupling. The higher overtone feature can enable qubit(s) in a hybrid quantum circuit to interact with one or more acoustic modes to form a quantum transducer. Here, the multi-mode resonator exhibits a unique DC bias dependency, and this feature of the ferroelectric thin film adds control variables that efficiently tune static and dynamic material, mechanical and electrical properties of the device. The resonator records a loaded quality factor of 180,000 in X band and 140,000 in the L band when measured at 10 K. A controllable robust resonator with simple fabrication technique offering high fQ can be a strong platform to be used in QAD circuits for applications in metrology, quantum memory and quantum information processing.

TI Coarse-grained quantum state tomography with optimal POVM construction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In a multiqubit system, when a detector's resolution is insufficient to distinguish between qubits, individual qubit measurement becomes impractical. This limitation results in coarse-grained (CG) measurements that dilute system information and, more critically, hinder accurate assessment of qubit correlations, making quantum state tomography (QST) infeasible. To address this issue, we propose a scheme to utilize CG measurements for QST by integrating two-qubit gates and optimizing their corresponding positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) using parametrized quantum circuits. Specifically, we focus on constructing generalized symmetric informationally complete POVMs by maximizing the von Neumann entropy of the Gram matrix of these CG POVMs. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for QST using a two-qubit model and further verify the scalability of our scheme toward N-qubit systems.

TI Student use of a quantum simulation and visualization tool
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Knowledge of quantum mechanical systems is becoming more important for many science and engineering students who are looking to join the emerging quantum workforce. To better prepare a wide range of students for these careers, we must seek to develop new tools to enhance our education in quantum topics. We present initial studies on the use of one of these such tools, Quantum Composer, a 1D quantum simulation and visualization tool developed for education and research purposes. In particular, we conducted five think-aloud interviews with students who worked through an exercise using Quantum Composer that focused on the statics and dynamics of quantum states in a single harmonic well system. Our results show that Quantum Composer helps students to obtain the correct answers to the questions posed, but additional support is needed to facilitate the development of student reasoning behind these answers. We also show that students are able to focus only on the relevant features of Quantum Composer to achieve the task.

TI High-dimensional coherent one-way quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) offers secure communication with key rates that surpass those of QKD protocols utilizing two-dimensional encoding. However, existing high-dimensional QKD protocols require additional experimental resources, such as multiport interferometers and multiple detectors, thereby increasing the cost of high-dimensional systems and limiting their use. We introduce and analyze a high-dimensional QKD protocol that requires only standard two-dimensional hardware. We provide security analysis against individual and coherent attacks, establishing upper and lower bounds on the secure key rates. We tested our protocol on a standard two-dimensional QKD system over a 40 km fiber link, achieving a twofold increase in secure key rate compared to the standard two-dimensional coherent one-way protocol, without any hardware modifications. This work offers a significant improvement in the performance of already deployed QKD systems through simple software updates and holds broad applicability across various QKD schemes, making high-dimensional QKD practical for widespread use.

TI A variational approach to quantum gated recurrent units
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks are receiving an increased attention thanks to their enhanced generalization capabilities in time series analysis. However, their performances were bottlenecked by long training times and unscalable architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel Quantum Recurrent Neural Network model based on Quantum Gated Recurrent Units. It uses a learnable Variational Quantum Layer to process temporal data, interspersed with two classical layers to properly match the dimensionality of the input and output vectors. Such an architecture has fewer quantum parameters than existing Quantum Long Short-Term Memory models. Both the quantum networks were evaluated on periodic and real-world time series datasets, together with the classical counterparts. The quantum models exhibited superior performances compared to the classical ones in all the test cases. The Quantum Gated Recurrent Units outperformed the Quantum Long Short-Term Memory network despite having a simpler internal configuration. Moreover, the Quantum Gated Recurrent Units network demonstrated to be about 25% faster during the training and inference procedure over the Quantum Long Short-Term Memory. This improvement in speed comes with one less quantum circuit to be executed, suggesting that our model may offer a more efficient alternative for implementing Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks on both simulated and real quantum hardware.

TI Generation of large-scale continuous-variable cluster states multiplexed
   both in time and frequency domains
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A large-scale continuous variable (CV) cluster state is necessary in quantum in-formation processing based on measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). Specially, generating a large-scale CV cluster state multiplexed in a time domain is easier to implement and has strong scalability in experiment. Here one-dimensional (1D) large-scale dual-rail CV cluster states multiplexed both in time and frequency domains are parallelly generated, which can be further extended to a three-dimensional (3D) CV cluster state by combining two time-delay nondegenerate optical parametric amplification systems with beam-splitters. It is shown that the number of parallel arrays depends on the corresponding frequency comb lines, the partite number of each array can be very large (million), and the scale of the 3D cluster state can be ultra-large. In addition, the concrete quantum computing schemes of applying the generated 1D and 3D cluster states are also demonstrated. Our schemes may pave the way for fault-tolerant and topologically protected MBQC in hybrid domains, by further combining with efficient coding and quantum error correction.

AB In this article, we study the evolution of the two-qubit system with Ising spin-chain environment by choosing the Lindblad equation to describe this process. First, we expand the Hamiltonian of a two-qubit system with its eigenstates and give the Lindblad equation for the evolution of the two-qubit system with Ising spin-chain as the environment. Compared with directly calculating the differential equation between elements of density matrix, we choose a method to solve the Lindblad equation with a smaller calculation dimension. Finally, by constructing an operator solution with operators, we obtain the dynamics of the two-qubit system with Ising spin-chain environment.

TI Benchmarking the quality of multiplexed qubit readout beyond assignment
   fidelity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computers. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity; however, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multiqubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum-state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as a validation tool for assignment fidelity and a more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multiqubit readout optimization. To make the best use of experimental resources, we investigate the most efficient distribution of a limited shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction within the context of single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates and test the scalability of the validation tool, we perform three-qubit quantum-state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout-error-mitigation methods and find a factor-of-30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that qubit readout correlations are not induced by a significantly reduced state distinguishability. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.

TI Decoherence of surface phonons in a quantum acoustic system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Phononic resonators are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, both for applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing as well as in experiments investigating fundamental physics. Here, we study the decoherence of phonons confined in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator strongly coupled (g/2 pi approximate to 9 MHz) to a superconducting transmon qubit. By comparing experimental data with numerical solutions to the Markovian master equation, we report a surface phononic energy decay rate of kappa 1/2 pi = 480 kHz and a pure dephasing rate of kappa phi /2 pi = 180 kHz. These rates are in good agreement with the level of decoherence we extract from qubit-assisted spectroscopic measurements of the SAW resonator. We additionally find that the timescales over which coherent driven dynamics and decoherence occur are comparable, highlighting the need to model the composite device as an open quantum system. We discuss possible sources of decoherence in SAW-based quantum acoustic devices and the application of these devices in future quantum acoustic dissipation engineering experiments. The decoherence characterization techniques we employ are broadly applicable for investigating and benchmarking the effects of loss and dephasing on mechanical resonators in the quantum regime.

TI Real-time dynamics in diluted quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce an approach to characterize the dynamics of disordered quantum networks. Each quantum element (i.e., each node) of the network experiences the other nodes as an effective environment that can be self-consistently represented by a Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For networks having the topology of locally treelike graphs, these Feynman-Vernon (FV) functionals can be determined by a new version of the cavity or belief propagation (BP) method. Here, we find the fixed point solution of this version of BP for a network of uniform quantum harmonic oscillators. Then, we estimate the effects of the disorder in these networks within the replica symmetry ansatz. We show that over a large time interval, at small disorder, the real part of the FV functional induces decoherence and classicality while at sufficiently large disorder the Feynman-Vernon functional tends to zero and the coherence survives, signaling in a time setting, the onset of an Anderson's transition.

TI Weighing unequal parameter importance and measurement expense in
   adaptive quantum sensing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A large class of experiments consists of measuring the parameters of physical models. In these experiments, the goal is to learn about these parameters as accurately and, often, quickly as possible. Adaptive experiment design works by yielding instrument control to Bayesian-based algorithms that alter instrument settings based on potential information gain about the parameters. By actively learning from data in real-time where to measure instead of determining instrument settings a priori, striking improvements in experiment efficiency are possible. Here, two new algorithms that improve upon previous implementations of adaptive experiment design are introduced. The first algorithm focuses on learning the model parameters that matter the most. The second algorithm considers the expense of a measurement and prioritizes information that can be gained at a lower cost. We demonstrate the remarkable improvement in efficiency and sensitivity that these algorithms provide for quantum sensing, specifically magnetometry, with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Most notably, we find an almost fivefold improvement in magnetic field sensitivity.

TI Boson sampling with Gaussian input states: Toward efficient scaling and
   certification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A universal quantum computer of large scale is not available yet, however, intermediate models of quantum computation would still permit demonstrations of a quantum computational advantage over classical computing and could challenge the extended Church-Turing thesis. One of these models based on single photons interacting via linear optics is called boson sampling. Although boson sampling was demonstrated and the threshold to claim quantum computational advantage was achieved, the question of how to scale up boson sampling experiments remains. To make progress with this problem, here we present a practically achievable pathway to scale boson sampling experiments by combining continuous-variable quantum information and temporal encoding. We propose the combination of switchable dual-homodyne and single-photon detections, the temporal loop technique, and scattershot-based boson sampling. We detail the required assumptions for concluding computational hardness for this configuration. Furthermore, this particular combination of techniques moves towards an efficient scaling and certification of boson sampling, all in a single experimental setup.

TI Entropic analysis of non-separability in noisy Dicke states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Characterizing quantum entanglement in mixed states is a longstanding challenge. Among the various methods available, conditional entropies serve as a powerful tool. Notably, the AR q-conditional entropy introduced by Abe and Rajagopal in 2002 has demonstrated significant promise as it often surpasses other entropy-based criteria. The wide-ranging applications of conditional entropy in quantum information underscore the importance of studying and analyzing it for a deeper understanding of quantum correlations and their implications. In this paper, we investigate the non-separability of noisy Dicke states using the AR approach of conditional entropy. Our findings reveal that the entropic criterion is equally effective as the PPT criterion in identifying non-separability across a large subset of N-partite noisy Dicke states with even N and excitation number k = N / 2 Additionally, for systems with N > 30 and k = 1 the separability thresholds derived from both criteria converge within 10(-8), high-lighting their strong agreement in this parameter range. Furthermore, we established a condition based on AR q-conditional entropy for identifying genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in noisy Dicke states and compared its effectiveness to previous methods. Notably, our condition identifies a broader range of GME, particularly when the number of excitations approaches half the number of qubits (i.e., N/2). In con-trast, previous methods perform better when the number of excitations is significantly less than N/2. We believe these results will pave the way for further advancements in entanglement theory and the development of potential quantum-based applications for conditional entropy.

TI Simulation of exceptional-point systems on quantum computers for quantum
   sensing
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB There has been debate around applicability of exceptional points (EPs) for quantum sensing. To resolve this, we first explore how to experimentally implement the non-Hermitian non-diagonalizable Hamiltonians, which exhibit EPs, in quantum computers that run on unitary gates. We propose to use an ancilla-based method in this regard. Next, we show how such Hamiltonians can be used for parameter estimation using quantum computers and analyze its performance in terms of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) at EPs, both without noise and in the presence of noise. It is well known that QFI of a parameter to be estimated is inversely related to the variance of the parameter by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Therefore, the divergence of the QFI at EPs promises sensing advantages. We experimentally demonstrate in a cloud quantum architecture and theoretically show, using Puiseux series, that the QFI indeed diverges in such EP systems that were earlier considered to be non-divergent.

TI Optimization of distribution networks using quantum annealing for loss
   reduction and voltage improvement in electrical vehicle parking
   management
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB This paper explores the integration of Electric Vehicle (EV) parking lots into power distribution networks (DNs) and proposes a quantum-based optimization framework to enhance grid performance. As EV and renewable energy source (RES) penetration increases, coordinated EV charging and discharging becomes critical for reducing power losses, improving voltage profiles, and supporting energy storage management. Traditional optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) often struggle with the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of EV-grid interaction problems. In contrast, Quantum Annealing (QA) leverages quantum tunneling and parallelism to efficiently explore complex solution spaces. The proposed approach formulates the EV parking scheduling task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for quantum processing. Simulation studies on IEEE 13-, 33-, and 69-bus systems show that QA significantly outperforms GA and PSO. Notably, in the 13-bus network, QA reduced power losses by 72.07 % and voltage deviation by 87.5 %; corresponding reductions in 33-and 69-bus systems were 42.1 % and 46.6 %, respectively. The results demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness in handling real-time EV integration while reducing operational costs and supporting voltage stability. From a societal perspective, the framework facilitates cleaner energy usage and more intelligent urban EV infrastructure planning. However, limitations include the reliance on quantum simulators (rather than physical hardware) and the assumption of deterministic EV behavior. Future research will investigate hybrid quantum-classical implementations and stochastic modeling using real-world data. Overall, this study presents a robust and scalable optimization strategy for building more efficient, resilient, and sustainable smart distribution systems.

TI Robust and localised control of a 10-spin qubit array in germanium
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for electric, fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the strong g-tensor anisotropy of holes in germanium and their sensitivity to the operational and environmental conditions challenge the operation of large qubit arrays. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array with single-qubit gate fidelities above 99%, and obtain surprisingly uniform qubit properties. By tuning the hole occupation, we demonstrate control over the spin susceptibility, enabling fast plunger gate driving with Rabi frequencies consistently above 1.45 MHz/ (mV & sdot; T). Moreover, we probe the locality of electric dipole spin resonance and find that the configuration with three-hole occupancy driven by the associated quantum dot plunger gate reduces crosstalk, lowering it by an average factor of 2.5 to nearest neighbours, compared to single-hole plunger driving. Theoretical modelling points towards the pronounced anisotropy of p-like orbitals as the main mechanism with significant contributions through Coulomb interactions, giving directions for reproducible control of large qubit arrays.

TI A quantum-enhanced support vector machine for galaxy classification
SO RAS TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTS
AB Galaxy morphology, a key tracer of the evolution of a galaxy's physical structure, has motivated extensive research on machine learning techniques for efficient and accurate galaxy classification. The emergence of quantum computers has generated optimism about the potential for significantly improving the accuracy of such classifications by leveraging the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space. This paper presents a quantum-enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for classifying galaxies based on their morphology. The algorithm requires the computation of a kernel matrix, a task that is performed on a simulated quantum computer using a quantum circuit conjectured to be intractable on classical computers. The result shows similar performance between classical and quantum-enhanced SVM algorithms. For a training size of 40k, the receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating ellipticals and spirals has an under-curve area of 0.946 +/- 0.005 for both classical and quantum-enhanced algorithms. Additionally, we demonstrate for a small data set that the performance of a noise-mitigated quantum SVM algorithm on a quantum device is in agreement with simulation. Finally, a necessary condition for achieving a potential quantum advantage is presented. This investigation is among the very first applications of quantum machine learning in astronomy and highlights their potential for further application in this field.

TI Fermionic systems for quantum information people
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The operator algebra of fermionic modes is isomorphic to that of qubits, the difference between them is twofold: the embedding of subalgebras corresponding to mode subsets and multiqubit subsystems on the one hand, and the parity superselection in the fermionic case on the other. We discuss these two fundamental differences extensively, and illustrate these through the Jordan-Wigner representation in a coherent, self-contained, pedagogical way, from the point of view of quantum information theory. Our perspective leads us to develop useful new tools for the treatment of fermionic systems, such as the fermionic (quasi-)tensor product, fermionic canonical embedding, fermionic partial trace, fermionic products of maps and fermionic embeddings of maps. We formulate these by direct, easily applicable formulas, without mode permutations, for arbitrary partitionings of the modes. It is also shown that fermionic reduced states can be calculated by the fermionic partial trace, containing the proper phase factors. We also consider variants of the notions of fermionic mode correlation and entanglement, which can be endowed with the usual, local operation based motivation, if the parity superselection rule is imposed. We also elucidate some other fundamental points, related to joint map extensions, which make the parity superselection inevitable in the description of fermionic systems.

TI Hacking coherent-one-way quantum key distribution with present-day
   technology
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent results have shown that the secret-key rate of coherent-one-way (COW) quantum key distribution (QKD) scales quadratically with the system's transmittance, thus rendering this protocol unsuitable for long-distance transmission. This was proven by using a so-called zero-error attack, which relies on an unambiguous state discrimination (USD) measurement. This type of attack allows the eavesdropper to learn the whole secret key without introducing any error. Here, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of zero-error attacks against COW QKD with present-day technology. For this, we introduce two practical USD receivers that can be realized with linear passive optical elements, phase-space displacement operations and threshold single-photon detectors. The first receiver is optimal with respect to its success probability, while the second one can impose stronger restrictions on the protocol's performance with faulty eavesdropping equipment. Our findings suggest that zero-error attacks could break the security of COW QKD even assuming realistic experimental conditions.

TI Quantum computational study of chloride attack on chloromethane for
   chemical accuracy and quantum noise effects with UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD
   ansatzes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing is expected to play an important role in solving the problem of huge computational costs in various applications by utilizing the collective properties of quantum states, including superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform computations. Quantum mechanical (QM) methods are candidates for various applications and can provide accurate absolute energy calculations in structure-based methods. QM methods are powerful tools for describing reaction pathways and their potential energy surfaces (PES). In this study, we applied quantum computing to describe the PES of the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S(N)2) reaction between chloromethane and chloride ions. We performed noiseless and noise simulations using quantum algorithms and compared the accuracy and noise effects of the ansatzes. In noiseless simulations, the results from UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD are similar to those of full configurational interaction (FCI) with the same active space, which indicates that quantum algorithms can describe the PES of the S(N)2 reaction. In noise simulations, UCCSD is more susceptible to quantum noise than k-UpCCGSD. Therefore, k-UpCCGSD can serve as an alternative to UCCSD to reduce quantum noisy effects in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and k-UpCCGSD is sufficient to describe the PES of the S(N)2 reaction in this work. The results showed the applicability of quantum computing to the S(N)2 reaction pathway and provided valuable information for structure-based molecular simulations with quantum computing.

TI Experimentally determining the incompatibility of two qubit measurements
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We describe and realize an experimental procedure for assessing the incompatibility of two qubit measurements. The experiment consists in a state discrimination task where either measurement is used according to some partial intermediate information. The success statistics of the task provides an upper bound for the amount of incompatibility of the two measurements, as it is quantified by means of their incompatibility robustness. For a broad class of unbiased and possibly noisy qubit measurements, one can make this upper bound coincide with the true value of the robustness by suitably tuning the preparation of the experiment. We demonstrate this fact in an optical setup, where the qubit states are encoded into the photons' polarization degrees of freedom, and incompatibility is directly accessed by virtue of a refined control on the amplitude, phase and purity of the final projection stage of the measurements. Our work thus establishes the practical feasibility of a recently proposed method for the detection of quantum incompatibility.

TI Optical Transparency Induced by a Largely Purcell Enhanced Quantum Dot
   in a Polarization-Degenerate Cavity
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optically active spill systems coupled to photonic cavities with high cooperativity can generate strong light-matter interactions, a key ingredient in quantum networks. However, obtaining high cooperativities for quantum information processing often involves the use of photonic crystal cavities that feature a poor optical access from the free space, especially to circularly polarized light required for the coherent control of the spin. Here, we demonstrate coupling with a cooperativity as high as 8 of an InAs/GaAs quantum dot to a fabricated bullseye cavity that provides nearly degenerate and Gaussian polarization modes for efficient optical accessing. We observe spontaneous emission lifetimes of the quantum dot as short as 80 ps (an similar to 15 Purcell enhancement) and a similar to 80% transparency of light reflected from the cavity. Leveraging the induced transparency for photon switching while coherently controlling the quantum dot spin could contribute to ongoing efforts of establishing quantum networks.

TI Persisting quantum effects in the anisotropic Rabi model at thermal
   equilibrium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum correlations and nonclassical states are at the heart of emerging quantum technologies. Efforts to produce long-lived states of such quantum resources are a subject of tireless pursuit. Among several platforms useful for quantum technology, the mature quantum system of light-matter interactions offers unprecedented advantages due to current on-chip nanofabrication, efficient quantum control of its constituents, and its wide range of operational regimes. Recently, a continuous transition between the Jaynes-Cummings model and the Rabi model has been proposed by exploiting anisotropies in their light-matter interactions, known as the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. In this paper, we study the long-lived quantum correlations and nonclassical states generated in the anisotropic Rabi model and how these indeed persist even at thermal equilibrium. To achieve this, we thoroughly analyze several quantumness quantifiers, where the long-lived quantum state is obtained from a dressed master equation that is valid for all coupling regimes and with the steady state ensured to be the canonical Gibbs state. Furthermore, we demonstrate a stark distinction between virtual excitations produced beyond the strong coupling regime and the quantumness quantifiers once the light-matter interaction has been switched off. This raises the key question about the nature of the equilibrium quantum features generated in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model and paves the way for future experimental investigations, without the need for challenging ground-state cooling.

TI Quantum advantage in variational Bayes inference
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Variational Bayes (VB) inference algorithm is used widely to estimate both the parameters and the unobserved hidden variables in generative statistical models. The algorithm-inspired by variational methods used in computational physics-is iterative and can get easily stuck in local minima, even when classical techniques, such as deterministic annealing (DA), are used. We study a VB inference algorithm based on a nontraditional quantum annealing approach-referred to as quantum annealing variational Bayes (QAVB) inference-and show that there is indeed a quantum advantage to QAVB over its classical counterparts. In particular, we show that such better performance is rooted in key quantum mechanics concepts: i) The ground state of the Hamiltonian of a quantum system-defined from the given data-corresponds to an optimal solution for the minimization problem of the variational free energy at very low temperatures; ii) such a ground state can be achieved by a technique paralleling the quantum annealing process; and iii) starting from this ground state, the optimal solution to the VB problem can be achieved by increasing the heat bath temperature to unity, and thereby avoiding local minima introduced by spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in classical physics based VB algorithms. We also show that the update equations of QAVB can be potentially implemented using [log K] qubits and O(K) operations per step, where K is the number of values hidden categorical variables can take. Thus, QAVB can match the time complexity of existing VB algorithms, while delivering higher performance.

TI A improved group quantum key distribution protocol with multi-party
   collaboration
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid advancement of quantum key distribution technology in recent years has spurred significant innovation within the field. Nevertheless, a crucial yet frequently underexplored challenge involves the comprehensive evaluation of security quantum state modulation. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for quantum group key distribution. In the setup phase, preprocessing is introduced to monitor photon intensity and count, thereby ensuring the secure initialization of the protocol. During the measurement phase, signal consistency checks are implemented to verify that the intensity of the signal received by the measurement device corresponds precisely to the transmitted signal. In the key generation phase, error correction is employed to mitigate errors induced by noise or external interference, effectively reducing the error margin and restricting the information available to potential eavesdroppers. This systematic, multi-phase approach significantly enhances the framework's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol not only substantially reduces the error rate under adversarial eavesdropping but also improves the efficiency and security of the key distribution process.

TI Quantum Annealing Optimization Method for the Design of Barrier
   Materials in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In the field of spintronics, there is a strong demand for barrier materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) having high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and low resistance area product (RA). However, the design of such barrier materials with atomically controlled composition, vacancies, and disordering of the constituent elements is still challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of potential candidates. Very recently, a quantum annealing (QA) method has been utilized for combinatorial optimization problems in materials science. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-concept study by applying the QA approach combining with first-principles calculations and a machine-learning factorization machine (FM) to MTJs with inverse-type spinel MgGa2O4 tunnel barrier. We treat 252 combinations of Mg2+ and Ga3+ cation disordering in the barrier layer of the MTJs and discuss the effect of the cation disordering on the structural stability, TMR, and RA. Our method is superior to simulated annealing, Bayesian optimization, and random sampling in searching for the best MTJs for low total energy and high TMR, but not so for low RA. We also revealed physical origins of high TMR and low RA behind the cation disordering. The present work highlights the applicability and advantage of materials informatics using FM + QA with first-principles calculations in designing spintronic MTJ devices.

TI Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon
   Detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counterintuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zerophoton detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.

TI Alternative fast quantum logic gates using nonadiabatic
   Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A conventional realization of quantum logic gates and control is based on resonant Rabi oscillations of the occupation probability of the system. This approach has certain limitations and complications, like counter-rotating terms. We study an alternative paradigm for implementing quantum logic gates based on Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry with nonresonant driving and the alternation of adiabatic evolution and nonadiabatic transitions. Compared to Rabi oscillations, the main differences are a nonresonant driving frequency and a small number of periods in the external driving. We explore the dynamics of a multilevel quantum system under LZSM drives and optimize the parameters for increasing the gate speed. We define the parameters of the external driving required for implementing a specific quantum logic gate using the adiabatic-impulse model. In particular, we demonstrate the implementations of single-qubit X, Y, Hadamard gates, and two-qubit iSWAP and CNOT gates using the LZSM transitions. The considered LZSM approach for implementing arbitrary quantum logic gates can be applied to a large variety of multilevel quantum systems and external driving.

TI Multiparty Quantum Private Comparison Using Rotation Operations
SO AXIOMS
AB This paper presents a multiparty quantum private comparison (MQPC) protocol that facilitates multiple users to compare the equality of their private inputs while preserving the confidentiality of each input through the principles of quantum mechanics. In our approach, users initially convert their secret integers into binary representations, which are then encoded into single photons that act as carriers of the information. These encoded single-photon states undergo encryption via rotational operations, effectively obscuring the original inputs before transmission to a semi-honest third party (TP). The TP decrypts the quantum states and conducts Z-basis measurements to derive the comparison results. To enhance security, the protocol incorporates decoy photons, enabling participants to detect potential eavesdropping on the quantum channel. Importantly, even if the TP or other participants attempt to glean insights into each other's inputs, the encryption via rotational operations ensures that private information remains inaccessible. This protocol demonstrates significant advancements in practicality compared to existing MQPC frameworks that rely on complex quantum technologies, such as entanglement swapping and multi-particle entanglement. By leveraging the simplicity of single photons, rotation operations, and Z-basis measurements, our protocol is more accessible for implementation.

TI Exact multiple complex mobility edges and quantum state engineering in
   coupled one-dimensional quasicrystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The key concept of mobility edge, which marks the critical transition between extended and localized states in the energy domain, has attracted significant interest in the cutting-edge frontiers of modern physics due to its profound implications for understanding localization and transport properties in disordered systems. However, a generic way to construct multiple mobility edges (MME) is still ambiguous and lacking. In this work, we propose a brief scheme to engineer both real and complex exact multiple mobility edges exploiting a few coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains. We study the extended-localized transitions of coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains along the chain direction. The model combines both the well-established quasiperiodicity and a kind of freshly introduced staggered nonreciprocity, which are aligned in two mutually perpendicular directions, within a unified framework. Based on analytical analysis, we predict that when the couplings between quasiperiodic chains are weak, the system will be in a mixed phase in which the localized states and extended states coexist and intertwine, thus lacking explicit energy separations. However, as the interchain couplings increase to a certain strength, exact multiple mobility edges emerge. This prediction is clearly verified by concrete numerical calculations of the fractal dimension FD and the scaling index beta. Moreover, we show that the combination of quasiperiodicity and the staggered nonreciprocity can be utilized to design and realize quantum states of various configurations. Our results reveal a brief and general scheme to implement exact multiple mobility edges for synthetic materials engineering.

TI A quantum model for constrained Markowitz modern portfolio using slack
   variables to process mixed-binary optimization under QAOA
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Effectively encoding inequality constraints is a primary obstacle in applying quantum algorithms to financial optimization. A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.

TI Transmittance-invariant phase modulator for chip-based quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In chip-based quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, the non-ideal quantum state preparation due to the imperfect electro-optic phase modulators (EOPM) decreases the secret key rate and introduces potential vulnerabilities. We propose and implement an on-chip transmittanceinvariant phase modulator (TIPM) to solve this problem. Simulated and experimental results show that TIPM can eliminate the correlation between phase, intensity, and polarization of quantum states caused by phase-dependent loss. The design can tolerate a significant fabrication mismatch and is universal to multi-material platforms. Furthermore, TIPM increases the modulation depth achievable by EOPMs in standard process design kit (PDK). The proposal of TIPM can improve the practical security and performance of the chip-based QKD systems.

AB This paper presents Giallar, a fully-automated verification toolkit for quantum compilers. Giallar requires no manual specifications, invariants, or proofs, and can automatically verify that a compiler pass preserves the semantics of quantum circuits. To deal with unbounded loops in quantum compilers, Giallar abstracts three loop templates, whose loop invariants can be automatically inferred. To efficiently check the equivalence of arbitrary input and output circuits that have complicated matrix semantics representation, Giallar introduces a symbolic representation for quantum circuits and a set of rewrite rules for showing the equivalence of symbolic quantum circuits. With Giallar, we implemented and verified 44 (out of 56) compiler passes in 13 versions of the Qiskit compiler, the open-source quantum compiler standard, during which three bugs were detected in and confirmed by Qiskit. Our evaluation shows that most of Qiskit compiler passes can be automatically verified in seconds and verification imposes only a modest overhead to compilation performance.

TI Application of RFSoC-based arbitrary waveform generator for coherent
   control of atomic qubits
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study evaluates an AMD Zynq Ultrascale+ RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) as an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) for controlling atomic qubits coherently. We explore the advantages of using an RFSoC-based AWG for atomic qubit manipulation and experimentally demonstrate its utility in quantum computing. Our findings demonstrate that RFSoC is a scalable solution for developing large-scale quantum computers with atomic qubits, offering a promising approach for applications.

TI Multipartitioning topological phases by vertex states and quantum
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We discuss multipartitions of the gapped ground states of (2+1)-dimensional topological liquids into three (or more) spatial regions that are adjacent to each other and meet at points. By considering the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing over a subset of the regions, we compute various correlation measures, such as entanglement negativity, reflected entropy, and associated spectra. We utilize the bulk-boundary correspondence to show that such multipartitions can be achieved by using what we call vertex states in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory: these are a type of state used to define an interaction vertex in string field theory and can be thought of as a proper generalization of conformal boundary states. This approach allows an explicit construction of the reduced density matrix near the entangling boundaries. We find the fingerprints of topological liquid in these quantities, such as (universal pieces in) the scaling of the entanglement negativity, and a nontrivial distribution of the spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix. For reflected entropy, we test the recent claim that states the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information is given, once short-range correlations are properly removed, by (c/3) ln 2 where c is the central charge of the topological liquid that measures ungappable edge degrees of freedom. As specific examples, we consider topological chiral p-wave superconductors and Chern insulators. We also study a specific lattice-fermion model realizing Chern insulator phases and calculate the correlation measures numerically, both in its gapped phases and at critical points separating them.

TI Noise-Based Damping of Chaotic Entanglement in Pulsed Driven Two-Qubit
   System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This paper investigates the entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit system in the presence of n-sequential sin 2-pulse shape. The study explores entanglement under two scenarios: when the system is completely isolated from the environment and when it interacts with one of the surrounding environments, namely the thermal environment and the common dephasing environment. The authors quantify entanglement through concurrence while systematically examining the effects of initial state preparation, qubit coupling strength, laser-qubit interaction intensity, pulse sequences, and decohering environments. The results highlight that the entanglement of the two-qubit system strongly depends on the initial state. Increasing the coupling strength between the qubits and the n-sequential pulse enhances the maximum values of entanglement. Conversely, augmenting the laser-qubits coupling or introducing the influence of the environment diminishes the entanglement.

TI Device-independent certification of desirable properties with a
   confidence interval
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB In the development of quantum technologies, a reliable means for characterizing quantum devices, be it a measurement device, a state-preparation device, or a transformation device, is crucial. However, the conventional approach based on, for example, quantum state tomography or process tomography relies on assumptions that are often not necessarily justifiable in a realistic experimental setting. Although the device-independent (DI) approach to this problem bypasses the shortcomings above by making only minimal, justifiable assumptions, most of the theoretical proposals to date only work in the idealized setting where independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trials are assumed. Here, we provide a versatile solution for rigorous device-independent certification that does not rely on the i.i.d. assumption. Specifically, we describe how the prediction-based ratio (PBR) protocol and martingale-based protocol developed for hypothesis testing can be applied in the present context to achieve a device-independent certification of desirable properties with confidence interval (CI). To illustrate the versatility of these methods, we demonstrate how we can use them to certify-with finite data-the underlying negativity, Hilbert space dimension, entanglement depth, and fidelity to some target pure state. In particular, we provide examples showing how the amount of certifiable negativity and fidelity scales with the number of trials and how many experimental trials one needs to certify a qutrit state space or the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement. Overall, we have found that the PBR protocol and the martingale-based protocol often offer similar performance, even though the latter does have to presuppose any witness (Bell-like inequality). In contrast, our findings also show that the performance of the martingale-based protocol may be severely affected by one's choice of Bell-like inequality. Intriguingly, a Bell function useful for self-testing does not necessarily give the optimal confidence-gain rate for certifying the fidelity to the corresponding target state.

TI Retrieval of single photons from solid-state quantum transducers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum networks using photonic channels require control of the interactions between the photons, carrying the information, and the elements comprising the nodes. In this work we analyze theoretically the spectral properties of an optical photon emitted by a solid-state quantum memory, which acts as a converter of a photon absorbed in another frequency range. We determine explicitly the expression connecting the stored and retrieved excitation taking into account possible mode and phase mismatch of the experimental setup. The expression we obtain describes the output field as a function of the input field for a transducer working over a wide range of frequencies, from optical-to-optical frequencies to microwave-to-optical frequencies. We apply this result to analyze the photon spectrum and the retrieval probability as a function of the optical depth for microwave-to-optical transduction. In the absence of losses, the efficiency of the solid-state quantum transducer is intrinsically determined by the capability of designing the retrieval process as the time reversal of the storage dynamics.

TI On-demand multimode optical storage in a laser-written on-chip waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memory is a fundamental building block for large-scale quantum networks. On-demand optical storage with a large bandwidth, a high multimode capacity, and an integrated structure simultaneously is crucial for practical application. However, this has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we fabricate an on-chip waveguide in a Eu-151(3+) : Y2SiO5 crystal with insertion losses of 0.2 dB, and propose a pumping scheme to enable spin-wave atomic frequency comb (AFC) storage with a bandwidth of 11 MHz inside the waveguide. Based on this, we demonstrate the storage of 200 temporal modes using the AFC scheme and conditional on-demand storage of 100 temporal modes using the spin-wave AFC scheme. The interference visibility between the readout light field and the reference light field is 99.0% +/- 0.6% and 97% +/- 3% for AFC and spin-wave AFC storage, respectively, indicating the coherent nature of this low-loss, multimode, and integrated storage device.

TI A Review of the Current State-of-the-Art of Quantum Computing for CFD:
   Approaches, Advantages, and Limitations
SO AEROTECNICA MISSILI E SPAZIO
AB This article is meant to review of current state-of-the-art of quantum computing applied to computational fluid dynamics and discuss possible applications of Quantum computing technologies in the area of thermofluid-dynamics. Quantum computers are devices that use quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition, entanglement and interference to perform calculations, with a theoretical high speed-up compared with traditional computing solutions, especially for computer science applications but also for engineering applications, like structural optimization, resolution of linear system and analysis of complex dynamics. Beside the consideration about the hardware implementation of these type of devices, this article propose a simplified taxonomy of the technologies that can be currently envisioned for the resolution of thermofluid dynamics problems, identifying the three main approaches, i.e., the traditional algorithmic or circuital approach (with the use of serval algorithms dedicated to the resolution of partial differential equations as well as algorithms dedicated to optimization and search), the analog approach (with the development of direct simulations given the analogy between quantum mechanical systems, like the Schr & ouml;dinger flow or the Dirac Majorana formulation, and fluid problems, like the inviscid flow or the Lattice Boltzmann model), and the applications based on machine learning techniques. The article discusses practical examples which highlight the flexibility of the methods as well as their intrinsic limitations that hinder the application to many industrial problems, i.e. the simplifications requires to manage physical non-linearities, or the absence of a general purpose algorithm, indicating, beside the intrinsic properties of each method, the technology readiness level (TRL) of this type of approach and the required level of modelling.

TI Momentum exchange method for quantum Boltzmann methods
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB The past years have seen a surge in quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These algorithms have in common that whilst promising a speed-up in the performance of the algorithm, no specific method of measurement has been suggested. This means that while the algorithms presented in the literature maybe promising methods for creating the quantum state that represents the final flow field, an efficient measurement strategy is not available. This paper marks the first quantum method proposed to efficiently calculate quantities of interest (QoIs) from a state vector representing the flow field. In particular, we propose a method to calculate the force acting on an object immersed in the fluid using a quantum version of the momentum exchange method (MEM) that is commonly used in lattice Boltzmann methods to determine the drag and lift coefficients. In order to achieve this we furthermore give a scheme that implements bounce back boundary conditions on a quantum computer, as those are the boundary conditions the momentum exchange method is designed for.

TI Variational quantum simulation of partial differential equations:
   applications in colloidal transport
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT & FLUID FLOW
AB PurposeThis study aims to assess the use of variational quantum imaginary time evolution for solving partial differential equations using real-amplitude ansatze with full circular entangling layers. A graphical mapping technique for encoding impulse functions is also proposed. Design/methodology/approachThe Smoluchowski equation, including the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek potential energy, is solved to simulate colloidal deposition on a planar wall. The performance of different types of entangling layers and over-parameterization is evaluated. FindingsColloidal transport can be modelled adequately with variational quantum simulations. Full circular entangling layers with real-amplitude ansatze lead to higher-fidelity solutions. In most cases, the proposed graphical mapping technique requires only a single bit-flip with a parametric gate. Over-parameterization is necessary to satisfy certain physical boundary conditions, and higher-order time-stepping reduces norm errors. Practical implicationsVariational quantum simulation can solve partial differential equations using near-term quantum devices. The proposed graphical mapping technique could potentially aid quantum simulations for certain applications. Originality/valueThis study shows a concrete application of variational quantum simulation methods in solving practically relevant partial differential equations. It also provides insight into the performance of different types of entangling layers and over-parameterization. The proposed graphical mapping technique could be valuable for quantum simulation implementations. The findings contribute to the growing body of research on using variational quantum simulations for solving partial differential equations.

TI Improved finite-key security analysis of quantum key distribution
   against Trojan-horse attacks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) disregard the effect of information leakage from the users' devices, and, thus, do not protect against Trojan-horse attacks (THAs). In a THA, the eavesdropper injects strong light into the QKD apparatuses, and then analyzes the back-reflected light to learn information about their internal setting choices. Only a few recent works consider this security threat, but predict a rather poor performance of QKD unless the devices are strongly isolated from the channel. Here, we derive finite-key security bounds for decoy-state-based QKD schemes in the presence of THAs, which significantly outperform previous analyses. Our results constitute an important step forward to closing the existing gap between theory and practice in QKD.

TI Quantum information teleportation through biological wires,
   gravitational micro-bio-holes and holographic micro-bio-systems: A
   hypothesis
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS REPORTS
AB Biological systems like cells, bacteria, chloroplasts and other micro-organisms could exchange quantum particles like electrons, photons and gravitational waves and have large distant information teleportation. This is because that their DNAs and membranes are formed from quantum particles like electrons and protons and by their motions, some currents and waves are emerged. These waves have the main role in information teleportation. There are different methods which could be used for quantum information teleportation in biological system. Some of these mechanisms are: 1. Microbes, micro-bubbles and some other biological molecules like to form some biological lines specially near the cellular gates. Also, some biological lines may be formed between two cells. These biological lines could play the role of wires which transmit information from a place to another one. For example, some signatures of this quantum information teleportation could be seen in biological lines which are emerged near the plant cell walls or gates or close to chloroplasts. Chloroplasts shoot some spinors which maybe confined within the micro-bubbles or absorb by microbes. These bubbles and microbes may join to each other and form some biological lines which may be strengthen from a plant cell to another. These biological lines could be seen near the plant cell walls or on a metal which connects two parts of a leaf. 2. Some another signatures of "quantum photon exchange or quantum information teleportation" could be seen between microbes under the objective lenses and macro-objects on the eye lenses of a light microscope. It seems that as microscope make big images from microbes for us, produce small pictures of macro-objects for microbes such as they could diagnose them and interact with them. This property could be used in controlling microbes. 3. Another way for controlling microbes is using of virtual shapes which are induced by a special light source. For example, using a multi-gonal lamp, one can induce multi-gonal shape within the micro-bubbles. Also, this special lamp could force microbes and micro-bubbles to build multi-gonal colonies on a metal-glass slide. Maybe, by using this property, one can build a light source with the shape of anti-microbial matter and induce anti-microbial property within micro-bubbles. 4. Another main way for quantum teleportation is using of gravitational holes which may be emerged by increasing concentration of microbes and heavy cells in some points. These holes absorb microbes and micro-bubbles and conduct them to the heavy cells. Usually, there are some white holes near these dark holes which as a proposal, one can assume that these white holes are another end of gravitational holes and emit photons which are entered from dark end. 5. And finally, a very main mechanism for quantum information teleportation with microbes and controlling them is using of a holography and inducing virtual microbes and biological molecules in biological systems. For example, by a combinations of two lights with different colors under a light microscope in a dark room, one may induce some non-virtual microbes in biological systems such as each microbe interacts with a virtual microbe. This is because that light waves take photos of microbes, collide with lenses of microscopes and return to the slide and form virtual microbes or biological molecules. This technique could be used in curing diseases.
   Although, results of our experiments show the correctness of these mechanisms and theories, however, for the moment, we propose them only as a proposal and hypothesis and hope that other scientists do similar experiments. Also, some of our experiments may be at preliminary stages; however they could be used as a hypothesis, proposal and guidance.

TI Optical preamplifier based simultaneous quantum key distribution and
   classical communication scheme
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB That the simultaneous quantum key distribution and classical communication (SQCC) scheme are combined with the continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) and the classical communication together, will provide an effective method to implement the simultaneous CVQKD and the classical communication in the existing optical networks in the future. However, superimposing a classical signal on the quantum signal will introduce excess noise into the CVQKD system, thus greatly reducing the performance of the system. In this paper, a novel scheme of SQCC based on optical preamplifier (OPA) is proposed, that is, the OPA is inserted into the receiver to improve the performance of the system. On the one hand, under the condition of the same bit error rate, the amplification of the signal by the OPA can reduce the requirement for the modulation amplitude of the classical signal at the sending end, thereby reducing the noise effect of the classical signal on the quantum signal. On the other hand, the OPA can compensate for the imperfection of the receiver detector. Moreover, in the case of locally generated local oscillator, the amplifier can also amplify the weak phase reference pulse, and thus reducing the phase excess noise caused by the shot noise of the weak phase reference pulse. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better performance than the original scheme in the sense of security key rate and transmission distance. These results show that this scheme provides an effective and practical method for the further development and practical application of the SQCC scheme.

TI Quantum scrambling via accessible tripartite information
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information scrambling (QIS), from the perspective of quantum information theory, is generally understood as local non-retrievability of information evolved through some dynamical process, and is often quantified via entropic quantities such as the tripartite information. We argue that this approach comes with a number of issues, in large part due to its reliance on quantum mutual informations, which do not faithfully quantify correlations directly retrievable via measurements, and in part due to the specific methodology used to compute tripartite informations of the studied dynamics. We show that these issues can be overcome by using accessible mutual informations, defining corresponding 'accessible tripartite informations', and provide explicit examples of dynamics whose scrambling properties are not properly quantified by the standard tripartite information. Our results lay the groundwork for a more profound understanding of what QIS represents, and reveal a number of promising, as of yet unexplored, venues for further research.

TI Characterizing decoherence rates of a superconducting qubit by direct
   microwave scattering
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We experimentally investigate a superconducting qubit coupled to the end of an open transmission line, in a regime where the qubit decay rates to the transmission line and to its own environment are comparable. We perform measurements of coherent and incoherent scattering, on- and off-resonant fluorescence, and time-resolved dynamics to determine the decay and decoherence rates of the qubit. In particular, these measurements let us discriminate between non-radiative decay and pure dephasing. We combine and contrast results across all methods and find consistent values for the extracted rates. The results show that the pure dephasing rate is one order of magnitude smaller than the non-radiative decay rate for our qubit. Our results indicate a pathway to benchmark decoherence rates of superconducting qubits in a resonator-free setting.

TI Scalable multiparty steering using a single entangled photon-pair
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The distribution and verification of quantum nonlocality across a network of users is essential for future quantum information science and technology applications. However, beyond simple point-to-point protocols, existing methods struggle with increasingly complex state preparation for a growing number of parties. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multiparty detection-loophole-free quantum steering, where one party simultaneously steers multiple spatially separate parties, using a multi-qubit state produced from a set of qubits of which only one pair is entangled. We derive loss-tolerant steering inequalities, enabling our experiment to close the detection loophole, and enabling us to show the scalability of this approach to rigorously verify quantum nonlocality across arbitrarily many parties. This provides practical tools for developing the future quantum internet. C2024 Author(s).

TI Defining quantum games
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this research article, we survey existing quantum physics-related games and, based on this survey, propose a definition for the concept of quantum games. We define a quantum game as any type of rule-based game that either employs the principles of quantum physics or references quantum phenomena or the theory of quantum physics through any of three proposed dimensions: the perceivable dimension of quantum physics, the dimension of quantum technologies, and the dimension of scientific purposes, such as citizen science or education. We also discuss the concept of quantum computer games, which are games on quantum computers, as well as definitions for the concept of science games. Various games explore quantum physics and quantum computing through digital, analogue, and hybrid means, with various incentives driving their development. As interest in games as educational tools for supporting quantum literacy grows, understanding the diverse landscape of quantum games becomes increasingly important. We propose that the three dimensions of quantum games identified in this article be used for designing, analysing, and defining the phenomenon of quantum games.

TI A Lagrangian path integral approach to the qubit
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB A Lagrangian description of the qubit based on Schwinger's picture of Quantum Mechanics that allows for a Feynman-like computation of its probability amplitudes is presented. The Lagrangian is a function on the groupoid that describes the qubit and at the same time determines a self-adjoint element on its associated algebra. Feynman's paths are replaced by histories on the groupoid which form a groupoid again, and a simple method to compute the sum over all histories is discussed. The unitarity of the theory described in this way imposes quantization conditions on the parameters determining the Lagrangian, and some particular instances are solved completely.

TI Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution with Fully Discrete Phase
   Randomization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) can overcome fundamental secret-key-rate bounds on point-to-point QKD links, allowing us to reach longer distances than ever before. Since its introduction, several TFQKD variants have been proposed, and some of them have already been implemented experimentally. Most of them assume that the users can emit weak coherent pulses with a continuous random phase. In practice, this assumption is often not satisfied, which could open up security loopholes in their implementations. To close this loophole, we propose and prove the security of a TFQKD variant that relies exclusively on discrete phase randomization. Remarkably, our results show that it can also provide higher secret-key rates than an equivalent continuous-phase-randomized protocol.

TI Quantum frequency resampling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In signal processing, resampling algorithms can modify the number of resources encoding a collection of data points. Downsampling reduces the cost of storage and communication, while upsampling interpolates new data from limited one, e.g., when resizing a digital image. We present a toolset of quantum algorithms to resample data encoded in the probabilities of a quantum register, using the quantum Fourier transform to adjust the number of high-frequency encoding qubits. We discuss advantage over classical resampling algorithms.

We show for many problems, including Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glasses, that at p = 1, it is as accurate as its classical counterpart, and maintains the infinite-depth optimal performance guarantee of the QAOA. Employing a different rounding scheme, we prove the method shares the performance of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for the maximum cut problem on certain graphs. We pave the way for an overarching quantum relax-and-round framework with performance on par with some of the best classical algorithms.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution with random key basis
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is the art of using untrusted devices to distribute secret keys in an insecure network. It thus represents the ultimate form of cryptography, offering not only information-theoretic security against channel attacks, but also against attacks exploiting implementation loopholes. In recent years, much progress has been made towards realising the first DIQKD experiments, but current proposals are just out of reach of today's loophole-free Bell experiments. Here, we significantly narrow the gap between the theory and practice of DIQKD with a simple variant of the original protocol based on the celebrated Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. By using two randomly chosen key generating bases instead of one, we show that our protocol significantly improves over the original DIQKD protocol, enabling positive keys in the high noise regime for the first time. We also compute the finite-key security of the protocol for general attacks, showing that approximately 10(8)-10(10) measurement rounds are needed to achieve positive rates using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our proposed DIQKD protocol thus represents a highly promising path towards the first realisation of DIQKD in practice. Device-independent quantum key distribution aims at the ultimate quantum-based unconditional security, but current protocols' rates are quite far from anything practical. The authors' protocol narrows this gap by using two randomly chosen key generating bases instead of one.

TI Probabilistic magnetometry with a two-spin system in diamond
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Solid-state magnetometers like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond have been of paramount importance for the development of quantum sensing with nanoscale spatial resolution. The underlying protocol is a Ramsey sequence, that imprints an external static magnetic field into the phase of the quantum sensor, which is subsequently read out. In this theoretical work we propose a sensing scheme that harnesses the hyperfine coupling between the NV center and a nearby nuclear spin to set a post-selection protocol. We show that concentrating valuable sensing information into a single successful measurement yields an improvement in sensitivity over Ramsey in the range of short transverse relaxation times. By considering realistic experimental conditions, we found that the detection of weak magnetic fields in the mu T range can be achieved with a sensitivity of few tens of nTHz(-1/2) at cryogenic temperature (4 K), and mu THz(-1/2) at room temperature.

TI Secure quantum key distribution with a subset of malicious devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The malicious manipulation of quantum key distribution (QKD) hardware is a serious threat to its security, as, typically, neither end users nor QKD manufacturers can validate the integrity of every component of their QKD system in practice. One possible approach to re-establish the security of QKD is to use a redundant number of devices. Following this idea, we address various corruption models of the possibly malicious devices and show that, compared to the most conservative model of active and collaborative corrupted devices, natural assumptions allow to significantly enhance the secret key rate or considerably reduce the necessary resources. Furthermore, we show that, for most practical situations, the resulting finite-size secret key rate is similar to that of the standard scenario assuming trusted devices.

TI Realization of fractonic quantum phases in the breathing pyrochlore
   lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Fractonic phases of matter are novel quantum ground states supporting subdimensional emergent excitations with mobility restrictions. Due to a subextensive ground state degeneracy that is dependent on the geometry of the underlying lattice, fractonic phases are considered as models for quantum memory or quantum glass. While there exist a number of exactly solvable models with interactions between multiple particles/spins, the realization of such models in real materials is extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a realistic quantum model of quadratic spin interactions on the breathing pyrochlore lattice of existing materials. We show that the emergent "cluster charge" excitations arise as vacuum fluctuations residing on the boundary of membrane objects, and move in a subdimensional space. Using the membrane operators, we demonstrate the existence of a subextensive ground state degeneracy explicitly depending on the lattice geometry, which is a useful resource for novel quantum memory.

TI Fibre polarisation state compensation in entanglement-based quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) using polarisation encoding can be hard to implement over deployed telecom fibres because the routing geometry and the birefringence of the fibre link can alter the polarisation states of the propagating photons. These alterations cause a basis mismatch, leading to an increased quantum bit error rate (QBER). In this work we demonstrate a technique for a dynamically compensating fibre-induced state alteration in a QKD system. This compensation scheme includes a feedback loop that minimizes the QBER using a stochastic optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of this technique is implemented and verified in a polarisation entanglement QKD system over a deployed telecom fibre.

TI Qubit-oscillator relationships in the open quantum Rabi model: the role
   of dissipation
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Using a dissipative quantum Rabi model, we study the dynamics of a slow qubit coupled to a fast quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a bosonic bath from weak to strong and ultra-strong coupling regimes. Solving the quantum Heisenberg equations of motion, perturbative in the internal coupling between qubit and oscillator, we derive functional relationships directly linking the qubit coordinates in the Bloch sphere to oscillator observables. We then perform accurate time-dependent Matrix Product State simulations and compare our results both with the analytical solutions of the Heisenberg equations of motion, and with numerical solutions of a Lindblad master equation, perturbative in the external coupling between oscillator and environment. Indeed, we show that, up to the strong coupling regime, the qubit state accurately fulfils the derived functional relationships. We analyse in detail the case of a qubit starting with generic coordinates on the Bloch sphere of which we evaluate the three components of the Bloch vector through the averages of oscillator observables. Interestingly, a weak to intermediate oscillator coupling to the bath is able to simplify the Bloch vector evaluation since qubit-oscillator relationships are more immediate. Moreover, by monitoring the qubit fidelity with respect to free limit, we find the parameter regime where the combined effect of internal and external couplings is able to hinder the reliable evaluation of the qubit Bloch vector. Finally, in the ultra-strong coupling regime, non-Markovian effects become robust and the dynamics of qubit and oscillator are inextricably entangled making the qubit Bloch vector evaluation difficult.

TI SEPSI: A Secure and Efficient Privacy-Preserving Set Intersection with
   Identity Authentication in IoT
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought extensive IoT services to entities. However, most IoT services carry the risk of leaking privacy. Privacy-preserving set intersection in IoT is used for a wide range of basic services, and its privacy protection issues have received widespread attention. The traditional candidate protocols to solve the privacy-preserving set intersection are classical encryption protocols based on computational difficulty. With the emergence of quantum computing, some advanced quantum algorithms may undermine the security and reliability of traditional protocols. Therefore, it is important to design more secure privacy-preserving set intersection protocols. In addition, identity information is also very important compared to data security. To this end, we propose a quantum privacy-preserving set intersection protocol for IoT scenarios, which has higher security and linear communication efficiency. This protocol can protect identity anonymity while protecting private data.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice quantum electrodynamics and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to 2xN plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of LGTs with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.

In this work, we introduce a parallel tomography of QND measurements that addresses single- and two-qubit readout on a multi-qubit quantum processor. We provide an experimental demonstration of the tomographic protocol on a 7-qubit IBM-Q device, characterizing the quality of conventional qubit readout as well as generalized measurements such as parity or measurement-and-reset schemes. Our protocol reconstructs the Choi matrices of the measurement processes, extracts relevant quantifiers-fidelity, QNDness, destructiveness-and identifies sources of errors that limit the performance of the device for repeated QND measurements. We also show how to quantify measurement crosstalk and use it to certify the quality of simultaneous readout on multiple qubits.

This Review surveys materials opportunities to improve the performance of trapped-ion qubits, from understanding the surface science that leads to electric-field noise to developing methods for building ion traps with integrated optics and electronics.
   Trapped-ion quantum information processors store information in atomic ions maintained in position in free space by electric fields. Quantum logic is enacted through manipulation of the ions' internal and shared motional quantum states using optical and microwave signals. Although trapped ions show great promise for quantum-enhanced computation, sensing and communication, materials research is needed to design traps that allow for improved performance by means of integration of system components, including optics and electronics for ion-qubit control, while minimizing the near-ubiquitous electric-field noise produced by trap-electrode surfaces. In this Review, we consider the materials requirements for such integrated systems, with a focus on problems that hinder current progress towards practical quantum computation. We give suggestions for how materials scientists and trapped-ion technologists can work together to develop materials-based integration and noise-mitigation strategies to enable the next generation of trapped-ion quantum computers.

TI Investigation of Noise Properties in the InP HEMT for LNAs in Qubit
   Amplification: Effects From Channel Indium Content
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB The InP high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) is employed in cryogenic low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) for the readout of faint microwave signals in quantum computing. The performance of such LNAs is ultimately limited by the properties of the active In(x)Ga(1-x)A(s )channel in the InP HEMT. In this study, we have investigated the noise performance of 100-nm gate-length InP HEMTs used in cryogenic LNAs for amplification of qubits. The channel indium content in the InP HEMTs was 53, 60 and 70%. Hall measurements of the epitaxial materials and dc characterization of the InP HEMTs confirmed the superior transport properties of the channel structures. An indirect method involving an LNA and small-signal noise modeling was used for extracting the channel noise with high accuracy. Under noise-optimized bias, we observed that the 60% indium channel InP HEMT exhibited the lowest drain noise temperature. The difference in LNA noise temperature among InP HEMTs became more pronounced with decreasing drain voltage and current. An average noise temperature and average gain of 3.3 K and 21 dB, respectively, for a 4-8 GHz three-stage hybrid cryogenic LNA using 60% indium channel InP HEMTs was measured at a dc power consumption of 108 mu W . To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a new state-of-the-art for a C-band LNA operating below 1 mW. The higher drain noise temperature observed for 53 and 70% indium channels InP HEMTs can be attributed to a combination of thermal noise in the channel and real-space transfer of electrons from the channel to the barrier. This report gives experimental evidence of an optimum channel indium content in the InP HEMT used in LNAs for qubit amplification.

Through modulating the motion of a nano-cantilever with voltages, optomechanical coupling and spin-mechanical coupling can be exponentially enhanced simultaneously. Numerical simulations show that by applying well-designed voltages high-fidelity quantum interface operations such as generation and absorption of a single photon with a known wave packet are within the reach of current techniques.

TI Quantum entanglement between neutrino eigenstates in the presence of the
   subsequent phase shift of the neutrino oscillations
SO EPL
AB - In this letter, using von Neumann entropy we examine the entanglement entropy for the neutrino oscillations in the presence of the subsequent phase shift. We numerically show that the entanglement entropy for the subsequent periods of the two-flavor neutrino oscillations increases asymmetrically with time depending on the space-time deformation. We also explored the obtained results for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations to show that this result is also valid for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These results, obtained for the first time in this letter, are quite different from the computing for the standard neutrino oscillation theory. We concluded that these interesting results play an important role in the cosmology.

TI Air-to-air quantum key distribution with boundary layer effects
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Airborne platforms offer a potential solution to overcome the challenges of quantum key distribution (QKD) over long distances and in free space. However, the presence of boundary layer around high-speed flying vehicles can introduce unpredictable shifts and disturbances to transmitted photons, affecting their mode. In this article, we propose a performance evaluation scheme for air-to-air QKD with boundary layer effects. Our analysis compares the effects of the boundary layer at the receiver and at the transmitter on QKD performance, as well as an evaluation of two possible air-to-air QKD models. The results indicate that in the co-directional flight model, a particular azimuth can significantly increase the QBER when both ends are affected by the boundary layer, and photon deflection angles are larger when the transmitter is at a relatively low altitude. In the counter-directional flight model, the boundary layer around the aircraft may result in a maximum reduction in secure key rate by approximately 79.6% and introduce average channel loss of around 3.45 dB for transmitted photons. These findings highlight the importance of considering the boundary layer effects in air-to-air QKD and provide insights for the design and optimization of QKD systems in practical scenarios.

TI Scalable noisy quantum circuits for biased-noise qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this work, we consider biased-noise qubits affected only by bit-flip errors, which is motivated by existing systems of stabilized cat qubits. This property allows us to design a class of noisy Hadamard tests involving entangling and certain non-Clifford gates, which can be conducted reliably with only a polynomial overhead in algorithm repetitions. On the flip side, we also found classical algorithms able to efficiently simulate both the noisy and noiseless versions of our specific variants of the Hadamard test. We propose to use these algorithms as a benchmark of the biasness of the noise at the scale of large circuits. The bias being checked on a full computational task makes our benchmark sensitive to crosstalk or time-correlated errors, which are usually invisible from individual gate tomography. For realistic noise models, phase-flip will not be negligible, but in the Pauli-Twirling approximation, we show that our benchmark could check the correctness of circuits containing up to 106 gates, several orders of magnitude larger than circuits not exploiting a noise-bias. Our benchmark is applicable for an arbitrary noise-bias, beyond Pauli models.

TI Experimental continuous-variable quantum key distribution using a
   thermal source
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Gaussian-modulated coherent-state (GMCS) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol can allow authenticated users to share secret key with unconditional security. So far, all previous experimental implementations of GMCS CVQKD schemes are based on active modulations, i.e. amplitude and phase modulators and quantum random number generator (QRNG) are required. However, high-speed modulation with high extinction ratio and stability is challenging, which is extremely remarkable in chip-scale silicon photonic realization. While the passive-state-preparation (PSP) CVQKD scheme, which explores the intrinsic field fluctuations of a thermal source, avoids the uses of active modulations and QRNG. In this paper, we experimentally realize the intact PSP CVQKD through a realistic optical fiber channel using off-the-shelf amplified spontaneous emission source. In particular, specially designed frame synchronization method is used to build the correlation between the data measured from the two legitimate parties, and excess noise are synthetically controlled to generate secure secret keys at the metro-area distances when considering the practical and non-negligible finite-size effects under collective Gaussian attacks. Due to the avoidance of modulators and QRNG, the passive state encoding scheme provides a promising direction of applicable high-speed, chip-based and even sunlight-based CVQKD with less cost and complexity.

TI Decomposable Pauli diagonal maps and tensor squares of qubit maps
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB It is a well-known result due to Stormer [Acta Math. 110, 233-278 (1963)] that every positive qubit map is decomposable into a sum of a completely positive map and a completely copositive map. Here, we generalize this result to tensor squares of qubit maps. Specifically, we show that any positive tensor product of a qubit map with itself is decomposable. This solves a recent conjecture by Filippov and Magadov [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50(5), 055301 (2017)]. We contrast this result with examples of non-decomposable positive maps arising as the tensor product of two distinct qubit maps or as the tensor square of a decomposable map from a qubit to a ququart. To show our main result, we reduce the problem to Pauli diagonal maps. We then characterize the cone of decomposable ququart Pauli diagonal maps by determining all 252 extremal rays of ququart Pauli diagonal maps that are both completely positive and completely copositive. These extremal rays split into three disjoint orbits under a natural symmetry group, and two of these orbits contain only entanglement breaking maps. Finally, we develop a general combinatorial method to determine the extremal rays of Pauli diagonal maps that are both completely positive and completely copositive between multi-qubit systems using the ordered spectra of their Choi matrices. Classifying these extremal rays beyond ququarts is left as an open problem.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Quasiparton distributions in massive QED2: Toward quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We analyze the quasiparton distributions of the lightest eta' ' meson in massive two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by exact diagonalization. The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous eta' ' state at strong coupling, and a nonanomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted eta' ' state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasiparton distribution function and amplitude for the eta' ' state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.

TI Procedure for reducing cross-resonance gate errors using pulse-level
   control
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Current implementations of superconducting qubits are often limited by the low fidelities of multi-qubit gates. We present a reproducible and runtime-efficient pulse-level approach for calibrating an improved cross-resonance gate CR(theta) for arbitrary theta . This CR(theta) gate can be used to produce a wide range of other two-qubit gates via the application of standard single-qubit gates. By performing an interleaved randomised benchmarking sequence, we demonstrate that our approach leads to significantly lower incoherent errors than the circuit-level approach currently used by IBM. Hence, our procedure provides a genuine improvement for applications where noise remains a limiting factor.

TI Quantum key distribution over FSO channel using error reconciliation
   protocol
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has evolved as a robust way of secret key distribution based on renowned modern physics concepts. To transmit sensitive information in the government, private, and personal sectors, high-security levels are now necessary. All conventional cryptographic algorithms applied in the communication models, which rely on mathematical models and conceptual assumptions, are unsecure. Thus, QKD systems are the best choice for protecting this information as a countermeasure since they provide unconditional security. In this paper, a design is proposed for the FSO channel using the CASCADE protocol under different atmospheric condition such as haze, rain and snow. The suggested framework's effectiveness and security in the context of QKD with two non-orthogonal photon states are assessed. Simulation results of this model show the percentage of original sequence recovery; the number of errors removed, optical spectrum at transmitter and receiver for a base frame length of 10(4) bits. Moreover, Error correction is calculated per iteration to improve signal quality at the receiver side and compared to previous work. The calculated value in this article shows a better result. Hence, both the sender and the receiver could achieve a security key using this method.

TI Moiré cavity quantum electrodynamics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing single-photon emission by engineering their photonic environment is essential for improving overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir & eacute; pattern, we propose a multilayer moir & eacute; photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir & eacute; cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter's position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moir & eacute; cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot's radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moir & eacute; flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet.

TI Compatibility of Binary Qubit Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Deciding which sets of quantum measurements allow a simultaneous readout is a central problem in quantum measurement theory. The problem is relevant not only from the foundational perspective, but also has direct applications in quantum correlation problems fueled by incompatible measurements. Although central, only a few analytical criteria exist for deciding the incompatibility of general sets of measurements. This Letter approaches the problem through functions defined on the Boolean hypercube and their Fourier transformations. We show that this reformulation of the problem leads to a complete geometric characterization of joint measurability of any finite set of unbiased binary qubit measurements and gives a necessary condition for the biased case. We discuss our results in the realm of quantum steering, where they translate into a family of steering inequalities. When certain unbiasedness conditions are fulfilled, these criteria are tight, hence fully characterizing the steering problem when the trusted party holds a qubit, and the untrusted party performs any finite number of binary measurements. We further discuss how our results point towards a second-order cone programming approach to measurement incompatibility and compare this to the predominantly used semi-definite programming-based techniques. We use our approach to falsify an existing conjecture on measurement incompatibility of special sets of measurements.

TI Quantum Correlations Cannot Be Reproduced with a Finite Number of
   Measurements in Any No-Signaling Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show, for any finite n >= 2, that there exist quantum correlations obtained from performing n dichotomic quantum measurements in a bipartite Bell scenario, which cannot be reproduced by mixtures of measurement devices with at most (n - 1) incompatible measurements across different partitions in any no-signaling theory. That is, it requires for any no-signaling theory an unbounded number of measurements to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory. We prove our results by showing that there exist linear Bell inequalities that have to be obeyed by any no-signaling theory involving only (n - 1)-wise incompatible measurements and show explicitly how these can be violated in quantum theory. Finally, we discuss the relation of our work to previous works ruling out alternatives to quantum theory with some kind of bounded degree of freedom and consider the experimental verifiability of our results.

TI Deep Bayesian experimental design for quantum many-body systems
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bayesian experimental design is a technique that allows to efficiently select measurements to characterize a physical system by maximizing the expected information gain. Recent developments in deep neural networks and normalizing flows allow for a more efficient approximation of the posterior and thus the extension of this technique to complex high-dimensional situations. In this paper, we show how this approach holds promise for adaptive measurement strategies to characterize present-day quantum technology platforms. In particular, we focus on arrays of coupled cavities and qubit arrays. Both represent model systems of high relevance for modern applications, like quantum simulations and computing, and both have been realized in platforms where measurement and control can be exploited to characterize and counteract unavoidable disorder. Thus, they represent ideal targets for applications of Bayesian experimental design.

TI T-Count Optimizing Genetic Algorithm for Quantum State Preparation

AB Quantum state preparation is a crucial process within numerous quantum algorithms, and the need for efficient initialization of quantum registers is ever increasing as demand for useful quantum computing grows. The problem arises as the number of qubits to be initialized grows, the circuits required to implement the desired state also exponentially increase in size leading to loss of fidelity to noise. This is mainly due to the susceptibility to environmental effects of the non-Clifford T gate, whose use should thus be reduced as much as possible. In this paper, we present and utilize a genetic algorithm for state preparation circuits consisting of gates from the Clifford + T gate set and optimize them in T-Count as to reduce the impact of noise. Whilst the method presented here does not always produce the most accurate circuits in terms of fidelity, it can generate high-fidelity, non-trivial quantum states such as quantum Fourier transform states. In addition, our algorithm does automatically generate fault tolerantly implementable solutions where the number of the most error prone components is reduced. We present an evaluation of the algorithm when trialed against preparing random, Poisson probability distribution, W, GHZ, and quantum Fourier transform states. We also experimentally demonstrate the scalability issues as qubit count increases, which highlights the need for further optimization of the search process.

TI An efficient large-scale privacy amplification scheme exceeding 10G bits
   for quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Privacy Amplification (PA) is indispensable in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), ensuring security against eavesdropping by eliminating information leakage. For Discrete-Variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols, a large input block size exceeding 108 bits is preferred to achieve the secure key rate approaching the asymptotic limit. However, in state-of-the-art quantum key distribution systems operating at multi-GHz pulse rates, PA becomes a critical bottleneck due to the conflicting requirements of large input block sizes and high throughput. To address this challenge, we propose a novel PA algorithm utilizing a newly constructed universal hash family DM3H and prove its cryptographic security rigorously. Based on the PA algorithm, we design and implement an efficient PA scheme which is capable of processing input block sizes up to 1010 bits while achieving high throughput performance. For an input block size of 1010 bits, the implementation on the i9-14900 platform demonstrates a throughput of 112 Mbps with a retention ratio of 0.33. This breakthrough significantly enhances the secure key rate and maximum transmission distance of DV-QKD systems.

TI Engineering of the qubit initialization in an imperfect physical system
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We propose a method to engineer the light matter interaction while initializing a qubit present of physical constraints utilizing the inverse engineering. Combining the multiple degrees of freedom in the pulse parameters with the perturbation theory, we develop pulses to initialize the qubit within a tightly packed frequency interval to an arbitrary superposition state with high fidelity. Importantly, the initialization induces low off-resonant excitations to the neighboring qubits, and it is robust against the spatial inhomogeneity in the laser intensity. We apply the method to the ensemble rare-earth ions system, and simulations show that the initialization is more robust against the variations in laser intensity than the previous pulses, and reduces the time that ions spend in the intermediate excited state by a factor of 17. The method is applicable to any systems addressed in frequency such as nitrogen-vacancy centers, superconducting qubits, quantum dots, and molecular qubit systems.

TI Single shot i-Toffoli gate in dispersively coupled superconducting
   qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum algorithms often benefit from the ability to execute multi-qubit (> 2) gates. To date, such multi-qubit gates are typically decomposed into single- and two-qubit gates, particularly in superconducting qubit architectures. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms. Here, we propose a single shot method for executing an i-Toffoli gate, a three-qubit gate with two control and one target qubit, using currently existing superconducting hardware. We show numerical evidence for a process fidelity over 99.5% and a gate time of 450 ns for superconducting qubits interacting via tunable couplers. Our method can straight forwardly be extended to implement gates with more than two control qubits at similar fidelities.

TI Quantum transport of high-dimensional spatial information with a
   nonlinear detector
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Information exchange between two distant parties, where information is shared without physically transporting it, is a crucial resource in future quantum networks. Doing so with high-dimensional states offers the promise of higher information capacity and improved resilience to noise, but progress to date has been limited. Here we demonstrate how a nonlinear parametric process allows for arbitrary high-dimensional state projections in the spatial degree of freedom, where a strong coherent field enhances the probability of the process. This allows us to experimentally realise quantum transport of high-dimensional spatial information facilitated by a quantum channel with a single entangled pair and a nonlinear spatial mode detector. Using sum frequency generation we upconvert one of the photons from an entangled pair resulting in high-dimensional spatial information transported to the other. We realise a d = 15 quantum channel for arbitrary photonic spatial modes which we demonstrate by faithfully transferring information encoded into orbital angular momentum, Hermite-Gaussian and arbitrary spatial mode superpositions, without requiring knowledge of the state to be sent. Our demonstration merges the nascent fields of nonlinear control of structured light with quantum processes, offering a new approach to harnessing high-dimensional quantum states, and may be extended to other degrees of freedom too.
   High-dimensional quantum states allow for several advantages in quantum communication, but protocols such as teleportation require additional entangled photons as the dimension increases. Here, the authors show how to transport a high-dimensional quantum state from a bright coherent laser field to a single photon, using two entangled photons as the quantum channel.

TI Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States Based on the Tensor
   Decompositions of Unitary Matrices
SO ENTROPY
AB Since two quantum states that are local unitary (LU) equivalent have the same amount of entanglement, it is meaningful to find a practical method to determine the LU equivalence of given quantum states. In this paper, we present a valid process to find the unitary tensor product decomposition for an arbitrary unitary matrix. Then, by using this process, the conditions for determining the local unitary equivalence of quantum states are obtained. A numerical verification is carried out, which shows the practicability of our protocol. We also present a property of LU invariants by using the universality of quantum gates which can be used to construct the complete set of LU invariants.

TI Purification scheduling control for throughput maximization in quantum
   networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks can establish End-to-End (E2E) entanglement connections between two arbitrary nodes with desired entanglement fidelity by performing entanglement purification to support quantum applications reliably. The existing works mainly focus on link-level purification scheduling and lack consideration of purifications at network-level, which fails to offer an effective solution for concurrent requests, resulting in low throughput. However, efficiently allocating scarce resources to purify entanglement for concurrent requests remains a critical but unsolved problem. To address this problem, we explore the purification resource scheduling problem from a network-level perspective. We analyze the cost of purification, design the E2E fidelity calculation method in detail, and propose an approach called Purification Scheduling Control (PSC). The basic idea of PSC is to determine the appropriate purification through jointly optimizing purification and resource allocation processes based on conflict avoidance. We conduct extensive experiments that show that PSC can maximize throughput under the fidelity requirement.
   In quantum networks, entanglement purification is required to ensure that the E2E fidelity of the entanglement connections can support quantum applications reliably. Here, the authors explore the purification resource scheduling problem from a network-level perspective by jointly optimizing purification and resource allocation processes to maximize the throughput under the fidelity requirement.

TI Query complexity of generalized Simon's problem
SO INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION
AB Simon's problem plays an important role in the history of quantum algorithms, as it inspired Shor to discover the celebrated quantum algorithm solving integer factorization in polynomial time. Besides, the quantum algorithm for Simon's problem has been recently applied to break symmetric cryptosystems. Generalized Simon's problem, denoted by GSP(p, n, k), is a natural extension of Simon's problem: Given a function f : Znp -> X where X is a finite set and the promise that for any x, y is an element of Z(p)(n), f (x) = f (y) iff x- y is an element of S for a subgroup S <= Z(p)(n) of rank k < n, the goal is to find S. In this paper we consider the query complexity of the problem, that is, the minimum number of queries to f required to find S. First, it is not difficult to design a quantum algorithm solving the above problem with query complexity of O(n - k). However, so far it is not clear what is the classical query complexity of the problem, and revealing this complexity is necessary for clarifying the computational power gap between quantum and classical computing on the problem. To tackle this problem, we prove that any classical (deterministic or randomized) algorithm for GSP(p, n, k) has to query at least Omega(max{k, root p(n-k)} values and any classical nonadaptive deterministic algorithm for GSP(p, n, k) has to query at least Omega max{k, root k center dot pn-k} values. Hence, we clearly show the classical computing model is less powerful than the quantum counterpart, in terms of query complexity for the generalized Simon's problem. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound O max{k, k middot pn-k} on the classical deterministic query complexity of GSP(p, n, k), by devising a subtle classical algorithm based on group theory and the divide-and-conquer approach. Therefore, we have an almost full characterization of the classical deterministic query complexity of the generalized Simon's problem. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Authentication of smart grid communications using quantum key

AB Smart grid solutions enable utilities and customers to better monitor and control energy use via information and communications technology. Information technology is intended to improve the future electric grid's reliability, efficiency, and sustainability by implementing advanced monitoring and control systems. However, leveraging modern communications systems also makes the grid vulnerable to cyberattacks. Here we report the first use of quantum key distribution (QKD) keys in the authentication of smart grid communications. In particular, we make such demonstration on a deployed electric utility fiber network. The developed method was prototyped in a software package to manage and utilize cryptographic keys to authenticate machine-to-machine communications used for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). This demonstration showcases the feasibility of using QKD to improve the security of critical infrastructure, including future distributed energy resources (DERs), such as energy storage.

TI Noiseless Attenuation for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   over Ground-Satellite Uplink
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) has lately received considerable attention due to its potential to establish a secure global network. Associated with its application is a turbulent atmosphere that sets a notable restriction to the transmission efficiency, which is especially challenging for ground-to-satellite uplink scenarios. Here, we propose a novel noiseless attenuation (NA) scheme involving a zero-photon catalysis operation for source preparation to improve the performance of continuous-variable (CV) QKD over uplink. Numerical analysis shows that the NA-based CV-QKD, under attenuation optimization, outperforms the traditional CV-QKD, which is embodied in extending the allowable zenith angle while improving the effective communication time. Attributing to characteristics of the attenuation optimization, we find that the NA-involved source preparation improves the security bound by relatively reducing the amount of information available to eavesdroppers. Taking the finite-size effect into account, we achieve a tighter bond of security, which is more practical compared with the asymptotic limit.

TI Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in
   molecules on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wave function and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with N strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with N. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where N is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wave function. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with (NN/2) Slater determinants with depth O(N) and O(N2) local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wave functions as initial states for a range of heuristic quantum algorithms, namely, the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.

TI Performance of entanglement purification including maximally entangled
   mixed states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Entanglement between distant quantum systems is a critical resource for implementing quantum communication. This property is affected by external agents and can be restored by employing efficient entanglement purification protocols. In this work, we propose an entanglement purification protocol based on two entangling two-qubit operations that replace the usual controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. These operations arise from a generalised quantum measurement and can be understood as measurement operators in a positive operator-valued measure. Furthermore, two variants of the core protocol are introduced and their performances are studied in terms of the overall success probability of reaching a Bell state and the number of purifiable states. Based on rank-two states, we can obtain analytical expressions for the success probability that we extend and refine using numerical calculations to the case of maximally entangled states. We also consider more general rank-three states to show that our procedure is in general more convenient compared to purification protocols based on Bell diagonal states. Finally, we test the protocols using initial random states. In all cases, we find a better performance and a larger amount of purifiable states using our schemes compared to the CNOT-based protocol.

TI Growth of telecom C-band In(Ga)As quantum dots for silicon quantum
   photonics
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on the silicon-on-insulator platform currently allow high-density integration of optical and electro-optical components on the same chip. This high complexity is also transferred to quantum PICs, where non-linear processes are used for the generation of quantum light on the silicon chip. However, these intrinsically probabilistic light emission processes pose challenges to the ultimately achievable scalability. Here, an interesting solution would be employing on-demand sources of quantum light based on III-V platforms, which are nonetheless very complex to grow directly on silicon. In this paper, we show the integration of InAs quantum dots (QDs) on silicon via the growth on a wafer-bonded GaAs/Si template. To ensure emission in the telecom C-band (similar to 1550 nm), a metamorphic buffer layer approach is utilized. We show that the deposited single QDs show similar performance to their counterparts directly grown on the well-established GaAs platform. Our results demonstrate that on-demand telecom emitters can be directly and effectively integrated on silicon, without compromises on the performances of either the platforms.

TI Detecting single gravitons with quantum sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quantization of gravity is widely believed to result in gravitons - particles of discrete energy that form gravitational waves. But their detection has so far been considered impossible. Here we show that signatures of single graviton exchange can be observed in laboratory experiments. We show that stimulated and spontaneous single-graviton processes can become relevant for massive quantum acoustic resonators and that stimulated absorption can be resolved through continuous sensing of quantum jumps. We analyze the feasibility of observing the exchange of single energy quanta between matter and gravitational waves. Our results show that single graviton signatures are within reach of experiments. In analogy to the discovery of the photo-electric effect for photons, such signatures can provide the first experimental clue of the quantization of gravity.

TI Evolutionary Computation for Adaptive Quantum Device Design
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices grow in number of qubits, determining good or even adequate parameter configurations for a given application, or for device calibration, becomes a cumbersome task. An evolutionary algorithm is presented here which allows for the automatic tuning of the parameters of any arrangement of coupled qubits, to perform a given task with high fidelity. The algorithm's use is exemplified with the generation of schemes for the distribution of quantum states and the design of multi-qubit gates. The algorithm is demonstrated to converge very rapidly, yielding unforeseeable designs of quantum devices that perform their required tasks with excellent fidelities. Given these promising results, practical scalability, and application versatility, the approach has the potential to become a powerful technique to aid the design and calibration of NISQ devices.

TI Variational quantum process tomography of unitaries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum process tomography is an experimental technique to fully characterize an unknown quantum process. Standard quantum process tomography suffers from exponentially scaling of the number of measurements with the increasing system size. In this work, we put forward a quantum machine learning algorithm which approximately encodes the unknown unitary quantum process into a relatively shallow depth parametric quan-tum circuit. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing the unitary quantum processes resulting from the quantum Hamiltonian evolution and random quantum circuits up to eight qubits. Results show that those quantum processes could be reconstructed with high fidelity, while the number of input states required are at least two orders of magnitude less than required by the standard quantum process tomography.

TI On the Capacity of Vector Linear Computation Over a Noiseless Quantum
   Multiple-Access Channel With Entangled Transmitters
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Network function computation is an active topic in network coding, with much recent progress for linear (over a finite field) computations over broadcast and multiple-access channels. Over a quantum multiple-access channel (QMAC) with quantum entanglement shared among transmitters, the linear computation problem (LC-QMAC) is nontrivial even when the channel is noiseless, due to the challenge of optimally exploiting transmitter-side entanglement through distributed coding. Given an arbitrary linear function of data streams defined in a finite field F-d, the LC-QMAC problem seeks the optimal communication cost (minimum number of qudits that need to be sent by the transmitters to the receiver, per computation instance) over a noise-free QMAC, when the independent input data streams originate at the corresponding transmitters, who share quantum entanglement in advance. As our main result, we fully solve this problem for K=3 transmitters (K >= 4 settings remain open). Coding schemes based on the N-sum box protocol (along with time sharing and batch processing) are shown to be information theoretically optimal in all cases.

TI Coherent manipulation of multiple ions in a room-temperature
   surface-electrode trap
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The development of high-performance chip-scale ion traps is crucial for the integration and scaling of ion-trap-based quantum computers. Although cryogenic environments can greatly reduce anomalous heating, operating ion traps at room temperature remains highly attractive due to its simplicity and lower cost. This work reports significant progress in coherently controlling multiple ions confined in a custom-fabricated, room-temperature surface-electrode trap, establishing a critical foundation for advanced quantum protocols such as quantum error correction and future scalable architectures. Research objectives and methods This study aims to characterize a home-built chip trap and demonstrate its capabilities for multi-ion quantum logic under ambient conditions. The trap adopts a six-wire electrode design on a high-resistivity silicon substrate, with ions trapped at a height of 154 mu m. A combination of Doppler cooling, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling, and resolved-sideband cooling is used to prepare the ions in their motional ground state. Coherent manipulations are performed using both a 729 nm laser (for optical qubits between the |S-1/2, m(j) = -1/2 > and |D-5/2, m(j )= -3/2 > states) and microwave radiation (for qubits between the |S-1/2, m(j) = -1/2 > and |S-1/2, m(j) = +1/2 > states). Quantum state detection is achieved via state-dependent fluorescence by using an EMCCD camera, thereby enabling site-resolved readout. Key results Low room-temperature heating rates: The trap exhibits low heating rates, measured to be 0.074(8) quanta/ms in the axial direction (at 833 kHz) and 0.237(51) quanta/ms in the radial direction (at 1.3 MHz). The spectral density of electric-field noise is on the order of 10(-13) V-2/(m(2) <middle dot> Hz) at trap frequencies above 500 kHz, ranking among the best for room-temperature devices. The spectral density of electric-field noise follows an approximate f(-2.52(22)) dependence, potentially influenced by external filtering circuits. High-fidelity single-ion control: A single 40Ca+ ion is cooled to an average phonon number of 0.04(2) in its axial motion. High-fidelity coherent operations are demonstrated: carrier Rabi oscillations using the 729 nm laser shows a single-pulse fidelity of approximately 98.98(8)%, while microwave-driven operations achieves a fidelity of 99.95(2)%. Ramsey interferometry with microwaves reveals a coherence time T2* of 5.0(4) ms. Site-resolved multi-ion coherent control: The core achievement is the global coherent manipulation of ion chains containing up to 20 ions. The system is characterized by driving motional sideband transitions on various axial modes of 5-and 6-ion chains. The resulting Rabi oscillations, measured using site-resolved fluorescence, clearly show the collective dynamics and mode-dependent coupling strengths determined by the normalized mode eigenvectors. Furthermore, global carrier transitions are demonstrated on a two-dimensional (2D) zigzag crystal of 20 ions, confirming the ability to execute simultaneous operations on a large qubit array. Global control of 2D ion crystals: Using 20 ions, a 2D zigzag crystal is formed and globally addressed using both laser and microwave drives.
   Laser-driven carrier transitions show strong decay due to multimode motional coupling, whereas microwave-driven oscillations remain nearly decay-free, consistent with the Lamb-Dicke parameter being negligible for microwave fields. Conclusion The room-temperature surface-electrode trap can support low-heating confinement, highfidelity single-and multi-qubit operations, as well as coherent control of large ion arrays. The site-resolved observations of mode-dependent coupling highlight the potential for utilizing collective vibrational modes for selective quantum control. These results validate the trap as a robust and promising platform for medium-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation at room temperature. Future work will focus on structural optimizations to reduce radial heating and integration with cryogenic systems to further suppress noise, ultimately advancing toward large-scale quantum computing architectures.

TI A Dynamic-Routing Algorithm Based on a Virtual Quantum Key Distribution
   Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an encrypted communication technique based on the principles of quantum mechanics that ensures communication security by exploiting the properties of quantum states. Currently, the transmission efficiency of the QKD system is low. Trusted relay technology is used to solve this problem and achieve long-distance transmission. However, trusted relaying alone cannot decrypt the issues of poor link stability and the low utilization of key resources. To further optimize the system performance, we propose a dynamic routing algorithm. One of the improvement schemes includes the following: firstly, an adjustable-size quantum key pool (QKP) is designed, which can dynamically adjust the size of the refreshing pool according to the actual demand. Secondly, the utilization of key resources is improved by using the residual quantum key model to dynamically obtain the remaining key amount in the QKP and set the key amount threshold. We calculate the link-blocking probability and track the blocking intensity and blocking entry by combining the Poisson process, thus realizing the evaluation of the link stability. Finally, the number of remaining keys in the QKP and the link-blocking probability combine with the random wandering model as the basis of the route selection for the QKD dynamic routing algorithm to achieve efficient key path selection. We validated the algorithm by comparing it with other algorithms on the Mininet simulation platform, and the algorithm proved to have a better performance in terms of congestion avoidance, delay reduction, and improved QKD efficiency. This scheme provides a novel and efficient way to solve the problems in existing QKD systems. It effectively improves the transmission efficiency and strengthens the system's security by dynamically obtaining the critical volume, accurately evaluating the link state, and selecting the optimal critical path.

TI Distribution and quantification of remotely generated Wigner negativity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Wigner negativity, as a well-known indicator of nonclassicality, plays an essential role in quantum computing and simulation using continuous-variable systems. The conditional preparation of Wigner-negative states through appropriate non-Gaussian operations on an auxiliary mode is common procedure in quantum optics experiments. Motivated by the demand of real-world quantum network, here we investigate the remote creation and distribution of Wigner negativity in the multipartite scenario from a quantitative perspective. By establishing a monogamy relation akin to the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality, we show that the amount of Wigner negativity cannot be freely distributed among different modes. Moreover, for photon subtraction-one of the main experimentally realized non-Gaussian operations-we provide an intuitive method to quantify remotely generated Wigner negativity. Our results pave the way for exploiting Wigner negativity as a valuable resource for numerous quantum information protocols based on non-Gaussian scenario.

These are schemes meant for characterizing arbitrary low-rank quantum objects, be it an unknown state, a process or detector, using minimal measuring resources (hence compressive) without any a priori assumptions (rank, sparsity, eigenbasis, etc.) about the quantum object. This paper contains a reasonable amount of technical details for the quantum-information community to start applying the methods discussed here. To facilitate the understanding of formulation logic and physics of compressive tomography, the theoretical concepts and important numerical results (both new and cross-referenced) shall be presented in a pedagogical manner.

TI Circuit implementation of discrete-time quantum walks via the shunt
   decomposition method
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Several models have been proposed to build evolution operators to perform quantum walks in a theoretical way, although when wanting to map the resulting evolution operators into quantum circuits to run them in quantum computers, it is often the case that the mapping process is in fact complicated. Nevertheless, when the adjacency matrix of a graph can be decomposed into a sum of permutation matrices, we can always build a shift operator for a quantum walk that has a block diagonal matrix representation. In this paper, we analyze the mapping process of block diagonal operators into quantum circuit form and apply this method to obtain quantum circuits that generate quantum walks on the most common topologies found in the literature: the straight line, the cyclic graph, the hypercube and the complete graph. The obtained circuits are then executed on quantum processors of the type Falcon r5.11 L and Falcon r4T (two of each type) through IBM Quantum Composer platform and on the Qiskit Aer simulator, performing three steps for each topology. The resulting distributions were compared against analytical distributions, using the statistical distance (sic)(1) as a performance metric. Regarding experimental executions, we obtained short (sic)(1) distances in the cases of quantum circuits with a low amount of multi-control gates, being the quantum processors of the type Falcon r4T the ones that provided more accurate results.

TI Optimisation of electron spin qubits in electrically driven multi-donor
   quantum dots
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Multi-donor quantum dots have been at the forefront of recent progress in Si-based quantum computation. Among them, 2P: 1P spin qubits have a built-in dipole moment, making them ideal for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR) using the donor hyperfine interaction, and thus all-electrical spin operation. We report fast EDSR, with T-pi similar to 10 - 50 ns and a Rabi ratio (T-1/T-pi) similar to 10(6). The fastest EDSR time T-pi occurs when the 2P: 1P axis is parallel to [111], while the best Rabi ratio occurs when it is parallel to [100]. Sensitivity to random telegraph noise due to nearby charge defects depends strongly on the location of the nearby defects. The qubit is robust against 1/f noise provided it is operated away from the charge anti-crossing. Entanglement via exchange is several orders of magnitude faster than dipole-dipole coupling. These findings pave the way towards fast, low-power, coherent and scalable donor dot-based quantum computing.

TI On infinite tensor networks, complementary recovery and type II factors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We initiate a study of local operator algebras at the boundary of infinite tensor networks, using the mathematical theory of inductive limits. In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic Harlow-Pastawski-Preskill-Yoshida code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II infinity factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans & auml;tze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.

TI Experimental Direct Measurement of the Relative Entropy of Coherence
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum coherence is the most distinguished feature of quantum mechanics, which characterizes the superposition properties of quantum states. It plays a critical role in various fields, ranging from quantum information technology to quantum biology. Although various coherence quantifiers have been proposed since the resource theory of coherence was established, there are a lack of experimental methods to estimate them efficiently, which restricts the applications of coherence. Relative entropy of coherence is one of the main quantifiers of coherence, and is frequently used in quantum information science. Such nonlinear properties of quantum states are usually calculated from full descriptions of the quantum state, although they are not related to all parameters that specify the state. Here, we experimentally measure the relative entropy of coherence for the arbitrary qubit states directly in the photonic system without using standard state tomography. In the experiment, we directly measure the von Neumann entropy of the quantum states through interference, thus obtaining the relative entropy of coherence, and finding that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theory. Our work provides a nice alternative experimental scheme for measuring the relative entropy of coherence.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB An evolution of a two-level system (qubit) interacting with a single-photon wave packet is analyzed. It is shown that a hierarchy of master equations gives rise to phase covariant qubit evolution. The temporal correlations in the input field induce nontrivial memory effects for the evolution of a qubit. It is shown that in the resonant case whenever time-local generator is regular (does not display singularities) the qubit evolution never displays information backflow. However, in general the generator might be highly singular leading to intricate non-Markovian effects. A detailed analysis of the exponential profile is provided which allows to illustrate all characteristic feature of the qubit evolution.

TI Thermal rectification in a qubit-resonator system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the subsystems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or superlinearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.

TI Initial experimental results on a superconducting-qubit reset based on
   photon-assisted quasiparticle tunneling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present here our recent results on qubit reset scheme based on a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR). In particular, we use the photon-assisted quasiparticle tunneling through a superconductor-insulator-normal-metal-insulator-superconductor junction to controllably decrease the energy relaxation time of the qubit during the QCR operation. In our experiment, we use a transmon qubit with dispersive readout. The QCR is capacitively coupled to the qubit through its normal-metal island. We employ rapid, square-shaped QCR control voltage pulses with durations in the range of 2-350 ns and a variety of amplitudes to optimize the reset time and fidelity. Consequently, we reach a qubit ground-state probability of roughly 97% with 80-ns pulses starting from the first excited state. The qubit state probability is extracted from averaged readout signal, where the calibration is based on Rabi oscillations, thus not distinguishing the residual thermal population of the qubit.

TI Microwave calibration of qubit drive line components at millikelvin
   temperatures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Systematic errors in qubit state preparation arise due to non-idealities in qubit control lines such as impedance mismatch. Using a data-based methodology of short-open-load calibration at a temperature of 30 mK, we report calibrated 1-port scattering parameter data of individual qubit drive line components. At 5 GHz, cryogenic return losses of a 20-dB-attenuator, a 10-dB-attenuator, a 230-mm-long 0.86-mm silver-plated cupronickel coaxial cable, and a 230-mm-long 0.86-mm NbTi coaxial cable were found to be 35(-2)(+3) dB, 33(-2)(+3) dB, 34(-2)(+3) dB, and 29(-1)(+2) dB, respectively. For the same frequency, we also extract cryogenic insertion losses of 0.99(-0.04)(+0.04) dB and 0.02(-0.04)(+0.04) dB for the coaxial cables. We interpret the results using master equation simulation of all XY gates performed on a single qubit. For example, we simulate a sequence of two 5 ns gate pulses (X and Y) through a two-element Fabry-Perot cavity with 276-mm path length directly preceding the qubit and establish that the return loss of its reflective elements must be > 9.7 dB (> 14.7 dB) to obtain 99.9% (99.99%) gate fidelity.

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We introduce a Xilinx RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC)-based qubit controller (called the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit, or QICK for short), which supports the direct synthesis of control pulses with carrier frequencies of up to 6 GHz. The QICK can control multiple qubits or other quantum devices. The QICK consists of a digital board hosting an RFSoC field-programmable gate array, custom firmware, and software and an optional companion custom-designed analog front-end board. We characterize the analog performance of the system as well as its digital latency, important for quantum error correction and feedback protocols. We benchmark the controller by performing standard characterizations of a transmon qubit. We achieve an average gate fidelity of Favg=99.93%.

TI Observation of Optical Precursor in Time-Energy-Entangled W Triphotons
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB In quantum communication and quantum computation, adding each entangled photon leads to an exponential increase in communication and computational capabilities. Utilizing a fifth-order nonlinear process, narrow-band non-Gaussian W-triphotons are experimentally generated through the spontaneous six -wave mixing (SSWM), but the manipulation of such entangled state in the group delay regime is still lacked. For the first time, the observation of optical precursors at the triphoton level is reported through the SSWM process. By appropriately adjusting the optical depth, optical precursors are effectively separated from the main wave through utilizing the slow-light effect to manipulate the triphoton temporal correlations in the group delay regime. In biphoton and conditional two-photon, the intensity ratio between the precursor and the main wave is tunable by adjusting the detuning and power of the laser. These pivotal breakthroughs mark a significant advancement in the study of optical precursors and open new possibilities for their application in quantum technologies.

TI The rank of contextuality
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum contextuality is one of the most recognized resources in quantum communication and computing scenarios. We provide a new quantifier of this resource, the rank of contextuality (RC). We define RC as the minimum number of non-contextual behaviors that are needed to simulate a contextual behavior. We show that the logarithm of RC is a natural contextuality measure satisfying several properties considered in the spirit of the resource-theoretic approach. The properties include faithfulness, monotonicity, and additivity under tensor product. We also give examples of how to construct contextual behaviors with an arbitrary value of RC exhibiting a natural connection between this quantifier and the arboricity of an underlying hypergraph. We also discuss exemplary areas of research in which the new measure appears as a natural quantifier.

TI Electrical control of quantum emitters in a Van der Waals
   heterostructure
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Controlling and manipulating individual quantum systems in solids underpins the growing interest in the development of scalable quantum technologies. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has garnered significant attention in quantum photonic applications due to its ability to host optically stable quantum emitters. However, the large bandgap of hBN and the lack of efficient doping inhibits electrical triggering and limits opportunities to study the electrical control of emitters. Here, we show an approach to electrically modulate quantum emitters in an hBN-graphene van der Waals heterostructure. We show that quantum emitters in hBN can be reversibly activated and modulated by applying a bias across the device. Notably, a significant number of quantum emitters are intrinsically dark and become optically active at non-zero voltages. To explain the results, we provide a heuristic electrostatic model of this unique behavior. Finally, employing these devices we demonstrate a nearly-coherent source with linewidths of similar to 160 MHz. Our results enhance the potential of hBN for tunable solid-state quantum emitters for the growing field of quantum information science.

TI Quantum Hacking on an Integrated Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution System via Power Analysis
SO ENTROPY
AB In quantum key distribution (QKD), there are some security loopholes opened by the gaps between the theoretical model and the practical system, and they may be exploited by eavesdroppers (Eve) to obtain secret key information without being detected. This is an effective quantum hacking strategy that seriously threatens the security of practical QKD systems. In this paper, we propose a new quantum hacking attack on an integrated silicon photonic continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system, which is known as a power analysis attack. This attack can be implemented by analyzing the power originating from the integrated electrical control circuit in state preparation with the help of machine learning, where the state preparation is assumed to be perfect in initial security proofs. Specifically, we describe a possible power model and show a complete attack based on a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. The simulation results show that the secret key information decreases with the increase of the accuracy of the attack, especially in a situation with less excess noise. In particular, Eve does not have to intrude into the transmitter chip (Alice), and may perform a similar attack in practical chip-based discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DVQKD) systems. To resist this attack, the electrical control circuit should be improved to randomize the corresponding power. In addition, the power can be reduced by utilizing the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technology.

TI Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a nonmonotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such nonmonotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.

TI A SAT Approach to the Initial Mapping Problem in SWAP Gate Insertion for
   Commuting Gates
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Most quantum circuits require SWAP gate insertion to run on quantum hardware with limited qubit connectivity. A promising SWAP gate insertion method for blocks of commuting two-qubit gates is a predetermined swap strategy which applies layers of SWAP gates simultaneously executable on the coupling map. A good initial mapping for the swap strategy reduces the number of required swap gates. However, even when a circuit consists of commuting gates, e.g., as in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) or trotterized simulations of Ising Hamiltonians, finding a good initial mapping is a hard problem. We present a SAT-based approach to find good initial mappings for circuits with commuting gates transpiled to the hardware with swap strategies. Our method achieves a 65% reduction in gate count for random three-regular graphs with 500 nodes. In addition, we present a heuristic approach that combines the SAT formulation with a clustering algorithm to reduce large problems to a manageable size. This approach reduces the number of swap layers by 25% compared to both a trivial and random initial mapping for a random three-regular graph with 1000 nodes. Good initial mappings will therefore enable the study of quantum algorithms, such as QAOA and Ising Hamiltonian simulation applied to sparse problems, on noisy quantum hardware with several hundreds of qubits.

We demonstrate that they can be optimized using the techniques of finite-time thermodynamics on the solutions of the Lindblad equation. Our results show that differently to what happens in classic refrigerators, in our quantum ones the optimization of the cooling power does not lead to an optimal working regime but that using the Omega\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Omega$$\end{document} function we can find it. Then, we generalize the study using a family of target functions defined by powers of the coefficient of performance times the cooling power to carry out a more general optimization. These last optimizations reveal the importance that every parameter defining the refrigerator has on the performance of the refrigerators when they work optimally.

TI Quantum Entanglement of the Final Particles in the Resonant Trident Pair
   Production Process in a Strong Electromagnetic Wave
SO PHOTONICS
AB The resonant trident pair production process in the collision of ultrarelativistic electrons with a strong electromagnetic wave was theoretically studied. Under resonant conditions, the intermediate virtual gamma-quantum became real. As a result, the original resonant trident pair production process effectively split into two first-order processes by the fine structure constant: the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton effect and the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process. The kinematics of the resonant trident pair production process were studied in detail. It was shown that there are two different cases for the energies and outgoing angles of the final particles (an electron and an electron-positron pair) in which their quantum entanglement is realized. In the first case, energies and outgoing angles of the final ultrarelativistic particles are uniquely determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton effect (the outgoing angle of the final electron and the quantum parameter of the Compton effect). In the second case, energies and outgoing angles of the final particles are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process (the electron-positron pair outgoing angle and the Breit-Wheeler quantum parameter). It was shown that in a sufficiently wide range of frequencies and intensities of a strong electromagnetic wave, and in the case of ultrarelativistic initial electrons, the differential probability of the resonant trident pair production process with simultaneous registration of the outgoing angles of the final particles can significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceed the total probability of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton effect.

TI True experimental reconstruction of quantum states and processes via
   convex optimization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We use a constrained convex optimization (CCO) method to experimentally characterize arbitrary quantum states and unknown quantum processes on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor. Standard protocols for quantum state and quantum process tomography are based on linear inversion, which often result in an unphysical density matrix and hence an invalid process matrix. The CCO method, on the other hand, produces physically valid density matrices and process matrices, with significantly improved fidelity as compared to the standard methods. We use the CCO method to estimate the Kraus operators and characterize gates in the presence of errors due to decoherence. We then assume Markovian system dynamics and use a Lindblad master equation in conjunction with the CCO method, to completely characterize the noise processes present in the NMR system.

TI Universal Gate Operations on Nuclear Spin Qubits in an Optical Tweezer
   Array of 171Yb Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Neutral atom arrays are a rapidly developing platform for quantum science. Recently, alkaline earth atoms (AEAs) have attracted interest because their unique level structure provides several opportunities for improved performance. In this work, we present the first demonstration of a universal set of quantum gate operations on a nuclear spin qubit in an AEA, using Yb-171. We implement narrow-line cooling and imaging using a newly discovered magic trapping wavelength at lambda = 486.78 nm. We also demonstrate nuclear spin initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates and observe long coherence times [T-1 approximate to 20 s and T*(2) = 1.24(5) s] and a single-qubit operation fidelity F-1Q = 0.99959(6). We also demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates using the Rydberg blockade, as well as coherent control of these gate operations using light shifts on the Yb+ ion core transition at 369 nm. These results are a significant step toward highly coherent quantum gates in AEA tweezer arrays.

TI Security of device-independent quantum key distribution protocols: a
   review
SO QUANTUM
AB Device-independent quantum key distribu-tion (DI-QKD) is often seen as the ulti-mate key exchange protocol in terms of se-curity, as it can be performed securely with uncharacterised black-box devices. The ad-vent of DI-QKD closes several loopholes and side-channels that plague current QKD sys-tems. While implementing DI-QKD protocols is technically challenging, there have been re-cent proof-of-principle demonstrations, result-ing from the progress made in both theory and experiments. In this review, we will provide an introduction to DI-QKD, an overview of the related experiments performed, and the the-ory and techniques required to analyse its se-curity. We conclude with an outlook on future DI-QKD research.

TI Experimental Demonstration of LLO Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution With Polarization Loss Compensation
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB compensation process for the state of polarization (SOP) from quantum signal plays an important role in the practical implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). In contrast to the previous scheme using an expensive digital dynamic polarization controller, we choose a cheaper manual polarization controller interfaced with a digital algorithm based on Kalman filter to achieve compensation of the polarization loss under the condition that the SOP of the fiber is relatively stable. This paper also enumerates the details of other digital signal processing method to achieve final secret key rate. And a pilot-sequential Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) continuous-variable quantum key distribution system with a local local oscillator (LLO) is experimentally implemented based on the analysis of excess noise. Finally, the experimental results show that the method of polarization loss compensation takes advantages in maintaining the stability of the final secret key rate. And a secret key rate of 110 kbps is achieved within 20 km optical fiber (with 4 dB loss) under the finite-size block of 1 x 10(6) during a more extended time in the laboratory.

TI Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing via Continuous Measurement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Present protocols of criticality-enhanced sensing with open quantum sensors assume direct measurement of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted to the environment, thereby potentially missing valuable information. Here we propose a protocol for criticality-enhanced sensing via continuous observation of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a scaling theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system and environment state at dissipative critical points. We derive universal scaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior governed by the underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the standard quantum limit and can in principle saturate the Heisenberg limit. To harness such advantageous scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based on continuous detection of the emitted quanta as realized experimentally in various quantum-optical setups. In such a scheme a single interrogation corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory of the open system evolving under the nonunitary dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed and the backaction of the continuous measurement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the associated precision scaling significantly exceeds that based on direct measurement of the critical steady state, thereby establishing the metrological value of the continuous detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative criticality. We illustrate our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the open Rabi model, a paradigmatic model for the study of dissipative phase transition with finite components. Our protocol is applicable to generic quantum-optical open sensors permitting continuous readout, and may find applications at the frontier of quantum sensing, such as the human-machine interface, magnetic diagnosis of heart disease, and zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance.

TI QSMIT: A Quantum Secure Medical Image Transmission Using Sphincs plus
   With DICOM
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
AB As quantum computing capabilities continue to evolve, the need for quantum-secure communication protocols is becoming increasingly essential, and ongoing research in this area is crucial to maintain the security and privacy of digital information in healthcare and beyond. Considering the integrity of such data, we proposed a secure medical image transmission using a post-quantum digital signature scheme known as Sphincs+, as suggested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Sphincs+ offers strong security against quantum attacks, ensuring long-term data protection. It is stateless, avoids issues with key reuse, and provides efficient, scalable digital signatures. Its robustness and flexibility make it ideal for diverse applications, maintaining integrity even as quantum computing advances. We transmit a digitally signed image using DICOM encoding and Quantum Fourier Transform for transmission. DICOM ensures standardized, interoperable management of medical images, integrating devices and systems for accurate diagnosis for modern consumer healthcare workflows and record-keeping. The Quantum Fourier Transform offers exponential speedup and higher precision over the classical Fast Fourier Transform, particularly benefiting applications in signal processing, data encryption, and environmental sensing. Advanced mistake detection and repair techniques, as well as extraordinarily fast data transmission, are possible with quantum communication. Additionally, it preserves the confidentiality and integrity of data while lowering the possibility of data loss or corruption during transmission. Some popular performance measuring parameters, such as PNR, MSE, SSIM, etc., are used to validate the proposed framework and observe a convincing result.

TI Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in
   Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a crucial platform for quantum technologies, where its precise numerical modeling is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. We present here a Python library for simulating the NV spin dynamics under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. Our library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time evolution, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum observable given by fluorescence. The simulation framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, where the states initialization and readout are postulated from the interaction with optical fields. By eliminating oversimplifications such as the adoption of rotating frames for the microwave and radio frequency fields, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics emerging from realistic pulse constraints. The software is illustrated with three examples and validated by comparing the simulations with experimental reports, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (conditional logic gates), sensing (dynamical decoupling sequences with coupled spins) and networks (state teleportation). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, which can be used for a wide range of applications.

TI Tuning nonequilibrium heat current and two-photon statistics via
   composite qubit-resonator interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum thermal transport and two-photon statistics serve as two representative nonequilibrium features in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems. Here we investigate quantum heat flow and two-photon correlation function at steady state in a composite qubit-resonator model, where one qubit shows both transverse and longitudinal couplings to a single-mode optical resonator. With weak qubit-resonator interaction, we unravel two microscopic transport pictures, i.e., cotunneling and cyclic heat exchange processes corresponding to transverse and longitudinal couplings, respectively. The nonmonotonic behavior of the heat current is exhibited by tuning the temperature bias with the weak longitudinal coupling. At strong qubit-resonator coupling, the heat current also exhibits a nonmonotonic feature by increasing qubit-resonator coupling strength, which tightly relies on the scattering processes between the qubit and the corresponding thermal bath. Furthermore, the longitudinal coupling is preferred to enhance heat current in the strong qubit-resonator coupling regime. For two-photon correlation function, it exhibits an antibunching-to-bunching transition by tuning the composite angle, which is mainly dominated by the modulation of the energy gap between the first and the second excited eigenstates. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of nonequilibrium thermal transport and nonclassical photon radiation based on the cQED platform.

TI Prefixed-Threshold Real-Time Selection for Free-Space Sending-or-Not
   Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB As a variant of the twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD), the sending-or-not twin-field quantum key distribution (SNS TF-QKD) is famous for its higher tolerance of misalignment error, in addition to the capacity of surpassing the rate-distance limit. Importantly, the free-space SNS TF-QKD will guarantee the security of the communications between mobile parties. In the paper, we first discuss the influence of atmospheric turbulence (AT) on the channel transmittance characterized by the probability distribution of the transmission coefficient (PDTC). Then, we present a method called prefixed-threshold real-time selection (P-RTS) to mitigate the interference of AT on the free-space SNS TF-QKD. The simulations of the free-space SNS TF-QKD with and without P-RTS are both given for comparison. The results showed that it is possible to share the secure key by using the free-space SNS TF-QKD. Simultaneously, the P-RTS method can make the free-space SNS TF-QKD achieve better and more stable performance at a short distance.

In addition, variations of these VQAs are also adapted to perform other useful functions such as quantum state learning and approximate fractional inverses. The common theme shared by the proposed algorithms is that their cost functions are all based on minimizing the quantum purity of a quantum state. Strategies to mitigate or avoid the problem of exponentially vanishing cost function gradients are also discussed.

   measures on a locally compact group
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We introduce positive operator-valued measure (POVM) generated by the projective unitary representation of a direct product of locally compact Abelian group G with its dual (G) over tilde. The method is based upon the Pontryagin duality allowing to establish an isometrical isomorphism between the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators in L-2(G) and the Hilbert space L-2((G) over tilde x G). Any such a measure determines a pair of hybrid (containing classical and quantum parts) quantum channels consisting of the measurement channel and the channel transmitting an initial quantum state to the ensemble of quantum states on the group. It is shown that the second channel can be called a complementary channel to the measurement channel.

TI Charge-induced energy shift of a single-spin qubit under a magnetic
   field gradient
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB An electron confined by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) can be displaced by changes in electron occupations of surrounding QDs owing to the Coulomb interaction. For a single-spin qubit in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such a positional displacement of the host electron results in a qubit energy shift, which must be handled carefully for high-fidelity operations. Here, we spectroscopically investigate the qubit energy shift induced by changes in charge occupations of nearby QDs for a silicon single-spin qubit in a magnetic field gradient. Between two different charge configurations of an adjacent double QD, a spin qubit shows an energy shift of about 4 MHz, which necessitates strict management of electron positions over a QD array. We confirm a correlation between the qubit frequency and the charge configuration by using a postselection analysis.

TI High-fidelity method for a single-step N-bit Toffoli gate in
   trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Conditional multiqubit gates are a key component for elaborate quantum algorithms. In a recent work, Rasmussen et al. [Phys. Rev. A 101, 022308 (2020)] proposed an efficient single-step method for a prototypical multiqubit gate, a Toffoli gate, based on a combination of Ising interactions between control qubits and an appropriate driving field on a target qubit. Trapped ions are a natural platform to implement this method, since Ising interactions mediated by phonons have been demonstrated in increasingly large ion crystals. However, the simultaneous application of these interactions and the driving field required for the gate results in undesired entanglement between the qubits and the motion of the ions, reducing the gate fidelity. In this work, we propose a solution based on adiabatic switching of these phonon-mediated Ising interactions. We study the effects of imperfect ground-state cooling and use spin-echo techniques to undo unwanted phase accumulation in the achievable fidelities. For gates coupling to all axial modes of a linear crystal, we calculate high-fidelity (>99%) N-qubit rotations with N = 3-7 ions cooled to their ground state of motion and a gate time below 1 ms. Finally, we study the effect of laser intensity fluctuations and find that the proposed gate requires intensity stabilization with subpercentage noise levels. The high fidelities obtained also for large crystals could make the gate competitive with gate-decomposed, multistep variants of the N-qubit Toffoli gate, at the expense of requiring ground-state cooling of the ion crystal.

TI Applying quantum autoencoders for time series anomaly detection
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition, or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field. This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.

TI Boosted Binary Quantum Classifier via Graphical Kernel
SO ENTROPY
AB In terms of the logical structure of data in machine learning (ML), we apply a novel graphical encoding method in quantum computing to build the mapping between feature space of sample data and two-level nested graph state that presents a kind of multi-partite entanglement state. By implementing swap-test circuit on the graphical training states, a binary quantum classifier to large-scale test states is effectively realized in this paper. In addition, for the error classification caused by noise, we further explored the subsequent processing scheme by adjusting the weights so that a strong classifier is formed and its accuracy is greatly boosted. In this paper, the proposed boosting algorithm demonstrates superiority in certain aspects as demonstrated via experimental investigation. This work further enriches the theoretical foundation of quantum graph theory and quantum machine learning, which may be exploited to assist the classification of massive-data networks by entangling subgraphs.

TI Leakage Reduces Device Coherence Demands for Pulse-Level Molecular
   Simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices is severely limited by short qubit coherence times. A variational pulse-shaping algorithm known as ctrl-VQE was recently proposed to address this issue by eliminating the need for parameterized quantum circuits, which lead to long state preparation times. Here, we find the fastest possible pulses that prepare target molecular wave functions for a given device Hamiltonian describing coupled transmon qubits using simulations. We find that the resulting time-optimal pulses develop a bang-bang form consistent with Pontryagin's maximum principle. We further investigate how the minimal state preparation time is impacted by the number of energy levels active in the transmon simulations. We find that leakage outside the computational subspace (something that is usually considered problematic) speeds up the state preparation, further reducing device coherence -time demands. Our analysis reveals that this speedup is due to both an enlarged solution space of target wave functions and the appearance of additional channels connecting initial and target states.

TI Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary.We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.

TI Solving traffic data occlusion problems in computer vision algorithms
   using DeepSORT and quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ENGLISH EDITION
AB Inaccuracies of traffic sensors during traffic counting and vehicle classification have persisted as transportation agencies have been prompted to calibrate sensors periodically. Detection of multiple objects, heavy occlusions, and similar appearances in congested places are some causes of computer vision model inaccuracies. This paper used the YOLOv5 model for detection and the DeepSORT model for tracking objects. Due to the nature of the reported problem caused by many misses and mismatches, the power of quantum computing with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimizer was leveraged. A basic Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm features were used in combination with a quantum optimizer to present robust multiple object tracking (MOT) algorithms. This hybrid combination of the classical and quantum model has fastened learning the occludes during frame matching of tracks and detections by generating minimum quantum cost function value. Comparisons with the existing models indicated a significant increase in the primary MOT metric multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) by 16% more than the regular YOLOv5-DeepSORT model when using a quantum optimizer. Also, a 6% multiple object tracking precision (MOTP) increases and a 6% identification metrics (F1) score increase were observed using the quantum optimizer with identity switching reduced from 6 to 4. This model is expected to assist transportation officials in improving the accuracy of traffic counts and vehicle classification and reduce the need for regular computer vision software calibration.

TI Charge-parity switching effects and optimisation of transmon-qubit
   design parameters
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Enhancing the performance of noisy quantum processors requires improving our understanding of error mechanisms and the ways to overcome them. A judicious selection of qubit design parameters plays a pivotal role in improving the performance of quantum processors. In this study, we identify optimal ranges for qubit design parameters, grounded in comprehensive noise modeling. To this end, we also analyze the effect of a charge-parity switch caused by quasiparticles on a two-qubit gate. Due to the utilization of the second excited state of a transmon, where the charge dispersion is significantly larger, a charge-parity switch will affect the conditional phase of the two-qubit gate. We derive an analytical expression for the infidelity of a diabatic controlled-Z gate and see effects of similar magnitude in adiabatic controlled-phase gates in the tunable coupler architecture. Moreover, we show that the effect of a charge-parity switch can be the dominant quasiparticle-related error source of a two-qubit gate. We also demonstrate that charge-parity switches induce a residual longitudinal interaction between qubits in a tunable-coupler circuit. Furthermore, we introduce a performance metric for quantum circuit execution, encompassing the fidelity and number of single- and two-qubit gates in an algorithm, as well as the state preparation fidelity. This comprehensive metric, coupled with a detailed noise model, enables us to determine an optimal range for the qubit design parameters, as confirmed by numerical simulation. Our systematic analysis offers insights and serves as a guiding framework for the development of the next generation of transmon-based quantum processors.

TI A hybrid quantum neural network for split learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as split learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose hybrid quantum split learning (HQSL), an application of hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.

TI Quantum Secure Direct Communication Technology-Enhanced Time-Sensitive
   Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information has emerged as a frontier in scientific research and is transitioning to real-world technologies and applications. In this work, we explore the integration of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) with time-sensitive networking (TSN) for the first time, proposing a novel framework to address the security and latency challenges of Ethernet-based networks. Because our QSDC-TSN protocol inherits all the advantages from QSDC, it will enhance the security of the classical communications both in the traditional TSN- and QKD-based TSN by the quantum principle and reduce the communication latency by transmitting information directly via quantum channels without using keys. By analyzing the integration of QSDC and TSN in terms of time synchronization, flow control, security mechanisms, and network management, we show how QSDC enhances the real-time performance and security of TSN. These advantages enable our QSDC-TSN to keep the balance between and meet the requirements of both high security and real-time performance in industrial control, in a digital twin of green power and green hydrogen systems in distributed energy networks, etc., showing its potential applications in future quantum-classical-hybrid systems.

TI Sensing dot with high output swing for scalable baseband readout of spin
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A crucial requirement for quantum computing-in particular, for scalable quantum computing and error correction-is fast and high-fidelity qubit readout. For semiconductor-based qubits, one limiting factor for local low-power signal amplification is the output swing of the charge sensor. We demonstrate GaAs and Si asymmetric sensing dots (ASDs) specifically designed to provide a significantly larger response compared to conventional charge-sensing dots. Our ASD design features a drain reservoir strongly decoupled from the sensor dot, which mitigates negative feedback effects found in conventional sensors. This results in a boosted output swing of 3 mV, which exceeds the response in the conventional regime of our device by more than a factor of 10. The enhanced output signal paves the way for employing very low-power readout amplifiers in close proximity to the qubit.

TI Quantum Marginal Problem and Incompatibility
SO QUANTUM
AB One of the basic distinctions between classical and quantum mechanics is the existence of fundamentally incompatible quantities. Such quantities are present on all levels of quantum objects: states, measurements, quantum channels, and even higher order dynamics. In this manuscript, we show that two seemingly different aspects of quantum incompatibility: the quantum marginal problem of states and the incompatibility on the level of quantum channels are in many-to-one correspondence. Importantly, as incompatibility of measurements is a special case of the latter, it also forms an instance of the quantum marginal problem. The generality of the connection is harnessed by solving the marginal problem for Gaussian and Bell diagonal states, as well as for pure states under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we derive entropic criteria for channel compatibility, and develop a converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs for quantifying the strength of quantum memories.

TI Unified master equation for molecules in phonon and radiation baths
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We have developed a unified quantum optical master equation that includes the dissipative mechanisms of an impurity molecule in crystals. Our theory applies generally to polyatomic molecules where several vibrational modes give rise to intramolecular vibrational redistributions. The usual assumption on identical shapes of the nuclear potentials in ground and excited electronic states and the rotating wave approximation have been relaxed, i.e. the vibrational coordinates are different in the ground and excited states, with counter-rotating terms included for generality. Linear vibrational coupling to the lattice phonons accounts for dissipations via non-radiative transitions. The interaction of a molecule with photons includes Herzberg-Teller coupling as the first order non-Condon interaction where the transition dipole matrix elements depend linearly on vibrational coordinates. We obtain new cross terms as the result of mixing the terms from the zeroth-order (Condon) and first-order (non-Condon) approximations. The corresponding Lamb shifts for all Liouvilleans are derived explicitly including the contributions of counter-rotating terms. The computed absorption and emission spectra for carbon monoxide is in good agreement with experimental data. We use our unified model to obtain the spectra for nitrogen dioxide, demonstrating the capability of our theory to incorporate all typical dissipative relaxation and decoherence mechanisms for polyatomic molecules. The molecular quantum master equation is a promising theory for studying molecular quantum memory.

TI Maxwell Demon and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Research of Maxwell demon and quantum entanglement is important because of its foundational significance in physics and its potential applications in quantum information. Previous studies on the Maxwell demon have primarily focused on thermodynamics, taking into account quantum correlations. Here we consider from another perspective and ask whether quantum non-locality correlations can be simulated by performing work. The Maxwell demon-assisted Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is thus proposed, which implies a new type of loophole. The application of Landauer's erasure principle suggests that the only way to close this loophole during a steering task is by continuously monitoring the heat fluctuation of the local environment by the participant. We construct a quantum circuit model of Maxwell demon-assisted EPR steering, which can be demonstrated by current programmable quantum processors, such as superconducting quantum computers. Based on this quantum circuit model, we obtain a quantitative formula describing the relationship between energy dissipation due to the work of the demon and quantum non-locality correlation. The result is of great physical interest because it provides a new way to explore and understand the relationship between quantum non-locality, information, and thermodynamics.

SO JETP LETTERS
AB We study a superlattice formed by tunnel-coupled identical antidots periodically situated in a two-dimensional topological insulator placed in a magnetic field. The superlattice spectrum can be controlled by gate electrodes or by changing the magnetic flux through the antidots. We demonstrate that a topologically protected qubit appears at the boundary between two regions with different fluxes. The qubit properties depend on the value of the flux jump on the boundary and can be controlled by the gate voltage. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of such a qubit and analyze the dependence of its properties on the main parameters of the superlattice: the tunnel coupling between antidots, and the probability of jumps with the spin flip.

TI Simulating Collider Physics on Quantum Computers Using Effective Field
   Theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulating the full dynamics of a quantum field theory over a wide range of energies requires exceptionally large quantum computing resources. Yet for many observables in particle physics, perturbative techniques are sufficient to accurately model all but a constrained range of energies within the validity of the theory. We demonstrate that effective field theories (EFTs) provide an efficient mechanism to separate the high energy dynamics that is easily calculated by traditional perturbation theory from the dynamics at low energy and show how quantum algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of the low energy EFT from first principles. As an explicit example we calculate the expectation values of vacuum-to-vacuum and vacuum-to-one-particle transitions in the presence of a time-ordered product of two Wilson lines in scalar field theory, an object closely related to those arising in EFTs of the standard model of particle physics. Calculations are performed using simulations of a quantum computer as well as measurements using the IBMQ Manhattan machine.

TI Free radical detection in precision- cut mouse liver slices with
   diamond- based quantum sensing
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Free radical generation plays a key role in many biological processes including cell communication, maturation, and aging. In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short- lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond- based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so- called nitrogen- vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision- cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant. Significance Here, we show diamond-based quantum sensing in tissue slices. We demonstrated this in precision cut liver slices which can be maintained alive for several days. This method allows measurements of free radical generation at the nanoscale. We were able to show that we can measure free radical generation during a stress response as well as after adding ascorbic acid.

TI Magneto-Optical Characterization of Trions in Symmetric InP-Based
   Quantum Dots for Quantum Communication Applications
SO MATERIALS
AB Magneto-optical parameters of trions in novel large and symmetric InP-based quantum dots, uncommon for molecular beam epitaxy-grown nanostructures, with emission in the third telecom window, are measured in Voigt and Faraday configurations of an external magnetic field. The diamagnetic coefficients are found to be in the range of 1.5-4 mu eV/T-2, and 8-15 mu eV/T-2, respectively out-of-plane and in-plane of the dots. The determined values of diamagnetic shifts are related to the anisotropy of dot sizes. Trion g-factors are measured to be relatively small, in the range of 0.3-0.7 and 0.5-1.3, in both configurations, respectively. Analysis of single carrier g-factors, based on the formalism of spin-correlated orbital currents, leads to similar values for hole and electron of similar to 0.25 for Voigt and g(e) approximate to -5; g(h) approximate to +6 for Faraday configuration of the magnetic field. Values of g-factors close to zero measured in Voigt configuration make the investigated dots promising for electrical tuning of the g-factor sign, required for schemes of single spin control in qubit applications.

TI Dispersive optical systems for scalable Raman driving of hyperfine
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hyperfine atomic states are among the most promising candidates for qubit encoding in quantum information processing. In atomic systems, hyperfine transitions are typically driven through a two-photon Raman process by a laser field which is amplitude modulated at the hyperfine qubit frequency. Here we introduce a method for generating amplitude modulation by phase modulating a laser and reflecting it from a highly dispersive optical element known as a chirped Bragg grating. This approach is passively stable, offers high efficiency, and is compatible with high-power laser sources, enabling large Rabi frequencies and improved quantum coherence. We benchmark this approach by globally driving an array of approximately 300 neutral Rb-87 atomic qubits trapped in optical tweezers and obtain Rabi frequencies of 2 MHz with photon-scattering error rates of less than 2 x 10(-4) per n pulse. This robust approach can be directly integrated with local addressing optics in both neutral atom and trapped ion systems to facilitate high-fidelity single-qubit operations for quantum information processing.

TI Quantification of Robustness, Leakage, and Seepage for Composite and
   Adiabatic Gates on Modern NISQ Systems
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Because processors based on superconducting qubits are inherently noisy, schemes for increased performance that yield higher fidelity, robustness, or improved error correction could be beneficial. Focusing on leakage, seepage, and robustness, we implemented single-qubit gates from composite and adiabatic pulses on a transmon qubit and assessed their performance relative to default pulses in terms of robustness and seepage and leakage rates using interleaved and leakage randomized benchmarking. Unsurprisingly, these pulses did not lead to marked reductions in leakage or seepage rates because they were not designed to do so. However, they were able to compensate for a broader range of systematic drive amplitude and off-resonance errors compared with standard gates. In some cases, using these pulses improved robustness by nearly an order of magnitude. These pulses could be useful for improving quantum error correction protocols or in contexts where cross-talk and calibration drift are problematic.

TI A silicon singlet-triplet qubit driven by spin-valley coupling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-orbit effects, inherent to electrons confined in quantum dots at a silicon heterointerface, provide a means to control electron spin qubits without the added complexity of on-chip, nanofabricated micromagnets or nearby coplanar striplines. Here, we demonstrate a singlet-triplet qubit operating mode that can drive qubit evolution at frequencies in excess of 200 MHz. This approach offers a means to electrically turn on and off fast control, while providing high logic gate orthogonality and long qubit dephasing times. We utilize this operational mode for dynamical decoupling experiments to probe the charge noise power spectrum in a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot. In addition, we assess qubit frequency drift over longer timescales to capture low-frequency noise. We present the charge noise power spectral density up to 3 MHz, which exhibits a 1/f(alpha) dependence consistent with alpha-0.7, over 9 orders of magnitude in noise frequency.

TI Chiral topological add-drop filter for integrated quantum photonic
   circuits
SO OPTICA
AB The integration of quantum emitters within topological nanophotonic devices enables the control of light-matter interactions at the single photon level. Here, we experimentally realize an integrated topological add-drop filter and observe multiport chiral emission from single photon emitters (quantum dots) embedded within the device. The filter is imprinted within a valley-Hall photonic crystal membrane and comprises a resonator evanescently coupled to a pair of access waveguides. We show that the longitudinal modes of the resonator enable the filter to perform wavelength-selective routing of light, protected by the underlying topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a quantum dot located at a chiral point in the resonator, selective coupling occurs between well-defined spin states and specific pairs of the filter output ports. The combination of multiport routing, allied with the inherent nonreciprocity of the device at the single photon level, presents opportunities for the formation of complex quantum optical devices, such as an on-chip quantum optical circulator.

TI Source monitoring twin-field quantum key distribution assisted with
   Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) can change the channel-loss dependence of key rates from O(eta) to O(root eta) and thus significantly increase the secure key rate compared with other existing quantum key distribution protocols. However, it does not take the source security into account in most present TF-QKD protocols. Here, we propose to employ the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference to characterize the source security, i.e., to use the interference visibility to quantify the information leakage from detectable side channels of sources. Furthermore, we establish a corresponding theoretical model and calculate the final key rate, by using the three-intensity decoy-state method and taking finite-data-size effects into account. Consequently, by employing our present scheme, the secure transmission distance can be longer than 100 km under current experimental conditions, significantly surpassing present device-independent QKD systems.

TI Quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics: A performance study on the
   spin-boson model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics simulations are traditionally based on implementing a Trotter approximation of the time-evolution operator. This approach typically relies on deep circuits and is therefore hampered by the substantial limitations of available noisy and near-term quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have become an indispensable alternative, enabling small-scale simulations on present-day hardware. However, despite the recent development of VQAs for quantum dynamics, a detailed assessment of their efficiency and scalability is yet to be presented. To fill this gap, we applied a VQA based on McLachlan's principle to simulate the dynamics of a spin-boson model subject to varying levels of realistic hardware noise as well as in different physical regimes, and discuss the algorithm's accuracy and scaling behavior as a function of system size. We observe a good performance of the variational approach used in combination with a general, physically motivated wave function ansatz, and compare it to the conventional first-order Trotter evolution. Finally, based on this, we make scaling predictions for the simulation of a classically intractable system. We show that, despite providing a clear reduction of quantum gate cost, the variational method in its current implementation is unlikely to lead to a quantum advantage for the solution of time-dependent problems.

TI Quantum Computing as a Game Changer on the Path towards a Net-Zero
   Economy: A Review of the Main Challenges in the Energy Domain
SO ENERGIES
AB The aim of this paper is to report on the state of the art of the literature on the most recent challenges in the energy domain that can be addressed through the use of quantum computing technology. More in detail, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the scope of the literature review considered in this paper is specifically limited to forecasting, grid management (namely, scheduling, dispatching, stability, and reliability), battery production, solar cell production, green hydrogen and ammonia production, and carbon capture. These challenges have been identified as the most relevant business needs currently expressed by energy companies on their path towards a net-zero economy. A critical discussion of the most relevant methodological approaches and experimental setups is provided, together with an overview of future research directions. Overall, the key finding of the paper, based on the proposed literature review, is twofold: namely, (1) quantum computing has the potential to trigger significant transformation in the energy domain by drastically reducing CO2 emissions, especially those relative to battery production, solar cell production, green hydrogen and ammonia production, as well as point-source and direct-air carbon capture technology; and (2) quantum computing offers enhanced optimization capability relative to relevant challenges that concern forecasting solar and wind resources, as well as managing power demand, facility allocation, and ensuring reliability and stability in power grids.

TI Optimal operation points for ultrafast, highly coherent Ge hole
   spin-orbit qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Strong spin-orbit interactions make hole quantum dots central to the quest for electrical spin qubit manipulation enabling fast, low-power, scalable quantum computation. Yet it is important to establish to what extent spin-orbit coupling exposes qubits to electrical noise, facilitating decoherence. Here, taking Ge as an example, we show that group IV gate-defined hole spin qubits generically exhibit optimal operation points, defined by the top gate electric field, at which they are both fast and long-lived: the dephasing rate vanishes to first order in the electric field noise along with all directions in space, the electron dipole spin resonance strength is maximized, while relaxation is drastically reduced at small magnetic fields. The existence of optimal operation points is traced to group IV crystal symmetry and properties of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction unique to spin-3/2 systems. Our results overturn the conventional wisdom that fast operation implies reduced lifetimes and suggest group IV hole spin qubits as ideal platforms for ultra-fast, highly coherent scalable quantum computing.

TI Low-Depth Unitary Coupled Cluster Theory for Quantum Computation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) approximation is one of the more promising wave function ansa''tzes for electronic structure calculations on quantum computers via the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. However, for large systems with many orbitals, the required number of UCC factors still leads to very deep quantumcircuits, which can be challenging to implement. Based on the observation that mostUCC amplitudes are small for both weakly correlated and strongly correlated molecules,we devise an algorithm that employs a Taylor expansion in the small amplitudes, tradingoffcircuit depth for extra measurements. Strong correlations can be taken into account by performing the expansion about a small set of UCC factors, which are treated exactly. Near equilibrium, the Taylor series expansion often works well without the need to include any exact factors; as the molecule is stretched and correlations increase, we find only a small number of factors need to be treated exactly

TI Quantum-classical separations in shallow-circuit-based learning with and
   without noises
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB An essential problem in quantum machine learning is to find quantum-classical separations between learning models. However, rigorous and unconditional separations are lacking for supervised learning. Here we construct a classification problem defined by a noiseless constant depth (i.e., shallow) quantum circuit and rigorously prove that any classical neural network with bounded connectivity requires logarithmic depth to output correctly with a larger-than-exponentially-small probability. This unconditional near-optimal quantum-classical representation power separation originates from the quantum nonlocality property that distinguishes quantum circuits from their classical counterparts. We further characterize the noise regimes for demonstrating such a separation on near-term quantum devices under the depolarization noise model. In addition, for quantum devices with constant noise strength, we prove that no super-polynomial classical-quantum separation exists for any classification task defined by Clifford circuits, independent of the structures of the circuits that specify the learning models.

TI Statistical approach to quantum phase estimation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce a new statistical and variational approach to the phase estimation algorithm (PEA). Unlike the traditional and iterative PEAs which return only an eigenphase estimate, the proposed method can determine any unknown eigenstate-eigenphase pair from a given unitary matrix utilizing a simplified version of the hardware intended for the iterative PEA (IPEA). This is achieved by treating the probabilistic output of an IPEA-like circuit as an eigenstate-eigenphase proximity metric, using this metric to estimate the proximity of the input state and input phase to the nearest eigenstate-eigenphase pair and approaching this pair via a variational process on the input state and phase. This method may search over the entire computational space, or can efficiently search for eigenphases (eigenstates) within some specified range (directions), allowing those with some prior knowledge of their system to search for particular solutions. We show the simulation results of the method with the Qiskit package on the IBM Q platform and on a local computer.

TI Naimark dilations of qubit POVMs and joint measurements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Measurement incompatibility is one of the cornerstones of quantum theory. This phenomenon appears in many forms, of which the concept of non-joint measurability has received considerable attention in the recent years. In order to characterise this non-classical phenomenon, various analytical and numerical methods have been developed. The analytical approaches have mostly concentrated on the qubit case, as well as to scenarios involving sets of measurements with symmetries, such as position and momentum or sets of mutually unbiased bases. The numerical methods can, in principle, decide any finite-dimensional and discrete joint measurability problem, but they naturally have practical limitations in terms of computational power. These methods exclusively start from a given set of measurements and ask whether the set possesses incompatibility. Here, we take a complementary approach by asking which measurements are compatible with a given measurement. It turns out, that this question can be answered in full generality through a minimal Naimark dilation of the given measurement: the set of interest is exactly those measurements that have a block-diagonal representation in such dilation. We demonstrate the use of the technique through various qubit examples, leading to an alternative characterisation of all compatible pairs of binary qubit measurements, which retrieves the celebrated Busch criterion. We further apply the technique to special examples of trinary and continuous qubit measurements.

TI Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Random Postselection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) can permit the superior security even with unknown devices. In practice, however, the realization of device-independent QKD is technically challenging because of its low noise tolerance. In the photonic setup, due to the limited detection efficiency, a large amount of the data generates from no-detection events which contain few correlations but contribute high errors. Here, we propose the device-independent QKD protocol with random postselection, where the secret keys are extracted only from the postselected subset of outcomes. This could not open the detection loophole as long as the entropy of the postselected subset is evaluated from the information of the entire set of data, including both detection and no-detection events. This postselection has the advantage to significantly reduce the error events, thus relaxing the threshold of required detection efficiency. In the model of collective attacks, our protocol can tolerate detector efficiency as low as 68.5%, which goes beyond standard security proofs. The results make a concrete step for the implementation of device independent QKD in practice.

TI Storing quantum information in a generalised Dicke model via a simple
   rotation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A method for storing quantum information is presented for three-level atomic systems interacting dipolarly with a single radiation field. The method involves performing simple local SU(2) rotations on the Hamiltonian. Under equal detuning, these transformations decouple one of the atomic levels from the electromagnetic field for the Lambda- and V-configurations, yielding two effective two-level systems (qubits) plus an isolated atomic level; this allows for the exchange of information between the qubits. This rotation preserves the quantum phase diagram of the system. The method could possibly be used as a means to manipulate quantum information, such as storage and retrieval, or communication via a transmission line.

TI Analysis of the Effects of the Two-Photon Temporal Distinguishability on
   Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) protects legitimate users from attacks on measurement devices. The decoy method allows for unconditionally secure quantum key generation using lasers. One of the most important issues in MDI-QKD is that photons from two independent lasers must be indistinguishable. Because Alice and Bob send Charlie laser pulses through separate fiber links, the arrival times of the pulses fluctuate independently. According to the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference at Charlie's relay, the time delay between two photons has the greatest effect on distinguishability. However, to date, these effects have not been analyzed. Our study uses simulations to investigate the effects of two-photon temporal distinguishability in terms of the visibility of the HOM-dip of two photons on the final key rate of finite-size MDI-QKD. Furthermore, an acceptable time delay range was estimated based on photons with Gaussian spectral amplitude functions.

TI High-Purity Single Photon Extraction from Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Centers in Low-Numerical-Aperture Optical Systems via Defect-Selective
   Metalens Printing
SO SMALL
AB Solid-state quantum emitters, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer a promising route toward scalable quantum technologies. However, their random spatial distribution and inherently broad dipole emission severely hinder high-purity single-photon extraction-particularly in low-numerical-aperture (NA) optical systems, which are essential for compact and scalable quantum photonic systems. Here, a defect-selective metalens integration approach is presented that allows precise and efficient single photon collection from individual NV centers, even under ultra-low-NA optical systems. Using an in situ transfer-printing process, high-purity silicon dioxide metalenses are stamped precisely and deterministically onto selected NV centers located 25 mu m below the diamond surface. This integration reshapes the broad dipolar emission of the targeted NV center into a tightly collimated, low-divergence beam, achieving a 40-fold enhancement in photon collection efficiency with an objective lens of NA = 0.07. Notably, emission is detected exclusively from metalens-coupled NV centers, effectively filtering out background noise from neighboring defects. Second-order correlation measurements yield g(()2())(0) = 0.04, unambiguously confirming the generation of high-purity single photons. This scalable, site-specific approach addresses key limitations in low-NA operation, opening the door to compact and fiber-integrated solid-state quantum photonics.

TI Molecular processes as quantum information resources
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In this contribution to Abraham Nitzan's Festschrift, we present a perspective of theoretical research over the years that has pointed to the potential of molecular processes to act as quantum information resources. Under appropriate control, homonuclear dimer (diatom) dissociation (half-collision) and the inverse process of atom-pair collisions are shown to reveal translational (EPR-like) entanglement that enables molecular wave packet teleportation. When such processes involve electronic-state excitation of the diatom, the fluorescence following dissociation can serve as an entanglement witness that unravels the molecular-state characteristics and evolution. Such entangling processes can also exhibit anomalous quantum thermodynamic features, particularly temperature enhancement of a cavity field that interacts with dissociated entangled diatoms.

TI Shared control of a 16?semiconductor quantum dot crossbar array
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The efficient control of a large number of qubits is one of the most challenging aspects for practical quantum computing. Current approaches in solid-state quantum technology are based on brute-force methods, where each and every qubit requires at least one unique control line-an approach that will become unsustainable when scaling to the required millions of qubits. Here, inspired by random-access architectures in classical electronics, we introduce the shared control of semiconductor quantum dots to efficiently operate a two-dimensional crossbar array in planar germanium. We tune the entire array, comprising 16 quantum dots, to the few-hole regime. We then confine an odd number of holes in each site to isolate an unpaired spin per dot. Moving forward, we demonstrate on a vertical and a horizontal double quantum dot a method for the selective control of the interdot coupling and achieve a tunnel coupling tunability over more than 10 GHz. The operation of a quantum electronic device with fewer control terminals than tunable experimental parameters represents a compelling step forward in the construction of scalable quantum technology.
   An efficient control strategy is designed for quantum dot arrays, drawing inspiration from classical semiconductor technology. A two-dimensional array of 16 semiconductor quantum dots is operated using only a few shared control lines.

TI Zero-temperature entanglement membranes in quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In chaotic quantum systems, the entanglement of a region A can be described in terms of the surface tension of a spacetime membrane pinned to the boundary of A. Here, we interpret the tension of this entanglement membrane in terms of the rate at which information "flows" across it. For any orientation of the membrane, one can define (generically nonunitary) dynamics across the membrane; we explore this dynamics in various spacetime translation-invariant (STTI) stabilizer circuits in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that the flux of information across the membrane in these STTI circuits reaches a steady state. In the cases where this dynamics is nonunitary and the steady-state flux is nonzero, this occurs because the dynamics across the membrane is unitary in a subspace of extensive entropy. This generalized unitarity is present in a broad class of STTI stabilizer circuits and is also present in some special nonstabilizer models. The existence of multiple unitary (or generalized unitary) directions forces the entanglement membrane tension to be a piecewise linear function of the orientation of the membrane; in this respect, the entanglement membrane behaves like an interface in a zero-temperature classical lattice model. We argue that entanglement membranes in random stabilizer circuits that produce volume-law entanglement are also effectively at zero temperature.

TI Multi-User Distillation of Common Randomness and Entanglement From
   Quantum States
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We construct new protocols for the tasks of converting noisy multipartite quantum correlations into noiseless classical and quantum ones using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The former task is known as common randomness (CR) distillation, and it requires offsetting the amount of classical communication against the randomness created. We obtain a new lower bound on the "distillable common randomness," an operational measure of the total genuine (classical) correlations in a quantum state. Our proof relies on a generalization of communication for omniscience (CO) [Csiszar and Narayan, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 50:3047-3061, 2004], and our contribution here is a novel simultaneous decoder for the compression of correlated classical sources by random binning with quantum side information at the decoder. For the latter task, we derive two lower bounds on the rate at which Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be asymptotically distilled from any given pure state under LOCC. Our approach consists in "making coherent" the proposed CR distillation protocols and recycling of resources [Devetak et al. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 54(10):4587-4618, 2008]. The first lower bound is identical to a recent result by Vrana and Christandl [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65(9):5945-5958, 2019], which is based on a combinatorial method to achieve the same rate. Our second lower bound generalises and improves upon this result, and unifies a number of other known lower bounds on GHZ distillation.

TI Quantum spectral clustering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spectral clustering is a powerful unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data with nonconvex or nested structures [A. Y. Ng, M. I. Jordan, and Y. Weiss, On spectral clustering: Analysis and an algorithm, in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 14: Proceedings of the 2001 Conference (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2002), pp. 849-856]. With roots in graph theory, it uses the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix to project the data in a low-dimensional space where clustering is more efficient. Despite its success in clustering tasks, spectral clustering suffers in practice from a fast-growing running time of O(n(3)), where n is the number of points in the data set. In this work we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm performing spectral clustering, extending a number of works in quantum machine learning. The quantum algorithm is composed of two parts: the first is the efficient creation of the quantum state corresponding to the projected Laplacian matrix, and the second consists of applying the existing quantum analog of the k-means algorithm [I. Kerenidis, J. Landman, A. Luongo, and A. Prakash, q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32: Proceedings of the 2019 Conference (Curran Associates, Red Hook, NY, 2020), pp. 4136-4146]. Both steps depend polynomially on the number of clusters, as well as precision and data parameters arising from quantum procedures, and polylogarithmically on the dimension of the input vectors. Our numerical simulations show an asymptotic linear growth with n when all terms are taken into account, significantly better than the classical cubic growth. This work opens the path to other graph-based quantum machine learning algorithms, as it provides routines for efficient computation and quantum access to the incidence, adjacency, and projected Laplacian matrices of a graph.

TI Verifying the analogy between transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems and
   inductively-coupled fluxoniums
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin- 1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two-qubit circuit. Such a mode has a minor effect on the present device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future multi-qubit designs.

TI Magic State Injection with Erasure Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Erasure qubits constitute a promising approach for tackling the daunting resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By heralding of erasure errors, both the error-correction threshold and the sub-threshold scaling of the logical error rate are significantly improved. While previous research has focused primarily on fault-tolerant quantum memories, we extend this investigation to magic state injection-a critical yet resource-intensive component of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that, after postselection on erasures, the logical error rate of the injected magic state is set by the residual Pauli error, while the space-time overhead is only marginally increased as compared with the case of non-erasure qubits with a similar noise strength. These conclusions hold both for injection into the surface code and for injection and cultivation on the color code. For the former, we show that most of the gains can be achieved by the use of just three strategically placed erasure qubits in the surface code patch, independent of the patch size. For the latter, in contrast, it is beneficial to have all the qubits in the cultivation patch be erasure qubits. Our results for cultivation suggest that algorithmically relevant logical error rates may be within reach without magic state distillation for erasure rates less than or similar to 4 x10(-3) and residual Pauli error rates of similar to 10(-4).

TI Experimental demonstration of high-speed continuous variable quantum key
   distribution enhanced by phase-sensitive amplifier
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The type of system employing continuous variables, such as light field quadrature for signal modulation, is an important branch for quantum key distribution. Achieving a high key rate using quantum key distribution technology is beneficial for realizing more frequent key updates or enabling one-time pad encryption for high-speed communication tasks. However, the deficiencies of typical large-bandwidth balanced photodetectors prevent the continuous variable quantum key distribution from matching the speed of state-of-the-art classical optical communications. Previous attempts to improve the key rate have focused on designing and manufacturing high-speed balanced photodetectors. It is well known that phase-sensitive amplifiers also improve the performance of balanced photodetectors and thus the performance of key distribution, but the concept remains purely theoretical. Here, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate a high-speed continuous-variable quantum key distribution operating with a 10 GHz balanced photodetector enhanced by phase-sensitive amplification and detection. A conjugated multi-mode continuous variable protocol is used to accommodate the phase-sensitive operations. The optical amplifier offers a 10 dB increase in the photodetector's clearance (quantum noise over electrical noise) and improves the detection efficiency from 72% to 96%, thus enabling an overall 248.9 Mb/s key distribution rate through a 16.7 km field-deployed optical fiber.

TI Bidirectional field-steering and atomic steering induced by a magnon
   mode in a qubit-photon system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper investigates the cavity-magnon steering and qubit-qubit steering of a hybrid quantum system consisting of a single-mode magnon, a two-qubit state, and a single-mode cavity field in the presence of their damping rates. The temporal wave vector of the system is obtained for the initial maximally entangled two-qubit state and initial vacuum state of the magnon and cavity modes. Additionally, the mathematical inequalities for obtaining the cavity-magnon steering and qubit-qubit steering are introduced. The findings reveal that steering between the magnon and cavity is asymmetric, while steering between the two qubits is symmetric in our system. Increasing the atom-field coupling improves steering from magnon to field, while reducing steering between the two qubits. Moreover, increasing magnon-field coupling enhances and elevates the lower bounds of qubit-qubit steering. Further, adding the damping rates causes deterioration of the cavity-magnon steering and qubit-qubit steering. However, the steering persistence is slightly greater when damping originates from the cavity field rather than the magnon modes based on the coupling parameters.

TI Generalized quantum Arimoto-Blahut algorithm and its application to
   quantum information bottleneck
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information bottleneck was proposed by Grimsmo and Still (2016 Phys. Rev. A 94 012338) as a promising method for quantum supervised machine learning. To study this method, we generalize the quantum Arimoto-Blahut algorithm by Ramakrishnan et al (2021 IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 67 946) to a function defined over a set of density matrices with linear constraints so that our algorithm can be applied to optimizations of quantum operations. This algorithm has wider applicability, and we apply our algorithm to the quantum information bottleneck with three quantum systems. We numerically compare our obtained algorithm with the existing algorithm by Grimsmo and Still. Our numerical analysis shows that our algorithm is better than their algorithm.

TI Enhanced quantum sensing with hybrid exceptional-diabolic singularities
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ultimate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling.

TI Quantum dueling: an efficient solution for combinatorial optimization
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper, we present a new algorithm for generic combinatorial optimization, which we term quantum dueling. Traditionally, potential solutions to the given optimization problems were encoded in a 'register' of qubits. Various techniques are used to increase the probability of finding the best solution upon measurement. Quantum dueling innovates by integrating an additional qubit register, effectively creating a 'dueling' scenario where two sets of solutions compete. This dual-register setup allows for a dynamic amplification process: in each iteration, one register is designated as the 'opponent,' against which the other register's more favorable solutions are enhanced through a controlled quantum search. This iterative process gradually steers the quantum state within both registers toward the optimal solution. With a quantitative contraction for the evolution of the state vector, classical simulation under a broad range of scenarios and hyper-parameter selection schemes shows that a quadratic speedup is achieved, which is further tested in more real-world situations. In addition, quantum dueling can be generalized to incorporate arbitrary quantum search techniques and as a quantum subroutine within a higher-level algorithm. Our work demonstrates that increasing the number of qubits allows the development of previously unthought-of algorithms, paving the way for advancement of efficient quantum algorithm design.

TI Ultrasensitive Calorimetric Detection of Single Photons from Qubit Decay
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We describe a qubit linearly coupled to a heat bath, either directly or via a cavity. The main focus of the paper is on calorimetric detection in a realistic circuit, specifically a solid-state qubit coupled to a resistor as an absorber. The bath in the model is formed of oscillators initially in the ground state with a distribution of energies and coupling strengths. A direct numerical solution of the Schrodinger equation for the full system including up to 106 oscillators in the bath verifies the expected decay process. We address quantitatively the question of separation of the qubit and bath by adding a cavity in between which by detuning allows one to adjust the decay rate into a convenient regime for detection purposes. Most importantly, we propose splitting a quantum to two uncoupled baths and performing a cross-correlation measurement of their temperatures. This technique enhances significantly the signal-to-noise ratio of the calorimeter.

TI Observation of Josephson harmonics in tunnel junctions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Approaches to developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art superconducting qubits employ aluminium oxide (AlOx) tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations. Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized, purely sinusoidal current-phase relation. However, this relation is expected to hold only in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlOx barrier. Here we show that the standard current-phase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunnelling through an inhomogeneous AlOx barrier predicts percent-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlOx-based quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude while preserving their anharmonicity.
   The standard current-phase relation in tunnel Josephson junctions involves a single sinusoidal term, but real junctions are more complicated. The effects of higher Josephson harmonics have now been identified in superconducting qubit devices.

TI On the Security of Offloading Post-Processing for Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been researched for almost four decades and is currently making its way to commercial applications. However, deployment of the technology at scale is challenging because of the very particular nature of QKD and its physical limitations. Among other issues, QKD is computationally intensive in the post-processing phase, and devices are therefore complex and power hungry, which leads to problems in certain application scenarios. In this work, we study the possibility to offload computationally intensive parts in the QKD post-processing stack in a secure way to untrusted hardware. We show how error correction can be securely offloaded for discrete-variable QKD to a single untrusted server and that the same method cannot be used for long-distance continuous-variable QKD. Furthermore, we analyze possibilities for multi-server protocols to be used for error correction and privacy amplification. Even in cases where it is not possible to offload to an external server, being able to delegate computation to untrusted hardware components on the device itself could improve the cost and certification effort for device manufacturers.

TI Quantum simulation of weak-field light-matter interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulation of the interaction of light with matter, including at the few-photon level, is important for un-derstanding the optical and optoelectronic properties of materials and for modeling next-generation nonlinear spectroscopies that use entangled light. At the few-photon level the quantum properties of the electromagnetic field must be accounted for with a quantized treatment of the field, and then such simulations quickly become intractable, especially if the matter subsystem must be modeled with a large number of degrees of freedom, as can be required to accurately capture many-body effects and quantum noise sources. Motivated by this we develop a quantum simulation framework for simulating such light-matter interactions on platforms with controllable bosonic degrees of freedom, such as vibrational modes in the trapped ion platform. The key innovation in our work is a scheme for simulating interactions with a continuum field using only a few discrete bosonic modes, which is enabled by a Green's function (response function) formalism. We develop the simulation approach, sketch how the simulation can be performed using trapped ions, and then illustrate the method with numerical examples. Our work expands the reach of quantum simulation to important light-matter interaction models and illustrates the advantages of extracting dynamical quantities such as response functions from quantum simulations.

TI Simulating noise on a quantum processor: interactions between a qubit
   and resonant two-level system bath
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Material defects fundamentally limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits, and manufacturing completely defect-free devices is not yet possible. Therefore, understanding the interactions between defects and a qubit in a real quantum processor design is essential. We build a model that incorporates the standard tunneling model, the electric field distributions in the qubit, and open quantum system dynamics, and draws from the current understanding of two-level system (TLS) theory. Specifically, we start with one million TLSs distributed on the surface of a qubit and pick the 200 systems that are most strongly coupled to the qubit. We then perform a full Lindbladian simulation that explicitly includes the coherent coupling between the qubit and the TLS bath to model the time dependent density matrix of resonant TLS defects and the qubit. We find that the 200 most strongly coupled TLSs can accurately describe the qubit energy relaxation time. This work confirms that resonant TLSs located in areas where the electric field is strong can significantly affect the qubit relaxation time, even if they are located far from the Josephson junction (JJ). Similarly, a strongly-coupled resonant TLS located in the JJ does not guarantee a reduced qubit relaxation time if a more strongly coupled TLS is far from the JJ. In addition to the coupling strengths between TLSs and the qubit, the model predicts that the geometry of the device and the TLS relaxation time play a significant role in qubit dynamics. Our work can provide guidance for future quantum processor designs with improved qubit coherence times.

TI Theory of Communication Efficient Quantum Secret Sharing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB A ((k, n)) quantum threshold secret sharing (QTS) scheme is a quantum cryptographic protocol for sharing a quantum secret among n parties such that the secret can be recovered by any k or more parties while k-1 or fewer parties have no information about the secret. Despite extensive research on these schemes, there has been very little study on optimizing the quantum communication cost during recovery. Recently, we initiated the study of communication efficient quantum threshold secret sharing (CE-QTS) schemes. These schemes reduce the communication complexity in QTS schemes by accessing d > k parties for recovery; here d is fixed ahead of encoding the secret. In contrast to the standard QTS schemes which require k qudits for recovering each qudit in the secret, these schemes have a lower communication cost of d/d-k+1. In this paper, we further develop the theory of communication efficient quantum threshold schemes. Here, we propose universal CE-QTS schemes which reduce the communication cost for all d > k simultaneously. We provide a framework based on ramp quantum secret sharing to construct CE-QTS and universal CE-QTS schemes. We give another construction for universal CE-QTS schemes based on Staircase codes. We derived a lower bound on communication complexity and show that our constructions are optimal. Finally, an information theoretic model is developed to analyse CE-QTS schemes and the lower bound on communication complexity is proved again using this model.

TI Sharing quantum steering among multiple Alices and Bobs via a two-qubit
   Werner state
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum steering, a type of quantum correlation with unique asymmetry, has important applications in asymmetric quantum information tasks. We consider a new quantum steering scenario in which one half of a two-qubit Werner state is sequentially measured by multiple Alices and the other half by multiple Bobs. We find that the maximum number of Alices who can share steering with a single Bob increases from 2 to 5 when the number of measurement settings N increases from 2 to 16. Furthermore, we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that for a fixed N, at most 2 Alices can share steering with 2 Bobs, while 4 or more Alices are allowed to share steering with a single Bob. We further analyze the robustness of the steering sharing by calculating the required purity of the initial Werner state, the lower bound of which varies from 0.503(1) to 0.979(5). Finally, we show that our both-sides sequential steering sharing scheme can be applied to control the steering ability, even the steering direction, if an initial asymmetric state or asymmetric measurement is adopted. Our work gives insights into the diversity of steering sharing and can be extended to study the problems such as genuine multipartite quantum steering when the sequential unsharp measurement is applied.

TI Robust and bright polarization-entangled photon sources exploiting
   non-critical phase matching without periodic poling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entangled photon sources are essential for quantum information applications, including quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. Periodically poled (PP) crystals are commonly used to generate bright photon sources through quasi-phase matching. However, fabricating uniform micron-scale periodic structures poses significant technical difficulties, typically limiting the crystal thickness to less than a millimeter. Here, we adopt non-critical phase matching to produce a robust and bright polarization-entangled photon source based on a bulk KTP crystal located in a Sagnac interferometer. This method is tolerant to variations in pump incidence angles and temperature, and theoretically offers about a 2.5-fold brightness enhancement compared to quasi-phase matching at a specific wavelength. Additionally, the absence of periodic poling allows for a larger crystal cross-section. Using a bulk KTP crystal without a PP structure, we experimentally produce the four Bell states with a brightness of 25.1 kHz/mW at a wavelength of 1079 nm, achieving purity, concurrence, and fidelity values close to 0.99. We believe our scheme will serve as a key building block for scalable and practical photonic quantum information applications.

TI Floquet geometric entangling gates in ground-state manifolds of Rydberg
   atoms
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose new applications of Floquet theory in Rydberg atoms for constructing quantum entangling gates in atomic ground-state manifolds. By dynamically periodically modulating the Rabi frequencies of transitions between ground and Rydberg states of atoms, error-resilient two-qubit entangling gates can be implemented in the regime of Rydberg blockade. According to different degrees of Floquet theory utilization, the fidelity of the resulting controlled gates surpasses that of the original reference, and it exhibits high robustness against Rabi error in two qubits and detuning error in the control qubit. Our method only uses encoding in the ground states, and compared to the original scheme using Rydberg state for encoding, it is less susceptible to environmental interference, making it more practical to implement. Therefore, our approach may have broader applications or potential for further expansion of geometric quantum computation with neutral atoms.

TI Learning quantum Hamiltonians from single-qubit measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the Hamiltonian-based quantum dynamics, to estimate Hamiltonians from the measured data is a vital topic. In this work, we propose a recurrent neural network to learn the target Hamiltonians from the temporal records of single-qubit measurements, which does not require the ground states and only measures single-qubit observables. It is applicable on both time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonians and can simultaneously capture the magnitude and sign of Hamiltonian parameters. Taking the Hamiltonians with the nearest-neighbor interactions as numerical examples, we trained our recurrent neural networks to learn different types of Hamiltonians with high accuracy. The study also shows that our method has good robustness against the measurement noise and decoherence effect. Therefore, it has widespread applications in estimating the parameters of quantum devices and characterizing the Hamiltonian-based quantum dynamics.

TI Single-photon emitters in PECVD-grown silicon nitride films: from
   material growth to photophysical properties
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Silicon nitride (SiN) is a key material for quantum photonics due to its wide transparency window, high refractive index, low optical losses, and semiconductor foundry compatibility. We study the formation of single-photon emitters in SiN films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), exploring their photophysical properties and dependence on growth conditions. Emitters were observed across the entire range of nitrogen-to-silicon precursor ratios, from silicon-rich to nitrogen-rich conditions, enabled by the low background fluorescence. We demonstrate single-photon emitters in SiN films with a higher refractive index (1.8-1.9) compared to our previous reports (similar to 1.7). Notably, nitrogen-rich, thinner films yield particularly bright emitters with shorter emission lifetimes, likely due to more efficient annealing. Silicon-rich SiN films exhibit red-shifted emission, suggesting that composition may provide a mechanism for wavelength tuning. These findings establish the feasibility of emitters formation in foundry standard PECVD tools, advancing the scalability and lab-to-fab transition of SiN-based quantum photonic technologies.

TI Constant-time quantum algorithm for homology detection in closed curves
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Given a loop or more generally 1-cycle r of size L on a closed two-dimensional manifold or surface, represented by a triangulated mesh, a question in computational topology asks whether or not it is homologous to zero. We frame and tackle this problem in the quantum setting. Given an oracle that one can use to query the inclusion of edges on a closed curve, we design a quantum algorithm for such a homology detection with a constant running time, with respect to the size or the number of edges on the loop r, requiring only a single usage of oracle. In contrast, classical algorithm requires & OHM;(L) oracle usage, followed by a linear time processing and can be improved to logarithmic by using a parallel algorithm. Our quantum algorithm can be extended to check whether two closed loops belong to the same homology class. Furthermore, it can be applied to a specific problem in the homotopy detection, namely, checking whether two curves are not homotopically equivalent on a closed two-dimensional manifold.

TI Experimental Side Channel Analysis of BB84 QKD Source
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB A typical implementation of BB84 protocol for quantum communication uses four laser diodes for transmitting weak coherent pulses, which may not have the same characteristics. We have characterized these lasers for mismatch in various parameters such as spectral width, pulse width, spatial mode, peak wavelength, polarization and their arrival times at the receiver. This information is utilized to calculate possible information leakage through side channel attacks by evaluating mutual information between source and eavesdropper. Based on our experimental observations of cross correlation between parameter values for different laser diodes, we suggest methods to reduce information leakage to Eve.

TI Overcoming Intensity Limits for Long-Distance Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables the sharing of cryptographic keys secured by quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol assumes single-photon sources, but practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to Photon-Number-Splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-L & uuml;tkenhaus-Preskill (GLLP) framework addresses these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds under limited PNS scenarios. The decoy-state protocol further improves performance by refining single-photon yield estimates, but still considers multi-photon states as insecure, thereby limiting intensities and constraining key rate and distance. More recently, finite-key security bounds for decoy-state QKD have been extended to address general attacks, ensuring security against adversaries capable of exploiting arbitrary strategies. In this work, we focus on a specific class of attacks, the generalized PNS attack, and demonstrate that higher pulse intensities can be securely used by employing Bayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed data. By raising the pulse intensity to 10 photons, we achieve a 50-fold increase in key rate and a 62.2% increase in operational range (about 200 km) compared to the decoy-state protocol. Furthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and reveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that may produce erroneous key-rate estimates. While this methodology does not address all possible attacks, it provides a new approach to security proofs in QKD by shifting from worst-case assumption analysis to observation-dependent inference, advancing the reach and efficiency of discrete-variable QKD protocols.

AB A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any classical circuit.
   In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum program, consisting of a quantum circuit C with a classical description and an auxiliary quantum state vertical bar psi , into a functionally-equivalent obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about C and vertical bar psi . We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly) deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability obfuscation for classical circuits.
   Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle, but leave the existence of a concrete real-world candidate as an open problem. Indeed, our quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first candidate realization of a best-possible copy-protection scheme for all polynomial-time functionalities.
   Our techniques deviate significantly from previous works on quantum obfuscation. We develop several novel technical tools which we expect to be broadly useful in quantum cryptography. These tools include a publicly-verifiable, linearly-homomorphic quantum authentication scheme with classically-decodable ZX measurements (which we build from coset states), and a method for compiling any quantum circuit into a linear + measurement () quantum program: an alternating sequence of CNOT operations and partial ZX measurements.

TI Accurate and Efficient Quantum Computations of Molecular Properties
   Using Daubechies Wavelet Molecular Orbitals: A Benchmark Study against
   Experimental Data
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Although quantum computation is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more quantum bits (qubits) and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make quantum computation practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus can not provide useful predictions. Herein, we propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for quantum computations of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H-2 and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient quantum computations of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose to adopt redundant space such as polarization mode in the sending-or-not-sending twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) in the Fock space. With the help of redundant space such as photon polarization, we can postselect events according to the outcome of the observation to the additional quantity. This compresses the bit-flip error rate in the postselected events of the SNS protocol. The calculation shows that the method using redundant space can greatly improve the performance in practical TF-QKD, especially when the total number of pulses is small.

TI State Preparation of Antisymmetrized Geminal Power on a Quantum Computer

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB The antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) is equivalent to the number projected Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (PBCS) wave function. It is also an elementary symmetric polynomial (ESP) state. We generalize previous research on deterministically implementing the Dicke state to a state preparation algorithm for an ESP state, or equivalently AGP, on a quantum computer. Our method is deterministic and has polynomial cost, and it does not rely on number symmetry breaking and restoration. We also show that our circuit is equivalent to a disentangled unitary paired coupled cluster operator and a layer of unitary Jastrow operator acting on a single Slater determinant. The method presented herein highlights the ability of disentangled unitary coupled cluster to capture nontrivial entanglement properties that are hardly accessible with traditional Hartree-Fock based electronic structure methods.

TI Efficient reconciliation of continuous variable quantum key distribution
   with multiplicatively repeated non-binary LDPC codes
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$(2, k)$\end{document}-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.

TI Active Learning in Physics: From 101, to Progress, and Perspective
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Active learning (AL) is a family of machine learning (ML) algorithms that predates the current era of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional approaches that require labeled samples for training, AL iteratively selects unlabeled samples to be annotated by an expert. This protocol aims to prioritize the most informative samples, leading to improved model performance compared to training with all labeled samples. In recent years, AL has gained increasing attention, particularly in the field of physics. This paper presents a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the theory of AL reviewing the latest advancements across various domains. Additionally, the potential integration of AL is explored with quantum ML, envisioning a synergistic fusion of these two fields rather than viewing AL as a mere extension of classical ML into the quantum realm.
   In this review, the concept of active learning is introduced to the physicists at the level of beginner without requirement on background in machine learning. It includes most of the latest applications of active learning in branches of physics, covering but not being limited to quantum information, high energy physics, and condensed matter physics. It also presents the author's perspective on extending the concept in quantum machine learning as a promising interdisciplinary fieldimage.

TI Probing Geometric Excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall States on
   Quantum Computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Intermediate-scale quantum technologies provide new opportunities for scientific discovery, yet they also pose the challenge of identifying suitable problems that can take advantage of such devices in spite of their present-day limitations. In solid-state materials, fractional quantum Hall phases continue to attract attention as hosts of emergent geometrical excitations analogous to gravitons, resulting from the nonperturbative interactions between the electrons. However, the direct observation of such excitations remains a challenge. Here, we identify a quasi-one-dimensional model that captures the geometric properties and graviton dynamics of fractional quantum Hall states. We then simulate geometric quench and the subsequent graviton dynamics on the IBM quantum computer using an optimally compiled Trotter circuit with bespoke error mitigation. Moreover, we develop an efficient, optimal-control-based variational quantum algorithm that can efficiently simulate graviton dynamics in larger systems. Our results open a new avenue for studying the emergence of gravitons in a new class of tractable models on the existing quantum hardware.

TI Swap-test interferometry with biased qubit noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a powerful device for detecting small phase shifts between two light beams. Simple input states, such as coherent states or single photons, can reach the standard quantum limit of phase estimation, while more complex states can be used to reach Heisenberg scaling; the latter, however, require challenging preparation and measurement strategies. The quest for highly sensitive phase estimation therefore calls for interferometers with nonlinear devices which would make the preparation of these complex states more efficient. Here, we show that the Heisenberg scaling can be recovered with simple input states (including Fock and coherent states) when the linear mirrors in the interferometer are replaced with controlled-swap gates and measurements on auxiliary qubits. These swap tests project the input Fock and coherent states onto NOON and entangled coherent states, respectively, and allow optimal or near-optimal measurements, leading to improved sensitivity to small phase shifts in one of the interferometer arms. We analyze auxiliary qubit errors in detail, showing that biasing the qubit towards phase flips offers a great advantage, and perform thorough numerical simulations of a possible implementation in circuit quantum electrodynamics with an auxiliary Kerr-cat qubit. Our results thus present a viable approach to phase estimation approaching Heisenberg-limited sensitivity and demonstrate potential advantages of using biased-noise qubits in quantum metrology.

TI Performance Analysis and Improvement for Optical Amplifiers in Quantum
   Key Distribution over Satellite-Ground Links
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB The study investigates the enhancement of quantum key rate in discrete-modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution (DM-CV-QKD) systems over satellite-ground links through the use of optical amplifiers, and its impact on system security. Simulation analysis reveals that optical amplifiers can significantly boost the quantum key rate for short-distance communication. Although 4-ary QKD and 8-ary QKD protocols effectively improve key rate in this scenario, their relatively large degradation regions fail to cover the secure communication distance between satellites and the ground, resulting in a limited secure communication range. To break through this limitation, a novel 16-ary double-ring modulation scheme for DM-CV-QKD is introduced, which effectively reduces the degradation region and enhances the overall system reliability, thereby significantly improving both the key rate and secure communication distance. Finally, the study also analyzes the effects of factors such as turbulence strength, optical wavelength, and horizontal elevation angle on system performance. The results show that under strong turbulence conditions, the Gaussian modulation and the 16-ary double-ring modulation scheme can still effectively improve signal quality with optical amplifiers, and their enhancement region can cover the operational range of low-earth orbit satellites, demonstrating their application value and significance in complex environments.

TI Interplay between dressed and strong-axial-field states in nitrogen
   vacancy centers for quantum sensing and computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing, and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground-state manifold's degeneracy (S = 1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial-field states. Conversely, in some experiments, a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonally to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial-field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial-field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of free induction decay (FID) measurements performed on an NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial-field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight into coherence time, nuclear spin, and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically sensitive and insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.

TI Measurement device-independent quantum key distribution with vector
   vortex modes under diverse weather conditions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Most quantum key distribution schemes exploiting orbital angular momentum-carrying optical beams are based on conventional set-ups, opening up the possibility of detector side-channel attacks. These optical beams also suffer from spatial aberrations due to atmospheric turbulence and unfavorable weather conditions. Consequently, we introduce a measurement device-independent quantum key distribution implemented with vector vortex modes. We study the transmission of vector vortex and scalar beams through a turbulent atmospheric link under diverse weather conditions such as rain or haze. We demonstrate that a maximum secure key transmission distance of 178 km can be achieved under clear conditions by utilizing the vector vortex beams, which have been mainly ignored in the literature. When raindrops have a diameter of 6 mm and fog particles have a radius of 0.5 mu m, the signals can reach 152 km and 160 km, respectively. Since these distances are comparable, this work sheds light into the feasibility of implementing measurement device-independent quantum key distribution using vector vortex modes under diverse weather conditions. Most significantly, this opens the door to practical secure quantum communications.

TI Kink Dynamics and Quantum Simulation of Supersymmetric Lattice
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a quantum simulation of a supersymmetric lattice model using atoms trapped in a 1D configuration and interacting through a Rydberg dressed potential. The elementary excitations in the model are kinks or (in a sector with one extra particle) their superpartners-the skinks. The two are connected by supersymmetry and display identical quantum dynamics. We provide an analytical description of the kink (skink) quench dynamics and propose a protocol to prepare and detect these excitations in the quantum simulator. We make a detailed analysis, based on numerical simulation, of the Rydberg atom simulator and show that it accurately tracks the dynamics of the supersymmetric model.

TI iSWAP-type geometric gates induced by paths on the Schmidt sphere
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose i SWAP-type quantum gates based on geometric phases purely associated with paths on the Schmidt sphere [Phys. Rev. A 62 , 022109 (2000)]. These geometric Schmidt gates can entangle qubit pairs to an arbitrary degree; in particular, they can create maximally entangled states from product states by an appropriate choice of base point on the Schmidt sphere. We identify Hamiltonians that generate pure paths on the Schmidt sphere by reverse engineering and demonstrate explicitly that the resulting Hamiltonians can be implemented in systems of transmon qubits. The geometric Schmidt gates are characterized by vanishing dynamical phases and are complementary to geometric single-qubit gates that take place on the Bloch sphere.

TI Quantum Sensing in Tweezer Arrays: Optical Magnetometry on an
   Individual-Atom Sensor Grid
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We implement a scalable platform for quantum sensing comprising hundreds of sites capable of holding individual laser-cooled atoms and demonstrate the applicability of this single-quantum-system sensor array to magnetic field mapping on a two-dimensional grid. With each atom being confined in an optical tweezer within an area of 0.5 mu m2 at mutual separations of 7.0(2) mu m, we obtain micrometer-scale spatial resolution and highly parallelized operation. An additional steerable optical tweezer allows rearrangement of atoms within the grid and enables single-atom scanning microscopy with submicron resolution. This individual-atom sensor platform finds an immediate application in mapping an externally applied dc gradient magnetic field. In a Ramsey-type measurement, we obtain a field resolution of 98(29) nT. We estimate the sensitivity to be 25 mu T/root Hz.

TI Enhancing nonclassical bosonic correlations in a quantum walk network
   through experimental control of disorder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The presence of disorder and inhomogeneities in quantum networks has often been unexpectedly beneficial for both quantum and classical resources. Here we experimentally realize a controllable inhomogenous quantum walk (QW) dynamics, which can be exploited to investigate the effect of coherent disorder on the quantum correlations between two indistinguishable photons. Through the imposition of suitable disorder configurations, we observe two-photon states that exhibit an enhancement in the quantum correlations between two selected modes of the network, compared to the case of an ordered QW. Different configurations of disorder can steer the system toward different realizations of such an enhancement, thus allowing spatial and temporal manipulation of quantum correlations between remote modes of QW networks.

TI Efficient quantum simulation of open quantum system dynamics on noisy
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum simulation represents the most promising quantum application to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, yet available quantum simulation algorithms are prone to errors and thus difficult to realize with limited circuit depth on nowadays quantum devices. Herein, we propose a novel scheme to utilize intrinsic gate errors of NISQ devices to enable controllable simulation of open quantum system dynamics without ancillary qubits or explicit bath engineering, thus turning unwanted quantum noises into useful quantum resources. Specifically, we simulate the energy transfer process in a photosynthetic dimer system on IBM-Q cloud. By employing tailored decoherence-inducing gates, we show that quantum dissipative dynamics can be simulated efficiently across coherent-to-incoherent regimes with results comparable to those of the numerically exact classical method. Moreover, we demonstrate a calibration routine that enables consistent and predictive simulations of open-quantum system dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime. This work provides a new direction for quantum advantage in the NISQ era.

TI Landauer principle and thermodynamics of computation
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the LB, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture

TI Loss control-based QKD with noisy devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum cryptography protocols aimed at providing communication security are based on the fundamental principle of quantum physics that non-orthogonal quantum states cannot be perfectly distinguished. The majority of practically applicable quantum cryptography realizations belong to the so-called device-dependent class of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security of the device-dependent protocols cannot be ensured without considering all the noises in the incorporated devices. Here, we analyze the influence of the preparation and detection noise on the loss control-based QKD that is built on continuous monitoring of the leakages in the fiber channel. By estimating the achievable secret key generation rates, we show the robustness of the loss control approach to trusted preparation and detection noises. Our findings demonstrate a positive impact of the trusted preparation noise on the QKD based on loss control for reverse and direct reconciliation scenarios.

TI Learning reduced representations for quantum classifiers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.

TI Spacetime Path Integrals for Entangled States
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB Although the path-integral formalism is known to be equivalent to conventional quantum mechanics, it is not generally obvious how to implement path-based calculations for multi-qubit entangled states. Whether one takes the formal view of entangled states as entities in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, or the intuitive view of these states as a connection between distant spatial configurations, it may not even be obvious that a path-based calculation can be achieved using only paths in ordinary space and time. Previous work has shown how to do this for certain special states; this paper extends those results to all pure two-qubit states, where each qubit can be measured in an arbitrary basis. Certain three-qubit states are also developed, and path integrals again reproduce the usual correlations. These results should allow for a substantial amount of conventional quantum analysis to be translated over into a path-integral perspective, simplifying certain calculations, and more generally informing research in quantum foundations.

TI Domain-specific compilers for dynamic simulations of quantum materials
   on quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulation of the dynamics of quantum materials is emerging as a promising scientific application for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Due to their high gate-error rates and short decoherence times, however, NISQ computers can only produce high-fidelity results for those quantum circuits smaller than some given circuit size. Dynamic simulations, therefore, pose a challenge as current algorithms produce circuits that grow in size with each subsequent time-step of the simulation. This underscores the crucial role of quantum circuit compilers to produce executable quantum circuits of minimal size, thereby maximizing the range of physical phenomena that can be studied within the NISQ fidelity budget. Here, we present two domain-specific (DS) quantum circuit compilers for the Rigetti and IBM quantum computers, specifically designed to compile circuits simulating dynamics under a special class of time-dependent Hamiltonians. The compilers outperform state-of-the-art general-purpose compilers in terms of circuit size reduction by around 25%-30% as well as wall-clock compilation time by around 40% (dependent on system size and simulation time-step). Drawing on heuristic techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence, both compilers scale well with simulation time-step and system size. Code for both compilers is open-source and packaged into a full-stack quantum simulation software with tutorials included for ease of use for future researchers wishing to perform dynamic simulations of quantum materials on quantum computers. As our DS compilers provide significant improvements in both compilation time and simulation fidelity, they provide a building block for accelerating progress toward physical quantum supremacy.

TI Wigner Function Non-Classicality Induced in a Charge Qubit Interacting
   with a Dissipative Field Cavity
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We explore a superconducting charge qubit interacting with a dissipative microwave cavity field. Wigner distribution and its non-classicality are investigated analytically under the effects of the qubit-cavity interaction, the qubit-cavity detuning, and the dissipation. As the microwave cavity field is initially in an even coherent state, we investigate the non-classicality of the Wigner distributions. Partially and maximally frozen entanglement are produced by the qubit-cavity interaction, depending on detuning and cavity dissipation. It is found that the amplitudes and frequency of the Wigner distribution can be controlled by the phase space parameters, the qubit-cavity interaction and the detuning, as well as by the dissipation. The cavity dissipation reduces the non-classicality; this process can be accelerated by the detuning.

TI T-depth-optimized quantum search with quantum data-access machine
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum search algorithms offer a remarkable advantage of quadratic reduction in query complexity using quantum superposition principle. However, how an actual architecture may access and handle the database in a quantum superposed state has been largely unexplored so far; the quantum state of data was simply assumed to be prepared and accessed by a black-box operation-so-called oracle, even though this process, if not appropriately designed, may adversely diminish the quantum query advantage. Here, we introduce an efficient quantum data-access process, dubbed as quantum data-access machine (QDAM), and present a general architecture for quantum search algorithm. We analyze the runtime of our algorithm in view of the fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) consisting of logical qubits within an effective quantum error correction code. Specifically, we introduce a measure involving two computational complexities, i.e. quantum query and T-depth complexities, which can be critical to assess performance since the logical non-Clifford gates, such as the T (i.e. pi/8 rotation) gate, are known to be costliest to implement in FTQC. Our analysis shows that for N searching data, a QDAM model exhibiting a logarithmic, i.e. O(logN) , growth of the T-depth complexity can be constructed. Further analysis reveals that our QDAM-embedded quantum search requires O(NxlogN) runtime cost. Our study thus demonstrates that the quantum data search algorithm can truly speed up over classical approaches with the logarithmic T-depth QDAM as a key component.

TI Relativistic Consistency of Nonlocal Quantum Correlations
SO ENTROPY
AB What guarantees the "peaceful coexistence" of quantum nonlocality and special relativity? The tension arises because entanglement leads to locally inexplicable correlations between distant events that have no absolute temporal order in relativistic spacetime. This paper identifies a relativistic consistency condition that is weaker than Bell locality but stronger than the no-signaling condition meant to exclude superluminal communication. While justifications for the no-signaling condition often rely on anthropocentric arguments, relativistic consistency is simply the requirement that joint outcome distributions for spacelike separated measurements (or measurement-like processes) must be independent of their temporal order. This is necessary to obtain consistent statistical predictions across different Lorentz frames. We first consider ideal quantum measurements, derive the relevant consistency condition on the level of probability distributions, and show that it implies no-signaling (but not vice versa). We then extend the results to general quantum operations and derive corresponding operator conditions. This will allow us to clarify the relationships between relativistic consistency, no-signaling, and local commutativity. We argue that relativistic consistency is the basic physical principle that ensures the compatibility of quantum statistics and relativistic spacetime structure, while no-signaling and local commutativity can be justified on this basis.

TI Dual Structure of a Vanadyl-Based Molecular Qubit Containing a
   Bis(β-diketonato) Ligand
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We designed [VO(bdhb)] (1 ') as a new electronic qubit containing an oxovanadium(IV) ion (S = 1/2) embraced by a single bis(beta-diketonato) ligand [H(2)bdhb = 1,3-bis(3,5-dioxo-1-hexyl)benzene]. The synthesis afforded three different crystal phases, all of which unexpectedly contain dimers with formula [(VO)(2)(bdhb)(2)] (1). A trigonal form (1h) with a honeycomb structure and 46% of solvent-accessible voids quantitatively transforms over time into a monoclinic solvatomorph 1m and minor amounts of a triclinic solventless phase (1a). In a static magnetic field, 1h and 1m have detectably slow magnetic relaxation at low temperatures through quantum tunneling and Raman mechanisms. Angle-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra on single crystals revealed signatures of low-dimensional magnetic behavior, which is solvatomorph-dependent, being the closest interdimer V<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>V separations (6.7-7.5 & Aring;) much shorter than intramolecular V<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>V distances (11.9-12.1 & Aring;). According to H-1 diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) and EPR experiments, the complex adopts the desired monomeric structure in organic solution and its geometry was inferred from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spin relaxation measurements in a frozen toluene-d(8)/CD2Cl2 matrix yielded T-m values reaching 13 mu s at 10 K, and coherent spin manipulations were demonstrated by Rabi nutation experiments at 70 K. The neutral quasi-macrocyclic structure, featuring nuclear spin-free donors and additional possibilities for chemical functionalization, makes 1 ' a new convenient spin-coherent building block in quantum technologies.

TI Hamiltonian open quantum system toolkit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In quantum computing, simulating continuously evolving open quantum systems is key to describe dynamical processes on noisy quantum devices. Here, the authors present an open-source software package "Hamiltonian Open Quantum System Toolkit" (HOQST) for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics in Hamiltonian quantum computing based on the master equation approach.
   We present an open-source software package called "Hamiltonian Open Quantum System Toolkit" (HOQST), a collection of tools for the investigation of open quantum system dynamics in Hamiltonian quantum computing, including both quantum annealing and the gate-model of quantum computing. It features the key master equations (MEs) used in the field, suitable for describing the reduced system dynamics of an arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonian with either weak or strong coupling to infinite-dimensional quantum baths. We present an overview of the theories behind the various MEs and provide examples to illustrate typical workflows in HOQST. We present an example that shows that HOQST can provide order of magnitude speedups compared to "Quantum Toolbox in Python" (QuTiP), for problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. The package is ready to be deployed on high performance computing (HPC) clusters and is aimed at providing reliable open-system analysis tools for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Unified approach to data-driven quantum error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Achieving near-term quantum advantage will require effective methods for mitigating hardware noise. Data-driven approaches to error mitigation are promising, with popular examples including zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and Clifford data regression (CDR). Here, we propose a scalable error mitigation method that conceptually unifies ZNE and CDR. Our approach, called variable-noise Clifford data regression (vnCDR), significantly outperforms these individual methods in numerical benchmarks. vnCDR generates training data first via near-Clifford circuits (which are classically simulable) and second by varying the noise levels in these circuits. We employ a noise model obtained from IBM's Ourense quantum computer to benchmark our method. For the problem of estimating the energy of an 8-qubit Ising model system, vnCDR improves the absolute energy error by a factor of 33 over the unmitigated results and by factors of 20 and 1.8 over ZNE and CDR, respectively. For the problem of correcting observables from random quantum circuits with 64 qubits, vnCDR improves the error by factors of 2.7 and 1.5 over ZNE and CDR, respectively.

TI Laser-annealing Josephson junctions for yielding scaled-up
   superconducting quantum processors
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB As superconducting quantum circuits scale to larger sizes, the problem of frequency crowding proves a formidable task. Here we present a solution for this problem in fixed-frequency qubit architectures. By systematically adjusting qubit frequencies post-fabrication, we show a nearly tenfold improvement in the precision of setting qubit frequencies. To assess scalability, we identify the types of "frequency collisions" that will impair a transmon qubit and cross-resonance gate architecture. Using statistical modeling, we compute the probability of evading all such conditions, as a function of qubit frequency precision. We find that, without post-fabrication tuning, the probability of finding a workable lattice quickly approaches 0. However, with the demonstrated precisions it is possible to find collision-free lattices with favorable yield. These techniques and models are currently employed in available quantum systems and will be indispensable as systems continue to scale to larger sizes.

TI High-fidelity entanglement of neutral atoms via a Rydberg-mediated
   single-modulated-pulse controlled-PHASE gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The neutral atom platform has become an attractive choice to study the science of quantum information and quantum simulation, where intense efforts have been devoted to the entangling processes between individual atoms. A two-qubit controlled-PHASE gate via Rydberg blockade is one of the most essential elements. Recent theoretical studies have suggested the advantages of introducing nontrivial waveform modulation into the gate protocol, which is anticipated to improve its performance towards the next stage. We report our recent experimental results in realizing the two-qubit controlled-PHASE (CZ) gate via single-modulated-pulse off-resonant modulated driving embedded in a two-photon transition for Rb atoms. It relies on a global driving laser pulse with a carefully calculated smooth waveform to gain the appropriate phase accumulations required by CZ gate. Combining this CZ gate with global microwave pulses, two-atom entanglement is generated with the raw fidelity of 0.945(6). After accounting for state preparation and measurement errors, we extract the entanglement operation fidelity to be 0.980(7). Our work features completing the CZ gate operation within a single pulse to avoid shelved population in the Rydberg levels, thus demonstrating another promising route for realizing a high-fidelity two-qubit gate for the neutral atom platform.

TI Quantum sensing of magnetic fields with molecular color centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Molecular color centers, such as S = 1 Cr(o-tolyl)4, show promise as an adaptable platform for magnetic quantum sensing. Their intrinsically small size, i.e., 1-2 nm, enables them to sense fields at short distances and in various geometries. This feature, in conjunction with tunable optical read-out of spin information, offers the potential for molecular color centers to be a paradigm shifting materials class beyond diamond-NV centers by accessing a distance scale opaque to NVs. This capability could, for example, address ambiguity in the reported magnetic fields arising from two-dimensional magnets by allowing for a single sensing technique to be used over a wider range of distances. Yet, so far, these abilities have only been hypothesized with theoretical validation absent. We show through simulation that Cr(o-tolyl)4 can spatially resolve proximity-exchange versus direct magnetic-field effects from monolayer CrI3 by quantifying how these interactions impact the excited states of the molecule. At short distances, proximity exchange dominates through molecule-substrate interactions, but at further distances the molecule behaves as a typical magnetic sensor, with magnetostatic effects dominating changes to the energy of the excited state. Our models effectively demonstrate how a molecular color center could be used to measure the magnetic field of a two-dimensional magnet and the role different distance-dependent interactions contribute to the measured field.

TI Integrated photonic source of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits
SO NATURE
AB Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 x 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.

TI Charge-Assisted Engineering of Color Centers in Diamond
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Owing to its unique optical and spin properties, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center holds the promise of a diamond-based room-temperature scalable quantum computer, but the numerous technical and physical issues are not yet overcome, especially the poor N to NV conversion. The NV and other color centers are, however, successfully used as multitasking quantum sensors, and open new routes in quantum sensing technologies. Most recently, several breakthroughs and demonstrations were achieved, shedding a new light on the feasibility of a NV-based quantum computer. Herein, the recently developed method of charge-assisted single defect engineering is reviewed. With a controlled charging of the involved species, it modifies the diffusion or kinetics of defect formation and acts as a catalyzer of the NV creation while hindering the formation of competing and perturbing defects such as divacancies or NVH. Very high NV creation yields up to 75% are obtained and the method is suitable to other impurity-vacancy defects. Furthermore, it has positive consequences on the charge state stability and coherence time of the NV centers, which is as well discussed. Together with the possibility to nowadays deterministically implant single ions, this powerful method brings the scalability of NV qubits closer.

TI Dynamics of a spin qubit in an optical dipole trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a theoretical investigation of coherent dynamics of a spin qubit encoded in hyperfine sublevels of an alkali-metal atom in a far off-resonant optical dipole trap. The qubit is prepared in the "clock transition" utilizing the Zeeman states with zero projection of the spin angular momentum. We focus on various dephasing processes such as the residual motion of the atom, fluctuations of the trapping field and its incoherent scattering, and their effects on the qubit dynamics. We implement the most general fully quantum treatment of the atomic motion, so our results remain valid in the limit of close-to-ground-state cooling with a low number of vibrational excitations. We support our results by comparison with an experiment showing reasonable correspondence with no fitting parameters.

TI Control of microwave photon transmissions in microwave quantum networks
   by elastic scattering
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Elastic scattering is one of the useful methods to control the transmission behaviors of microwave photons transporting in microwave quantum networks without energy consumption. Therefore, it is of practical networks. The transmission line embedded by a single Josephson junction can be described by different circuit models (series and parallel). In this work, we first theoretically analyze the transmission characteristics of models, generated by a single LC loop or a nonlinear Josephson junction device, respectively. The classical microwave transport theory predicts that the series LC loop and the parallel LC loop lead to different elastic scattering behaviors of microwave photons, i.e. the series LC circuit yields the resonant reflection and the parallel LC circuit leads alternatively to the resonant transmission. Recently, the transport properties of microwave photons scattered by a Josephson junction embedded in a transmission line have been discussed, and the results suggested that the Josephson junction embedded in the transmission line can be described by a series embedding circuit, which implies the resonant reflection. We argue here that if the Josephson junction is embedded in parallel in the transmission line, the elastically scattered microwave photons should be transmitted by resonant transmission. In order to test which of the above two different embedding circuit models yielding the completely different elastic scattering behaviors, is physically correct, we then fabricate such a device, i.e. a single Joseph junction device embedded in a transmission line, and measure its elastic scattering transmission coefficient at an extremely low temperature. The results are consistent with the expected effect of the parallel embedding circuit model, but inconsistent with the behaviors predicted by the series embedding circuit model in the literature. According to the above theoretical and experimental analyses of the elastic scattering of a single Josephson junction device, we further propose a scheme to control the elastic scattering behavior of microwave photons by modulating a DC superconducting quantum interference device with a bypass current, which can be applied to the construction of a microwave quantum network based on elastic scattering node controls.

TI Complexity Phase Diagram for Interacting and Long-Range Bosonic
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We classify phases of a bosonic lattice model based on the computational complexity of classically simulating the system. We show that the system transitions from being classically simulable to classically hard to simulate as it evolves in time, extending previous results to include on-site number-conserving interactions and long-range hopping. Specifically, we construct a complexity phase diagram with easy and hard "phases" and derive analytic bounds on the location of the phase boundary with respect to the evolution time and the degree of locality. We find that the location of the phase transition is intimately related to upper bounds on the spread of quantum correlations and protocols to transfer quantum information. Remarkably, although the location of the transition point is unchanged by on-site interactions, the nature of the transition point does change. Specifically, we find that there are two kinds of transitions, sharp and coarse, broadly corresponding to interacting and noninteracting bosons, respectively. Our Letter motivates future studies of complexity in many-body systems and its interplay with the associated physical phenomena.

TI A partially trusted relay-based method for siting key service nodes in a
   quantum key distribution network group
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB This study proposes a group key service node placement method for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks based on partially trusted relays, aiming to optimize network structure, improve key distribution efficiency, reduce communication delay, and ensure transmission integrity and confidentiality. Based on graph theory, a key information model for the quantum key distribution network is established, which defines node types, functions, and connectivity. Leveraging the secure transmission protocol of quantum keys, the unconditional security of the key during transmission is ensured. Furthermore, this study proposes a QKD network architecture incorporating partially trusted relays, which combines trusted and untrusted relay technologies. An improved p-median model is introduced and solved using a greedy algorithm to ensure secure quantum key distribution and optimal deployment of group key service nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the location of group key service nodes in quantum key distribution network ensures the minimum number of key service nodes and minimizes the path length from network demand nodes to group key service nodes. Furthermore, this method significantly improves the key distribution efficiency, success rate, security, energy consumption, resource consumption, network coverage, and blind area of quantum key distribution network.

TI Enhancing IoT Security: Quantum-Level Resilience against Threats
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) operations has necessitated the incorporation of quantum computing technologies to meet its expanding needs. This integration is motivated by the need to solve the specific issues provided by the expansion of IoT and the potential benefits that quantum computing can offer in this scenario. The combination of IoT and quantum computing creates new privacy and security problems. This study examines the critical need to prevent potential security concerns from quantum computing in IoT applications. We investigate the incorporation of quantum computing approaches within IoT security frameworks, with a focus on developing effective security mechanisms. Our research, which uses quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols, provides a unique solution to protecting sensitive information and assuring the integrity of IoT systems. We rigorously analyze critical quantum computing security properties, building a hierarchical framework for systematic examination. We offer concrete solutions flexible to diverse as well as ambiguous opinions through using a unified computational model with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) multi -criteria decision -making (MCDM) as the technique for ordering preferences by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy environment. This study adds practical benefit by supporting practitioners in recognizing, choosing, and prioritizing essential security factors from the standpoint of quantum computing. Our approach is a critical step towards improving quantumlevel security in IoT systems, strengthening their resilience against future threats, and preserving the IoT ecosystem's long-term prosperity.

TI Robust polarization state generation for long-range quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a new compact and robust polarization state transmitter designed to execute the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol. Our transmitter prepares polarization states using a single commercial-off-the-shelf phase modulator. Our scheme does not require global biasing to compensate thermal and mechanical drifts, as both of the system's two time-demultiplexed polarization modes share a single optical path. Furthermore, the transmitter's optical path entails a double-pass through the phase modulation device for each polarization mode, allowing multiple phase rotations to be impinged on each light pulse. We present a proof-of-concept prototype of this transmitter topology and demonstrate a mean intrinsic quantum bit error rate below 0.2% over a 5 hour measurement.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Entanglement Between Two Mechanical Oscillators in a Dual-Coupling
   Optomechanical System
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB In this study, we investigated the properties of entanglement of an optomechanical system including two mechanical oscillators, where two mechanical oscillators are coupled with the cavity field in different coupling modes: the interaction between one mechanical oscillator and cavity field is first-order coupling, and the interaction between the other and the cavity field is quadratic coupling. On the one hand, the entanglement between two mechanical oscillators is studied. The influence of the frequency of the cavity field, the mass of mechanical oscillators, and the temperature of mechanical oscillators on the entanglement between two mechanical oscillators are investigated. On the other hand, for the given parameters of the system, we also obtained the entanglement between the cavity field and the mechanical oscillator that has a quadratic coupling. Compared with the entanglement between microscopic particles, the stable macroscopic quantum entanglement between two mechanical oscillators has the characteristics of long existence life and can be reused, and it also plays an important role in quantum information processing and quantum network construction.

TI Coupling a single spin to the motion of a carbon nanotube
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The ability to couple a solitary spin to high-frequency motion is a crucial advancement for a range of applications, including quantum sensing, intermediate and long-distance spin-spin coupling, and quantum information processing. Although proposed theoretically over a decade ago, experimental demonstrations have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of spin-mechanical coupling in a carbon nanotube device. We demonstrate this coupling in two configurations: off-resonant, with spin and mechanics excited by separate tones, and resonant, driven by a single tone. The coupling manifests as a shift and broadening of the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), respectively. Our theoretical model, which accounts for the tensor character of the coupling and mechanical non-linearity, reproduces the data with very good agreement. Our results demonstrate a previously unobserved spin-mechanical coupling, offering versatile tools for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum simulation.

TI Note about Passive Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution over
   Turbulent Atmospheric Channel
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has been implemented over the atmospheric channels over free space. However, atmospheric turbulence weakens the quality of the transmitting quantum signals and hence decreases the secret key rate of the system. Here, we suggest an atmospheric turbulence channel model that involves atmospheric turbulence bubbles and demonstrates the implementation feasibility of passive CVQKD with spectrum resources in the terahertz band over the atmospheric turbulence channel. We achieve the channel transmittance characterized by the refractive index and the wavefront distortions. Moreover, an adaptive optics (AO) unit is used for performance improvement while considering the effect of the thermal noise and excess noise on the atmospheric turbulence bubble-modeled channel. Numerical simulations show that the AO-involved detection scheme can result in reductions in excess noise when being faced with the floating clouds and mist in atmospheric turbulence, which results in performance improvements in terms of secret key rate, which confirms the utility of the high-rate and long-distance CVQKD in terahertz (THz) for practical implementations.

TI Quantum algorithms for matrix geometric means
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined from distinct perspectives-as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. We devise quantum subroutines for the matrix geometric means, and construct solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation-an important class of nonlinear systems of equations appearing in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms, for both classical and quantum data, called quantum geometric mean metric learning, for weakly supervised learning and anomaly detection. The subroutines are also useful for estimating geometric R & eacute;nyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity, in particular achieving optimal dependence on precision for the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines.

TI Optimized Clifford Noise Reduction: Theory, Simulations and Experiments
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose several optimizations of the CliNR partial error correction scheme which implements Clifford circuits by consuming a resource state. Errors are corrected by measuring a sequence of Pauli operators that we refer to as the verification sequence. We first propose a global optimization algorithm searching for a verification sequence resulting in a low logical error rate using tabu search. Then, we introduce a proxy for the logical error rate which is easier to evaluate and we design a two-step optimization algorithm. First, a verification sequence minimizing the proxy is computed, then this sequence is refined by reintroducing the logical error rate. Finally, we identify a large group of automorphisms of the search space which preserve the proxy and we use this symmetry to reduce the size of the search space. This results in a 168x (respectively 20, 160x) reduction of the size of the search space for the optimization of verification sequences with three (respectively four) Pauli operators. Our numerical simulations for 20-qubit Clifford circuits with size 400 under the ion chain model show that our optimization algorithms improve the performance of CliNR by 25% and that the two-step optimization achieves the same results as the global optimization with 64% fewer evaluations of the logical error rate. Finally, we perform experiments on a 36-qubit trapped ion quantum computer, without mid-circuit measurements, showing that the CZNR variant of CliNR is at breakeven.

TI Security Analysis of Sending or Not-Sending Twin-Field Quantum Key
   Distribution with Weak Randomness
SO ENTROPY
AB Sending-or-not sending twin-field quantum key distribution (SNS TF-QKD) has the advantage of tolerating large amounts of misalignment errors, and its key rate can exceed the linear bound of repeaterless quantum key distribution. However, the weak randomness in a practical QKD system may lower the secret key rate and limit its achievable communication distance, thus compromising its performance. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the weak randomness on the SNS TF-QKD. The numerical simulation shows that SNS TF-QKD can still have an excellent performance under the weak random condition: the secret key rate can exceed the PLOB boundary and achieve long transmission distances. Furthermore, our simulation results also show that SNS TF-QKD is more robust to the weak randomness loopholes than the BB84 protocol and the measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD). Our results emphasize that keeping the randomness of the states is significant to the protection of state preparation devices.

TI Partial Recovery of Coherence Loss in Coherence-Assisted Transformation
SO ENTROPY
AB Coherence-assisted transformation under incoherent operations is discussed. For transformation from the pure state to the mixed state, we show that the coherence loss can be partially recovered by adding auxiliary coherent states. First, we discuss the coherence-assisted transformation for qubit states and give the sufficient and necessary condition for the partial recovery of coherence loss, and the maximum of the recovery of coherence loss is also studied in this case. Second, the maximally coherent state can be obtained in the above recovery scheme, so we give the full characterization of obtaining the maximally coherent state in a qubit system. Finally, we show that the coherence-assisted transformation for arbitrary finite-dimensional main coherent states and low-dimensional auxiliary coherent states is always possible, and the coherence loss also can be partially recovered in these cases.

TI Reconfigurable Quantum Local Area Network Over Deployed Fiber
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Practical quantum networking architectures are crucial for scaling the connection of quantum resources. Yet quantum network testbeds have thus far underutilized the full capabilities of modern lightwave communications, such as flexible-grid bandwidth allocation. In this work, we implement flex-grid entanglement distribution in a deployed network for the first time, connecting nodes in three distinct campus buildings time synchronized via the Global Positioning System. We quantify the quality of the distributed polarization entanglement via log-negativity, which offers a generic metric of link performance in entangled bits per second. After demonstrating successful entanglement distribution for two allocations of our eight dynamically reconfigurable channels, we realize the first deployed fiber network demonstration of remote state preparation (RSP), a fundamental quantum communications protocol with utility for performing remote private "blind" quantum computing. We further demonstrate RSP not only at one location but over three nodes in three locations. In general, our results highlight an advanced paradigm for managing entanglement resources in quantum networks of ever-increasing complexity and service demands.

TI Robust coherent control of solid-state spin qubits using anti-Stokes
   excitation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically addressable solid-state color center spin qubits have become important platforms for quantum information processing, quantum networks and quantum sensing. The readout of color center spin states with optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technology is traditionally based on Stokes excitation, where the energy of the exciting laser is higher than that of the emission photons. Here, we investigate an unconventional approach using anti-Stokes excitation to detect the ODMR signal of silicon vacancy defect spin in silicon carbide, where the exciting laser has lower energy than the emitted photons. Laser power, microwave power and temperature dependence of the anti-Stokes excited ODMR are systematically studied, in which the behavior of ODMR contrast and linewidth is shown to be similar to that of Stokes excitation. However, the ODMR contrast is several times that of the Stokes excitation. Coherent control of silicon vacancy spin under anti-Stokes excitation is then realized at room temperature. The spin coherence properties are the same as those of Stokes excitation, but with a signal contrast that is around three times greater. To illustrate the enhanced spin readout contrast under anti-Stokes excitation, we also provide a theoretical model. The experiments demonstrate that the current anti-Stokes excitation ODMR approach has promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Optically detected magnetic resonance of defect spins typically relies on Stokes excitation, in which the excitation energy is larger than that of the emitted photon. Here, the authors use the opposite regime of anti-Stokes excitation to detect Si vacancy spins in SiC, with a threefold improvement in signal contrast.

SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB This Technical Review collects values of selected performance characteristics of semiconductor spin qubits defined in electrically controlled nanostructures. The characteristics are envisaged to serve as a community source for the values of figures of merit with agreed definitions allowing the comparison of different spin-qubit platforms. We include characteristics on the qubit coherence, speed, fidelity and qubit size of multi-qubit devices. The focus is on collecting and curating the values of these characteristics as reported in the literature, rather than on their motivation or significance.

TI Quantum Fisher information measurement and verification of the quantum
   Cramer-Rao bound in a solid-state qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The quantum Cramer-Rao bound sets a fundamental limit on the accuracy of unbiased parameter estimation in quantum systems, relating the uncertainty in determining a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information. We experimentally demonstrate near saturation of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the phase estimation of a solid-state spin system, provided by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. This is achieved by comparing the experimental uncertainty in phase estimation with an independent measurement of the related quantum Fisher information. The latter is independently extracted from coherent dynamical responses of the system under weak parametric modulations, without performing any quantum-state tomography. While optimal parameter estimation has already been observed for quantum devices involving a limited number of degrees of freedom, our method offers a versatile and powerful experimental tool to explore the Cramer-Rao bound and the quantum Fisher information in systems of higher complexity, as relevant for quantum technologies.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Developing quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using monolithic photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can accelerate their adoption by a wide range of markets, thanks to the potential reduction in size, complexity of the overall system, power consumption, and production cost. In this work, we design, fabricate and characterize an InP-based PIC transmitter for continuous-variable (CV) QKD applications. In a proof-of-principle experiment implementing a pulsed Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) CV-QKD protocol over an optical fiber channel of 11 km, the system showed a performance compatible with a secret key rate of 78 kbps in the asymptotic regime. These results show the potential of InP technologies to integrate CV-QKD systems onto a monolithic platform.

TI Quantum private comparison protocol via 4D layered states and DQC model
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Based on the four-dimensional layered quantum states and the delegating quantum computation (DQC) model, a new quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol is designed to compare private information between two participants with the help of a semi-honest third party (TP). The TP may misbehave on his own, though he enables to perform the protocol loyally. Benefiting from the properties of 4D layered quantum states in quantum secure communication, the QPC protocol performs the comparison of secrets better. The proposed QPC protocol based on a DQC scheme can be realized by the participants with insufficient capacity. The security of the proposed protocol is ensured by the usage of decoy photons and location obfuscation technique of sequences. The correctness of the proposed protocol is validated by simulations on the IBM's qiskit. The performance of the protocol against the external and internal attacks is also analyzed.

TI Asymmetric Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Technology: from
   Chirality to Nonreciprocity
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Chirality, a fundamental geometric and symmetrical property introduced by Lord Kelvin in the 19th century, has long been central to classical optics and is exemplified by phenomena such as optical activity and circular dichroism. In recent years, this concept has been remarkably extended into the quantum domain, giving rise to the emerging field of chiral quantum optics. This field focuses on direction-dependent light- matter interactions that break spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry, offering novel mechanisms for asymmetric photon transport, quantum information processing, and quantum-enhanced sensing. To move beyond the traditional paradigm of spin- momentum locking, researchers have proposed a broader framework, generalized chiral quantum optics, which incorporates multiple optical degrees of freedom, such as polarization, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and propagation direction, to engineer direction-dependent light-matter interactions. This unified framework has facilitated the discovery and design of nonreciprocal quantum behavior across diverse physical platforms. The ability to control the directionality of light-matter coupling at the quantum level opens up promising avenues for scalable nonreciprocal quantum networks, high-dimensional quantum encoding, and topologically robust quantum devices. A comprehensive review of generalized chiral mechanisms and their integration into quantum optical systems is essential for advancing asymmetric quantum technologies. Progress In this paper, we systematically review recent advances in asymmetric quantum optics from the perspective of generalized chirality. The review begins with representative classical optical phenomena that exhibit chiral responses, including natural optical activity, magneto-optical effects, the photon drag effect, and the Sagnac effect (Figs. 1-4). These effects arise from intrinsic or extrinsic symmetry breaking in the material system or reference frame, giving rise to direction-dependent light-matter interactions. For instance, optical activity arises fundamentally from the breaking of spatial inversion symmetry in a medium, resulting in different refractive indices for left-and right-handed circularly polarized light. Magneto-optical effects, such as the Faraday effect, on the other hand, stem from time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by an external magnetic field. The photon drag effect corresponds to the modulation of the effective refractive index for different polarization states induced by medium motion. In a rotating reference frame, the Sagnac effect reveals that clockwise and counterclockwise propagating beams experience different group refractive indices, leading to direction-dependent propagation times and accumulated phases. At the quantum level, five representative mechanisms underpinning chiral quantum optical interactions are highlighted: 1) spin- momentum locking, which reveals a deterministic coupling between the transverse spin and propagation direction of light, enabling directional coupling between photons and quantum emitters with chiral transition selection rules (Fig. 5); 2) susceptibility-momentum locking, which exploits unidirectional control fields and microscopic Doppler effects to induce direction-dependent susceptibility in thermal atomic ensembles (Fig.
   6); 3) directional quantum squeezing, where nonlinear momentum-matching conditions in cavity quantum electrodynamics systems enable the generation of squeezed states with propagation-direction selectivity, leading to chiral photon-photon and photon-matter interactions (Fig. 7); 4) reservoir engineering, which utilizes coordinated control of the system and its common dissipative environment to construct nonreciprocal coupling channels with propagation-direction dependence (Fig. 8); 5) high-dimensional chiral interactions induced by OAM, where electric quadrupole transitions enable asymmetric light-matter coupling in the topological charge degree of freedom (Fig. 9). We further explore the deep integration of chiral mechanisms with topological photonics (Figs. 10-11) and non-Hermitian optics (Fig. 12), and introduce two emerging hybrid directions: chiral topological quantum optics and chiral non-Hermitian quantum optics. The former embeds quantum emitters into topological photonic structures to realize interfaces that simultaneously exhibit topological protection and directional selectivity. The latter introduces chiral couplings into the non-Hermitian evolution of open quantum systems, enabling systematic exploration of direction-dependent dynamics in nonequilibrium quantum regimes. This leads to propagation-direction-dependent excitation and decay processes and yields stable, controllable nonreciprocal quantum responses, thus significantly enhancing sensitivity to external perturbations. Experimental demonstrations in topological photonic crystals, thermal atomic ensembles, and passive magneto-optical cavities reveal diverse novel nonreciprocal quantum dynamics and sensing capabilities. Conclusions and Prospects Generalized chiral quantum optics provides a unifying framework for understanding and exploiting asymmetric light -matter interactions across classical and quantum domains. As the field advances, several promising directions are emerging. Integrating multiple degrees of freedom, such as spin, OAM, and propagation direction, opens opportunities for high-dimensional chiral interactions and flexible quantum control. In parallel, collective effects in multi-emitter systems are expected to give rise to direction-dependent superradiance, dissipative phase transitions, and emergent nonreciprocal quantum phases, paving the way toward scalable chiral quantum networks. On the implementation side, the integration of chiral optics with metasurfaces and metamaterials offers a practical path toward chip-scale, tunable nonreciprocal devices. Recent demonstrations of loss-enabled chirality inversion near non-Hermitian singularities highlight the potential of such platforms for dynamic control. Moreover, the inherent sensitivity of chiral quantum systems to direction, when combined with quantum coherence and non-Hermitian features, holds promise for ultra-sensitive sensing applications such as quantum gyroscopes and magnetometers. Finally, the emergence of chirality through nonlinear interactions, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking in Kerr microresonators, reveals new pathways for realizing self-organized, structure-free chiral quantum devices. In summary, the field of chiral quantum optics is at a pivotal stage of rapid development and deep expansion. On the one hand, its foundational theories are being continuously refined and extended; on the other hand, the technological pathways toward practical implementation are becoming increasingly well-defined.
   This synergy between fundamental research and applied innovation is expected to provide sustained momentum for the advancement of nonreciprocal quantum optics and quantum information technologies, laying a solid foundation for the realization of high-dimensional, integrated, and scalable quantum devices and applications.

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic-secure secret key exchange thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics. Since it can easily be incorporated into existing telecom networks, continuous-variable QKD (CV QKD) using coherent states and coherent detection has recently emerged as a promising candidate. However, the secret key rate and link distance in CV QKD systems are still limited by the imperfections of used components. In this work, through simulations, we study the use of different digital filtering techniques for optical phase recovery, aided by pilot symbols, to mitigate the phase noise induced by the coherent mixing of two free-running lasers in a CV QKD system. Moving average, Butterworth and unscented Kalman filters are evaluated for different phase drift conditions. Results show that phase recovery from small amplitude pilot symbols, along with further digital filtering, can considerably reduce phase noise and measurement error, while increasing the secret key rate and link distance of the CV QKD system.<bold> </bold>

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We construct a computationally universal quantum programming language QuantumII II from two copies of II , the internal language of rig groupoids. The first step constructs a pure (measurement-free) term language by interpreting each copy of II in a generalisation of the category Unitary in which every morphism is "rotated" by a particular angle, and the two copies are amalgamated using a free categorical construction expressed as a computational effect. The amalgamated language only exhibits quantum behaviour for specific values of the rotation angles, a property which is enforced by imposing a small number of equations on the resulting category. The second step in the construction introduces measurements by layering an additional effect.

TI Sampled subblock hashing for large-input randomness extraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Randomness extraction is an essential postprocessing step in practical quantum cryptography systems. When statistical fluctuations are taken into consideration, the requirement of large-input data size could heavily penalize the speed and resource consumption of the randomness-extraction process, thereby limiting the overall system performance. In this work, we propose a sampled subblock hashing approach to circumvent this problem by randomly dividing the large-input block into multiple subblocks and processing them individually. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an order-of-magnitude increase in system throughput while keeping the resource utilization low. Furthermore, our proposed approach is applicable to a generic class of quantum cryptographic protocols that satisfy the generalized entropy-accumulation framework, presenting a highly promising and general solution for high-speed postprocessing in quantum cryptographic applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.

TI Qubit decoherence and symmetry restoration through real-time instantons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A parametrically driven quantum oscillator, stabilized by a nonlinear dissipation, exhibits a spontaneous breaking of the parity symmetry. It results in the quantum bistability, corresponding to a Bloch sphere of dark states. This makes such a driven-dissipative system an attractive candidate for a qubit. The parity symmetry breaking is exact both on the classical level and within the quantum mechanical perturbation theory. Here, we show that nonperturbative quantum effects lead to the symmetry restoration and result in an exponentially small but finite qubit decoherence rate. Technically, the symmetry restoration is due to real-time instanton trajectories of the Keldysh path integral, which represents the Lindbladian evolution of the driven-dissipative oscillator.

TI Implementation of quantum compression on IBM quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Advances in development of quantum computing processors brought ample opportunities to test the performance of various quantum algorithms with practical implementations. In this paper we report on implementations of quantum compression algorithm that can efficiently compress unknown quantum information. We restricted ourselves to compression of three pure qubits into two qubits, as the complexity of even such a simple implementation is barely within the reach of today's quantum processors. We implemented the algorithm on IBM quantum processors with two different topological layouts-a fully connected triangle processor and a partially connected line processor. It turns out that the incomplete connectivity of the line processor affects the performance only minimally. On the other hand, it turns out that the transpilation, i.e. compilation of the circuit into gates physically available to the quantum processor, crucially influences the result. We also have seen that the compression followed by immediate decompression is, even for such a simple case, on the edge or even beyond the capabilities of currently available quantum processors.

TI Afterpulse effect in measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB There is no doubt that measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is a crucial protocol that is immune to all possible detector side channel attacks. In the preparation phase, a simulation model is usually employed to get a set of optimized parameters, which is utilized for getting a higher secure key rate in reality. With the implementation of high-speed QKD, the afterpulse effect which is an intrinsic characteristic of the single-photon avalanche photodiode is no longer ignorable, this will lead to a great deviation compared with the existing analytical model. Here we develop an afterpulse-compatible MDI-QKD model to get the optimized parameters. Our results indicate that by using our afterpulse-compatible model, we can get a much higher key rate than the prior afterpulse-omitted model. It is significant to take the afterpulse effect into consideration because of the improvement of the system working frequency.

TI Spin Weyl quantum unit: A theoretical proposal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a four-state quantum system, or quantum unit, that can be realized in superconducting heterostructures. The unit combines the states of a spin and an Andreev qubit providing the opportunity of quantum superpositions of their states. This functionality is achieved by tunnel coupling between a four-terminal superconducting heterostructure housing a Weyl point and a quantum dot. The quantum states in the vicinity of the Weyl point are extremely sensitive to small changes of superconducting phase; this gives rich opportunities for quantum manipulation. We establish an effective Hamiltonian for the setup and describe the peculiarities of the resulting spectrum. We concentrate on the four-state subspace and explain how to make a double qubit in this setup. We review various ways to achieve quantum manipulation in the unit: this includes resonant, adiabatic, diabatic manipulation and combinations of those. We provide detailed illustrations of designing arbitrary quantum gates in the unit.

Used as a qubit, the circuit shows long energy-relaxation times, of the order of 40 mu s and a spin-echo dephasing time of 9.4 mu s. The circuit has high anharmonicity, of 2 pi x 3.69 GHz. We extract the multilevel relaxation and dephasing rates of the circuit used as a qutrit and discuss the possible sources for the decoherence. The high anharmonicity allows for fast qubit control with nanosecond-range gate durations and a measured average gate fidelity of 99.92%, characterized by randomized benchmarking. These results demonstrate interesting potential use for fast nanosecond-timescale two-qubit gates and multilevel quantum logic.

TI Engineering unsteerable quantum states with active feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose active steering protocols for quantum state preparation in quantum circuits where each system qubit is connected to a single detector qubit, employing a simple coupling selected from a small set of steering operators. The decision is made such that the expected cost-function gain in one time step is maximized. We apply these protocols to several many-qubit models. Our results are underlined by three remarkable insights. First, we show that the standard fidelity does not give a useful cost function; instead, successful steering is achieved by including local fidelity terms. Second, although the steering dynamics acts on each system qubit separately, entanglement in the generated target state is introduced, and can be tuned at will, by performing Bell measurements on detector qubit pairs after every time step. This implements a weak-measurement variant of entanglement swapping. Third, numerical simulations suggest that the active steering protocol can reach arbitrarily designated target states, including passively unsteerable states such as the N-qubit W state.

TI Optimization of tensor network codes with reinforcement learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Tensor network codes enable structured construction and manipulation of stabilizer codes out of small seed codes. Here, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to tensor network code geometries and demonstrate how optimal stabilizer codes can be found. Using the projective simulation framework, our RL agent consistently finds the best possible codes given an environment and set of allowed actions, including for codes with more than one logical qubit. The agent also consistently outperforms a random search, for example finding an optimal code with a 10% frequency after 1000 trials, vs a theoretical 0.16% from random search, an improvement by a factor of 65.

TI Quantum Obfuscation of Generalized Quantum Power Functions with
   Coefficient
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum obfuscation is one of the important primitives in quantum cryptography that can be used to enhance the security of various quantum cryptographic schemes. The research on quantum obfuscation focuses mainly on the obfuscatability of quantum functions. As a primary quantum function, the quantum power function has led to the development of quantum obfuscation because it is applicable to construct new obfuscation applications such as quantum encryption schemes. However, the previous definition of quantum power functions is constrained and cannot be beneficial to the further construction of other quantum functions. Thus, it is essential to extend the definition of the basic quantum power function in a more general manner. In this paper, we provide a formal definition of two quantum power functions called generalized quantum power functions with coefficients, each of which is characterized by a leading coefficient and an exponent that corresponds to either a quantum or classical state, indicating the generality. The first is the quantum power function with a leading coefficient, and the second is the quantum n-th power function, which are both fundamental components of quantum polynomial functions. In addition, obfuscation schemes for the functions are constructed by quantum teleportation and quantum superdense coding, and demonstrations of their obfuscatability are also provided in this paper. This work establishes the fundamental basis for constructing more quantum functions that can be utilized for quantum obfuscation, therefore contributing to the theory of quantum obfuscation.

TI Single-Shot Single-Mode Optical Two-Parameter Displacement Estimation
   beyond Classical Limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Uncertainty principle prohibits the precise measurement of both components of displacement parameters in phase space. We have theoretically shown that this limit can be beaten using single-photon states, in a single-shot and single-mode setting [F. Hanamura et al., Estimation of gaussian random displacement using non-gaussian states, Phys. Rev. A 104, 062601 (2021).]. In this Letter, we validate this by experimentally beating the classical limit. In optics, this is the first experiment to estimate both parameters of displacement using non-Gaussian states. This result is related to many important applications, such as quantum error correction.

TI Scenarios for Optical Encryption Using Quantum Keys
SO SENSORS
AB Optical communications providing huge capacity and low latency remain vulnerable to a range of attacks. In consequence, encryption at the optical layer is needed to ensure secure data transmission. In our previous work, we proposed LightPath SECurity (LPSec), a secure cryptographic solution for optical transmission that leverages stream ciphers and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange for high-speed optical encryption. Still, LPSec faces limitations related to key generation and key distribution. To address these limitations, in this paper, we rely on Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. Specifically, we focus on three meaningful scenarios: In Scenario A, the two optical transponders (Tp) involved in the optical transmission are within the security perimeter of the QKD network. In Scenario B, only one Tp is within the QKD network, so keys are retrieved from a QRNG and distributed using LPSec. Finally, Scenario C extends Scenario B by employing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) by implementing a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) to secure key exchanges. The scenarios are analyzed based on their security, efficiency, and applicability, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced LPSec to provide secure, low-latency encryption for current optical communications. The experimental assessment, conducted on the Madrid Quantum Infrastructure, validates the feasibility of the proposed solutions.

TI Operator delocalization in quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the delocalization of operators in nonchaotic quantum systems whose interactions are encoded in an underlying graph or network. In particular, we study how fast operators of different sizes delocalize as the network connectivity is varied. We argue that these delocalization properties are well captured by Krylov complexity and show, numerically, that efficient delocalization of large operators can only happen within sufficiently connected network topologies. Finally, we demonstrate how this can be used to furnish a deeper understanding of the quantum charging advantage of a class of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)-like quantum batteries.

TI Spin-photon correlations from a Purcell-enhanced diamond
   nitrogen-vacancy center coupled to an open microcavity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 +/- 1.6. Upon pulsed resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5% per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations. Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.

TI Universal Multiport Interferometers for Post-Selected Multi-Photon Gates
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB It is showed how to use universal multiport interferometers' schemes in order to create photonic post-selected Controlled-Z and Controlled-Controlled-Z gates, which are equivalent, modulo single-qubit gates, to Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates, respectively. The new proposed method is based on the following ingredients: identical single photons, Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks, single-photon detectors and post-selection. In particular, by using dual-rail path encoding together with auxiliary paths and single photons, the success probabilities of such gates is improved. This result further proves the complexity and richness of Reck and Clements schemes beyond the usual notions and practices of Boson Sampling.

TI DV-QKD Coexistence With 1.6 Tbps Classical Channels Over Hollow Core
   Fibre
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB The feasibility of coexisting a quantum channel with carrier-grade classical optical channels over Hollow Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibre (HC-NANF) is experimentally explored for the first time in terms of achievable quantum bit error rate (QBER), secret key rate (SKR) as well as classical signal bit error rates (BER). A coexistence transmission of 1.6 Tbps is achieved for the classical channels simultaneously with a quantum channel over a 2 km-long HC-NANF with a total coexistence power of 0 dBm. To find the best and worst wavelength position for the classical channels, we simulated different classical channels bands with different spacing between the quantum and classical channels considering the crosstalk generated from both Raman scattering and four-wave-mixing (FWM) on the quantum channel. Following our simulation, we numerically estimate the best (Raman spectrum dip) and worst locations (Raman spectrum peak) of the classical channel with respect to its impact on the performance on the quantum channel in terms of SKR and QBER. We further implemented a testbed to experimentally test both single-mode fibre (SMF) and HC-NANF in the best and worst-case scenarios. In the best-case scenario, the spacing between quantum and classical is 200 GHz (1.6 nm) with 50 GHz (0.4 nm) spacing between each classical channel. The SKR was preserved without any noticeable changes when coexisting the quantum channel with eight classical channels at 0 dBm total coexistence power in HC-NANF compared to a significant drop of 73% when using SMF at -24 dBm total coexistence power which is 250 times lower than the power used in HC-NANF. In the worst-case scenario using the same powers, and with 1 THz (8 nm) spacing between quantum and classical channels, the SKR dropped 10% using the HC-NANF, whereas in the SMF the SKR plummeted to zero.

TI Simulation Paths for Quantum Circuit Simulation With Decision Diagrams
   What to Learn From Tensor Networks, and What Not
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a notoriously hard, yet increasingly important task for the development and testing of quantum algorithms. In order to alleviate this inherent complexity, efficient data structures and methods, such as tensor networks and decision diagrams, have been proposed. However, their efficiency heavily depends on the order in which the individual computations are performed. For tensor networks, the order is defined by so-called contraction plans and a plethora of methods has been developed to determine suitable plans. On the other hand, simulation based on decision diagrams is mostly conducted in a straight-forward, i.e., sequential, fashion thus far. In this work, we study the importance of the path that is chosen when simulating quantum circuits using decision diagrams and show, conceptually and experimentally, that choosing the right simulation path can make a vast difference in the efficiency of classical simulations using decision diagrams. We propose an open-source framework (available at github.com/cda-tum/ddsim) that not only allows to investigate of dedicated simulation paths but also to reuse of existing findings, e.g., obtained from determining contraction plans for tensor networks. Experimental evaluations show that translating strategies from the domain of tensor networks may yield speedups of several factors compared to the state of the art. Furthermore, we design a dedicated simulation path heuristic that allows to improve the performance even further-frequently yielding speedups of several orders of magnitude. Finally, we provide an extensive discussion on what can be learned from tensor networks and what cannot.

TI Waveguide band-gap N-qubit array with a tunable transparency
   resonance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a single-photon transmission through a one-dimensional N-qubit chain. The qubits are supposed to be identical with equal distance between neighbors. We express the transfer matrix of the N-qubit chain in terms of Chebyshev polynomials, which allows us to obtain simple expressions for the transmission and reflection amplitudes for arbitrarily large N. If the distance between neighbor qubits is equal to a half wavelength, then the transmission spectrum exhibits a flat band gap structure with very steep walls. We show that, for odd N, the tuning of the excitation frequency of a central qubit gives rise to the appearance within a band gap of a narrow resonance with a full transmission. The position of the resonance and its width can be monitored with the frequency of a central qubit. We show that the formation of the band gap and the transmission resonance result from the overlapping the widths of individual qubits, which is due to the strong coupling between qubits and waveguide photons.

TI Observation of the dynamics of an ergodic quantum protocol in a photonic
   realization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Iterated quantum protocols with measurement-based selection lead to deterministic chaos for the evolving pure state representing an ensemble of qubits. Deterministic chaos for the pure quantum state may lead to ergodic evolution in the sense that initial states from any small area on the Bloch sphere will cover the whole sphere after a finite number of iterations. We realize two steps of an ergodic protocol in a photonic experiment, where initial qubit states are encoded in the polarization and path degrees of freedom of down-converted photons stemming from a parametric process. We numerically analyze the effect of noise on the time evolution and show that the protocol, described by a Lattes map, remains quasi-ergodic for any initial state if the initial noise is small. Tomographic reconstruction of the quantum states throughout the evolution is consistent with simulations and thus demonstrates ergodicity of the quantum dynamics.

TI Pulsed laser attack at 1061 nm potentially compromises quantum key
   distribution
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum key distribution systems offer cryptographic security, provided that all their components are thoroughly characterized. However, certain components might be vulnerable to laser-damage attacks, particularly when subjected to untested laser parameters. Here, we show that exposing 1550-nm fiber-optic isolators to 1061-nm sub-nanosecond pulsed illumination with 1.16 W average power permanently degrades their isolation performance at 1550 nm, while their forward transparency is less affected. One experimental sample was exposed to 17 mW average power picosecond attacking pulses that temporarily reduced its isolation below the specified guaranteed minimum value. This indicates a potential security threat under these attacking laser regimes that need to be addressed by improving security analysis for various light-injection attacks.

TI Irreducible Magic Sets for n-Qubit Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Magic sets of observables are minimal structures that capture quantum state-independent advantage for systems of n >= 2 qubits and are, therefore, fundamental tools for investigating the interface between classical and quantum physics. A theorem by Arkhipov (arXiv:1209.3819) states that n-qubit magic sets in which each observable is in exactly two subsets of compatible observables can be reduced either to the twoqubit magic square or the three-qubit magic pentagram [N. D. Mermin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 3373 (1990)]. An open question is whether there are magic sets that cannot be reduced to the square or the pentagram. If they exist, a second key question is whether they require n > 3 qubits, since, if this is the case, these magic sets would capture minimal state-independent quantum advantage that is specific for n-qubit systems with specific values of n. Here, we answer both questions affirmatively. We identify magic sets that cannot be reduced to the square or the pentagram and require n = 3, 4, 5, or 6 qubits. In addition, we prove a generalized version of Arkhipov's theorem providing an efficient algorithm for, given a hypergraph, deciding whether or not it can accommodate a magic set, and solve another open problem, namely, given a magic set, obtaining the tight bound of its associated noncontextuality inequality.

TI EXIT-Chart Aided Design of Irregular Multiple-Rate Quantum Turbo Block
   Codes
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a novel quantum turbo short-block code, which subsumes multiple-rate quantum short-block codes (MR-QSBCs) as the outer codes and a quantum unity-rate code (QURC) as the inner code. The proposed design is denoted as MR-QSBC-QURC. More specifically, the proposed design exhibits multiple quantum coding rates despite relying only on a single quantum encoder. Moreover, the flexibility offered by the single-encoder MR-QSBCs enables us to leverage extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart based heuristic optimization for determining the optimal weighting in the fractional encoding of MR-QSBCs. Our simulation results show that the MR-QSBC-QURC scheme conceived performs relatively close to the ultimate limit of the quantum hashing bound. Specifically, when considering the target quantum coding rates of rQ = {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7}, the MR-QSBC-QURC operates at a distance of D = {0.042, 0.029, 0.030, 0.024, 0.017} from the quantum hashing bound, respectively, at a quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of 10(-3).

TI Controlled-Z operation versus the beam-splitter transformation: Errors
   of entangled operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using the quantum teleportation in continuous variables as a test scheme, we compare two entangled transformations-mixing of signals on a beam splitter and by the controlled-Z (CZ) operation. We evaluate these transformations in terms of the errors added to teleported oscillators. We have shown that the CZ operation leads to the lower error of teleportation. This error can be further reduced by choosing appropriate weight coefficients for the CZ transforms. We have compared the errors of the theoretical CZ scheme and its practical implementation in the optical design. Although the CZ optical scheme adds intrinsic noise to the overall transformation, it is nevertheless possible to specify the parameters which provides a gain in comparison with the traditional teleportation protocol.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with time-division
   dual-quadrature homodyne detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a novel heterodyne detection scheme for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), which measures both quadrature components of a quantum signal encoded in optical phase space. The proposed method uses time division to achieve identical performance to conventional heterodyne detection with only a single homodyne detection system. Our method also uses a Faraday-Michelson interferometer to make it independent of polarization drift and eliminate the need for dynamic polarization control. Our method is experimentally demonstrated using the Gaussian-modulated coherent-states (GMCS) protocol over a 20.06 km optical fiber channel, achieving an expected secret key rate of up to 0.187 Mbps.

TI Quantum sensing of free radicals in macrophages reveals early
   autophagy-lysosome regulation in an atherosclerosis cell model
SO REDOX BIOLOGY
AB Atherosclerosis is the predominant cause of death in industrialized countries and is on track to become the foremost cause of death worldwide. Free radicals play a crucial role in regulating the degradation system in macrophages within plaques which lead to complications in atherosclerosis. They are linked to the decline of autophagy-lysosomes and plaque progression. However, their specific production sites and timing remain unclear. To investigate free radical production in the macrophage autophagy-lysosome system's response to stress, we employed nanodiamond-based quantum sensing. By incubating RAW 264.7 macrophages with nanodiamonds and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, we observed colocalization of nanodiamonds with oxLDL in the autophagylysosomal system. Quantum sensing was then applied to sense free radical production in the surrounding area. Our findings revealed a decrease in spin lattice relaxation (T1) times (more free radicals), with a 36.7 % and 31.8 % rise at 0.5 and 4 h of oxLDL incubation compared to controls. Additionally, we observed the nuclear translocation of transcriptional factor EB (TFEB), the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis. This suggests the initiation of an autophagy-lysosomal program, which enhanced the cell's degradative capacity. Consequently, T1 values firstly increased after 1h. At 4h, a significant TFEB nuclear translocation was observed, leading to the increase of T1 values by 8.2 % and 20.3 % at 6 and 8 h, respectively, compared to the 4-h mark.

TI Merged-Element Transmons: Design and Qubit Performance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate a superconducting transmon qubit in which a Josephson junction has been engineered to act as its own parallel shunt capacitor. This merged-element transmon potentially offers a smaller footprint than conventional transmons. Because it concentrates the electromagnetic energy inside the junction, it reduces the relative electric field participation from other interfaces. By combining micrometer-scale Al/AlOx/Al junctions with long oxidations, we produce functional devices with E-J/E-C in the lowtransmon regime (E-J/E-C less than or similar to 30). Cryogenic I-V measurements show a sharp dI/dV structure with low subgap conduction. Qubit spectroscopy of tunable versions shows a small number of avoided level crossings, suggesting the presence of two-level systems. We observe mean T-1 times typically in the range of 10-90 mu s, with some annealed devices exhibiting T-1 > 100 mu s over several hours. The results suggest that energy relaxation in conventional small-junction transmons is not limited by junction loss.

TI Patient Data Analysis with the Quantum Clustering Method
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum computing is one of the most promising solutions for solving optimization problems in the healthcare world. Quantum computing development aims to light up the execution of a vast and complex set of algorithmic instructions. For its implementation, the machine learning models are continuously evolving. Hence, the new challenge is to improve the existing complex and critical machine learning training models. Therefore, the healthcare sector is shifting from a classical to a quantum domain to sustain patient-oriented attention to healthcare patrons. This paper presents a hybrid classical-quantum approach for training the unsupervised data models. In order to achieve good performance and optimization of the machine learning algorithms, a quantum k-means (QK-means) clustering problem was deployed on the IBM quantum simulators, i.e.,the IBM QASM simulator. In the first place, the approach was theoretically studied and then implemented to analyze the experimental results. The approach was further tested using small synthetics and cardiovascular datasets on a qsam simulator to obtain the clustering solution. The future direction connecting the dots is the incremental k-means algorithm with the quantum platform, which would open hitherto unimaginable technological doors.

TI Latched readout for the quantum dot hybrid qubit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A primary method of reading out a quantum dot hybrid qubit involves projection of the logical basis onto distinct charge states that are readily detected by an integrated charge sensing dot. However, in the simplest configuration, the excited charge state decays rapidly, making a single-shot readout challenging. Here, we demonstrate a readout procedure where the qubit excited state is latched to a metastable charge configuration whose lifetime is tunnel-rate limited, persisting here as long as 2.5 ms. Additionally, we show that working in the (4,1)-(3,2) charge configuration enables a latched readout window that is larger and more tunable than typical charge configurations, because the size of the readout window is determined by an orbital splitting rather than a valley splitting.

TI Attainable and usable coherence in X states over Markovian and
   non-Markovian channels
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The relations between the resource theoretic measures of quantum coherence are rigorously investigated for various Markovian and non-Markovian channels for the two-qubit X states with specific attention to the maximum and minimum attainable coherence and usefulness of these states in performing quantum teleportation in noisy environment. The investigation has revealed that under both dephasing and dissipative type noises the maximally entangled mixed states andWerner states lose their form and usefulness. However, maximally non-local mixed states (MNMSs) lose their identity in dissipative noise only. Thus, MNMSs are established to be useful in teleporting a qubit with fidelity greater than the classical limit in the presence of dephasing noise. MNMSs also remain useful for device independent quantum key distribution in this case as they still violate Bell's inequality. In the presence of noise, coherence measured by relative entropy of coherence is found to fall faster than the same measured using l(1) norm of coherence. Further, information back-flow from the environment to the system is observed over non-Markovian channels which leads to revival in coherence. Additionally, sequential interaction of two qubits with the same environment is found to result in correlated noise on both qubits, and coherence is observed to be frozen in this case under dephasing channel. Under the effect of Markovian and non-Markovian dephasing channels studied here, we observed that MNMSs have maximum relative coherence, i.e. they have the maximum amount of l(1) norm of coherence among the states with the same amount of relative entropy of coherence. However, this feature is not visible in any X state evolving over dissipative channels.

TI No-Go Theorems for Universal Entanglement Purification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An entanglement purification protocol (EPP) aims to transform multiple noisy entangled states into a single entangled state with higher fidelity. In this work we consider input-independent EPPs that always yield an output fidelity no worse than each of the original noisy states, a property we call universality. We prove there is no n-to-1 EPP implementable by local operations and classical communication that is universal for all two-qubit entangled states, whereas such an EPP is possible using more general positive partial transpose-preserving (PPT) operations. We also show that universality is impossible by any bilocal Clifford EPP even when restricted to states with fidelities above an arbitrarily high threshold.

TI Pure-State Photon-Pair Source with a Long Coherence Time for Large-Scale
   Quantum Information Processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent photons plays a pivotal role in large-scale quantum networks involving distant nodes. Photons need to work in a pure state for indistinguishability to reach high-quality interference. Also, they need to have a sufficiently long coherence time to reduce the time-synchronization requirements in practical applications. In this paper, we discuss a scheme for generating a pure-state photon-pair source with a long coherence time in periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystals. By selecting the appropriate pump laser and filter, we can simultaneously eliminate the frequency correlation of the parametric photons while achieving a long coherence time. We experimentally develop this pure-state photon-pair source of 780 nm on potassium titanyl phosphate crystals pumped by a 390-nm pulsed laser. The source provides a coherence time of tens of picoseconds, and it is shown to have the potential to be applied in long-distance quantum interference. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two photon sources with visibility exceeding the classical limit.

TI Dual-state purification for practical quantum error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error mitigation is essential for many computing tasks on the noisy quantum computer with a limited number of qubits. In this paper, we propose a practical protocol of error mitigation by virtually purifying the quantum state without qubit overhead or requiring only one ancilla qubit. In dual-state purification, we effectively generate a purified state with increased fidelity using the erroneous state and its dual state, respectively, prepared with the noisy quantum circuit and the dual map of its inverse circuit. Combined with tomography purification, we can make sure that the final estimate of an observable is obtained from a pure state. While the absolute error increases, the numerical result, based on a depolarizing model, suggests that our protocol reduces the error compared to the case without the protocol by a rescaling factor decreasing with the qubit number and circuit depth; i.e., the relative performance of purification is better for larger circuits. On a cloud quantum computer, we successfully demonstrate the reduced error with a quantum variational eigensolver circuit.

TI Practical underwater quantum key distribution based on decoy-state BB84
   protocol
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB Polarization encoding quantum key distribution has been proven to be a reliable method to build a secure communication system. It has already been used in an inter-city fiber channel and near-Earth atmosphere channel, leaving an underwater channel the last barrier to conquer. Here we demonstrate a decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution system over a water channel with a compact system design for future experiments in the ocean. In the system, a multiple-intensity modulated laser module is designed to produce the light pulses of quantum states, including signal state, decoy state, and vacuum state. Classical communication and synchronization are realized by wireless optical transmission. Multiple filtering techniques and wavelength division multiplexing are further used to avoid cross talk of different lights. We test the performance of the system and obtain a final key rate of 245.6 bps with an average quantum bit error rate of 1.91% over a 2.4 m water channel, in which the channel attenuation is 16.35 dB. Numerical simulation shows that the system can tolerate up to 21.7 dB total channel loss and can still generate secure keys in 277.9mJerlov type I ocean channel. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Sending-or-not-sending twin field quantum key distribution with
   imperfect vacuum sources
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol of the twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) can tolerant large misalignment error and its key rate can exceed the linear bound of repeaterless QKD. The original SNS protocol and all variants of TF-QKD require perfect vacuum sources, but in the real world experiments there is no practical perfect vacuum source. Instead, experimenters use extremely weak sources to substitute vacuum sources, which may break the security of the protocol. Here we propose an SNS protocol with imperfect vacuum sources and give the non-asymptotic decoy-state analysis of this protocol. Our numerical simulation shows that when the imperfect vacuum sources are close to perfect vacuum sources, our protocol can obtain similar key rate as that with perfect vacuum sources. This is the first result that closes the potential security loophole due to imperfect vacuum of TF-QKD.

TI A note on Schmidt-number witnesses based on symmetric measurements
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The Schmidt number is an important kind of characterization of quantum entanglement. Quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers demonstrate significant advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. By deriving a class of k-positive linear maps based on symmetric measurements, we present new Schmidt-number witnesses of class (k+1). By detailed example, we show that our Schmidt number witnesses identify better the Schmidt number of quantum states in high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we note that the Fedorov ratio, which coincides with the Schmidt number for pure Gaussian states and provides a close approximation in non-Gaussian cases such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, serves as an experimentally accessible tool for validating the proposed (k+1)-class Schmidt-number witnesses.

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Based on N-APSK
   Modulation over Seawater Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB A continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) can be realized over the seawater channel, but the transmission of quantum signals in seawater media exhibits significant attenuation effects. Therefore, we propose an N-symbol amplitude and phase shift keying (N-APSK) modulation scheme to enhance the transmission performance of the CVQKD over the seawater channel. Specifically, an optimal N-APSK modulation scheme is designed based on the principle of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance (MED). The simulation results show that the CVQKD protocol based on N-APSK modulation achieves a longer transmission distance over the seawater channel compared to the Gaussian modulation protocol. Additionally, increasing the value of N simultaneously expands the number of rings in the constellation diagram, further enhancing the communication distance. This study transfers modulation methods from the field of classical communications to the field of quantum communications, achieving a substantial improvement in communication distance and thereby promoting the integration of quantum communications and classical communications.

TI Land Cover Classification From Sentinel-2 Images With Quantum-Classical
   Convolutional Neural Networks
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Exploiting machine learning techniques to automatically classify multispectral remote sensing imagery plays a significant role in deriving changes on the Earth's surface. However, the computation power required to manage large Earth observation data and apply sophisticated machine learning models for this analysis purpose has become an intractable bottleneck. Leveraging quantum computing provides a possibility to tackle this challenge in the future. This article focuses on land cover classification by analyzing Sentinel-2 images with quantum computing. Two hybrid quantum-classical deep learning frameworks are proposed. Both models exploit quantum computing to extract features efficiently from multispectral images and classical computing for final classification. As proof of concept, numerical simulation results on the LCZ42 dataset through the TensorFlow Quantum platform verify our models' validity. The experiments indicate that our models can extract features more effectively compared with their classical counterparts, specifically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our models demonstrated improvements, with an average test accuracy increase of 4.5% and 3.3%, respectively, in comparison to the CNN model. In addition, our proposed models exhibit better transferability and robustness than CNN models.

TI FPGA-Based Implementation of an Underwater Quantum Key Distribution
   System With BB84 Protocol
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB As threats in the maritime domain diversify, securing data transmission becomes critical for underwater wireless networks designed for the surveillance of critical infrastructure and maritime border protection. This has sparked interest in underwater Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). In this paper, we present an FPGA-based real-time implementation of an underwater QKD system based on the BB84 protocol. The QKD unit is built on a hybrid computation system consisting of an FPGA and an on-board computer (OBC) interfaced with optical front-ends. A real-time photon counting module is implemented on FPGA. The transmitter and receiver units are powered with external UPS and all system parameters can be monitored from the connected computers. The system is equipped with a visible laser and an alignment indicator to validate successful manual alignment. Secure key distribution at a rate of 100 qubits per second was successfully tested over a link distance of 7 meters.

TI Wavelet-Based Quantum Sensing of Geomagnetic Fluctuations With Multiple
   NV Ensembles
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles are viable magnetometers to be implemented on nanosatellites for monitoring geomagnetic fluctuations, which are credible precursors for predicting earthquakes at short notice. In this work, a Haar wavelet-based quantum sensing method is proposed to reconstruct the time-varying waveform of geomagnetic fluctuations in the very low frequency band. To collect different frequency components of fluctuations waveform at once, we propose a schematic to employ multiple NV ensembles (NVEs), with each controlled by an independent microwave source. Berry sequences are applied on one set of NVEs to extract the scaling coefficients from accumulated geometric phases to reconstruct near-dc components of a waveform. Spin-echo sequences are applied to another set of NVEs to extract the Haar wavelet coefficients from the dynamic phases to reconstruct high-frequency components. The efficacy of the proposed sensing protocol implemented on multiple NVEs is validated by reconstructing a waveform of geomagnetic fluctuations from a DEMETER satellite dataset through simulations. Each NVE is assumed to contain $N = 10<^>{8}$ uncorrelated NV centers. The application of a Berry sequence to each NVE can achieve the maximum detectable magnetic field of over $460 \ \mu$T, resolving the issues of phase ambiguity and hyperfine-induced detuning if conventional Ramsey sequence were applied. The feasibility of the proposed simulation scenario considering spin-bath noise within an NVE is justified by simulations. The effects of wavelet scales, Rabi frequency in Berry sequence, and number of NV centers in each NVE are analyzed. The proposed NVE quantum sensors operated with the proposed sensing protocol can be installed on nanosatellites to monitor global geomagnetic fluctuations, with sub-$\mu$s temporal resolution in the near future.

TI Topology-Abstraction-Based Protection Scheme in Quantum Key Distribution
   Networks with Partially Trusted Relays
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can protect the exchange process of confidential information between communicating parties. By using the basic principles of quantum mechanics and combined with "one-time pad" cipher encryption, information can be unconditionally secure. The BB84 protocol first describes the method of transmitting information by photon polarization state, and it expounds the transmission process of services between trusted relays. However, due to the defects of real experimental devices, there are security vulnerabilities in QKD in a real system. The birth of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) protocol solves the problem, providing immunity to hacker attacks at the end of the detector. It can enable both sides of the transmission service to establish a connection and generate secret keys through an untrusted relay node to ensure information security. However, the types and properties of link nodes in quantum key distribution network (QKDN) based on partially trusted relay are more complex, which can easily result in network fault. Therefore, how to prevent the impact of failure on QKDN has become an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose a protection scheme for QKDN with partially trusted relays. The method deals with trusted and untrusted relays differently and constructs the working and protection paths of the secret key for each service. It reduces resource conflict between the protection and working paths by establishing a key protection threshold, which realizes the resource trade-off between the two factors. Simulation results show that the scheme provides effective protection to the services, and it improves the stability and reliability of QKDN based on partially trusted relay.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Algorithmic Fairness and the Advancement of AI
   Integrity and Responsibility
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In the evolving digital landscape, the pervasive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on social media platforms reveals a compelling paradox: the capability to provide personalized experiences juxtaposed with inherent biases reminiscent of human imperfections. Such biases prompt rigorous contemplation on matters of fairness, equity, and societal ramifications, and penetrate the foundational essence of AI. Within this intricate context, the present work ventures into novel domains by examining the potential of quantum computing as a viable remedy for bias in artificial intelligence. The conceptual framework of the quantum sentinel is presented-an innovative approach that employs quantum principles for the detection and scrutiny of biases in AI algorithms. Furthermore, the study poses and investigates the question of whether the integration of advanced quantum computing to address AI bias is seen as an excessive measure or a requisite advancement commensurate with the intricacy of the issue. By intertwining quantum mechanics, AI bias, and the philosophical considerations they induce, this research fosters a discourse on the journey toward ethical AI, thus establishing a foundation for an ethically conscious and balanced digital environment. We also show that the quantum Zeno effect can protect SVM hyperplanes from bias through targeted simulations.

TI Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle
   interactions
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires the same von Neumann entanglement entropy generation for either a particle interaction or an act of measurement. For the first time, the language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. We show that unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. We also show the language of relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation for the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and an additional entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle. This article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics such as correlations and mutual information for any particle interaction.

TI Quantum channels and the entropic uncertainty relation in two-level
   harmonic oscillator superposition states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The Shannon information entropy sum is examined as systems comprised of two-level harmonic oscillator states are passed through dephasing and depolarization quantum channels. We show how the entropy sum increases as the dephasing parameter is increased. The interpretation here is a loss of information in the system as the quantum coherences are removed. This result and interpretation also holds in the depolarization channel as the system transits to the maximally mixed state. The increase in the entropy sum is associated with a delocalization of both position and momentum densities. The behaviour of phase-space Wigner functions and their Shannon entropies is also addressed. Wigner negativity is seen to decrease and disappear with an increase of the dephasing parameter. Here, Wigner negativity is associated with the presence of quantum coherences. The imaginary component of the Wigner function entropy is shown to capture the changes in Wigner negativity. On the other hand, Wigner functions with diagonal input density matrices are non-negative in the depolarization channel. Their real-valued Shannon entropies increase with the depolarization parameter as the system approaches the maximally mixed state. The mutual information between the Wigner function and the product of position and momentum space densities is used to probe the statistical correlation between position and momentum variables. This measure decreases in both channels as the parameter increases. Thus, there is a loss of correlation as quantum coherences are eliminated in the dephasing case, and as the system transits to the maximally mixed case in the depolarizing channel.

TI Quantum-inspired algorithm for direct multi-class classification
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Over the last few decades, quantum machine learning has emerged as a groundbreaking discipline. Harnessing the peculiarities of quantum computation for machine learning tasks offers promising advantages. Quantum-inspired machine learning has revealed how relevant benefits for machine learning problems can be obtained using the quantum information theory even without employing quantum computers. In the recent past, experiments have demonstrated how to design an algorithm for binary classification inspired by the method of quantum state discrimination, which exhibits high performance with respect to several standard classifiers. However, a generalization of this quantum-inspired binary classifier to a multi-class scenario remains nontrivial. Typically, a simple solution in machine learning decomposes multi-class classification into a combinatorial number of binary classifications, with a concomitant increase in computational resources. In this study, we introduce a quantum-inspired classifier that avoids this problem. Inspired by quantum state discrimination, our classifier performs multi-class classification directly without using binary classifiers. We first compared the performance of the quantum-inspired multi-class classifier with eleven standard classifiers. The comparison revealed an excellent performance of the quantum-inspired classifier. Comparing these results with those obtained using the decomposition in binary classifiers shows that our method improves the accuracy and reduces the time complexity. Therefore, the quantum-inspired machine learning algorithm proposed in this work is an effective and efficient framework for multi-class classification. Finally, although these advantages can be attained without employing any quantum component in the hardware, we discuss how it is possible to implement the model in quantum hardware.

TI Sensing of magnetic field effects in radical-pair reactions using a
   quantum sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magnetic field effects (MFE) in certain chemical reactions have been well established in the last five decades and are attributed to the evolution of transient radical pairs whose spin dynamics are determined by local and external magnetic fields. The majority of existing experimental techniques used to probe these reactions only provide ensemble averaged reaction parameters and spin chemistry, hindering the observation of the potential presence of quantum coherent phenomena at the single molecule scale. Here, considering a single nitrogenvacancy (NV) center as quantum sensor, we investigate the prospects and requirements for the detection of MFEs on the spin dynamics of radical pairs at the scale of a single and small ensembles of molecules. We employ elaborate and realistic models of radical pairs, considering their coupling to the local spin environment and the sensor. For two model systems, we derive signals of MFE detectable even in the weak coupling regime between a radical pair and an NV quantum sensor and observe that the dynamics of certain populations, as well as coherence elements, of the density matrix of the radical pair are directly detectable. Our investigations will provide important guidelines for the potential detection of spin chemistry of biomolecules at the scale of a single and small ensembles of molecules.

TI Digital-Analog Quantum Simulations Using the Cross-Resonance Effect
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Digital-analog quantum computation aims to reduce the currently infeasible resource requirements needed for near-term quantum information processing by replacing sequences of one- and two-qubit gates with a unitary transformation generated by the systems' underlying Hamiltonian. Inspired by this paradigm, we consider superconducting architectures and extend the cross-resonance effect, up to first order in perturbation theory, from a two-qubit interaction to an analog Hamiltonian acting on one-dimensional (1D) chains and two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, which, in an appropriate reference frame, results in a purely two-local Hamiltonian. By augmenting the analog Hamiltonian dynamics with single-qubit gates we show how one may generate a larger variety of distinct analog Hamiltonians. We then synthesize unitary sequences, in which we toggle between the various analog Hamiltonians as needed, simulating the dynamics of Ising, XY, and Heisenberg spin models. Our dynamics simulations are Trotter error-free for the Ising and XY models in 1D. We also show that the Trotter errors for 2D XY and 1D Heisenberg chains are reduced, with respect to a digital decomposition, by a constant factor. In order to realize these important near-term speedups, we discuss the practical considerations needed to accurately characterize and calibrate our analog Hamiltonians for use in quantum simulations. We conclude with a discussion of how the Hamiltonian toggling techniques could be extended to derive new analog Hamiltonians, which may be of use in more complex digital-analog quantum simulations for various models of interacting spins.

TI Explicit Formulas for Estimating Trace of Reduced Density Matrix Powers
   via Single-Circuit Measurement Probabilities
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum information science, the traces of reduced density matrix powers play a crucial role in the study of quantum systems and have numerous important applications. In this study, a universal framework is proposed to simultaneously estimate the traces of the 2nd to the n$n$th powers of a reduced density matrix using a single quantum circuit with n$n$ copies of the quantum state. Specifically, this approach leverages the controlled SWAP test and establishes explicit formulas connecting measurement probabilities to these traces. Further, two algorithms are developed: a purely quantum method and a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Newton-Girard iteration. Rigorous analysis via Hoeffding inequality demonstrates the method's efficiency, requiring only M=O1 epsilon 2log(n delta)$M=O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon <^>2}\log (\frac{n}{\delta })\right)$ measurements to achieve precision epsilon$\epsilon$ with confidence 1-delta$1-\delta$. Additionally, various applications are explored including the estimation of nonlinear functions and the representation of entanglement measures. Numerical simulations are conducted for two maximally entangled states, the GHZ state and the W state, to validate the proposed method.

AB This research focuses on strain-free GaSb/AlGaSb quantum dots (QDs) grown via local droplet etching (LDE) for their potential in quantum photonic applications. These QDs exhibit excitonic emission in the telecom S-band with a narrow ensemble emission linewidth. Through theoretical modeling in addition to previous photoluminescence experiments, the study investigates the electronic band structure, dipole transitions, and dimensions of the GaSb/AlGaSb QDs. Key findings include insights into the indirect-direct bandgap crossover based on QD dimensions and the comparison of dipole transitions with photoluminescence measurements. The results contribute to the practical integration of these QDs in quantum photonic devices and fiber optics-based quantum key distribution networks.

AB In local local oscillator (LLO)-based continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), a difference between the linewidth values of two free-running lasers at Alice and Bob induces a phase drift noise. This work proposes a novel minimax filter-based phase tracking that aims to minimize the phase drift considering maximum residual phase error to achieve optimal phase estimation. Simulation results show that the minimax filter offers a lower phase estimation mean square error (MSE) value compared to the Kalman filter when worst-case phase drift error due to high linewidth difference or high measurement noise values are considered.

TI Localization measures of parity adapted U(D)-spin coherent states
   applied to the phase space analysis of the D-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study phase space properties of critical, parity symmetric, N-qudit systems undergoing a quantum phase transition (QPT) in the thermodynamic N & INFIN; limit. The D = 3 level (qutrit) Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is eventually examined as a particular example. For this purpose, we consider U(D )-spin coherent states (DSCS), generalizing the standard D = 2 atomic coherent states, to define the coherent state representation Q & psi; (Husimi function) of a symmetric N-qudit state |& psi;) in the phase space CPD-1 (complex projective manifold). DSCS are good variational approximations to the ground state of an N-qudit system, especially in the N & INFIN; limit, where the discrete parity symmetry ZD-1 2 is spontaneously broken. For finite N, parity can be restored by projecting DSCS onto 2D-1 different parity invariant subspaces, which define generalized "Schrodinger cat states" reproducing quite faithfully low-lying Hamiltonian eigenstates obtained by numerical diagonalization. Precursors of the QPT are then visualized for finite N by plotting the Husimi function of these parity projected DSCS in phase space, together with their Husimi moments and Wehrl entropy, in the neighborhood of the critical points. These are good localization measures and markers of the QPT.

TI Inverse engineering for robust state transport along a spin chain via
   low-energy subspaces
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum state transfer (QST) plays a central role in the field of quantum computation and communication, but its quality will be deteriorated by the ubiquitous variations and noise in quantum systems. Here we propose robust and nonadiabatic protocols for transmitting quantum state across a strongly coupled spin chain, especially in the presence of unwanted disorders in the couplings. To this end, we approximately map the low-energy subspaces of the odd-size Heisenberg chain to a two-level system, and derive the sensitivity of the final fidelity with respect to systematic deviations or time-varying fluctuations. Subsequently, leveraging the flexibility of the inverse-engineering technique, we optimize the state-transfer robustness concerning these perturbations individually. The resulting schemes allow for more stable QST than the original accelerated schemes and only require manipulating the two boundary couplings instead of the whole system, which open up the possibility of fast and robust information transfer in spin-based quantum systems.

AB We define a variation on the well-known problem of private message transmission. This new problem called private randomness agreement (PRA) gives two participants access to a public, authenticated channel alongside the main channels, and the 'message' is not fixed a priori. Instead, the participants' aim to agree on a random string completely unknown to a computationally unbounded adversary. We define privacy and reliability, and show that PRA cannot be solved in a single round. We then show that it can be solved in three rounds, albeit with exponential cost, and give an efficient four-round protocol based on polynomial evaluation.

TI Quantum circuits for SU(3) lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure SU(3) gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multicontrolled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.

SO ICT EXPRESS
AB Although quantum mechanics guarantees the security of the quantum key distribution system, it is crucial to examine whether the implementation flaws can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. In this paper, we propose the side-channel attack on the key reconciliation in the quantum key distribution system. In this system, the sifted key and the syndrome are used to derive a shared secret key between two users. From our attack, these can be fully recovered through a single power consumption trace measured during the syndrome computation on the sender's side. Additionally, we propose efficient countermeasures to thwart such side-channel attacks. (C) 2021 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS).

TI Emerging GaN technologies for power, RF, digital, and quantum computing
   applications: Recent advances and prospects
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB GaN technology is not only gaining traction in power and RF electronics but is also rapidly expanding into other application areas including digital and quantum computing electronics. This paper provides a glimpse of future GaN device technologies and advanced modeling approaches that can push the boundaries of these applications in terms of performance and reliability. While GaN power devices have recently been commercialized in the 15-900 V classes, new GaN devices are greatly desirable to explore both higher-voltage and ultra-low-voltage power applications. Moving into the RF domain, ultra-high frequency GaN devices are being used to implement digitized power amplifier circuits, and further advances using the hardware-software co-design approach can be expected. On the horizon is the GaN CMOS technology, a key missing piece to realize the full-GaN platform with integrated digital, power, and RF electronics technologies. Although currently a challenge, high-performance p-type GaN technology will be crucial to realize high-performance GaN CMOS circuits. Due to its excellent transport characteristics and ability to generate free carriers via polarization doping, GaN is expected to be an important technology for ultra-low temperature and quantum computing electronics. Finally, given the increasing cost of hardware prototyping of new devices and circuits, the use of high-fidelity device models and data-driven modeling approaches for technology-circuit co-design are projected to be the trends of the future. In this regard, physically inspired, mathematically robust, less computationally taxing, and predictive modeling approaches are indispensable. With all these and future efforts, we envision GaN to become the next Si for electronics.

TI Realization of higher-order topological lattices on a quantum computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Programmable quantum simulators may one day outperform classical computers at certain tasks. But at present, the range of viable applications with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains limited by gate errors and the number of high-quality qubits. Here, we develop an approach that places digital NISQ hardware as a versatile platform for simulating multi-dimensional condensed matter systems. Our method encodes a high-dimensional lattice in terms of many-body interactions on a reduced-dimension model, thereby taking full advantage of the exponentially large Hilbert space of the host quantum system. With circuit optimization and error mitigation techniques, we measured on IBM superconducting quantum processors the topological state dynamics and protected mid-gap spectra of higher-order topological lattices, in up to four dimensions, with high accuracy. Our projected resource requirements scale favorably with system size and lattice dimensionality compared to classical computation, suggesting a possible route to useful quantum advantage in the longer term.
   Previous quantum simulations of higher-order topological phases have utilized synthetic dimensions. Here the authors simulate high-order topological phases on lattices with spatial dimension up to four on a superconducting quantum computer using a mapping to a many-body Hamiltonian in a reduced dimension.

TI Modulation leakage-free continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Distributing cryptographic keys over public channels in a way that can provide information-theoretic security is the holy grail for secure communication. This can be achieved by exploiting quantum mechanical principles in so-called quantum key distribution (QKD). Continuous-variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states, in particular, is an attractive scheme for secure communication since it requires only standard telecommunication technology that can operate at room temperature. However, a recently discovered side-channel created in the process of state preparation leads to a leakage of information about the transmitted quantum state, opening a security loophole for eavesdroppers to compromise the security of the CVQKD system. Here, we present a CVQKD system without this modulation leakage vulnerability. Our implementation is based on a baseband modulation approach and uses an in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulator for state preparation and radio frequency heterodyne detection together with carefully designed digital signal processing for state measurement. We consider practical aspects in the implementation and demonstrate the generation of a composable secret key secure against collective attacks. This work is a step towards protecting CVQKD systems against practical imperfections of physical devices and operational limitations without performance degradation.

TI Multi-NARP laser driving scheme for multiplexed quantum networks
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We extend the recently developed Notch-filtered Adiabatic Rapid Passage (NARP) scheme for laser-triggered single-photon sources to the simultaneous excitation of multiple emitters with varying transition energies, laying the groundwork for wavelength-division multiplexing in quantum optical networks. Our multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.

TI Optical Charge State Manipulation of Lead-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond exhibit excellent optical and spin coherence properties, making them highly promising and scalable spin qubit candidates. Since only specific charge states are magneto-optically active, control over the charge state is fundamental for quantum applications. Here, we realize the charge state control of lead-vacancy centers (PbV) through multicolor laser irradiation. We achieve tunable population manipulation of the negatively charged state from 0 to 89%, paving the way for spin control of the negatively charged PbV center. Furthermore, through analysis of charge state dynamics, we propose a charge cycle between the neutral and negatively charged states, indicating a possible pathway to the neutral PbV center with a spin-1 system.

TI Microscopic theory of a magnetic-field-tuned sweet spot of exchange
   interactions in multielectron quantum-dot systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The exchange interaction in a singlet-triplet qubit defined by two-electron states in the double-quantum-dot system (???two-electron singlet-triplet qubit???) typically varies monotonically with the exchange interaction and thus carries no sweet spot. Here we study a singlet-triplet qubit defined by four-electron states in the doublequantum-dot system (???four-electron singlet-triplet qubit???). We demonstrate, using configuration-interaction calculations, that in the four-electron singlet-triplet qubit the exchange energy as a function of detuning can be nonmonotonic, suggesting existence of sweet spots. We further show that the tuning of the sweet spot and the corresponding exchange energy by perpendicular magnetic field can be related to the variation of orbital splitting. Our results suggest that a singlet-triplet qubit with more than two electrons can have advantages in the realization of quantum computing.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB An accurate assessment of how quantum computers can be used for chemical simulation, especially their potential computational advantages, provides important context on how to deploy these future devices. To perform this assessment reliably, quantum resource estimates must be coupled with classical computations attempting to answer relevant chemical questions and to define the classical algorithms simulation frontier. Herein, we explore the quantum computation and classical computation resources required to assess the electronic structure of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and thus define a classical-quantum advantage boundary. This is accomplished by analyzing the convergence of density matrix renormalization group plus n-electron valence state perturbation theory (DMRG+NEVPT2) and coupled-cluster singles doubles with noniterative triples [CCSD(T)] calculations for spin gaps in models of the CYP catalytic cycle that indicate multireference character. The quantum resources required to perform phase estimation using qubitized quantum walks are calculated for the same systems. Compilation into the surface code provides runtime estimates to compare directly toDMRGruntimes and to evaluate potential quantum advantage. Both classical and quantum resource estimates suggest that simulation of CYP models at scales large enough to balance dynamic and multiconfigurational electron correlation has the potential to be a quantum advantage problem and emphasizes the important interplay between classical computations and quantum algorithms development for chemical simulation.

TI Quantum Speed Limit for a Moving Qubit inside a Leaky Cavity
SO PHOTONICS
AB The quantum speed limit (QSL) is a theoretical lower bound of the time required for a quantum system to evolve from an arbitrary initial state to its orthogonal counterpart. This figure can be used to characterize the dynamics of open quantum systems, including non-Markovian maps. In this paper, we investigate the QSL time for a model that consists of a single qubit moving inside a leaky cavity. Notably, we show that for both weak and strong coupling regimes, the QSL time increases while we boost the velocity of the qubit inside the leaky cavity. Moreover, it is observed that by increasing the qubit velocity, the speed of the evolution tends to a constant value, and the system becomes more stable. The results provide a better understanding of the dynamics of atom-photon couplings and can be used to enhance the controllability of quantum systems.

TI Fast high-fidelity single-qubit gates for flip-flop qubits in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The flip-flop qubit, encoded in the states with antiparallel donor-bound electron and donor nuclear spins in sil-icon, showcases long coherence times, good controllability, and, in contrast to other donor-spin-based schemes, long-distance coupling. Electron spin control near the interface, however, is likely to shorten the relaxation time by many orders of magnitude, reducing the overall qubit quality factor. Here, we theoretically study the multilevel system that is formed by the interacting electron and nuclear spins and derive analytical effective two-level Hamiltonians with and without periodic driving. We then propose an optimal control scheme that produces fast and robust single-qubit gates in the presence of low-frequency noise without relying on parametrically restrictive sweet spots. This scheme increases considerably both the relaxation time and the qubit quality factor.

TI Qubit-efficient encoding schemes for binary optimisation problems
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose and analyze a set of variational quantum algorithms for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems where a problem consisting of n(c) classical variables can l:x implemented on O(log n(c)) number of qubits. The underlying encoding scheme allows for a systematic increase in correlations among the classical variables captured by a variational quantum state by progressively increasing the number of qubits involved. We first examine the simplest limit where all correlations are neglected, i.e. when the quantum state can only describe statistically independent classical variables. We apply this minimal encoding to find approximate solutions of a general problem instance comprised of 64 classical variables using 7 qubits. Next, we show how two-body correlations between the classical variables can be incorporated in the variational quantum state and how it can improve the quality of the approximate solutions. We give an example by solving a 42-variable Max-Cut problem using only 8 qubits where we exploit the specific topology of the problem. We analyze whether these cases can be optimized efficiently given the limited resources available in state-of-the-art quantum platforms. Lastly, we present the general framework for extending the expressibility of the probability distribution to any multi-body correlations. Our encoding scheme allows current generations of quantum hardware to explore the boundaries of classical intractability involving real world problem sizes, and can be implemented on currently available quantum hardware across various platforms, requiring only few dozens of qubits.

TI Secure and Scalable Internet of Things Model Using Post-Quantum MACsec
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB For the secure deployment of network platforms tailored for IoT devices, the encryption of data transmission is equally as crucial as the process of authentication. In this context, we introduce the Secure and Scalable IoT network (SSI) network platform, designed to accommodate a diverse range of IoT devices. It provides scalability and implements effective many-to-many and end-to-end encryption across extensive regions. With the emergence of quantum computing, secure public key exchange mechanisms have become important. Among the various post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms assessed, Nth Degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRUs) have emerged as an optimally suited PQC algorithm for IoT devices constrained by limited computational capabilities. We have integrated NTRUs with SSI as a lightweight PQC solution. Moreover, SSI-PQM (Post-Quantum MACsec) enhances the SSI's initial authentication structure to minimize PQC-TLS session attempts and protect the SSI's important configuration information. When applying TLS with PQC for secret key exchange purposes, it was verified that this approach ensures stable performance in IoT environments. Upon the implementation of our proposed SSI-PQM on Raspberry Pi 3B+ based IoT devices, SSI-PQM exhibited acceptable performance at security levels from 80 to 128 and achieved a minimum speed improvement of 161% over RSA at security levels above 160. It can be concluded that SSI-PQM stands out as an effective Zero Trust-based IoT network platform, demonstrating its viability and efficiency in safeguarding data transmission against potential quantum computing threats.

AB High-dimensional (HD) quantum systems are capable of processing more complex information and performing a wider array of quantum operations, in contrast to low-dimensional (LD) quantum systems, thereby improving the speed and fault tolerance of quantum computing. In the study, we propose a deterministic qudit-encoded 4x4x4\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$4\times 4\times 4$\end{document}-dimensional (64D) controlled-controlled-SUM (CCSUM) gate based on weak Kerr effect. The 64D CCSUM gate leverages the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of three photons to encode 4D control and target qudits, thereby optimizing quantum resources and reducing costs. Moreover, the HD CCSUM gate functionality is implemented in a deterministic way by employing the X-Homodyne detector to measure coherent states, combined with related classical feed-forward operations. Through detailed analyses, the proposed HD CCSUM gate, under current technological conditions, exhibits robust fidelity and feasibility, offering a promising path toward the realization of HD quantum computing.

This is the first time this important application in bioinformatics is modeled using quantum computation. Each one of the four steps of the implementation (TSP, QUBO, Hamiltonians and QAOA) is explained with a proof-of-concept example to target both the genomics research community and quantum application developers in a self-contained manner. The implementation and results on executing the algorithm from a set of DNA reads to a reconstructed sequence, on a gate-based quantum simulator, the D-Wave quantum annealing simulator and hardware are detailed. We also highlight the limitations of current classical simulation and available quantum hardware systems. The implementation is open-source and can be found on https://github.com/QE-Lab/QuASeR.

TI Optically Heralded Entanglement of Superconducting Systems in Quantum
   Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Networking superconducting quantum computers is a longstanding challenge in quantum science. The typical approach has been to cascade transducers: converting to optical frequencies at the transmitter and to microwave frequencies at the receiver. However, the small microwave-optical coupling and added noise have proven formidable obstacles. Instead, we propose optical networking via heralding end-to-end entanglement with one detected photon and teleportation. This new protocol can be implemented on standard transduction hardware while providing significant performance improvements over transduction. In contrast to cascaded direct transduction, our scheme absorbs the low optical-microwave coupling efficiency into the heralding step, thus breaking the rate-fidelity trade-off. Moreover, this technique unifies and simplifies entanglement generation between superconducting devices and other physical modalities in quantum networks.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning in latent observation
   spaces
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Recent progress in quantum machine learning has sparked interest in using quantum methods to tackle classical control problems via quantum reinforcement learning. However, the classical reinforcement learning environments often scale to high-dimensional problem spaces, which represents a challenge for the limited and costly resources available for quantum agent implementations. We propose to solve this dimensionality challenge by a classical autoencoder and a quantum agent together, where a compressed representation of observations is jointly learned in a hybrid training loop. The latent representation of such an autoencoder will serve as a tailored observation space best suited for both the control problem and the QPU architecture, aligning with the agent's requirements. A series of numerical experiments are designed for a performance analysis of the latent space learning method. Results are presented for different control problems and for both photonic (continuous-variable) and qubit-based agents, to show how the QNN learning process is improved by the joint training.

We analytically and numerically study the properties of the Floquet vortex states, with methods analogous to the ones previously applied to the analysis of superconducting vortex states. We show that such Floquet vortex states are similar to superconducting vortex states, and they exhibit a wide range of tunability. To illustrate the potential utility of such tunability, we show how such states could be used for quantum state engineering.

TI Microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor
   logic
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (similar to 10 mu W at similar to 10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately -80 dBm and on/off ratio of similar to 40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.

AB In current quantum computers, most qubit control electronics are connected to the qubit chip inside the cryostat by cables at room temperature. This poses a challenge when scaling the quantum chip to an increasing number of qubits. We present a lateral nanowire network 1-to-4 demultiplexer design fabricated by selective area grown InGaAs on InP, suitable for on chip routing of DC current for qubit biasing. We have characterized the device at cryogenic temperatures, and at 40 mK the device exhibits a minimum inverse subthreshold slope of 2 mV/dec, which is encouraging for low power operation. At low drain bias, the transmission breaks up into several resonance peaks due to a rough conduction band edge; this is qualitatively explained by a simple model based on a 1D real space tight-binding nonequilibrium Green's functions model.

TI Depth-Optimization of Quantum Cryptanalysis on Binary Elliptic Curves
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents quantum cryptanalysis for binary elliptic curves from a time-efficient implementation perspective (i.e., reducing the circuit depth), complementing the previous research that focuses on the space-efficiency perspective (i.e., reducing the circuit width). To achieve depth optimization, we propose an improvement to the existing circuit implementation of the Karatsuba multiplier and FLT-based inversion, then construct and analyze the resource in the Qiskit quantum computer simulator. The proposed multiplier architecture, which improves the quantum Karatsuba multiplier from the previous study, reduces the depth and yields a lower number of CNOT gates that bound to O(n(log2)(3)) while maintaining a similar number of Toffoli gates and qubits. Furthermore, our improved FLT-based inversion reduces CNOT count and overall depth, with a tradeoff of higher qubit size. Finally, we employ the proposed multiplier and FLTbased inversion for performing quantum cryptanalysis of binary point addition as well as the complete Shor's algorithm for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). As a result, apart from depth reduction, we are also able to reduce up to 90% of the Toffoli gates required in a single-step point addition compared to prior work, leading to significant improvements and giving new insights on quantum cryptanalysis for a depth-optimized implementation.

TI Genome assembly using quantum and quantum-inspired annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent advances in DNA sequencing open prospects to make whole-genome analysis rapid and reliable, which is promising for various applications including personalized medicine. However, existing techniques for de novo genome assembly, which is used for the analysis of genomic rearrangements, chromosome phasing, and reconstructing genomes without a reference, require solving tasks of high computational complexity. Here we demonstrate a method for solving genome assembly tasks with the use of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization techniques. Within this method, we present experimental results on genome assembly using quantum annealers both for simulated data and the phi X 174 bacteriophage. Our results pave a way for a significant increase in the efficiency of solving bioinformatics problems with the use of quantum computing technologies and, in particular, quantum annealing might be an effective method. We expect that the new generation of quantum annealing devices would outperform existing techniques for de novo genome assembly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study of de novo genome assembly problems both for real and synthetic data on quantum annealing devices and quantum-inspired techniques.

TI Phase compensation of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution via
   temporal convolutional neural network
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Although the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol based on a local local oscillator (LLO) can close all the security loopholes from the transmitted local oscillator (TLO), the phase noise caused by the inaccurate phase reference information limits the performance of the protocol. To reduce the residual phase noise, in this work, we propose a phase estimation and compensation method based on the temporal convolutional neural (TCN) model, where a part of phase information obtained by measuring pilot pulses is employed as the training data and input into the TCN module. With a trained TCN module, the subsequent phase drifts can be more accurately estimated, allowing for better phase compensation and lower phase noise. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme can improve the transmission distance and the secret key rate of the LLO protocol.

AB There are several groups have implemented polarization encoding measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD). However, these groups use manual polarization controller to achieve the initial polarization state for encoders, and some of the encoders cannot fully satisfy the two bases for polarization encoding quantum key distribution. Here, we apply an all-fiber and calibration-free intrinsically stable polarization-modulated unit (APMU), which can maintain stable encoding for several hours without any calibration. A proof-of-principle demonstration of MDI-QKD based on our APMU is implemented with the four-intensity decoy state protocol. The proposed APMU can realize stable MDI-QKD encoding and simplify the operation for Alice and Bob, which makes the polarization encoding MDI-QKD more practical.

TI Multi-frequency composite pulse sequences for sensitivity enhancement in
   hexagonal boron nitride quantum sensor
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB A negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently started to be used as a magnetic sensor. However, V-B has magnetic resonance spectra broadened by hyperfine interactions, which decreases the signal contrast and thus degrades the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we propose multi-frequency composite pulse sequences to enhance the contrast of the measurement signal in the Rabi oscillation. We demonstrate that the sequence using five microwave frequencies enhances the signal contrast, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 2.3 compared to the conventional sequence.

TI Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Approaches to Protein-Ligand Binding
   Affinity Prediction
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Drug repositioning is a less expensive and time-consuming method than the traditional method of drug discovery. It is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. A key strategy in repositioning approved or investigational drugs is determining the binding affinity of these drugs to target proteins. The large increase in available experimental data has helped deep learning methods to demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional prediction and other traditional computational methods in precise binding affinity prediction. However, these methods are complex and time-consuming, presenting a significant barrier to their development and practical application. In this context, quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) theoretically offer promising solutions to effectively address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework to predict binding affinity. Our approach involves, initially, the implementation of an efficient classical model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and three fully connected layers for prediction. Subsequently, retaining the classical module for feature extraction, we implement various quantum and classical modules for binding affinity prediction, which accept the concatenated features as input. Quantum predicted modules are implemented with Variational Quantum Regressions (VQRs), while classical predicted modules are implemented with various fully connected layers. Our findings clearly show that hybrid quantum-classical models accelerate the training process in terms of epochs and achieve faster stabilization. Also, these models demonstrate quantum superiority in terms of complexity, accuracy, and generalization, thereby indicating a promising direction for QML.

TI Efficient information reconciliation in quantum key distribution systems
   using informed design of non-binary LDPC codes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In quantum key distribution (QKD), two users extract a shared secret key using a quantum communication channel in the presence of an eavesdropper. Among QKD protocols, the ones based on energy-time (ET) entanglement of photons have been studied extensively due to their ability to generate high key rates from the arrival times of entangled photons. For the information reconciliation (IR) stage of ET-QKD protocols (where the users communicate using a classical channel in order to reconcile differences in their data), a scheme called multi-level coding (MLC) was proposed by Zhou et al. in prior work. The MLC scheme splits the raw key symbols into bit layers and utilizes binary low-density parity check (LDPC) codes to encode each layer. Although binary LDPC codes are able to offer low complexity decoding for IR, they have poor error-correcting performance compared to their non-binary counterparts, thus leading to low key rates. Additionally, existing LDPC codes do not fully utilize the properties of the QKD channel to optimize the key rates. In this paper, we mitigate the above issues by proposing a flexible protocol for IR in ET-QKD systems called non-binary multi-level coding NB-MLC(a) which is parameterized by a positive integer a. The NB-MLC(a) protocol is a generalization of the MLC scheme and utilizes NB-LDPC codes from a Galois field of size 2 a \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>a$$\end{document} . We show that by using a small value of a, the NB-MLC(a) protocol significantly improves the key rate without much increase in complexity. To further improve the key rates of the NB-MLC(a) protocol, we propose (i) a joint rate and degree distribution optimization (JRDO) algorithm to design the NB-LDPC codes for the protocol and (ii) an interleaved decoding and communication (IDC) scheme to decode the different layers of the NB-MLC(a) protocol. The JRDO algorithm is designed to use the QKD channel information, and we show that it results in a higher key rate than codes used in prior work. Additionally, the IDC scheme improves the key rate compared to the decoding and communication methods utilized previously in literature. Overall, the NB-MLC(a) protocol that uses JRDO-LDPC codes and the IDC scheme results in a significant 40-60 % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document} improvement in key rates compared to prior work for ET-QKD systems.

TI Postprocessing Variationally Scheduled Quantum Algorithm for Constrained
   Combinatorial Optimization Problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose a postprocessing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA) for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). COPs are typically transformed into ground-state search problems of the Ising model on a quantum annealer or gate-based quantum device. Variational methods are used to find an optimal schedule function that leads to high-quality solutions in a short amount of time. Postprocessing techniques convert the output solutions of the quantum devices to satisfy the constraints of the COPs. The pVSQA combines the variational methods and the postprocessing technique. We obtain a sufficient condition for constrained COPs to apply the pVSQA based on a greedy postprocessing algorithm. We apply the proposed method to two constrained NP-hard COPs: the graph partitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. The pVSQA on a simulator shows that a small number of variational parameters is sufficient to achieve a (near-) optimal performance within a predetermined operation time. Then, building upon the simulator results, we implement the pVSQA on a quantum annealer and a gate-based quantum device. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI QKDTI A quantum kernel based machine learning model for drug target
   interaction prediction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a critical task in computational drug discovery, enabling drug repurposing, precise medicine, and large-scale virtual screening. Traditional in-silico methods, such as molecular docking, classical machine learning, and deep learning, have made significant progress in addressing this issue. However, existing approaches are hindered by computational inefficiencies, reliance on manual feature engineering, and struggles to generalize across diverse molecular structures, limiting their molecular capabilities. Recent advancements in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) are paving the way for its practical applications, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in predictive accuracy, scalability, and efficiency by leveraging the unique powers of quantum computing, namely superposition and entanglement. This study proposes QKDTI - Quantum Kernel Drug-Target Interaction, a novel quantum-enhanced framework for DTI prediction. It used Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) with quantum feature mapping that takes into account a quantum feature space for molecular descriptors and allows encoding molecular and protein features, improved predictions of binding affinities. To enhance the model to be more computationally feasible, integration of the Nystrom approximation into the model allows providing an efficient kernel approximation while reducing overhead expenses. QKDTI was evaluated on benchmark datasets - Davis and KIBA, and validated independently on BindingDB. This model achieves 94.21% accuracy on DAVIS, 99.99% on KIBA, and 89.26% on BindingDB, significantly outperforming classical and other quantum models. Further, the statistical tests have been conducted on the compared models to provide the reliability of the results. This indicates that introducing quantum computing into DTI pipeline can revolutionize computational drug discovery by improving predictive accuracy and providing a better generalization over multiple datasets.

TI Rubyene: a promising platform for quantum technologies and optical
   nanosensing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB In this paper, we have investigated the optical properties of a newly synthesized material consisting of a few-nm-thin flakes of ruby ( Al2O3:Cr3+), referred to as rubyene. Both theoretical and experimental approaches focus on the photoluminescence of Cr3+, particularly exploring the effects of the refractive index of the surrounding medium on the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of the photoexcited chromium ions, and the consequences of the diverse shapes of the thin rubyene flakes. Notably, we demonstrate how such susceptibility of the radiative rates to the refractive index allows for insight into the orientation of the crystallographic axes relative to the surface of the flakes. Although the effect of the environment on the nonradiative relaxation rates is an order of magnitude smaller than its effect on the radiative rates, the achieved sensitivity of our measurements was sufficient to observe both. The presented theoretical analysis of nonradiative transitions has broader implications for F & ouml;rster-type energy transfer, especially in scenarios where the refractive index of the medium is non-uniform. Our results demonstrate good agreement between the theory and the experiment and establish the potential of rubyene in optical nanosensing applications, highlighting its sensitivity to environmental refractive index changes.

TI Optical-pumping attack on a quantum key distribution laser source
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a new type of vulnerability based on a physical principle that has not been previously exploited in quantum hacking-optical pumping of a laser in practical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. We show that it is possible to increase the pulse energy of a source laser diode not only by injection-locking it with external light near its emission wavelength of 1550 nm, but also by optically pumping it at a much shorter wavelength. We experimentally demonstrate a 10% increase in pulse energy when exposing the laser diode to continuous-wave (cw) laser light at 1310 nm with a power of 1.6 mW via its fiber pigtail. This effect may allow an eavesdropper to steal the secret key. A possible countermeasure is to install broadband optical filters and isolators at the source output and to characterize them during security certification.

TI Evaluation of quantum key distribution systems against injection-locking
   attacks
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB While ideal quantum key distribution (QKD) systems are well-understood, practical implementations face various vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks resulting from device imperfections. Current security proofs for decoy-state BB84 protocols either assume uniform phase randomization of Alice's signals, which is compromised by practical limitations and attacks like injection locking, or rely on a (partially) characterized phase distribution. This work presents an experimental method to characterize the phase de-randomization from injection locking using a heterodyne detection setup, providing a lower bound on the degree of isolation required to protect QKD transmitters against injection-locking attacks. The methods presented are source-agnostic and can be used to evaluate general QKD systems against injection-locking attacks. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Enhancing macroscopic multimode entanglement through many-body
   interactions in cavity magnomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Coherent control of many-body interactions allows the possibility of generating complex quantum states for future quantum technology. Specifically, the quantum states of the center-of-mass motion of a trapped macroscopic particle, being highly isolated from the environment, in hybrid systems is a potential platform for testing macroscopic quantum mechanics. We present a many-body interaction platform to enhance multimode Gaussian entanglement where the center-of-mass motion is coupled to a magnon through a microwave field. The strong and ultrastrong cavity-magnon couplings allow the generation of simultaneous entanglement in all bipartitions, without any pairwise entanglement, through numerical optimization of parameters, akin to quantum phase transitions in spin systems. Moreover, the ultrastrong coupling facilitates the generation of such multimode entanglement for a low-frequency oscillator in the unresolved sideband. This scheme provides a potential platform to explore the quantum effects in a large massive oscillator and paves the way for creating complex states for quantum simulation, sensing, exploring exotic quantum phases, and quantum computing.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We address a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol employing quaternary phase-shift-keying of coherent states and a non-Gaussian measurement inspired by quantum receivers minimizing the error probability in a quantum-state-discrimination scenario. We consider a pure-loss quantum wiretap channel, in which a possible eavesdropper is limited to collect the sole channel losses. We perform a characterization of state-discrimination receivers and design an optimized receiver maximizing the asymptotic secure key rate (SKR), namely the key-rate optimized receiver (KOR), comparing its performance with respect to the pretty good measurement and the heterodyne-based protocol. We show that the KOR increases the SKR for metropolitan-network distances. Finally, we also investigate the implementations of feasible schemes, such as the displacement feed-forward receiver, obtaining an increase in the SKR in particular regimes.

TI Suppression of midcircuit measurement crosstalk errors with micromotion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Midcircuit measurement and reset are crucial primitives in quantum computation, but such operations require strong interactions with selected qubits while maintaining isolation of neighboring qubits, which is a significant challenge in many systems. For trapped ion systems, measurement is performed with laser-induced fluorescence. Stray light from the detection beam and fluorescence from the measured ions can be significant sources of decoherence for unmeasured qubits. We present a technique using ion micromotion to reduce these sources of decoherence by over an order of magnitude. We benchmark the performance with a different method, based on randomized benchmarking, to estimate the magnitude of crosstalk errors on nearby qubits. Using the Honeywell System Model H0, we demonstrate measurement and reset on select qubits with low crosstalk errors on neighboring qubits.

TI Parallel Gate Operations Fidelity in a Linear Array of Flip-Flop Qubits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum computers based on silicon are promising candidates for long term universal quantum computation due to the long coherence times of electron and nuclear spin states. Furthermore, the continuous progress of micro- and nano-electronics, also related to the scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor systems, makes it possible to control the displacement of single dopants thus suggesting their exploitation as qubit holders. Flip-flop qubit is a donor based qubit where interactions between qubits are achievable for distance up to several hundred nanometers. In this work, a linear array of flip-flop qubits is considered and the unwanted mutual qubit interactions due to the simultaneous application of two one-qubit and two two-qubit gates are included in the quantum gate simulations. In particular, by studying the parallel execution of couples of one-qubit gates, namely Rz(-pi 2)$R_z(-\frac{\pi }{2})$ and Rx(-pi 2)$R_x(-\frac{\pi }{2})$, and of couples of two-qubit gate, that is, iSWAP$\sqrt {\text{i}\text{SWAP}}$, a safe inter-qubit distance is found where unwanted qubit interactions are negligible thus leading to parallel gates fidelity up to 99.9%.

TI Quantum emission from coupled spin pairs in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically addressable defect qubits in wide band gap materials are favorable candidates for room-temperature quantum information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid-state platform with great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters and quantum memories, leveraging the advantages of 2D materials for scalable preparation of defect qubits. Although room-temperature bright defect qubits have been recently reported in hBN, their microscopic origin, the nature of the optical transition, and the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) have remained elusive. Here, we connect the variance in the optical spectra, optical lifetimes, and spectral stability of quantum emitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in hBN through ab initio calculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signals for the acceptor counterpart of the defect pair with an S = 1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic fields, depending on the donor partner and dominantly mediated by the hyperfine interaction. The donor-acceptor pair model and its transition mechanisms provide a recipe for defect qubit identification and performance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.

TI Approaching a fully-polarized state of nuclear spins in a solid
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Magnetic noise of atomic nuclear spins is a major source of decoherence in solid-state spin qubits. In theory, near-unity nuclear spin polarization can eliminate decoherence of the electron spin qubit, while turning the nuclei into a useful quantum information resource. However, achieving sufficiently high nuclear polarizations has remained an evasive goal. Here we implement a nuclear spin polarization protocol which combines strong optical pumping and fast electron tunneling. Nuclear polarizations well above 95% are generated in GaAs semiconductor quantum dots on a timescale of 1 minute. The technique is compatible with standard quantum dot device designs, where highly-polarized nuclear spins can simplify implementations of qubits and quantum memories, as well as offer a testbed for studies of many-body quantum dynamics and magnetism.

TI Qubit state discrimination using post-measurement information
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We consider the optimal discrimination of nonorthogonal qubit states with post-measurement information and provide an analytic structure of the optimal measurements. We also show that there is always a null optimal measurement when post-measurement information is given. Further, in discriminating four states using post-measurement information, we analytically provide the optimal probability of correct guessing and show that the uniqueness of optimal measurement is equivalent to the non-existence of non-null optimal measurement with post-measurement information.

TI Safe image transmission with hybrid quantum key-genetic encryption via
   spatial modulation assisted NOMA
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This manuscript presents a secure and spectrally efficient Spatial Modulation (SM)-based Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system for two-user downlink 5G wireless communication. The proposed SM-NOMA shows significant improvements in spectral efficiency and energy savings by activating only one transmit antenna per symbol duration and all other remaining antennas remain silent, reducing hardware complexity and RF chain usage compared to traditional Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. In terms of detection strategy, the weak user employs Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) to directly decode its signal, as it receives higher power and does not need interference cancellation. Conversely, the strong user first applies MRC to detect the weak user's signal, performs Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to remove the weak user's contribution, and then applies MRC again to decode its own signal. This approach balances complexity and performance, offering practical implementation benefits. Additionally, the system includes optimized power allocation to manage interference and maintain user fairness. The proposed SM-NOMA system performance is evaluated using Bit Error Rate (BER), outage probability, and the spectral efficiency under imperfect CSI and imperfect SIC conditions. SM-NOMA outperforms conventional NOMA by significantly reducing BER, lowering outage probability and enhancing spectral efficiency. At a transmit power of 25 dBm, in the case of User 1 the BER is improved from 10(-2) (NOMA) to 10(-3) (SM-NOMA). Similarly, for User 2, there is an improvement in BER from 10(-2) (NOMA) to 10(-4) (SM-NOMA). Also, the outage probability values for both the users improved significantly with User 1 dropping from the previous value of 10(-1) (NOMA) to 10(-5) (SM-NOMA) at 20 dBm transmit power and for User 2 it drops from 10(-4) to 8.39233 x 10(-5). The overall spectral efficiency improved from 2.57 bps/Hz (NOMA) to 2.74 bps/Hz (SM-NOMA). Wireless systems are easily prone to attacks by intruders. To enhance transmission security, the system integrates Quantum-Enhanced Genetic Encryption (QGE(2)) a hybrid encryption framework combining quantum gate-generated keys and genetic algorithm-based encryption. The sequence generated using quantum gates is used as a seed value for the genetic algorithm. It is used to encrypt a 256 x 256 8-bit grayscale image. The randomness of the proposed quantum key is tested through the NIST test. The proposed encryption scheme passed all 17 NIST randomness evaluations (15 core + 2 subsections) with p-values >= 0.01. Additional metrics such as correlation, entropy, and histogram analysis validate the strength of the encryption against both classical and quantum threats. The integration of spatial modulation NOMA with QGE(2) ensures the safe and secure transfer of information through the Rayleigh faded wireless channel.

TI Spatially Resolved Decoherence of Donor Spins in Silicon Strained by a
   Metallic Electrode
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Electron spins are amongst the most coherent solid-state systems known. However, to be used in devices for quantum sensing and information processing applications, they must typically be placed near interfaces. Understanding and mitigating the impacts of such interfaces on the coherence and spectral properties of electron spins is critical to realizing such applications, but it is also challenging: Inferring such data from single-spin studies requires many measurements to obtain meaningful results, while ensemble measurements typically give averaged results that hide critical information. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the coherence of near-surface bismuth donor spins in 28-silicon at millikelvin temperatures. In particular, we use strain-induced frequency shifts caused by a metallic electrode to infer spatial maps of spin coherence as a function of position relative to the electrode. By measuring magnetic-field-insensitive clock transitions, we separate magnetic noise caused by surface spins from charge noise. Our results include quantitative models of the strain-split spin resonance spectra and extraction of paramagnetic impurity concentrations at the silicon surface. The interplay of these decoherence mechanisms for such near-surface electron spins is critical for their application in quantum technologies, while the combination of the strain splitting and clock transition extends the coherence lifetimes by up to 2 orders of magnitude, reaching up to 300 ms at a mean depth of only 100 nm. The technique we introduce here to spatially map coherence in near-surface ensembles is directly applicable to other spin systems of active interest, such as defects in diamond, silicon carbide, and rare earth ions in optical crystals.

TI An atomically resolved study of droplet epitaxy InAs quantum dots grown
   on InGa(As,P)/InP by MOVPE for quantum photonic applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We investigated droplet epitaxy InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs) grown by MOVPE on two different substrate interlayers of InGaAs and InGaAsP, both lattice-matched to InP, by cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM) and AFM (atomic force microscopy). We compared, at the atomic scale, the structural and compositional properties of the QDs grown on the two different surfaces. On both interlayers, the QDs present a truncated pyramid shape with a rhomboid base, flat top and bottom facets, and side planes corresponding to {136} planes. Finite element simulations (FESs) are performed to fit the experimental outward relaxation of the QDs and the lattice constant profiles. The X-STM results and FES confirm that the QDs grown on InGaAsP present a composition with less than 5% P intermixing, whereas the QDs on InGaAs have a slightly higher P incorporation but still less than 10% of P intermixing. This study confirms that both interlayers suppress the etching mechanisms, previously identified as etch pits and trenches, when growing InAs QDs directly on InP. The InGaAs and InGaAsP interlayers both show lateral composition modulation, with much stronger fluctuations and filamentation displayed in the InGaAsP interlayer. We demonstrate that the growth on InGaAsP produces InAs QDs with a high crystal quality comparable to those grown on InP and control over the etching mechanisms. The detailed study performed in this work shows the successful integration of high-quality InAs/InP QDs with the InGaAsP surface, which is used in many applications in a wide range of photonic devices and quantum technologies.

TI Spin-Photon Coupling for Atomic Qubit Devices in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Electrically addressing spin systems is predicted to be a key component in developing scalable semiconductor-based quantum-processing architectures, to enable fast spin-qubit manipulation and longdistance entanglement via microwave photons. However, single spins have no electric dipole, and therefore a spin-orbit mechanism must be integrated in the qubit design. Here, we propose to couple microwave photons to atomically precise donor spin-qubit devices in silicon using the hyperfine interaction intrinsic to donor systems and an electrically induced spin-orbit coupling. We characterize a one-electron system bound to a tunnel-coupled donor pair (1P-1P) using the tight-binding method, and then estimate the spin-photon coupling achievable under realistic assumptions. We address the recent experiments on double quantum dots (DQDs) in silicon and indicate the differences between DQD and 1P-1P systems. Our analysis shows that it is possible to achieve strong spin-photon coupling in 1P-1P systems in realistic device conditions without the need for an external magnetic field gradient.

TI Deterministic creation of strained color centers in nanostructures via
   high-stress thin films
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Color centers have emerged as a leading qubit candidate for realizing hybrid spin-photon quantum information technology. One major limitation of the platform, however, is that the characteristics of individual color centers are often strain dependent. As an illustrative case, the silicon-vacancy center in diamond typically requires millikelvin temperatures in order to achieve long coherence properties, but strained silicon-vacancy centers have been shown to operate at temperatures beyond 1 K without phonon-mediated decoherence. In this work, we combine high-stress silicon-nitride thin films with diamond nanostructures to reproducibly create statically strained silicon-vacancy color centers (mean ground state splitting of 608 GHz) with strain magnitudes of similar to 4 x 10(-4). Based on modeling, this strain should be sufficient to allow for operation of a majority silicon-vacancy centers within the measured sample at elevated temperatures (1.5 K) without any degradation of their spin properties. This method offers a scalable approach to fabricate high-temperature operation quantum memories. Beyond silicon-vacancy centers, this method is sufficiently general that it can be easily extended to other platforms as well.

TI Finite-key analysis for coherent one-way quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Coherent-one-way (COW) quantum key distribution (QKD) is a significant communication protocol that has been implemented experimentally and deployed in practical products due to its simple equipment requirements. However, existing security analyses of COW-QKD either provide a short transmission distance or lack immunity against coherent attacks in the finite-key regime. In this paper, we present a tight finite-key security analysis within the universally composable framework for a variant of COW-QKD, which has been proven to extend the secure transmission distance in the asymptotic case. We combine the quantum leftover hash lemma and entropic uncertainty relation to derive the key rate formula. When estimating statistical parameters, we use the recently proposed Kato's inequality to ensure security against coherent attacks and achieve a higher key rate. Our paper confirms the security and feasibility of COW-QKD for practical application and lays the foundation for further theoretical study and experimental implementation.

TI Classical-Noise-Free Sensing Based on Quantum Correlation Measurement*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum sensing, using quantum properties of sensors, can enhance resolution, precision, and sensitivity of imaging, spectroscopy, and detection. An intriguing question is: Can the quantum nature (quantumness) of sensors and targets be exploited to enable schemes that are not possible for classical probes or classical targets? Here we show that measurement of the quantum correlations of a quantum target indeed allows for sensing schemes that have no classical counterparts. As a concrete example, in the case that the second-order classical correlation of a quantum target could be totally concealed by non-stationary classical noise, the higher-order quantum correlations can single out a quantum target from the classical noise background, regardless of the spectrum, statistics, or intensity of the noise. Hence a classical-noise-free sensing scheme is proposed. This finding suggests that the quantumness of sensors and targets is still to be explored to realize the full potential of quantum sensing. New opportunities include sensitivity beyond classical approaches, non-classical correlations as a new approach to quantum many-body physics, loophole-free tests of the quantum foundation, et cetera.

TI Chip-scale atomic birefringent diffractive-optical-elements
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The interaction between light and vapors in the presence of magnetic fields is fundamental to many quantum technologies and applications. Recently, the ability to geometrically confine atoms into periodic structures has enabled the creation of chip-scale, micromachined hybrid atomic-diffractive optical elements. However, applying magnetic fields to such structures remains largely unexplored, offering potential for both fundamental and applied insights. Here, we present measurements of an atomic-diffractive optical element subject to magnetic fields. In contrast to the well-known polarization rotation in a Faraday medium, these diffractive atomic elements exhibit additional, rapidly oscillating rotation terms, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, we find that the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields leads to a reduction in fringe visibility, which can be leveraged for gradiometric applications. Together, these effects establish a chip-scale platform where diffraction and quantum sensing are inseparably co-engineered, unveiling previously inaccessible regimes of atom-photon-magnetic interaction. By probing the magneto-optic response of periodically confined vapors, our results lay the groundwork for integrated smart-cell magnetometers and open new avenues for flat-optics-enabled quantum photonic devices.

TI Quantum Verification and Estimation with Few Copies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As quantum technologies advance, the ability to generate increasingly large quantum states has experienced rapid development. In this context, the verification and estimation of large entangled systems represent one of the main challenges in the employment of such systems for reliable quantum information processing. Though the most complete technique is undoubtedly full tomography, the inherent exponential increase of experimental and post-processing resources with system size makes this approach infeasible even at moderate scales. For this reason, there is currently an urgent need to develop novel methods that surpass these limitations. This review article presents novel techniques focusing on a fixed number of resources (sampling complexity), and thus prove suitable for systems of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, a probabilistic framework requiring at best only a single copy for entanglement detection is reviewed, together with the concept of selective quantum state tomography, which enables the estimation of arbitrary elements of an unknown state with a number of copies that is low and independent of the system's size. These hyper-efficient techniques define a dimensional demarcation for partial tomography and open a path for novel applications.

TI Exponential Improvements in the Simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories
   Using Near-Optimal Techniques
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We report a first-of-its-kind analysis on post-Trotter simulation of U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) lattice gauge theories including fermions in arbitrary spatial dimension. We provide explicit circuit constructions as well as T-gate counts and logical qubit counts for Hamiltonian simulation. We find a reduction of up to 25 orders of magnitude in space-time volume over Trotter methods for simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories relevant to the standard model. This improvement results from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors in the gauge theory, achieved by utilizing oracle constructions relying on the sparsity of physical operators, in contrast to the exponential scaling seen in state-of-theart Trotter methods, which employ explicit mappings onto Pauli operators. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of simulating fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first-principles quantum simulation of chemistry.

TI Coulomb-mediated antibunching of an electron pair surfing on sound
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Electron flying qubits are envisioned as potential information links within a quantum computer, but also promise-like photonic approaches-to serve as self-standing quantum processing units. In contrast to their photonic counterparts, electron-quantum-optics implementations are subject to Coulomb interactions, which provide a direct route to entangle the orbital or spin degree of freedom. However, controlled interaction of flying electrons at the single-particle level has not yet been established experimentally. Here we report antibunching of a pair of single electrons that is synchronously shuttled through a circuit of coupled quantum rails by means of a surface acoustic wave. The in-flight partitioning process exhibits a reciprocal gating effect which allows us to ascribe the observed repulsion predominantly to Coulomb interaction.

TI Crosstalk-resilient quantum MIMO for scalable quantum communications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We address the challenge of crosstalk in quantum multiplexing-an obstacle to scaling throughput in quantum communication networks. Crosstalk arises when physically coupled quantum modes interfere, degrading signal fidelity. We propose a mitigation strategy based on encoding discrete-variable (DV) quantum information into continuous-variable (CV) bosonic modes using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. By analyzing the effect of mode-mixing interference, we show that under specific noise strength conditions, the interaction can be absorbed into a gauge subsystem that leaves the logical content intact. We provide rigorous conditions for perfect transmission in the ideal case, derive the structure of the output codes and prove the existence of a gauge-fixing decoder enabling recovery of the logical information. Numerical simulations under displacement Gaussian noise illustrate the fidelity behavior and rate-fidelity tradeoff. Our results establish a coding-theoretic foundation for crosstalk-resilient multiplexing in quantum networks.

TI Lattice surgery-based logical state teleportation via noisy links
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB For planar architectures, surface code-based quantum error correction is one of the most promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation. This is partially due to the variety of fault-tolerant logical protocols that can be implemented in two dimensions using local operations. One such protocol is the lattice surgerybased logical state teleportation, which transfers a logical quantum state from an initial location on a quantum chip to a target location through a linking region of qubits. This protocol serves as a basis for higher-level routines, such as the entangling cnot gate or magic state injection. In this work, we investigate the correctability phase diagram of this protocol for distinct error rates inside the surface code patches and within the linking region. We adopt techniques from statistical physics to describe the numerically observed crossover regime between correctable and uncorrectable quantum error correction phases, where the correctability depends on the separation between the initial and target locations. We find that inside the crossover regime the correctabilitythreshold lines decay as a power law with increasing separation, which we explain accurately using a finite-size scaling analysis. Our results indicate that the logical state teleportation protocol can tolerate much higher noise rates in the linking region compared to the bulk of the surface code patches, provided the separation between the positions is relatively small.

TI Anyon Condensation and the Color Code
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The manipulation of topologically ordered phases of matter to encode and process quantum information forms the cornerstone of many approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate that fault-tolerant logical operations in these approaches can be interpreted as instances of anyon condensation. We present a constructive theory for anyon condensation and, in tandem, illustrate our theory explicitly using the color-code model. We show that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of domain walls, which can exist in both spacelike and timelike directions. This class includes semitransparent domain walls that condense certain subsets of anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also argue that dynamical "Floquet codes" can be viewed as a series of condensation operations. We propose a general construction for realizing planar dynamically driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code. We use our construction to introduce a new Calderbank-Shor-Steane-type Floquet code that we call the Floquet color code.

TI Creating heralded hyper-entangled photons using Rydberg atoms
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Entangled photon pairs are a fundamental component for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics, and for modern quantum technologies such as teleportation and secured communication. Current state-of-the-art sources are based on nonlinear processes that are limited in their efficiency and wavelength tunability. This motivates the exploration of physical mechanisms for entangled photon generation, with a special interest in mechanisms that can be heralded, preferably at telecommunications wavelengths. Here we present a mechanism for the generation of heralded entangled photons from Rydberg atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). We propose a scheme to demonstrate the mechanism and quantify its expected performance. The heralding of the process enables non-destructive detection of the photon pairs. The entangled photons are produced by exciting a rubidium atom to a Rydberg state, from where the atom decays via two-photon emission (TPE). A Rydberg blockade helps to excite a single Rydberg excitation while the input light field is more efficiently collectively absorbed by all the atoms. The TPE rate is significantly enhanced by a designed photonic cavity, whose many resonances also translate into high-dimensional entanglement. The resulting high-dimensionally entangled photons are entangled in more than one degree of freedom: in all of their spectral components, in addition to the polarization-forming a hyper-entangled state, which is particularly interesting in high information capacity quantum communication. We characterize the photon comb states by analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and propose proof-of-concept experiments.

TI Femtosecond Laser Writing of Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Optically active spin defects in wide-bandgap materials have many potential applications in quantum information and quantum sensing. Spin defects in two-dimensional layered van der Waals materials are just emerging to be investigated. Here we demonstrate that optically addressable spin ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can be generated by femtosecond laser irradiation. We observe optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of hBN spin defects created by laser irradiation. We show that the creation of spin defects in hBN is strongly affected by the pulse energy of the femtosecond laser. When the laser pulse number is less than a few thousand, the pulse number only affects the density of the defects but not the type of defects. With proper laser parameters, spin defects can be generated with a high probability of success. Our work provides a convenient way to create spin defects in hBN by femtosecond laser writing, which shows promising prospects for quantum technologies.

TI Unbalanced-basis-misalignment-tolerant measurement-device-independent
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICA
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) is a revolutionary protocol since it is physically immune to all attacks on the detection side. However, the protocol still keeps the strict assumptions on the source side that specify that the four BB84 states must be perfectly prepared to ensure security. Some protocols release part of the assumptions in the encoding system to keep the practical security, but the performance would be dramatically reduced. In this work, we present a MDIQKD protocol that requires less knowledge of the encoding system to combat the troublesome modulation errors and fluctuations. We have also experimentally demonstrated the protocol. The result indicates a high performance and good security for practical applications. Its robustness and flexibility also exhibit a good value for complex scenarios such as the QKD networks.

TI Heuristic Time Complexity of NISQ Shortest-Vector-Problem Solvers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The shortest vector problem (SVP) is central to the security of lattice-based cryptography, forming the foundation of two of the three NIST-standardized postquantum cryptosystems. Understanding how quantum algorithms perform on SVP is vital for assessing the long-term security of these schemes. In particular, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) designed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices offer a heuristic yet practical approach. However, due to their heuristic nature, their performance and time complexity at nontrivial scales remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose angle pretraining for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to SVP. We show that QAOA with fixed pretrained angles generalizes effectively to larger problem sizes, surpassing the scale limitations of prior training-based methods by eliminating dependence on classical optimizers, enabling to systematically extrapolate performance trends. Our results indicate that the probability of success scales as 2(-0.695n) for depth p = 3, where n is the lattice dimension. Repetition of the algorithm thus yields an estimated heuristic time complexity of O(2(0.695n))for solving SVP with high probability-slightly worse than the Grover-based fault-tolerant bound of O(2(0.5n)), but achieved with far lower quantum resource requirements. Unlike Grover's algorithm, which requires exponential circuit depth, our constant-depth fixed-angle QAOA approach scales polynomially with qubit count. Additionally, we introduce a space-efficient encoding of SVP that avoids the zero-vector solution without extra logical qubits, improving prior NISQ implementations in both scalability and efficiency.

While fusion operations for merging entangled states are well developed, no direct protocol exists for the reverse process, which we term "fission." We introduce a simple, yet powerful, protocol that achieves this, allowing a qubit to split while preserving selective connections with minimum entanglement overhead. This tool offers flexible entanglement management with potential applications in secure communication, error correction, and adaptive entanglement distribution.

Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of SQKD based on the Mirror protocol, which is the most experimentally feasible SQKD protocol, and equipped with time-phase encoding scheme employing the method of selective modulation. The experiment was performed at a repetition frequency of 62.5 MHz and a high raw key rate arrived at 69.8 kbps, and the average quantum bit error rate was found to be 4.56% and 2.78% for the "SWAP-x-Z" (x is an element of {01, 10}) and the "CTRL-X", respectively. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our system, and this study is helpful for future research on SQKD experiments.

TI Distinguishing Parity-Switching Mechanisms in a Superconducting Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Single-charge tunneling is a decoherence mechanism affecting superconducting qubits, yet the origin of excess quasiparticle excitations (QPs) responsible for this tunneling in superconducting devices is not fully understood. We measure the flux dependence of charge-parity (or, simply, "parity") switching in an offsetcharge-sensitive transmon qubit to identify the contributions of photon-assisted parity switching and QP generation to the overall parity-switching rate. The parity-switching rate exhibits a qubit-state-dependent peak in the flux dependence, indicating a cold distribution of excess QPs that are predominantly trapped in the low-gap film of the device. Moreover, we find that the photon-assisted process contributes significantly to both parity switching and the generation of excess QPs by fitting to a model that self-consistently incorporates photon-assisted parity switching as well as interfilm QP dynamics.

I also present analogous formulas in classical information theory for a Poisson model. An operator called the intensity operator emerges as the central quantity in the formalism to describe Poisson states. It behaves like a density operator but is unnormalized. The formulas in terms of the intensity operators not only resemble the general formulas in terms of the density operators, but also coincide with some existing definitions of divergences between unnormalized positivese-midefinite matrices. Furthermore, I show that the effects of certain channels on Poisson states can be described by simple maps for the intensity operators.

TI Quantum computing inspired iterative refinement for semidefinite
   optimization
SO MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING
AB Iterative Refinement (IR) is a classical computing technique for obtaining highly precise solutions to linear systems of equations, as well as linear optimization problems. In this paper, motivated by the limited precision of quantum solvers, we develop the first IR scheme for solving semidefinite optimization (SDO) problems and explore two major impacts of the proposed IR scheme. First, we prove that the proposed IR scheme exhibits quadratic convergence of the optimality gap without any assumption on problem characteristics. As an application of our results, we show that using IR with Quantum Interior Point Methods (QIPMs) leads to exponential improvements in the worst-case overall running time of QIPMs, compared to previous best-performing QIPMs. We also discuss how the proposed IR scheme can be used with classical inexact SDO solvers, such as classical inexact IPMs with conjugate gradient methods.

TI Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model
   for novel medical knowledge discovery
SO PLOS ONE
AB Recently, the utilization of real-world medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.

TI An empirical study into the effects of transpilation on quantum circuit
   smells
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing is a promising field that can solve complex problems beyond traditional computers' capabilities. Developing high-quality quantum software applications, called quantum software engineering, has recently gained attention. However, quantum software development faces challenges related to code quality. A recent study found that many open-source quantum programs are affected by quantum-specific code smells, with long circuit being the most common. While the study provided relevant insights into the prevalence of code smells in quantum circuits, it did not explore the potential effect of transpilation, a necessary step for executing quantum computer programs, on the emergence of code smells. Indeed, transpilation might alter those characteristics employed to detect the presence of a smell on a circuit. To address this limitation, we present a new study investigating the impact of transpilation on quantum-specific code smells and how different target gate sets affect the results. We conducted experiments on 17 open-source quantum programs alongside a set of 100 synthetic circuits. We found that transpilation can significantly alter the metrics that are used to detect code smells, even into previously smell-free circuits, with the long circuit smell being the most susceptible to transpilation. Furthermore, the choice of the gate set significantly influences the presence and severity of code smells in transpiled circuits, highlighting the need for careful gate set selection to mitigate their impact. These findings have implications for circuit optimization and high-quality quantum software development. Further research is needed to understand the consequences of code smells and their potential impact on quantum computations, considering the characteristics and constraints of different gate sets and hardware platforms.

TI A MARL-federated blockchain-based quantum secure framework for trust
   management in industrial internet of things
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the emergence of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods face significant vulnerabilities, particularly in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, where cybersecurity, data privacy, and trust management are critical. In order to address the said problems concerned with post-quantum security, this paper proposes a quantum-secure framework for IIoT applications by integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for optimized blockchain consensus, blockchain-supported federated learning for privacy-preserving AI training, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for quantum-resistant security. The MARL-based consensus uses a deep Q-network with explainable AI to enhance transparency and trust. Federated learning employs dynamic participant selection and PQC (e.g., NTRUEncrypt, Kyber) to ensure privacy. Evaluations are carried out on Edge IIoT and Federated EMNIST datasets, which are publicly available datasets and are used in similar studies. The experimental results reveal that the proposed framework demonstrate improvements in scalability, security, and efficiency, hence, offering a robust solution for applications like smart cities and healthcare.

The underlying phase space is described by a locally compact abelian (LCA) group G with a symplectic structure determined by a 2-cocycle on G.

TI All-optical quantum simulation of ultrastrong optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The observation of single-photon optomechanical effects is a desired task in cavity optomechanics. However, the realization of ultrastrong optomechanical interaction remains a big challenge. Here we present an all-optical scheme to simulate ultrastrong optomechanical coupling based on a Fredkin-type interaction, which consists of two exchange-coupled modes with the coupling strength depending on the photon number in another controller mode. This coupling enhancement is assisted by the displacement amplification according to the physical idea of the Bogoliubov approximation, which is realized by utilizing a strong driving to pump one of the two exchanging modes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the enhanced optomechanical coupling can enter the single-photon strong-coupling and even ultrastrong-coupling regimes. We also show the creation of macroscopic quantum superposed states and the implementation of a weak-to-strong transition for quantum measurement in this system. This work will pave the way to quantum simulation of single-photon optomechanical effects with current experimental platforms.

TI Margenau-Hill operator valued measures and joint measurability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We employ the Margenau-Hill (MH) correspondence rule for associating classical functions with quantum operators to construct quasi-probability mass functions. Using this we obtain the fuzzy one parameter quasi measurement operator (QMO) characterizing the incompatibility of noncommuting spin observables of qubits, qutrits and 2-qubit systems. Positivity of the fuzzy MH-QMO places upper bounds on the associated unsharpness parameter. This serves as a sufficient condition for measurement incompatibility of spin observables. We assess the amount of unsharpness required for joint measurability (compatibility) of the noncommuting qubit, qutrit and 2-qubit observables. We show that the degree of compatibility of a pair of orthogonal qubit observables agrees perfectly with the necessary and sufficient conditions for joint measurability. Furthermore, we obtain analytical upper bounds on the unsharpness parameter specifying the range of joint measurability of spin components of qutrits and pairs of orthogonal spin observables of a 2-qubit system. Our results indicate that the measurement incompatibility of spin observables increases with Hilbert space dimension.

Through participatory action research conducted during the setup and operation of a pan-European pilot project, the QTEdu Open Master (QTOM), we examine the viability of this educational model to offer flexible learning opportunities to STEM Master's students through the setup and year-long operation of an online course exchange platform. A crucial lynchpin in the Open Master model are the mechanisms of local accreditation available for the awarding of credit, which we divide into distinct course types varying in formality and applicability. Furthermore, we have elucidated the strategies taken by staff to successfully implement the Open Master and benefit from its transformative value, building long-lasting communities within and between faculty, and scaling up educational offerings across Europe. With this research, we reflect on a possible future for QT Education.

TI CircuitQ: an open-source toolbox for superconducting circuits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce CircuitQ, an open-source toolbox for the analysis of superconducting circuits implemented in Python. It features the automated construction of a symbolic Hamiltonian of the input circuit and a dynamic numerical representation of the Hamiltonian with a variable basis choice. The software implementation is capable of choosing the basis in a fully automated fashion based on the potential energy landscape. Additional features include the estimation of the T-1 lifetimes of the circuit states under various noise mechanisms. We review previously established circuit quantization methods and formulate them in a way that facilitates the software implementation. The toolbox is then showcased by applying it to practically relevant qubit circuits and comparing it to specialized circuit solvers. Our circuit quantization is applicable to circuit inputs from a large design space, and the software is open-sourced. We thereby add an important resource for the design of new quantum circuits for quantum information processing applications.

TI Quantum algorithm for angle-based anomaly detection
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Anomaly detection is a prominent task in machine learning and data mining, which plays a key role in various domains such as financial fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and healthcare. Angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) algorithm stands out as one of the most common approaches for anomaly detection, the core step of which involves computing the angular variance among distance vectors from each point to others, and then marking those points with angular variance lower than a threshold as outliers. The time complexity of classical ABOD algorithm scales as O(M3) with respect to the number of samples M, making it hard to efficiently handle large-scale datasets. To this end, a quantum ABOD algorithm is proposed, in which quantum amplitude estimation is harnessed to compute angular variance in quantum parallel, and quantum amplitude amplification is further applied to search out the outliers. Compared with its classical counterpart, our [ root ] quantum ABOD algorithm has time complexity O M log(M) with respect to M, achieving a polynomial speedup with respect to M.

TI Plug-and-play discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key
   distribution based on non-Gaussian state- discrimination detection
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Plug-and-play discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key distribution can generate local oscillator light locally without using two independent lasers, and both signal light and local oscillator are generated from the same laser, which can effectively ensure the practical security of the system and have a completely identical frequency characteristic. In addition, this scheme has good compatibility with efficient error correction codes, and can achieve high reconciliation efficiency even at low signal-to-noise ratio. However, there exists large excess noise in the plug-and-play configuration based on the untrusted source model, which seriously limits the maximum transmission distance of the discrete modulation scheme. To solve this problem, we propose a plug-and-play discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key distribution based on non-Gaussian state -discrimination detection. That is to say, a non-Gaussian state-discrimination detector is deployed at the receiver. With adaptive measurement method and Bayesian inference, four non-orthogonal coherent states which are based on four-state discrete modulation can be unconditionally distinguished on condition that the error probability is lower than the standard quantum limit. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol by considering both asymptotic limit and finite-size effect. Simulation results show that the secret key rate and maximum transmission distance are significantly enhanced by using no-Gaussian state-discrimination detection even under the influence of the untrusted source noise compared with the original plug-and-play discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key distribution. These results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the negative influence of the untrust source noise on the performance of the plug-and-play discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol. The proposed protocol can not only ensure the practical security of the system, but also achieve more efficient and longer transmission distance quantum key distribution.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Multiplexed operations and extended coherent control over multiple trapping sites are fundamental requirements for a trapped-ion processor in a large-scale architecture. Here, we demonstrate these building blocks using a surface-electrode trap with integrated photonic components which are scalable to larger numbers of zones. We implement a Ramsey sequence using the integrated light in two zones, separated by 375 mu m, performing transport of the ion from one zone to the other in 200 mu s between pulses. In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we develop techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multizone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device architecture.

TI Imperfect quantum networks with tailored resource states
SO QUANTUM
AB Entanglement-based quantum networks exhibit a unique flexibility in the choice of entangled resource states that are then locally manipulated by the nodes to fulfill any request in the network. Furthermore, this manipulation is not uniquely defined and thus can be optimized. We tailor the adaptation of the resource state or preestablished entanglement to achieve bipartite communication in an imperfect setting that includes time-dependent memory errors. In this same setting, we study how the flexibility of this approach can be used for the distribution of entanglement in a fully asymmetric network scenario. The considered entanglement topology is a custom one based on the minimization of the required measurements to retrieve a Bell pair. The optimization of the manipulation and the study of such a custom entanglement topology are performed using the noisy stabilizer formalism, a recently introduced method to fully track noise on graph states. We find that exploiting the flexibility of the entanglement topology, given a certain set of bipartite requests, is highly favorable in terms of the fidelity of the final state.

TI Paving the Way for SQIsign: Toward Efficient Deployment on 32-bit
   Embedded Devices
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The threat of quantum computing has spurred research into post-quantum cryptography. SQIsign, a candidate submitted to the standardization process of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is emerging as a promising isogeny-based signature scheme. This work aimed to enhance SQIsign's practical deployment by optimizing its low-level arithmetic operations. Through hierarchical decomposition and performance profiling, we identified the ideal-to-isogeny translation, primarily involving elliptic curve operations, as the main bottleneck. We developed efficient 32-bit finite field arithmetic for elliptic curves, such as basic operations, like addition with carry, subtraction with borrow, and conditional move. We then implemented arithmetic operations in the Montgomery domain, and extended these to quadratic field extensions. Our implementation offers improved compatibility with 32-bit architectures and enables more fine-grained SIMD acceleration. Performance evaluations demonstrated the practicality in low-level operations.

TI Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Scaling of Quantum Computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The third law of thermodynamics, also known as the Nernst unattainability principle, puts a fundamental bound on how close a system, whether classical or quantum, can be cooled to a temperature near to absolute zero. On the other hand, a fundamental assumption of quantum computing is to start each computation from a register of qubits initialized in a pure state, i.e., at zero temperature. These conflicting aspects, at the interface between quantum computing and thermodynamics, are often overlooked or, at best, addressed only at a single-qubit level. In this Letter, we argue how the existence of a small but finite effective temperature, which makes the initial state a mixed state, poses a real challenge to the fidelity constraints required for the scaling of quantum computers. Our theoretical results, carried out for a generic quantum circuit with N-qubit input states, are validated by test runs performed on a real quantum processor.

TI PQ-LEACH: A novel post-quantum protocol for securing WSNs communication
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB Ensuring the confidentiality of communication is of paramount significance. Traditionally, cryptographic practices for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been primarily based on classical cryptography like RSA and Elliptic Curve, which are potentially susceptible to cyber attacks from future quantum computers with enough computing power. To ensure the protection and safety of inter-node communication in WSNs, it becomes imperative to employ a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithm. This paper presents post-quantum low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (PQ-LEACH), an advanced secure wireless communication protocol based on the LEACH protocol. By integrating post-quantum cryptography, specifically Kyber's key encapsulation method, and a key update system, PQ-LEACH effectively enhances the security of communication and mitigates various WSN attacks. Additionally, a comprehensive performance analysis of PQ-LEACH, including its impact on network energy efficiency and longevity, is conducted. The results demonstrate the trade-offs between enhanced security measures and operational performance, providing critical insights for the deployment of secure and efficient WSNs in a quantum-threatened landscape.

TI Neural network decoder for near-term surface-code experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Neural network decoders can achieve a lower logical error rate compared to conventional decoders, like minimum-weight perfect matching, when decoding the surface code. Furthermore, these decoders require no prior information about the physical error rates, making them highly adaptable. In this study, we investigate the performance of such a decoder using both simulated and experimental data obtained from a transmon-qubit processor, focusing on small-distance surface codes. We first show that the neural network typically outperforms the matching decoder due to better handling of errors leading to multiple correlated syndrome defects, such as Y errors. When applied to the experimental data of Google Quantum AI [R. Acharya et al., Nature (London) 614, 676 (2023)], the neural network decoder achieves logical error rates approximately 25% lower than minimum-weight perfect matching, approaching the performance of a maximum-likelihood decoder. To demonstrate the flexibility of this decoder, we incorporate the soft information available in the analog readout of transmon qubits and evaluate the performance of this decoder in simulation using a symmetric Gaussian-noise model. Considering the soft information leads to an approximately 10% lower logical error rate, depending on the probability of a measurement error. The good logical performance, flexibility, and computational efficiency make neural network decoders well-suited for near-term demonstrations of quantum memories.

TI Demystifying Quantum Gate Fidelity for Electronics Engineers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The implementation of quantum gates by means of microwave cryo-RFICs controlling qubits is a promising path toward scalable quantum processors. Quantum gate fidelity quantifies how well an actual quantum gate produces a quantum state close to the desired ideal one. Regrettably, the literature usually reports on quantum gate fidelity in a highly theoretical way, making it hard for RFIC designers to understand. This paper explains quantum gate fidelity by moving from Shannon's concept of fidelity and proposing a detailed mathematical proof of a valuable integral formulation of quantum gate fidelity. Shannon's information theory and the simple mathematics adopted for the proof are both expected to be in the background of electronics engineers. By using Shannon's fidelity, this paper rationalizes the integral formulation of quantum gate fidelity. Because of the simple mathematics adopted, this paper also demystifies to electronics engineers how this integral formulation can be reduced to a more practical algebraic product matrix. This paper makes evident the practical utility of this matrix formulation by applying it to the specific examples of one- and two-qubit quantum gates. Moreover, this paper also compares mixed states, entanglement fidelity, and the error rate's upper bound.

TI Digital quantum simulation of an extended Agassi model: Using machine
   learning to disentangle its phase-diagram
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB A digital quantum simulation for the extended Agassi model is proposed using a quantum platform with eight trapped ions. The extended Agassi model is an analytically solvable model including both short range pairing and long range monopole-monopole interactions with applications in nuclear physics and in other many -body systems. In addition, it owns a rich phase diagram with different phases and the corresponding phase transition surfaces. The aim of this work is twofold: on one hand, to propose a quantum simulation of the model at the present limits of the trapped ions facilities and, on the other hand, to show how to use a machine learning algorithm on top of the quantum simulation to accurately determine the phase of the system. Concerning the quantum simulation, this proposal is scalable with polynomial resources to larger Agassi systems. Digital quantum simulations of nuclear physics models assisted by machine learning may enable one to outperform the fastest classical computers in determining fundamental aspects of nuclear matter.

TI Suppressing ZZ Crosstalk of Quantum Computers through Pulse and

AB Noise is a significant obstacle to quantum computing, and ZZ crosstalk is one of the most destructive types of noise affecting superconducting qubits. Previous approaches to suppressing ZZ crosstalk have mainly relied on specific chip design that can complicate chip fabrication and aggravate decoherence. To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on pulse optimization to suppress ZZ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved.
   To address the above problems, we propose a scalable approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an ability to suppress ZZ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods. We have conducted extensive evaluations by simulation and on a real quantum computer. Simulation results show that our proposal can improve the fidelity of quantum computing on 4 similar to 12 qubits by up to 81x (11x on average). Ramsey experiments on a real quantum computer also demonstrate that our method can eliminate the effect of ZZ crosstalk to a great extent.

TI Three-Party Secure Semiquantum Summation without Entanglement Among
   Quantum User and Classical Users
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, a three-party secure semiquantum summation protocol, which can calculate the modulo 2 addition of the private bits from one quantum participant and two classical participants, is constructed by only using single qubits as the initial quantum resource. This protocol needs none of quantum entanglement swapping, the unitary operation or a pre-shared private key. This protocol only requires the quantum participant to perform the { vertical bar 0 >, vertical bar 1 > } basis measurements, the {vertical bar+>,vertical bar-> } basis measurements and the Bell basis measurements. Compared with the existing only semiquantum summation protocol (Int J Theor Phys, 60 (2021) 3478), this protocol has better performance in quantum measurements for quantum participant; moreover, it may also have higher qubit efficiency.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution with realistic single-photon
   source implementations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims at generating secret keys between distant parties without the parties trusting their devices. We investigate a proposal for performing fully photonic DIQKD, based on single photon sources and heralding measurements at a central station placed between the two parties. We derive conditions to attain non-zero secret-key rates in terms of the photon efficiency, indistinguishability and the second order autocorrelation function of the single-photon sources. Exploiting new results on the security bound of such protocols allows us to reduce the requirements on the physical parameters of the setup. Our analysis shows that in the considered schemes, key rates of several hundreds of secret bits per second are within reach at distances of several tens of kilometers.

TI Causality in a Qubit-Based Implementation of a Quantum Switch
SO UNIVERSE
AB We introduce a qubit-based version of the quantum switch, consisting of a variation of the Fermi problem. Two qubits start in a superposition state in which one qubit is excited and the other is in the ground state. However, it is not defined which is the excited qubit. Then, after some time, if a photon is detected, we know that it must have experienced an emission by one atom and then an absorption and re-emission by the other one, but the ordering of the emission events by both qubits is undefined. While it is tempting to refer to this scenario as one with indefinite causality or a superposition of causal orders, we show that there is still a precise notion of causality: the probability of excitation of each atom is totally independent of the other one when the times are short enough to prevent photon exchange.

TI Maintaining Secure Level on Symmetric Encryption under Quantum Attack
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computing is currently being researched in many countries, and if implemented in the near future, it may pose a threat to existing encryption standards. In the quantum computer environment, asymmetric encryption can be solved by Shor's Algorithm in polynomial time, and the difficulty of breaking symmetric encryption using brute force is reduced from N times to square root N times by Grover's Algorithm. We take the Advanced Encryption Standard as the theme and increase the key length from the original standard 192 bits and 256 bits to 384 bits and 512 bits, respectively, in order to maintain the security level of AES 192/256 under the environment of quantum computing, so we propose the key schedule of AES 384/512, and write the software in C++ on FPGA. The experimental results show that our scheme can achieve Level III and Level V security levels in a quantum computer attack environment. In addition to increasing the length of the key, we use the LUT method in the process of writing SubBytes to replace the array and speed up the computation to optimize the execution speed. In addition, the proposed scheme is still based on 128-bit computing blocks, rather than computing blocks in larger blocks.

TI Vulnerability of Satellite Quantum Key Distribution to Disruption from
   Ground-Based Lasers
SO SENSORS
AB Satellite-mediated quantum key distribution (QKD) is set to become a critical technology for quantum-secure communication over long distances. While satellite QKD cannot be effectively eavesdropped, we show it can be disrupted (or 'jammed') with relatively simple and readily available equipment. We developed an atmospheric attenuation and satellite optical scattering model to estimate the rate of excess noise photons that can be injected into a satellite QKD channel by an off-axis laser, and calculated the effect this added noise has on the quantum bit error rate. We show that a ground-based laser on the order of 1 kW can significantly disrupt modern satellite QKD systems due to photons scattering off the satellite being detected by the QKD receiver on the ground. This class of laser can be purchased commercially, meaning such a method of disruption could be a serious threat to effectively securing high-value communications via satellite QKD in the future. We also discuss these results in relation to likely future developments in satellite-mediated QKD systems, and countermeasures that can be taken against this, and related methods, of disruption.

TI Blueprint for a Molecular-Spin Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The implementation of a universal quantum processor still poses fundamental issues related to error mitigation and correction, which demand investigation of also platforms and computing schemes alternative to the main stream. A possibility is offered by employing multilevel logical units (qudits), naturally provided by molecular spins. Here we present the blueprint of a molecular spin quantum processor consisting of single molecular nanomagnets, acting as qudits, placed within superconducting resonators adapted to the size and interactions of these molecules to achieve a strong single spin-to-photon coupling. We show how to implement a universal set of gates in such a platform and to readout the final qudit state. Singlequdit unitaries (potentially embedding multiple qubits) are implemented by fast classical drives, while an alternative scheme is introduced to obtain two-qubit gates via resonant photon exchange. The latter is compared to the dispersive approach, finding in general a significant improvement. The performance of the platform is assessed by realistic numerical simulations of gate sequences, such as Deutsch-Josza and quantum simulation algorithms. The very good results demonstrate the feasibility of the molecular route towards a universal quantum processor.

By leveraging Identity-Based Encryption (IBE), our solution minimizes the necessary modifications to the surrounding infrastructure, enabling the reuse of existing keys and certificates. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and performance analysis, demonstrating the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

TI A strain-engineered graphene qubit in a nanobubble
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a controllable qubit in a graphene nanobubble (NB) with emergent two-level systems (TLSs) induced by pseudo-magnetic fields (PMFs). We found that double quantum dots can be created by the strain-induced PMFs of a NB, and also that their quantum states can be manipulated by either local gate potentials or the PMFs. Graphene qubits clearly exhibit avoided crossing behavior as electrical detuning, with energy splittings of about few meV. We show a remarkable tunability of our device design that allows a fine control of the Landau-Zener transition probability by strain engineering of the NB, showing half-and-half splitting at the avoided crossing point. Further, we demonstrate that the TLSs in the NB exhibit Rabi oscillations near the avoided crossing point, resulting in very fast Rabi cycles of a few ps.

TI Random logic networks: From classical Boolean to quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We investigate dynamical properties of a quantum generalization of classical reversible Boolean networks. The state of each node is encoded as a single qubit, and classical Boolean logic operations are supplemented by controlled bit-flip and Hadamard operations. We consider synchronous updating schemes in which each qubit is updated at each step based on stored values of the qubits from the previous step. We investigate the periodic or quasiperiodic behavior of quantum networks, and we analyze the propagation of single site perturbations through the quantum networks with input degree one. A nonclassical mechanism for perturbation propagation leads to substantially different evolution of the Hamming distance between the original and perturbed states.

TI Design and Implementation of the Illinois Express Quantum Metropolitan
   Area Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The Illinois Express Quantum Network (IEQNET) is a program to realize metropolitan-scale quantum networking over deployed optical fiber using currently available technology. IEQNET consists of multiple sites that are geographically dispersed in the Chicago metropolitan area. Each site has one or more quantum nodes (Q-Nodes) representing the communication parties in a quantum network. Q-Nodes generate or measure quantum signals such as entangled photons and communicate the measurement results via standard classical signals and conventional networking processes. The entangled photons in IEQNET nodes are generated at multiple wavelengths and are selectively distributed to the desired users via transparent optical switches. Here, we describe the network architecture of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered hierarchy that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) technology to perform traditional wavelength routing and assignment between the Q-Nodes. Specifically, SDN decouples the control and data planes, with the control plane being entirely implemented in the classical domain. We also discuss the IEQNET processes that address issues associated with synchronization, calibration, network monitoring, and scheduling. An important goal of IEQNET is to demonstrate the extent to which the control plane classical signals can copropagate with the data plane quantum signals in the same fiber lines (quantum-classical signal "coexistence"). This goal is furthered by the use of tunable narrowband optical filtering at the receivers and, at least in some cases, a wide wavelength separation between the quantum and classical channels. We envision IEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks by demonstrating metropolitan-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement distribution and quantum-state teleportation.

TI Holography and quantum information exchange between systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB In this paper, we estimate the net information exchange between adjacent quantum subsystems holographically living on the boundary of AdS space-time. The information exchange is a real-time phenomenon and only after long-time interval it may get saturated. Normally, we prepare systems for small time intervals and measure the information exchange over finite interval only. We find that the information flow between entangled subsystems gets reduced if systems are in excited state whereas the ground state allows maximum information flow at any given time. Especially for CFT2 we exactly show that a rise in the entropy is detrimental to the information exchange by a quantum dot and vice versa. We next observe that there is a reduction in circuit (CV) complexity too in the presence of excitations for small times.

TI Mapping Guaranteed Positive Secret Key Rates for Continuous Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB The standard way to measure the performance of existing continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocols is by using the achievable secret key rate (SKR) with respect to one parameter while keeping all other parameters constant. However, this atomistic method requires many individual parameter analyses while overlooking the co-dependence of other parameters. In this work, a numerical tool is developed for comparing different CVQKD protocols while taking into account the simultaneous effects of multiple CVQKD parameters on the capability of protocols to produce positive SKRs. Using the transmittance, excess noise, and modulation amplitude parameter space, regions of positive SKR are identified to compare three discrete modulated (DM) CVQKD protocols. The results show that the M-QAM protocol outperforms the M-APSK and M-PSK protocols and that there is a non-linear increase in the capability to produce positive SKRs as the number of coherent states used for a protocol increases. The tool developed is beneficial for choosing the optimum protocol in unstable channels, such as free space, where the transmittance and excess noise fluctuate, providing a more holistic assessment of a protocol's capability to produce positive SKRs.

TI Quantum Support Vector Regression for Disability Insurance

The modeling of logistic disability inception probabilities is formulated as a support vector regression problem. Using a quantum feature map, the data are mapped to quantum states belonging to a quantum feature space, where the associated kernel is determined by the inner product between the quantum states. This quantum kernel can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer. We conduct experiments on the IBM Yorktown quantum computer, fitting the model to disability inception data from a Swedish insurance company.

TI Recommender system expedited quantum control optimization
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Quantum control optimization algorithms are routinely used to synthesize optimal quantum gates or to realize efficient quantum state transfers. The computational resource required for the optimization is an essential consideration in order to scale toward quantum control of larger registers. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of a machine learning method, specifically the recommender system (RS), to deal with the challenge of enhancing computational efficiency. Given a sparse database of a set of products and their customer ratings, RS is used to efficiently predict unknown ratings. In the quantum control problem, each iteration of a numerical optimization algorithm typically involves evaluating a large number of parameters, such as gradients or fidelities, which can be tabulated as a rating matrix. We establish that RS can rapidly and accurately predict elements of such a sparse rating matrix. Using this approach, we expedite a gradient ascent based quantum control optimization, namely GRAPE, and demonstrate the faster construction of two-qubit CNOT gate in registers with up to 8 qubits. We also describe and implement the enhancement of the computational speed of a hybrid algorithm involving simulated annealing as well as gradient ascent. Moreover, the faster construction of three-qubit Toffoli gates further confirmed the applicability of RS in larger registers.

TI Field test of quantum key distribution with high key creation efficiency
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditional security for communication. However, the random choices of the measurement basis in QKD usually result in low key creation efficiency. This drawback is overcome in the differential-phase-shift QKD, provided that each photon can be prepared in a large number of time slots with a proper waveform. In this work we develop a miniature room-temperature 1550-nm single-photon source to generate narrowband single photon in 50 time slots with a nearly optimal waveform for achieving unity key creation efficiency. By utilizing these single photons in the field test, we demonstrate the differential -phase-shift QKD with a key creation efficiency of 97%. Our work shows that the practical QKD can benefit from the narrowband single photons with controllable waveforms.

TI A trade-off between classical and quantum circuit size for an attack

SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB We propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the underlying hard problem of the CSIDH cryptosystem (and other isogeny-based cryptosystems using elliptic curves with endomorphism ring isomorphic to an imaginary quadratic order O). Let Delta = Disc(O) (in CSIDH, Delta = -4p for p the security parameter). Let 0 < alpha < 1/2, our algorithm requires:
   A classical circuit of size 2((O) over tilde (log(vertical bar Delta vertical bar)1-alpha)).
   A quantum circuit of size 2((O) over tilde (log(vertical bar Delta vertical bar)alpha)).
   Polynomial classical and quantum memory.
   Essentially, we propose to reduce the size of the quantum circuit below the state-of-the-art complexity 2((O) over tilde (log(vertical bar Delta vertical bar)1/2)) at the cost of increasing the classical circuit-size required. The required classical circuit remains subexponential, which is a superpolynomial improvement over the classical state-of-the-art exponential solutions to these problems. Our method requires polynomial memory, both classical and quantum.

TI Permutation-equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The Symmetric group S-n manifests itself in large classes of quantum systems as the invariance of certain characteristics of a quantum state with respect to permuting the qubits. Subgroups of S-n arise, among many other contexts, to describe label symmetry of classical images with respect to spatial transformations, such as reflection or rotation. Equipped with the formalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this study we propose the architectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) adherent to S-n and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of pixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for small subgroups of S-n. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the full permutation group S-n is built by applying all possible QCNNs with equal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in quantum neural networks. For subgroups of S-n, our numerical results using MNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs. The S-n-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training and test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected and non-connected graphs. When trained with sufficiently large number of data, the S-n-equivariant QCNN shows better average performance compared to S-n-equivariant QNN . These results contribute towards building powerful quantum machine learning architectures in permutation-symmetric systems.

TI Boost clustering with Gaussian Boson Sampling: a quantum-classical
   hybrid approach
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a recently developed paradigm of quantum computing consisting of sending a Gaussian state through a linear interferometer and then counting the number of photons in each output mode. When the system encodes a symmetric matrix, GBS can be viewed as a tool to sample subgraphs: the most sampled are those with a large number of perfect matchings, and thus are the densest ones. This property has been the foundation of the novel clustering approach we propose in this work, called GBS-based clustering, which relies solely on GBS, without the need of classical algorithms. The GBS-based clustering has been tested on several datasets and benchmarked with two well-known classical clustering algorithms. Results obtained by using a GBS simulator show that on average, our approach outperforms the two classical algorithms in two out of the three chosen metrics, proposing itself as a viable quantum-classical hybrid clustering option.

TI Quantum information approach to the implementation of a neutron cavity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Using the quantum information model of dynamical diffraction we consider a neutron cavity composed of two perfect crystal silicon blades capable of containing the neutron wavefunction. We show that the internal confinement of the neutrons through Bragg diffraction can be modelled by a quantum random walk. Furthermore, we introduce a toolbox for modelling crystal imperfections such as surface roughness and defects. Good agreement is found between the simulation and the experimental implementation, where leakage beams are present, modelling of which is impractical with the conventional theory of dynamical diffraction. Analysis of the standing neutron waves is presented in regards to the crystal geometry and parameters; and the conditions required for well-defined bounces are derived. The presented results enable new approaches to studying the setups utilizing neutron confinement, such as the experiments to measure neutron magnetic and electric dipole moments.

We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a method to tune the interaction between a TLS, implemented as a flux qubit, and a transmission line waveguide from a decoupled state to a coupling strength that is a significant fraction of the TLS transition frequency, near the ultrastrong coupling regime. The coupling, controlled via magnetic flux, is described by a normalized coupling strength alpha that is measured to range between 6.2x10-5 and 2.19x10-2, with larger attainable maximum values predicted by a circuit model of the device. This system enables future investigations in the dynamics of the spin-boson model, microwave photonics, and relativistic quantum information.

TI Fault-Tolerant Code-Switching Protocols for Near-Term Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Topological color codes are widely acknowledged as promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Neither a two-dimensional nor a three-dimensional topology, however, can provide a universal gate set {H, T, CNOT}, with the T gate missing in the two-dimensional and the H gate in the threedimensional case. These complementary shortcomings of the isolated topologies may be overcome in a combined approach, by switching between a two- and a three-dimensional code while maintaining the logical state. In this work, we construct resource-optimized deterministic and nondeterministic code-switching protocols for two- and three-dimensional distance-three color codes using fault-tolerant quantum circuits based on flag qubits. Deterministic protocols allow for the fault-tolerant implementation of logical gates on an encoded quantum state, while nondeterministic protocols may be used for the fault-tolerant preparation of magic states. Taking the error rates of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors as a reference, we find a logical failure probability of 3% for deterministic logical gates, which cannot be realized transversally in the respective code. By replacing the three-dimensional distance-three color code in the protocol for magic state preparation with the morphed code introduced in Vasmer and Kubica [PRX Quantum 3, 030319 (2022)], we reduce the logical failure rates by 2 orders of magnitude, thus rendering it a viable method for magic state preparation on near-term quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that code switching enables the fault-tolerant and deterministic implementation of a universal gate set under realistic conditions, and thereby provide a practical avenue to advance universal, fault-tolerant quantum computing and enable quantum algorithms on first, error-corrected logical qubits.

Based on this idea, we model such pointers by qubits and couple them to a free particle, in analogy to a classical time-of-flight arrangement. The corresponding Heisenberg dynamics leads to pointer observables whose expectation values allow us to reconstruct the particle's momentum distribution via the characteristic function. We investigate different initial qubit states and find that such a reconstruction can be considerably simplified by initially entangled pointers.

   uniformly accelerated atoms
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the entanglement dynamics for a quantum system composed of two uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in different spacetime dimensions. It is found that the range of parameters in which entanglement can be generated is shrunk and the amount of generated entanglement is also decreased with the increasing spacetime dimension, by calculating the evolution of two-atom states using the method for open quantum systems. We study the entanglement evolution between two accelerated atoms for different initial two-atom states, and the influence of corresponding spacetime dimensions for every initial state is discussed. When the spacetime dimensions increase, the change of entanglement becomes slower with time. The influence of spacetime dimensions on the change of entanglement also expands to the case of the massive field. The time delay for entanglement generation is shown in different spacetime dimensions. In particular, entanglement decreases more quickly with the increasing spacetime dimensions compared with that in the case of the massless field. The recently found anti-Unruh effect is discussed, and a novel and interesting phenomenon is found that the Unruh effect in small spacetime dimensions can become the anti-Unruh effect in large spacetime dimensions with the same parameters.

TI A Quantum Detectable Byzantine Agreement Protocol Using Only EPR Pairs
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we introduce a new quantum protocol for Detectable Byzantine Agreement. What distinguishes the proposed protocol among similar quantum protocols, is the fact that it uses only EPR pairs, and, in particular, |?(+)? pairs. There are many sophisticated quantum protocols that guarantee Detectable Byzantine Agreement, but they do not easily lend themselves to practical implementations, due to present-day technological limitations. For a large number n of players, |GHZ?n-tuples, or other more exotic entangled states, are not easy to produce, a fact which might complicate the scalability of such protocols. In contrast, Bell states are, undoubtedly, the easiest to generate among maximally entangled states. This will, hopefully, facilitate the scalability of the proposed protocol, as only EPR pairs are required, irrespective of the number n of players. Finally, we mention that, even for arbitrary many players n, our protocol always completes in a constant number of rounds, namely 4.

TI Design and implementation of quantum hippo inspired convolutional neural
   networks using parametric quantum circuits for an efficient lung cancer
   classification
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence in medical and engineering fields, the most unique solutions were deployed in any individual's life for prolonging their life span against the odds of growing disorders. One such disorder is Lung Cancer which is predominantly found in both women and men causing a disturbed life cycle which could lead to mental stress and even fatal end when unnoticed. In recent times, computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) act as a major automating diagnosing tool by building the self-tailored learning algorithms founded on Classical Machine and Deep Learning model. However, training classical learning frameworks consumes a huge computational resources which leads to complexity and low diagnostic performance. To overcome this problem, Quantum Hippo Optimized Convolution Neural Network (QHO-CNN) has been proposed to homogenize the quantum computations on classical computers which can effectively diagnose lung cancers with the high-speed computations. The proposed learning framework consists of four components namely Data collection & Data pre-processing, Classical Hippo Optimized Convolutional Neural networks, and Quantum based model using parametric quantum circuits (PQC), Evaluation and Analysis. The extensive experimentation carried out using LIDC-IDRI Lung cancer datasets which consists of original 1018 CT Lung Images and various learning capability tests was performed, which is then compared with the other learning framework. Results demonstrate that quantum-based learning framework has produced the accuracy of 0.97, precision of 0.964, recall of 0.963 and F1-score of 0.97 besides showing its strength of success in terms of recognising the image data and quantum training(5.431 HRS) against the other existing quantum models.

AB To address the semiconducting qubit biasing bottle-neck, we develop a cryogenic analog demultiplexer operating 64 independent channels at 4K and integrating a realistic 20 mu m to 100nm pitch reduction compatible with dense qubit arrays. We achieve <0.22% crosstalk while maintaining 0.44 mu V/s maximum voltage drift. Our active router allows DC to >100MHz signals to target static qubit polarization as well as fast (down to 3 ns) voltage pulses for qubit manipulation. From the extracted power consumption (3.54 mu W/MHz/channel), we can extrapolate the thermal budget required to control future large-scale qubit arrays.

AB With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.

TI Deterministic generation of large-scale hyperentanglement in three
   degrees of freedom
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for quantum information protocols, and hyperentanglement has received an increasing amount of attention for its high-capacity characteristic. Increasing the scale of hyperentanglement, i.e., the number of modes in a hyperentangled system, is crucial for enhancing its capability in quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate the generation of large-scale continuous-variable (CV) hyperentanglement in three degrees of freedom (DOFs), including azimuthal and radial indices of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes and frequency. In our experiment, 216 pairs of hyperentangled modes are deterministically generated from the four-wave mixing process in an atomic vapor. In addition, we show that the entanglement between coherent LG superposition modes denoted by both azimuthal and radial quantum numbers can also be generated from this system. Such large-scale CV hyperentanglement in three DOFs presents an efficient scheme to significantly increase the information capacity of the CV system. Our results provide a new platform for studying CV quantum information and open the avenue for constructing high-capacity parallel and multiple-DOF CV quantum information protocols.

TI Hypercube quantum search: exact computation of the probability of
   success in polynomial time
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In the emerging domain of quantum algorithms, Grover's quantum search is certainly one of the most significant. It is relatively simple, performs a useful task and more importantly, does it in an optimal way. However, due to the success of quantum walks in the field, it is logical to study quantum search variants over several kinds of walks. In this paper, we propose an in-depth study of the quantum search over a hypercube layout. First, through the analysis of elementary walk operators restricted to suitable eigenspaces, we show that the acting component of the search algorithm takes place in a small subspace of the Hilbert workspace that grows linearly with the problem size. Subsequently, we exploit this property to predict the exact evolution of the probability of success of the quantum search in polynomial time.

TI Quantum Computing Optimization Technique for IoT Platform using Modified
   Deep Residual Approach
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a global network of millions of devices connected in wireless that exchange data. Multiple data are aiming to be observed through a single platform, and it becomes necessary to evaluate accuracy in order to realize the ideal IoT platform. IoT data collection is more important to meet the growing data analysis in demanding time-sensitive and real-time decision making. There has been a lot of effort involved in developing efficient quantum neural networks due to the success over the traditional neural network. This research proposes a new deep residual learning based quantum-classical neural network (Res-QCNN). The residual structural block is connected to the quantum neural network to examine and provide a training algorithm for analysing the IoT platform. Simultaneously, the benefits and drawbacks of translating quantum idea form deep residual learning are discussed. As a result, training algorithm is performing in the proposed model from beginning to end, similar working of backpropagation in traditional neural networks. When compared to existing, the Res-QCNN completes better when learning a Unitary function and has robustness for noisy data.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI Flexible and Compact MLWE-Based KEM
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In order to resist the security risks caused by quantum computing, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has been a research focus. Constructing a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on lattices is one of the promising PQC routines. The algebraically structured learning with errors (LWE) problem over power-of-two cyclotomics has been one of the most widely used hardness assumptions for lattice-based cryptographic schemes. However, power-of-two cyclotomic rings may be exploited in the inflexibility of selecting parameters. Recently, trinomial cyclotomic rings of the form Zq[x]/(xn-xn/2+1), where n=2k3l, k >= 1,l >= 0, have received widespread attention due to their flexible parameter selection. In this paper, we propose Tyber, a variant scheme of the NIST-standardized KEM candidate Kyber over trinomial cyclotomic rings. We provide three parameter sets, aiming at the quantum security of 128, 192, and 256 bits (actually achieving 129, 197, and 276 bits) with matching and negligible error probabilities. When compared to Kyber, our Tyber exhibits stronger quantum security, by 22, 31, and 44 bits, than Kyber for three security levels.

TI Nonreciprocal interaction and entanglement between two superconducting
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonreciprocal interaction between two spatially separated subsystems plays a crucial role in signal processing and quantum networks. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to achieve nonreciprocal interaction and entanglement between two qubits by combining coherent and dissipative couplings in a superconducting platform, where two coherently coupled transmon qubits simultaneously interact with a transmission line waveguide. The coherent interaction between the transmon qubits can be achieved via capacitive coupling or via an intermediary cavity mode, while the dissipative interaction is induced by the transmission line via reservoir engineering. With high tunability of superconducting qubits, their positions along the transmission line can be adjusted to tune the dissipative coupling, enabling to tailor reciprocal and nonreciprocal interactions between the qubits. A unidirectional interaction can be achieved when the separation between the two qubits is (4n + 3)lambda 0/4, where n is an integer and lambda 0 is the photon wavelength. This nonreciprocal interaction enables the generation of nonreciprocal entanglement between the two transmon qubits. Furthermore, applying a drive field to one of the qubits can stabilize the system into a nonreciprocal steady-state entangled state. Remarkably, the nonreciprocal interaction in this work does not rely on the presence of nonlinearity or any explicitly nonreciprocal elements, which has more potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices, processing quantum information, and building quantum networks.

TI Laser-written waveguide-integrated coherent spins in diamond
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum emitters, such as the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, are attractive for quantum technologies, such as nano-sensing, quantum information processing, and as a non-classical light source. However, it is still challenging to position individual emitters in photonic structures while preserving the spin coherence properties of the defect. In this paper, we investigate single and ensemble waveguide-integrated nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond fabricated by femtosecond laser writing followed by thermal annealing. Their spin coherence properties are systematically investigated and are shown to be comparable to native nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This method paves the way for the fabrication of coherent spins integrated within photonic devices. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Computational design of quantum defects in two-dimensional materials
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB Missing atoms or atom substitutions (point defects) in crystal lattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials are potential hosts for emerging quantum technologies, such as single-photon emitters and spin quantum bits (qubits). First-principles-guided design of quantum defects in 2D materials is paving the way for rational spin qubit discovery. Here we discuss the frontier of first-principles theory development and the challenges in predicting the critical physical properties of point defects in 2D materials for quantum information technology, in particular for optoelectronic and spin-optotronic properties. Strong many-body interactions at reduced dimensionality require advanced electronic structure methods beyond mean-field theory. The great challenges for developing theoretical methods that are appropriate for strongly correlated defect states, as well as general approaches for predicting spin relaxation and the decoherence time of spin defects, are yet to be addressed.

AB Programmable interferometric circuits are at the heart of integrated quantum photonic processors. While the lithium niobate-on-insulator platform has the potential to advance integrated quantum photonics due to its strong nonlinearity and tight mode confinement, the demonstration of reconfigurable two-photon interference has not yet been achieved. Here, we design, fabricate and characterize the building block of such interferometric networks in the form of a 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. We use a thermo-optic phase shifter to achieve stable performance with a power consumption of P pi = 44.4 mW and sub-microsecond switching times. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our device for quantum applications by measuring single-photon routing with up to 34 dB extinction ratio. We show Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with fully tunable visibilities reaching a maximum value of 97.4 +/- 1.0 % . As part of large scale quantum photonic circuits, this building block will facilitate reconfigurable and tunable photonic processing units integrated alongside non-classical light sources.

TI Benchmarking Hamiltonian Noise in the D-Wave Quantum Annealer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Various sources of noise limit the performance of quantum computers by altering qubit states in an uncontrolled manner throughout computations and reducing their coherence time. In quantum annealers, this noise introduces additional fluctuations to the parameters defining the original problem Hamiltonian, such that they find the ground states of problems perturbed from those originally programmed. Here, we describe a method to benchmark the amount of noise affecting the programmed Hamiltonian of a quantum annealer. We show that a sequence of degenerate runs with the coefficients of the programmed Hamiltonian set to zero leads to an estimate of the noise spectral density affecting Hamiltonian parameters "in situ" during the quantum annealing protocol. The method is demonstrated in D-Wave's lower noise 2000 qubit device (DW_2000Q_6) and in its recently released 5000 qubit device (Advantage_system1.1). Our benchmarking of DW_2000Q_6 shows Hamiltonian noise dominated by the 1/f(0.7) (f)requency dependence characteristic of flux noise intrinsic to the materials forming flux qubits. In contrast, Advantage_system1.1 is found to be affected by additional noise sources for low annealing times, with underlying intrinsic flux noise amplitudes 2-3 times higher than in DW_2000Q_6 for all annealing times.

AB We discuss the generation and the long-time persistence of entanglement in open two-qubit systems whose reduced dissipative dynamics is not a priori engineered but is instead subjected to filtering and Markovian feedback. In particular, we analytically study (1) whether the latter operations may enhance the environment capability of generating entanglement at short times and (2) whether the generated entanglement survives in the long-time regime. We show that, in the case of particularly symmetric Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad it is possible to fully control the convex set of stationary states of the two-qubit reduced dynamics, therefore the asymptotic behaviour of any initial two-qubit state. We then study the impact of a suitable class of feed-back operations on the considered dynamics.

TI Two-Qubit Local Fisher Information Correlation beyond Entanglement in a
   Nonlinear Generalized Cavity with an Intrinsic Decoherence
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we study a Hamiltonian system constituted by two coupled two-level atoms (qubits) interacting with a nonlinear generalized cavity field. The nonclassical two-qubit correlation dynamics are investigated using Bures distance entanglement and local quantum Fisher information under the influences of intrinsic decoherence and qubit-qubit interaction. The effects of the superposition of two identical generalized coherent states and the initial coherent field intensity on the generated two-qubit correlations are investigated. Entanglement of sudden death and sudden birth of the Bures distance entanglement as well as the sudden changes in local Fisher information are observed. We show that the robustness, against decoherence, of the generated two-qubit correlations can be controlled by qubit-qubit coupling and the initial coherent cavity states.

TI Magnon Blockade and Magnon-Atom Entanglement Induced by a Qutrit Coupled
   to a Ferromagnetic YIG Sphere
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Hybridized magnonic-photonic systems promise novel applications for future information processing technologies. Here, a hybrid magnonic system comprising of a qutrit (?-type three-level atom) and a ferromagnetic YIG sphere is considered. Indeed, the whole system is driven by two light fields under the influence of the thermal environment. The indirect magnon-atom interaction is established via the virtual photon exchange. The associated Lindblad master equation is derived and its solution is found to investigate the nonclassical feature, especially in the steady-state solution. Generally, the system shows considerable nonclassicality, that is, strong magnon antibunching and magnon blockade. In fact, the feasibility of using such a hybrid system to prepare a single-magnon source based on magnon blockade effects we theoretically demonstrated. Besides, the considered system may be exploited to generate robust and stable magnon-atom entanglement. The appearance of magnon blockade and magnon-atom entanglement in the ?-type atom may have its origin in the fact that the atom is trapped in different superposition states, induced by the quantum interference phenomenon. The proposed model and the corresponding results may open up an intriguing prospect to prepare a single-magnon source and provide further benefits through concatenating with photons in optomagnonic systems.

TI Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Volt-VAR Control in Power
   Distribution Systems
SO IEEE OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL OF POWER AND ENERGY
AB Volt-VAR control (VVC) is crucial in active distribution networks for optimizing voltage profiles and minimizing network losses. While traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms exhibit promise for VVC, they often require extensive computational resources to handle such a high-dimensional problem. As a potential solution, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithms integrate the computational capabilities of quantum computing into the DRL framework. However, existing QRL algorithms struggle with complex VVC problems due to the limitations of current quantum hardware. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an innovative QRL algorithm featuring an end-to-end architecture that integrates a classical autoencoder, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), and classical post-processing layers. This design efficiently compresses high-dimensional grid states, enabling VQCs to leverage quantum advantages while producing multiple control device outputs tailored for VVC tasks. Numerical studies on three representative distribution systems verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed QRL algorithm, and demonstrate its enhanced performance over classical approaches with only approximately 1% of the parameters. Additionally, the robustness of our developed algorithm is validated through noisy quantum environments.

TI Color center in <bold>β</bold>-Ga2O3
   emitting at the telecom range
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Transition metal (TM) ions incorporated into a host from a wide bandgap semiconductor are recognized as a promising system for quantum technologies with enormous potential. In this work, we report on a TM color center in beta-Ga2O3 with physical properties attractive for quantum information applications. The center is found to emit at 1.316 mu m and exhibits weak coupling to phonons, with optically addressable higher-lying excited states, beneficial for single-photon emission within the telecom range (O-band). Using magneto-photoluminescence (PL) complemented by time-resolved PL measurements, we identify the monitored emission to be internal E-1 ->(3)A(2) spin-forbidden transitions of a 3d(8) TM ion with a spin-triplet ground state-a possible candidate for a spin qubit. We tentatively attribute this color center to a complex involving a sixfold coordinated Cu3+ ion.

TI Factory-based fault-tolerant preparation of quantum polar codes encoding
   one logical qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A fault-tolerant way to prepare logical code states of Q1 1 codes, i.e., quantum polar codes encoding one qubit, was recently proposed. The fault tolerance therein is guaranteed by an error detection gadget, where, if an error is detected during the preparation, one entirely discards the preparation. Due to error detection, the preparation is probabilistic and its success rate, referred to as the preparation rate, , decreases rapidly with the code length, preventing the preparation of code states of large code- lengths. In this paper, to improve the preparation rate, we consider a factory preparation of Q1 1 code states, where one attempts to prepare several copies of Q1 1 code states in parallel. Using an extra scheduling step, we can avoid discarding the preparation entirely every time an error is detected, hence, achieving an increased preparation rate in turn. We further provide a theoretical method to estimate preparation and logical error rates of Q1 1 codes, prepared using factory preparation, which is shown to tightly fit the Monte Carlo simulation-based numerical results. Therefore, our theoretical method is useful for providing estimates for large code lengths, where Monte Carlo simulations are practically not feasible. Our numerical results, for a circuit-level depolarizing noise model, indicate that the preparation rate increases significantly, especially for large code-length N . For example, for N = 256, it increases from 0.02% . 02% to 27% for a practically interesting physical error rate p = 10-3. - 3 . Remarkably, a Q1 1 code with N = 256 achieves logical error rates around 10-11 - 11 and 10-15 - 15 for p = 10-3 - 3 and p = 3 x 10-4, - 4 , respectively. This corresponds to an improvement of about three orders of magnitude compared to a surface code with similar code length and minimum distance, thus showing the promise of the proposed scheme for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Crystallinity in niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate two-level-system
   defects in niobium three-dimensional resonators for quantum applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Materials imperfections in Nb-based superconducting quantum circuits-in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects-are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices will help develop strategies that eliminate them, which are key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-h high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650 degrees C, even after exposure to air and high-pressure rinsing (HPR). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveal an alteration of the native oxide composition regrown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nanoscale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator. Tunneling spectroscopy measurements show a pronounced proximity effect that further confirms the presence of metallic layers on the niobium surface.

TI Plasmonic Nanodiamond - Microneedle Bioinspired System for Ultrarapid
   Sampling and Quantum Sensing of Melanoma-Related MiRNA
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB MicroRNA (miRNA) in interstitial fluid (ISF) is a promising biomarker for early disease diagnosis, but its quantification is challenging due to low sampling efficiency and weak signals. Here, inspired by the osmotic pressure-driven feeding mechanism of sea anemones, a novel is designed that plasmonic nanodiamonds - microneedles (PND-MNs) bioinspired system for ultrarapid sampling and quantum sensing of melanoma-related miRNA. Specifically, high-osmotic hydrogel microneedles, prepared by immersing in LiCl solution, exhibit a substantial swelling ratio for rapid ISF enrichment, extracting 0.92 +/- 0.14 mg within 5 min. Concurrently, by coating fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with hollow composite metal Au-Ag NPs, precise modulation of the fluorescence intensity of nitrogen vacancy color centers (NV-center) in FNDs has been achieved. This innovative quantum sensing technology significantly enhances the fluorescence signal in the PND-MNs bioinspired system, amplifying it by a factor of 16, reducing the detection limit of miRNA to an unprecedented 0.68 fm (to the knowledge, no method based on fluorescent microneedles for detecting biomarkers has surpassed this level). Furthermore, the PND-MNs bioinspired system, employing backpropagation neural network (BPNN), achieves high accuracy in recognizing miRNA concentrations (R2 = 0.9986). By combining rapid sampling, signal enhancement, and machine learning, it holds promise for detecting ISF biomarkers, offering significant clinical applications.

TI Counterdiabatic Optimized Local Driving
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Adiabatic protocols are employed across a variety of quantum technologies, from implementing state preparation and individual operations that are building blocks of larger devices, to higher-level protocols in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation. The problem of speeding up these processes has garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a menagerie of approaches, most notably quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity. The two approaches are complementary: optimal control manipulates control fields to steer the dynamics in the minimum allowed time, while shortcuts to adia-baticity aims to retain the adiabatic condition upon speed-up. We outline a new method that combines the two methodologies and takes advantage of the strengths of each. The new technique improves upon approximate local counterdiabatic driving with the addition of time-dependent control fields. We refer to this new method as counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD) and we show that it can result in a substantial improvement when applied to annealing protocols, state preparation schemes, entanglement generation, and population transfer on a lattice. We also demonstrate a new approach to the optimization of control fields that does not require access to the wave function or the computation of system dynamics. COLD can be enhanced with existing advanced optimal control methods and we explore this using the chopped randomized basis method and gradient ascent pulse engineering.

TI Squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing with quadratic optomechanics
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Cavity optomechanical (COM) sensors, enhanced by quantum squeezing or entanglement, have become powerful tools for measuring ultra-weak forces with high precision and sensitivity. However, these sensors usually rely on linear COM couplings, a fundamental limitation when measurements of the mechanical energy are desired. Very recently, a giant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio was predicted in a quadratic COM system. Here we show that the performance of such a system can be further improved surpassing the standard quantum limit by using quantum squeezed light. Our approach is compatible with available engineering techniques of advanced COM sensors and provides new opportunities for using COM sensors in tests of fundamental laws of physics and quantum metrology applications.

TI Collisional-model quantum trajectories for entangled-qubit environments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with a stream of entangled-qubit pairs in the weak coupling limit. For a large class of two-qubit bath states, we present a detailed framework describing conditional dynamical maps for the system, known as quantum trajectories, that arise when the qubits are measured. Depending on the measurement basis, these quantum trajectories can be jump-type or diffusive-type, and can successively transfer entanglement from the bath qubits other quantum systems. They also exhibit features not present in standard quantum optical trajectories due to the fact that collisional models are not confined by the standard white-noise limit for optical-mode baths. As an example of this formalism, we consider the case of two remote two-level systems, where jump-type quantum trajectories herald the birth and death of entanglement.

AB Recent progress in quantum simulation and algorithms has demonstrated a rapid expansion in capabilities. The search continues for new techniques and applications to exploit quantum advantage. Here we propose an innovative method to investigate directly the properties of a time-dependent density operator ?(t) . Using quantum commutation simulators, we can directly compute the expectation value of the commutation relation and thus of the rate of change of ?(t) . The approach can be utilized as a quantum eigen-vector solver for the von Neumann equation and a decoherence investigator for the Lindblad equation, by using just the statistics of single-qubit measurements. A simple but important example is demonstrated in the single-qubit case and we discuss extension of the method for practical quantum simulation with many qubits, towards investigation of more realistic quantum systems.

AB Generation and manipulation of randomness is a relevant task for several applications of information technology. It has been shown that quantum mechanics offers some advantages for this type of task. A promising model for randomness manipulation is provided by Bernoulli factories-protocols capable of changing the bias of Bernoulli random processes in a controlled way. At first, this framework was proposed and investigated in a fully classical regime. Recent extensions of this model to the quantum case showed the possibility of implementing a wider class of randomness manipulation functions. We propose a Bernoulli factory scheme with quantum states as the input and output, using a photonic-path-encoding approach. Our scheme is modular and universal and its functioning is truly oblivious of the input bias-characteristics that were missing in earlier work. We report on experimental implementations using an integrated and fully programmable photonic platform, thereby demonstrating the viability of our approach. These results open new paths for randomness manipulation with integrated quantum technologies.
   A quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory is demonstrated by using a reconfigurable Clements's squared unitary circuit in an integrated quantum photonic platform. Three interferometer designs are proposed for the basic operations of a field on qubit states.

TI Calibration of Drive Nonlinearity for Arbitrary-Angle Single-Qubit Gates
   Using Error Amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to execute high-fidelity operations is crucial to scaling up quantum devices to large numbers of qubits. However, signal distortions originating from nonlinear components in the control lines can limit the performance of single-qubit gates. In this work, we use a measurement based on error amplification to characterize and correct the small single-qubit rotation errors originating from the nonlinear scaling of the qubit drive rate with the amplitude of the programmed pulse. With our hardware, and for a 15-ns pulse, the rotation angles deviate by up to several degrees from a linear model. Using purity benchmarking, we find that control errors reach 2 x 10-4, which accounts for half of the total gate error. Using crossentropy benchmarking, we demonstrate arbitrary-angle single-qubit gates with coherence-limited errors of 2 x 10-4 and leakage below 6 x 10-5. While the exact magnitude of these errors is specific to our setup, the presented method is applicable to most sources of nonlinearity. Our work shows that the nonlinearity of qubit drive line components imposes a limit on the fidelity of single-qubit gates, independent of improvements in coherence times, circuit design, or leakage mitigation when not corrected for.

AB Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a crucial architectural component for querying classical or quantum data in superposition, enabling algorithms with wide-ranging applications in quantum arithmetic, quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we introduce Fat-Tree QRAM, a novel query architecture capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries simultaneously while maintaining desirable scalings in query speed and fidelity. Specifically, Fat-Tree QRAM performs.. (log(N)) independent queries in O(log(N)) time using O (N) qubits, offering immense parallelism benefits over traditional QRAM architectures. To demonstrate its experimental feasibility, we propose modular and on-chip implementations of Fat-Tree QRAM based on superconducting circuits and analyze their performance and fidelity under realistic parameters. Furthermore, a query scheduling protocol is presented to maximize hardware utilization and access the underlying data at an optimal rate. These results suggest that Fat-Tree QRAM is an attractive architecture in a shared memory system for practical quantum computing.

TI FedQCNN: A Privacy-Preserving Federated Quantum Convolutional Neural
   Network for Retinal Image Classification
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) provides the opportunity for the success of an automated medical diagnostic system due to the effective representation of the solution space by quantum entangled states and faster optimisation through quantum superposition. Preserving medical data privacy is crucial while implementing an intelligent and efficient medical service provider system. The federated machine learning model is not only rich in diversified model experiences but also helps to protect patient data privacy. This paper proposes a secure, intelligent Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) application with a federated quantum convolutional neural network (FedQCNN) to classify medically significant retinal image patches. Following the gradient descent algorithm, we executed the model optimisation and performed the global aggregation using the weighted average of the local models' parameters. The proposed system achieves an evaluation accuracy of 96.8% on E-Ophtha retinal image dataset. We suggest over-the-air distributed machine learning with wireless multiple access channels to significantly save the scaled-up radio resource requirements for massive connectivity to ultra dense IoT devices. The research emphasises the significant progress of federated quantum machine learning and its prospects in the coming decades.

We extend the formalism of previous studies on D-Wave's quantum annealer as a computing platform to finite, simply reducible gauge groups. As an example, we use the dihedral group D-n with n = 3,4 on a two plaquette ladder for which we provide proof-of-principle calculations of the ground-state and employ the known time evolution formalism with Feynman clock states.

TI Quantum generative adversarial network with automated noise suppression
   mechanism based on WGAN-GP
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has attracted significant attention for its potential to deliver exponential advantages over classical machine learning approaches, particularly in classification and recognition tasks. Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), a form of quantum machine learning, provide promising advantages in image processing and generation tasks when compared to classical technologies. However, the limitations of current quantum devices have led to suboptimal image quality and limited robustness in earlier methods. To overcome these challenges, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical approach, introducing CAQ, a quantum-classical Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. Leveraging the latest WGAN-gradient penalty (GP) strategy, we trained and optimized the quantum generator, reduced the complexity of parameters, and implemented an adaptive noise input system that dynamically adjusts noise levels, thereby improving the model's robustness. Additionally, we employed a remapping technique to transform the original image's multimodal distribution into a unimodal one, thereby reducing the complexity of the learned distribution. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets show that CAQ generates grayscale images effectively, demonstrating its feasibility on near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

TI A quantum-based diagnostics approach for additive manufacturing machine
SO IET COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB Current Additive Manufacturing machines have limited techniques to observe process conditions and to decrease process errors. In order to overcome these limitations and increase the level and accuracy of machine intelligence, machine conditions need to be monitored more meticulously. A novel method for the condition monitoring of a 3D-printer is proposed in this paper. Quantum support vector machine (QSVM) is compiled for recognizing the health condition of the 3D-printer. The proposed quantum machine learning approach helps in monitoring the health state of the machine and classifies the same as healthy or aberrant. Classical machine learning approaches are inefficient to process the large amount of experimental data in real time. For better decision-making on such big data, quantum machine learning approaches are deployed which are much more efficient due to their exponential speed and parallel operation on complex sensor data, they show speedups in both the dimensionality and number of experimental data deployed to train the algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy in fault diagnosis than the traditional Support Vector Machine. All the numerical simulations and experiments have been carried out on a real quantum hardware provided by the IBM Quantum computing over the cloud.

TI Quantum Linear System Algorithm for General Matrices in System
   Identification
SO ENTROPY
AB Solving linear systems of equations is one of the most common and basic problems in classical identification systems. Given a coefficient matrix A and a vector b, the ultimate task is to find the solution x such that Ax=b. Based on the technique of the singular value estimation, the paper proposes a modified quantum scheme to obtain the quantum state vertical bar x > corresponding to the solution of the linear system of equations in O(kappa(2)root rpolylog(mn)/epsilon) time for a general mxn dimensional A, which is superior to existing quantum algorithms, where kappa is the condition number, r is the rank of matrix A and epsilon is the precision parameter. Meanwhile, we also design a quantum circuit for the homogeneous linear equations and achieve an exponential improvement. The coefficient matrix A in our scheme is a sparsity-independent and non-square matrix, which can be applied in more general situations. Our research provides a universal quantum linear system solver and can enrich the research scope of quantum computation.

AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has gained significant attention recently for exploring the quantum computing applications. In this work, we delve into QML applications using the quantum support vector classifier (QSVC). QSVC uses quantum feature maps to create quantum-enhanced kernels. These kernels have the potential to provide a quantum advantage over classical machine learning (ML) algorithms in data classification. In this study, we introduced a novel quantum feature map and analyzed its role in developing a quantum-enhanced classifier, thereby expanding the applications of QML. Additionally, the study explored the importance of hyperparameter tuning for achieving quantum enhancement. To demonstrate proof of concept, we analyzed motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets using the quantum kernel. We compared the results from our novel quantum feature map with outcomes from state-of-the-art feature maps. Additionally, we assessed the performance of quantum kernels in comparison with classical kernels and other ML classifiers. Finally, the study demonstrates the analytical advantages of the proposed quantum feature map over state-of-the-art feature maps and various classical classifiers through classification accuracy.

TI Quantum Sensing of Spin Fluctuations of Magnetic Insulator Films with
   Perpendicular Anisotropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers, optically active atomic defects in diamond, have been widely applied to emerging quantum sensing, imaging, and network efforts, showing unprecedented field sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution. Many of these advantages derive from their excellent quantum-coherence, single-spin addressability, and remarkable functionality over a broad temperature range, enabling opportunities to outperform their classical counterparts. To date, N-V measurements of spin fluctuations have mainly focused on systems with in-plane magnetization, but applications to material systems with a spontaneous out-of-plane magnetization remain largely unexplored despite their technological importance. Here, we report N-V sensing of intrinsic spin fluctuations of magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12 thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The measured field dependence of N-V relaxation rates is well correlated to the variation of magnon density and band structure of the magnetic samples, which are challenging to access by the conventional magnetometry methods. Our results highlight the significant opportunities offered by N-V centers in diagnosing the noise environment of functional magnetic elements, providing valuable information to develop next-generation, high-density, and scalable spintronic devices.

TI Quantum simulation of in-medium QCD jets: Momentum broadening, gluon
   production, and entropy growth
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Jets provide one of the primary probes of the quark-gluon plasma produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and the cold nuclear matter explored in deep inelastic scattering experiments. However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from being complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle iq) to the iq) + iqg) Fock space, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multiparticle jet probe in the presence of a medium described as a stochastic color field. Studying the momentum broadening of the jet state, we observe sizable sub-eikonal effects by comparing to eikonal estimates. We also study the medium-induced modifications to the gluon emission probability, which exhibit small corrections compared to the vacuum splitting function. In addition, we study the time evolution of the von-Neumann entropy associated with the quark component; we find that the exponential of the entropy grows linearly in time for the bare quark but superlinearly when taking into account gluon emission.

TI Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution with Partial Phase Postselection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties to share information-theoretically secure keys. In recent years, a revolutionary breakthrough called twin-field (TF) QKD has been developed to overcome the linear key-rate constraint and greatly increases the achievable distance. Phase randomization and subsequent postselection play roles in its security proof. Later, no-phase-postselection TF QKD was proposed and became a popular variant, since the removal of phase postselection leads to a higher key rate. However, the achievable distance is decreased compared to the original one. Here, we propose a TF QKD protocol with partial phase postselection. Namely, its code mode is still free from global phase randomization and postselection to make sure the advantage of the high key rate remain. On the other hand, phase postselection is introduced in the decoy mode to improve the performance. Applying an operator dominance condition, we prove universal security of the proposed protocol in the finite-key case under coherent attacks, and numerical simulations confirm its potential advantages in terms of key rate and achievable distance.

TI Surface loss calculations and design of a superconducting transmon qubit
   with tapered wiring
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Analytical formulas are presented for simplified but useful qubit geometries that predict surface dielectric loss when its thickness is much less than the metal thickness, the limiting case needed for real devices. These formulas can thus be used to precisely predict loss and optimize the qubit layout. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of surface loss comes from the small wire that connects the Josephson junction to the qubit capacitor. Tapering this wire is shown to significantly lower its loss. Also predicted are the size and density of the two-level state (TLS) spectrum from individual surface dissipation sites.

TI Demonstration of long-range correlations via susceptibility measurements
   in a one-dimensional superconducting Josephson spin chain
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spin chains have long been considered an effective medium for long-range interactions, entanglement generation, and quantum state transfer. In this work, we explore the properties of a spin chain implemented with superconducting flux circuits, designed to act as a connectivity medium between two superconducting qubits. The susceptibility of the chain is probed and shown to support long-range, cross-chain correlations. In addition, interactions between the two end qubits, mediated by the coupler chain, are demonstrated. This work has direct applicability in near term quantum annealing processors as a means of generating long-range, coherent coupling between qubits.

TI Violation of Bell inequality with unentangled photons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Violation of local realism via Bell inequality-a profound and counterintuitive manifestation of quantum theory that conflicts with the prediction of local realism-is viewed to be intimately linked with quantum entanglement. Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here, we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multiphoton frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four SDs. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.

TI Scalable multiphoton quantum metrology with neither pre- nor
   post-selected measurements
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The quantum statistical fluctuations of electromagnetic fields establish a limit, known as the shot-noise limit, on the sensitivity of optical measurements performed with classical technologies. However, quantum technologies are not constrained by this shot-noise limit. In this regard, the possibility of using every photon produced by quantum sources of light to estimate small physical parameters, beyond the shot-noise limit, constitutes one of the main goals of quantum optics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable protocol for quantum-enhanced optical phase estimation across a broad range of phases, with neither pre- nor post-selected measurements. This is achieved through the efficient design of a source of spontaneous parametric downconversion in combination with photon-number-resolving detection. The robustness of two-mode squeezed vacuum states against loss allows us to outperform schemes based on N00N states, in which the loss of a single photon is enough to remove all phase information from a quantum state. In contrast to other schemes that rely on N00N states or conditional measurements, the sensitivity of our technique could be improved through the generation and detection of high-order photon pairs. This unique feature of our protocol makes it scalable. Our work is important for quantum technologies that rely on multiphoton interference such as quantum imaging, boson sampling, and quantum networks.</p>

TI Skyrmion Qubits: A New Class of Quantum Logic Elements Based on
   Nanoscale Magnetization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a new class of primitive building blocks for realizing quantum logic elements based on nanoscale magnetization textures called skyrmions. In a skyrmion qubit, information is stored in the quantum degree of helicity, and the logical states can be adjusted by electric and magnetic fields, offering a rich operation regime with high anharmonicity. By exploring a large parameter space, we propose two skyrmion qubit variants depending on their quantized state. We discuss appropriate microwave pulses required to generate single-qubit gates for quantum computing, and skyrmion multiqubit schemes for a scalable architecture with tailored couplings. Scalability, controllability by microwave fields, operation time scales, and readout by nonvolatile techniques converge to make the skyrmion qubit highly attractive as a logical element of a quantum processor.

TI Deterministic Identification Over Channels With Finite Output: A
   Dimensional Perspective on Superlinear Rates
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length n, and that the optimal rate R is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension d of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac {1}{4} d \leq R \leq \frac {1}{2} d$ . Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a Hypothesis Testing Lemma showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.

TI Parallel quantum simulation of large systems on small NISQ computers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Tensor networks permit computational and entanglement resources to be concentrated in interesting regions of Hilbert space. Implemented on NISQ machines they allow simulation of quantum systems that are much larger than the computational machine itself. This is achieved by parallelising the quantum simulation. Here, we demonstrate this in the simplest case; an infinite, translationally invariant quantum spin chain. We provide Cirq and Qiskit code that translates infinite, translationally invariant matrix product state (iMPS) algorithms to finite-depth quantum circuit machines, allowing the representation, optimisation and evolution of arbitrary one-dimensional systems. The illustrative simulated output of these codes for achievable circuit sizes is given.

AB We designed and experimentally demonstrated a silicon photonics-integrated time-domain balanced homodyne detector (TBHD), containing an optical part of dimensions of 1.5 mm x 0.4 mm. To automatically and accurately balance the detector, new variable optical attenuators were used, and a common mode rejection ratio of 86.9 dB could be achieved. In the quantum tomography experiment, the density matrix and Wigner function of a coherent state were reconstructed with 99.97% fidelity. The feasibility of this TBHD in a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system was also demonstrated. Our TBHD technologies are expected to be used in silicon photonics-integrated CVQKD system and silicon photonics-integrated BB84 heterodyne system.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum computation without distillation on a 2D device
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We show how looped pipeline architectures-which use short-range shuttling of physical qubits to achieve bounded non-local connectivity-can efficiently implement the fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate between 2D surface codes described in (Sci. Adv. 6, eaay4929 (2020)). The shuttling schedule required is only marginally more complex than is required for implementing the standard 2D surface code in this architecture. We compare the resource cost with the cost of magic state distillation and find that, at present, this comparison is heavily in favour of distillation. The high cost of the non-Clifford gate is largely due to the relatively low performance of the just-in-time decoder used in the procedure, which necessitates very large code distances in order to achieve suitably low logical error rates. We argue that, as little attention has been given to the study and optimisation of these decoders, there are potentially significant improvements to be made in this area.

TI Line-of-sight quantum key distribution with differential phase shift
   keying
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Free-space optical (FSO) links offer a practical approach to realize quantum key distribution (QKD) in a global scale. However, when one wants to further extend the distance from the geostationary orbit to the ground, currently known QKD schemes cannot realize practical key rates mainly due to the diffraction losses of a laser beam. If the facts that the FSO links are highly directional and must be used in the line-of-sight (LoS) condition are taken into account, one may impose some physical restrictions on an eavesdropping model to explore longer-distance QKD. In this paper, we propose a novel FSO secret key agreement scheme, line-of-sight QKD (LoS-QKD), based on a quantum wiretap channel. In our model, an eavesdropper can tap only a limited fraction of the FSO signal beam but perform any physically allowable operations on the tapped signals. Fading effects which are significant in the FSO links are fully taken into account. We provide a security proof for the differential phase shift (DPS) keying scheme in terms of the metric which meets the composability. We investigate numerically the performances of LoS-QKD with DPS keying, including finite-length analysis, showing that our proposed scheme can realize high-speed and long-distance secret key agreement with information-theoretic security.

TI Quantum simulations of molecular systems with intrinsic atomic orbitals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulations of molecular systems on quantum computers often employ minimal basis sets of Gaussian orbitals. In comparison with more realistic basis sets, quantum simulations employing minimal basis sets require fewer qubits and quantum gates but yield results of lower accuracy. A natural strategy to achieve more accurate results is to increase the basis set size, which, in turn, requires increasing the number of qubits and quantum gates. Here we explore the use of intrinsic atomic orbitals in quantum simulations of molecules to improve the accuracy of energies and properties at the same computational cost required by a minimal basis. We investigate ground-state energies and one-and two-body density operators in the framework of the variational quantum eigensolver employing and comparing different Ansatze. We also demonstrate the use of this approach in the calculation of ground-and excited-state energies of small molecules by a combination of quantum algorithms using IBM quantum computers.

TI Entanglement-assisted authenticated BB84 protocol
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and second, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret key growing.In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic implementation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic-Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter mu. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 mu s and a 1 km distance between parties.

TI Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via quantum interference
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended HOM interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.

AB Quantum key distribution provides an unconditional secure key sharing method in theory, but the imperfect factors of practical devices will bring security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we characterize the imperfections of the sender and analyze the possible attack strategies of Eve. Firstly, we present a quantized model for distinguishability of decoy states caused by intensity modulation. Besides, considering that Eve may control the preparation of states through hidden variables, we evaluate the security of preparation in practical quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme based on the weak-randomness model. Finally, we analyze the influence of the distinguishability of decoy state to secure key rate, for Eve may conduct the beam splitting attack and control the channel attenuation of different parts. Through the simulation, it can be seen that the secure key rate is sensitive to the distinguishability of decoy state and weak randomness, especially when Eve can control the channel attenuation.

TI Single-mode quantum non-Gaussian light from warm atoms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The distributed quantum information processing and hybridization of quantum platforms raises increasing demands on the quality of light-matter interaction and realization of efficient quantum interfaces. This becomes particularly challenging for needed states possessing fundamental quantum non-Gaussian (QNG) aspects. They correspond to paramount resources in most potent applications of quantum technologies. We demonstrate the generation of light with provably QNG features from a warm atomic ensemble in a single-mode regime. The light is generated in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process in the presence of decoherence effects caused by a large atomic thermal motion. Despite its high sensitivity to any excess noise, direct observability of heralded QNG light could be achieved due to a combination of a fast resonant excitation, large spectral bandwidth, and a low absorption loss of resonant photons guaranteed by the source geometry.

AB Realistic modelling of qubit systems including noise and constraints imposed by control hardware is required for performance prediction and control optimization of quantum processors. We introduce qopt, a software framework for simulating qubit dynamics and robust quantum optimal control considering common experimental situations. To this end, we model open and closed qubit systems with a focus on the simulation of realistic noise characteristics and experimental constraints. Specifically, the influence of noise can be calculated using Monte Carlo methods, effective master equations or with the efficient filter function formalism, which enables the investigation and mitigation of auto-correlated noise. In addition, limitations of control electronics including finite bandwidth effects can be considered. The calculation of gradients based on analytic results is implemented to facilitate the efficient optimization of control pulses. The software is published under an open source license, well-tested and features a detailed documentation.

TI Comparative S/TEM study of superconducting Ta quantum resonators by wet
   and dry etching types
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting resonators play a pivotal role in various quantum technology applications, such as quantum computing and high-frequency communication systems. The performance of these resonators is closely tied to the properties of the superconducting films used in their fabrication. In this study, we investigated the impact of wet and dry etching on tantalum (Ta) films leveraging advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy-based characterization methods and examined the morphological, chemical, and strain changes caused by the etching processes. Consequently, we report the significant differences between the two etching methods, with dry etching resulting in straight slanted sidewalls and a thinner oxidized layer, while wet etching produced curved sidewalls and undercuts. Both methods led to the formation of a residual Ta wedge at the lower part of the sidewall, causing lattice deformation, which could adversely influence the homogeneous operations of superconducting devices. These insights enhance our understanding of how etching influences superconducting films, offering valuable guidance for optimizing resonators and related devices. Our findings mark a significant stride in advancing quantum technologies and high-frequency communication by enhancing our practical understanding of superconducting material fabrication.

TI Fock States in Additive Gaussian Noise Channels: Analytical and
   Numerical Considerations
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In this paper, we study the effects of additive Gaussian noise on Fock states. We put forth a simple analytical formula for the resulting output states. Additionally, we conduct numerical analysis into several key properties of noisy Fock states, including their purity, nonclassicality and non-Gaussianness, with respect to the noise parameter. Finally, we examine the impact of noise on entangled N00N states, focusing on its entanglement-breaking effects, which we quantify using the logarithmic negativity measure. Regarding purity, we observe that for a fixed noise level, the purity of a noisy Fock state decreases as the number of photons increases. In terms of non-Gaussianity, we show that at any given noise level, higher Fock states exhibit higher non-Gaussianity compared to lower ones. Although all noisy Fock states eventually lose their nonclassical characteristics under sufficient noise, higher Fock states exhibit more pronounced nonclassical features in low-noise conditions, whereas lower Fock states show greater nonclassicality in high-noise environments. We quantitatively show that the |2002 > state is the most robust against additive Gaussian noise among the N00N states.

TI State preparation error tolerant quantum key distribution protocol based
   on heralded single photon source
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In practical quantum key distribution systems, there inevitably exist errors in the quantum state preparation process due to imperfections in realistic equipment and devices. Those errors would lead to some security loopholes in the quantum key distribution systems. According to the work of Tamaki et al. (Phys. Rev. A 90 052314), here in this work we propose a state preparation error tolerant quantum key distribution protocol through using heralded single-photon sources.
   In this protocol, we characterize the size of the error in the preparation state of Alice and bring it into the security analysis, thereby avoiding possible security loopholes and improving the security of the system. Moreover, we take the three-intensity decoy-state method for example to introduce the method of constructing the model and estimating the parameters, and carry out corresponding numerical simulations.
   We make a comparison between the loss tolerant protocol with weak coherent source (WCS) and our present protocol using heralded single-photon source (HSPS). Simulation results show that under the same state preparation error, the key generation rate of the protocol based on WCS is higher than that of protocol based on HSPS at short transmission distances (e.g. less than 150 km). The main reason is that the detection efficiency of the local detector used in the latter scheme is low. However, in the case of long transmission distances (e.g. greater than 200 km), the key generation rate of scheme with WCS drops deeply, while the decline of the key generation rate of the present scheme is much flatter. As a result, the former can no longer generate keys after 211 km, while the latter can transmit a maximum distance of 228 km.
   Moreover, we also make a comparison between the present scheme and the GLLP protocol with HSPS. The simulation results show that the GLLP protocol with HSPS is very sensitive to the state preparation error and its key generation rate will rapidly decrease with the increase of the state preparation error. On the contrary, our present protocol shows almost no performance degradation under practical state preparation errors. It thus verify the robustness against the state preparation errors of our present work.
   In addition, in principle, the method can also be combined with the measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol and the twin-field quantum key distribution protocol to further increase the secure communication transmission distance that the present system can reach. Therefore, this work may provide an important reference value for the practical application of long-distance quantum secure communication in the near future.

AB Quantum simulation has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating complex many-body phenomena. A key requirement for emulating these dynamics is the realization of fully controllable quantum systems enabling various spin interactions. Yet, quantum simulators remain constrained in the types of attainable interactions. Here we demonstrate experimental realization of multiple microwave-engineered spin interactions in superconducting quantum circuits. By precisely controlling the native XY interaction and microwave drives, we achieve tunable spin Hamiltonians, including (i) XYZ spin models with continuously adjustable parameters, (ii) transverse-field Ising models, and (iii) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interacting systems. Our work expands the toolbox for analog-digital quantum simulation, paving the way for exploring a wide range of exotic quantum spin models.

TI Genomic privacy and security in the era of artificial intelligence and
   quantum computing
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB The rapid advancements in sequencing technologies have greatly increased access to genomic data stored in public databases. This has raised significant privacy and security concerns. This review emphasizes the importance of protecting genomic data by analyzing vulnerabilities in current storage and sharing practices. It examines the risks genetic databases face from cyber-attacks and internal breaches, focusing especially on advanced AI-driven threats and quantum computing vulnerabilities. The review explores machine learning methods designed to secure data. It highlights algorithms that prioritize privacy while maintaining data confidentiality, such as differential privacy, federated learning, and synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Findings demonstrate progress in mitigating common privacy breaches like re-identification and inference attacks. However, persistent vulnerabilities remain, particularly to emerging threats such as model inversion and membership inference attacks. The review advocates an integrated approach combining robust legislative frameworks with advanced technology to address genomic privacy challenges. It calls for intensified research efforts to safeguard genomic information. In particular, there is an urgent need to adopt quantum-resistant cryptographic methods, including lattice-based encryption and blockchain-integrated security frameworks. The paper emphasizes the necessity for genomics researchers to prioritize data privacy and security. This ensures responsible handling of genomic information in research.

TI Underwater Wavelength Attack on Discrete Modulated Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB The wavelength attack utilizes the dependence of beam splitters (BSs) on wavelength to cause legitimate users Alice and Bob to underestimate their excess noise so that Eve can steal more secret keys without being detected. Recently, the wavelength attack on Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has been researched in both fiber and atmospheric channels. However, the wavelength attack may also pose a threat to the case of ocean turbulent channels, which are vital for the secure communication of both ocean sensor networks and submarines. In this work, we propose two wavelength attack schemes on underwater discrete modulated (DM) CV-QKD protocol, which is effective for the case with and without local oscillator (LO) intensity monitor, respectively. In terms of the transmittance properties of the fused biconical taper (FBT) BS, two sets of wavelengths are determined for Eve's pulse manipulation, which are all located in the so-called blue-green band. The derived successful criterion shows that both attack schemes can control the estimated excess noise of Alice and Bob close to zero by selecting the corresponding condition parameters based on channel transmittance. Additionally, our numerical analysis shows that Eve can steal more bits when the wavelength attack controls the value of the estimated excess noise closer to zero.

TI Quantum causal unravelling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Complex processes often arise from sequences of simpler interactions involving a few particles at a time. These interactions, however, may not be directly accessible to experiments. Here we develop the first efficient method for unravelling the causal structure of the interactions in a multipartite quantum process, under the assumption that the process has bounded information loss and induces causal dependencies whose strength is above a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) threshold. Our method is based on a quantum algorithm whose complexity scales polynomially in the total number of input/output systems, in the dimension of the systems involved in each interaction, and in the inverse of the chosen threshold for the strength of the causal dependencies. Under additional assumptions, we also provide a second algorithm that has lower complexity and requires only local state preparation and local measurements. Our algorithms can be used to identify processes that can be characterized efficiently with the technique of quantum process tomography. Similarly, they can be used to identify useful communication channels in quantum networks, and to test the internal structure of uncharacterized quantum circuits.

TI Finite-Key Analysis for Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete-Phase
   Randomization
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties to share information-theoretic secret keys. Many QKD protocols assume the phase of encoding state can be continuous randomized from 0 to 2 pi, which, however, may be questionable in the experiment. This is particularly the case in the recently proposed twin-field (TF) QKD, which has received a lot of attention since it can increase the key rate significantly and even beat some theoretical rate-loss limits. As an intuitive solution, one may introduce discrete-phase randomization instead of continuous randomization. However, a security proof for a QKD protocol with discrete-phase randomization in the finite-key region is still missing. Here, we develop a technique based on conjugate measurement and quantum state distinguishment to analyze the security in this case. Our results show that TF-QKD with a reasonable number of discrete random phases, e.g., 8 phases from {0,pi/4,pi/2, horizontal ellipsis ,7 pi/4}, can achieve satisfactory performance. On the other hand, we find the finite-size effects become more notable than before, which implies that more pulses should be emit in this case. More importantly, as a the first proof for TF-QKD with discrete-phase randomization in the finite-key region, our method is also applicable in other QKD protocols.

TI Unidimensional Two-Way Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   Using Coherent States
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a unidimensional two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol with coherent states, where the sender modulates a single quadrature of the coherent states rather than both quadratures to simplify the structure of a two-way system. Security analysis is performed with a general attack strategy, known as two-mode attack, which helps to reduce limitations in the analysis. The performance of the protocol under all accessible two-mode attacks at fixed distance is illustrated. Further, two typical two-mode attack strategies are obtained from it, which are one-mode attack strategy and optimal two-mode attack strategy. Between them, the one-mode attack is the simplest form of the two-mode attack, while the optimal two-mode attack is the most complicated one. Simulations show that though the system is simplified, the performance of the two-way protocol with unidimensional modulation is still comparable to that of the counterpart with Gaussian modulation even against the optimal two-mode attack when Eve's ability is maximized. Thus, the proposed protocol simplifies the two-way system while guaranteeing its performance to a certain extent. Especially in a practical system with short transmission distance and high excess noise, the protocol has a good application prospect.

TI Practical Measurement Angular Errors Analysis for Thermal-State
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Thermal-state continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) of direct reconciliation with heterodyne detection can improve the robustness of the protocols. However, CV-QKD protocols require outlier detection, optical phase shifters are used to achieve orthogonal differentiation of the modes, but the actual optical phase shifters suffer from measurement angular errors, resulting in the imperfect phase. This kind of error degrades the security of the system. In this paper, we analyze the causes of measurement angular error and its impact on the secret key rate of the thermal-state CV-QKD protocols. We propose a compensation method to compensate for the effects of the measurement angular error and give a more complete secure analysis method under collective attack. The results obtained in this paper further improve the secure analysis under the thermal-state protocol and further enhance the performance of the system using the compensation method.

TI Dicke State Quantum Search for Solving the Vertex Cover Problem
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper proposes a quantum algorithm, named Dicke state quantum search (DSQS), to set qubits in the Dicke state |Dkn > of D states in superposition to locate the target inputs or solutions of specific patterns among 2n unstructured input instances, where n is the number of input qubits and D=nk=O(nk) for min(k,n-k)<< n/2. Compared to Grover's algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm that calls an oracle and a diffuser O(2n) times, DSQS requires no diffuser and calls an oracle only once. Furthermore, DSQS does not need to know the number of solutions in advance. We prove the correctness of DSQS with unitary transformations, and show that each solution can be found by DSQS with an error probability less than 1/3 through O(nk) repetitions, as long as min(k,n-k)<< n/2. Additionally, this paper proposes a classical algorithm, named DSQS-VCP, to generate quantum circuits based on DSQS for solving the k-vertex cover problem (k-VCP), a well-known NP-complete (NPC) problem. Complexity analysis demonstrates that DSQS-VCP operates in polynomial time and that the quantum circuit generated by DSQS-VCP has a polynomial qubit count, gate count, and circuit depth as long as min(k,n-k)<< n/2. We thus conclude that the k-VCP can be solved by the DSQS-VCP quantum circuit in polynomial time with an error probability less than 1/3 under the condition of min(k,n-k)<< n/2. Since the k-VCP is NP-complete, NP and NPC problems can be polynomially reduced to the k-VCP. If the reduced k-VCP instance satisfies min(k,n-k)<< n/2, then both the instance and the original NP/NPC problem instance to which it corresponds can be solved by the DSQS-VCP quantum circuit in polynomial time with an error probability less than 1/3. All statements of polynomial algorithm execution time in this paper apply only to VCP instances and similar instances of other problems, where min(k,n-k)<< n/2. Thus, they imply neither NP subset of BQP nor P = NP. In this restricted regime of min(k,n-k)<< n/2, the Dicke state subspace has a polynomial size of D=nk=O(nk), and our DSQS algorithm samples from it without asymptotic superiority over exhaustive enumeration. Nevertheless, DSQS may be combined with other quantum algorithms to better exploit the strengths of quantum computation in practice. Experimental results using IBM Qiskit packages show that the DSQS-VCP quantum circuit can solve the k-VCP successfully.

TI Secret key rate bounds for quantum key distribution with faulty active
   phase randomization
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) is undoubtedly the most efficient solution to handle multi-photon signals emitted by laser sources, and provides the same secret key rate scaling as ideal single-photon sources. It requires, however, that the phase of each emitted pulse is uniformly random. This might be difficult to guarantee in practice, due to inevitable device imperfections and/or the use of an external phase modulator for phase randomization in an active setup, which limits the possible selected phases to a finite set. Here, we investigate the security of decoy-state QKD when the phase is actively randomized by faulty devices, and show that this technique is quite robust to deviations from the ideal uniformly random scenario. For this, we combine a novel parameter estimation technique based on semi-definite programming, with the use of basis mismatched events, to tightly estimate the parameters that determine the achievable secret key rate. In doing so, we demonstrate that our analysis can significantly outperform previous results that address more restricted scenarios.

TI Channel Estimation and Secret Key Rate Analysis of MIMO Terahertz
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB We study the secret key rate (SKR) of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies, accounting for the effects of channel estimation. We propose a practical channel estimation scheme for the THz MIMO CVQKD system which is necessary to realize transmit-receive beamforming between Alice and Bob. We characterize the input-output relation between Alice and Bob during the key generation phase, by incorporating the effects of additional noise terms arising due to the channel estimation error and detector noise. Furthermore, we analyze the SKR of the system and study the effect of channel estimation error and overhead. Our simulation results reveal that the SKR may degrade significantly as compared to the SKR upper bound that assumes perfect channel state information, particularly at large transmission distances.

AB The simplest non-dissipative 2-level atom system, a qubit, excited by a train of resonant n-Gaussian laser pulses is investigated. This concerns examination of the averaged atomic variables, the intensity-intensity correlation function, and the transient fluorescent radiation. Analytical formulas for the above expressions are obtained. Computational results show that the transient spectra with the initial ground and coherent atomic states exhibit asymmetric Mollow structure with dip structure, dense oscillation, and narrowing, and depends on the pulse number (n), the repetition time (tau R), and the observed time.

Plasmonic cavities confine electromagnetic field in subwavelength region that makes the strong coupling with single quantum emitter possible even at room temperature. In this article, a conceptual introduction is provided to single quantum emitter strong coupling with plasmonic cavities along with a comprehensive review of recent experimental and theoretical advances. The phenomenon of strong light-matter coupling is examined, followed by a conceptual overview of plasmonic cavities and their unique electromagnetic properties. An overview of theoretical predictions and a detailed discussion of recent experimental advances demonstrating strong coupling between single quantum emitter and confined electromagnetic field of plasmonic cavities are then presented. The article is concluded by offering a perspective on the future of this rapidly evolving field, which promises to uncover even more intriguing physics and extend its impact across a wide range of scientific disciplines.

TI Accelerated adiabatic passage in cavity magnomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Cavity magnomechanics provides a readily controllable hybrid system, consisting of a cavity mode, magnon mode, and phonon mode, for quantum state manipulation and transfer. To implement a fast-and-robust state transfer between the hybrid photon-magnon mode and the phonon mode, we apply two accelerated-adiabatic-passage protocols based on the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian for transitionless quantum driving and the Levis-Riesenfeld invariant for inverse engineering. We construct the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian in a state-resolved way and express it through the creation and annihilation operators rather than the system eigenstates and their time derivatives. We can optimize the invariant-based inverse-engineering protocol with respect to the stability against the systematic errors of the coupling strength and frequency detuning. Both protocols apply for continuous-variable systems with arbitrary target states. We also discuss the decoherence effects from the thermal environment and the counterrotating interactions on both protocols. Our work contributes to the quantum memory for photonic and magnonic quantum information.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Recently, Cai [3] showed that Shor's quantum factoring algorithm fails to factor large integers when algorithm's quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is corrupted by a vanishing level of random noise on the QFT's precise controlled rotation gates. We show that under the same error model, Shor's quantum discrete log algorithm, and its various modifications, fail to compute discrete logs modulo P for a positive density of primes P and a similarly vanishing level of noise. We also show that the same noise level causes Shor's algorithm to fail with probability 1 - o(1) to compute discrete logs modulo P for randomly selected primes P.

TI Driven strongly correlated quantum circuits and Hall edge states:
   Unified photoassisted noise and revisited minimal excitations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the photoassisted shot noise (PASN) generated by time-dependent (TD) or random sources and transmission amplitudes. We show that it obeys a perturbative nonequilibrium (NEQ) fluctuation relation (FR) that fully extends the lateral-band transmission picture in terms of many-body correlated states. This FR holds in NEQ strongly correlated systems such as the integer or fractional quantum Hall regime as well as in quantum circuits formed by a normal or a Josephson junction (JJ) strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment, with a possible temperature bias. We then show that the PASN is universally super-Poissonian, giving an alternative to a theorem by L. Levitov et al. which states that an ac voltage increases the noise. We show that this theorem is restricted to a linear dc current and that it does not apply to a nonlinear SIS (superconductor-insulator -superconductor) junction. Then we characterize minimal excitations in nonlinear conductors as those which ensure a Poissonian PASN, and show that these can carry a nontrivial charge value in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We also propose methods for shot noise spectroscopy and for a robust determination of the fractional charge which complement those we have proposed previously and that have been implemented experimentally [M. Kapfer et al., Science 363, 846 (2019) and R. Bisognin et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 2231 (2019)].

TI The rationality and morality of connecting quantum computers
SO ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, we explore the complexities and implications of connecting quantum computers. This connection is in the literature seen as an obvious and fast way forward to arrive at a large quantum computer that can deliver the promises of quantum computing. We explore this option by understanding the conditions and contexts under which different scenarios of connecting these computers are most beneficial for quantum computer owners, be it for practical gains or moral considerations. "Introduction" and "Quantum Computing" Sections introduce quantum computing, laying out the broader framework of our study. Then "Connecting Quantum Computers" Section delineates three scenarios for connecting quantum computers: no connection, a connection that is "blind" for the uses of the linked systems, and a "governed connection" in which these uses are subjected to rules. These scenarios are evaluated against five criteria: the ability of computer owners to leverage quantum strengths (quantum advantage), the benefits of cooperative efforts for owners (collaboration gain), ensuring equitable benefits between owners (equality), maintaining clarity and openness about the connection to the owners (transparency), and preserving the independence and self-direction of the computer owners (autonomy). The evaluation does not single out a scenario as the clear winner. Rather, it reveals two significant moral trade-offs, showing that no one scenario is best for all situations. As a result, the choice of which trade-offs to accept and which scenario to choose depends greatly on the context. To highlight this, "Ethical Analysis of Scenarios" Section offers a detailed example for each of the three scenarios, explaining the reasons for choosing a particular option for each trade-off given the specific situation.

TI Testing of a four-channel Stokes polarimeter performance for intrusion
   detection in QKD systems
SO OPTO-ELECTRONICS REVIEW
AB The most mature quantum key distribution systems available on the market is the class of prepare-and-measure systems which are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, monitoring optical properties of such a system should be enhanced. This paper presents a measurement methodology, characterisation, and testing of a four-channel Stokes polarimeter implemented into the send-and-return quantum key distribution system with faint pulses. The developed polarimetric setup is a complete amplitude-division Stokes polarimeter, the main objective of which is to define changes in the polarization state of light pulses. The measurement method is based on intensity measurements of four selected polarization components. The four-channel Stokes polarimeter was characterised and its performance was compared with a commercial instrument. At this stage of the polarimeter development, different signal processing paths were proposed. The influence of fibre infringement was observed as a rapidly changing polarisation state and, as a result, intrusion threshold levels were determined for the analysed signals for the quantum key distribution fibre-optic link tested.

TI Dynamic and scalable secret sharing schemes based on matrix product
   compressed states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Currently, quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes based on entangled states have not yet fully utilized the potential of the probability amplitude of entangled states. However, the probability amplitude is a key characteristic of quantum information science and possesses significant application prospects in the fields of quantum computing and quantum communication. It is worth noting that entangled states can be effectively represented by matrix product states (MPSs). The representation of entangled states using MPS can precisely reveal the entanglement characteristics closely related to the probability amplitude. This study first focuses on the representation of the W state by using MPS, an approach that allows us to determine the key conditions for W state to achieve quantum advantage in QSS. Subsequently, this research demonstrates that by representing entangled states with MPS, a W state can be compressed into a single photon state and a simplified matrix form, presenting an innovative technical path.<br /> Moreover, one of the most attractive features of our proposed QSS scheme is its ability to compress multiple different quantum states (represented by photons) into a unified state represented by a single photon. This characteristic endows our scheme with scalability and flexibility, meaning that the group of participants can be easily expanded or reduced according to their specific needs. The addition of new participants is managed by Alice, who is responsible for the distribution of quantum state shares. On the other hand, when a participant leaves the group, their old quantum state share can be simply ignored in the process of recovering the secret's quantum state, thereby simplifying the management process. Through this strategy, we can not only make effective use of entangled resources but also meet the various requirements of the system, including but not limited to communication security, data transfer rates, and system scalability. This research provides new perspectives and possibilities for the field of quantum information science and may have a significant influence on the development of the field.

TI Quantum imaging with a photon counting camera
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Classical light sources emit a randomly-timed stream of individual photons, the spatial distribution of which can be detected with a camera to form an image. Quantum light sources, based on parametric down conversion, emit photons as correlated photon-pairs. The spatial correlations between the photons enables imaging systems where the preferential selection of photon-pairs allows for enhancements in the noise performance over what is possible using classical light sources. However, until now the technical challenge of measuring, and correlating both photons has led to system complexity. Here we show that a camera capable of resolving the number of individual photons in each pixel of the detector array can be used to record an image formed from these photon-pair events and hence achieve a greater contrast than possible using a classical light source. We achieve an enhancement in the ratio of two-photon events compared to one-photon events using spatially correlated SPDC light compared to uncorrelated illumination by a LED. These results indicate the potential advantages of using photon counting cameras in quantum imaging schemes and these advantages will further increase as the technology is developed. Operating in photon sparse regimes such systems have potential applications in low-light microscopy and covert imaging.

TI A wide dynamic range diamond quantum sensor as an electric vehicle
   battery monitor
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB To demonstrate the application capability of the diamond quantum sensor as an electric vehicle (EV) battery monitor, we (i) investigated the measurable current in a real car noise level and (ii) compared the linearity with conventional sensors. Consequently, (i) we could measure a 20 mA current pulse even under an external magnetic field of 80 mu T, which is larger than that of 50 mu T around the EV battery module in a real car during driving. The 20 mA pulse measurement corresponds to the EV battery state of charge estimation accuracy of 0.2% in the standard driving pattern, which is smaller than the present level of 10%. (ii) The linearity degradation seen in the Hall sensor near the upper limit of the measurement range was not seen in the diamond sensor. Although the Hall sensor and the shunt resistor showed linearity degradation in the current range of several tens of amperes or less, the degradation was smaller for the diamond sensor. The transverse magnetic field effect in the diamond sensor on the linearity was estimated to be less than 0.01% for a several-degree misalignment of the sensor surface to the magnetic field direction and under a 340 A current.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Diamond for quantum applications'.

TI Quantum spin mixing in Dirac materials
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Spintronic devices, where the spin of the electron becomes the main carrier of information, offer a promising avenue to develop quantum devices. The authors experimentally and theoretically investigate spin-polarization and spin-orbit mixing in a W(110) surface, and provide a mean to fine tune the quantum (de)coherence of materials by changing the spin polarization of a conduction electron in a spintronic device
   The spin of the electron is nowadays replacing the charge as basic carrier of information not only in spintronics applications, but also in the emerging field of quantum information. Topological quantum materials, where spin-momentum locking is believed to lead to particularly long spin lifetimes, are regarded as a promising platform for such applications. However, spin-orbit coupling, that is essential to all topological matter, at the same time gives rise to spin mixing and decoherence as a major obstacle for quantum computing. Here, we give experimental evidence that hot-spots of spin-mixing and spin-conserving contributions of the spin-orbit operator coexist in an archetypal topological Dirac metal, and that these hot spots can have a strongly anisotropic distribution of their respective wave vectors with respect to the spin quantization direction. Our results can be understood within a theory that takes into account the decomposition of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian into spin-conserving and spin-flip terms, contributing to a better understanding of quantum decoherence in topological materials, in general.

TI Multiedge-type low-density parity-check codes for continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) utilizes an ensemble of coherent states of light to distribute secret encryption keys between two parties. An essential ingredient of the QKD protocol is highly efficient information reconciliation. To achieve highly efficient reconciliation, error-correcting codes with a low channel coding rate are inevitable in the most common schemes of multilevel coding and multistage decoding (MLC-MSD) and multidimensional reconciliation. Multiedge-type (MET) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are well suited for highly efficient reconciliation at low rates. Here, we calculate the optimal channel coding rates in the MLC-MSD scheme for reverse reconciliation, introduce the concept of generalized extrinsic information transfer charts for MET-LDPC codes, which constitute a simple and fast asymptotic analysis tool, and present a set of MET-LDPC codes with asymptotic efficiency >97% for channel coding rates 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01. We believe that our codes will find wide application in implementations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on Gaussian modulation.

The natural candidate for the basis of tuning, coupling, and neromorphic co-processing elements for processors based on flux qubits is the adia-batic (reversible) superconducting logic cell. Using the simplest implementation of such a cell as an example, we have investigated the conditions under which it can optionally operate as an auxiliary qubit while maintaining its "classical" neural functionality. The performance and temperature regime estimates obtained confirm the possibility of practical use of a single-contact inductively shunted interferometer in a quantum mode in adjustment circuits for q-processors.

TI Statistically significant tests of multiparticle quantum correlations
   based on randomized measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider statistical methods based on finite samples of locally randomized measurements in order to certify different degrees of multiparticle entanglement in intermediate-scale quantum systems. We first introduce hierarchies of multiqubit criteria, satisfied by states which are separable with respect to partitions of different size, involving only second moments of the underlying probability distribution. Then, we analyze in detail the statistical error of the estimation in experiments and present several approaches for estimating the statistical significance based on large deviation bounds. The latter allows us to characterize the measurement resources required for the certification of multiparticle correlations, as well as to analyze given experimental data in detail.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution robust environmental
   disturbances
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) can guarantee that two parties share secure keys even in the presence of an eavesdropper. However, the polarization direction of the coherent state transmitted in CV-QKD is susceptible to environmental disturbances during channel transmission, making it difficult to share keys consistently over long periods of time. Therefore, a CV-QKD system that can resist environmental disturbance is very urgent. In this paper, we propose a new optical architecture for CV-QKD based on the Faraday -Michelson interference (FMI) structure, and finally form an all -single -mode (SM) fiber -based stable CVQKD system which employs transmitted local oscillator (TLO) scheme and discrete modulation coherent state (DMCS) protocol. Specifically, since the Faraday mirror rotates the polarization direction of light by 90o, the birefringence effect of light can be effectively dealt with, thus ensuring the same polarization state of light before and after reflection. The final simulation results show that the theoretical secret key rate of this scheme can reach 139 kbps at 70 km, which can further improve the stability and robustness of CV-QKD in the real environment, and provide technical support for the next -generation high -stability QKD system.

TI Polarization superposition of room-temperature polariton condensation
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB A methodology for forming a qubit state is essential for quantum applications of room temperature polaritons. While polarization degree of freedom is expected as a possible means for this purpose, the coupling of linearly polarized polariton condensed states has been still a challenging issue. In this study, we show a polarization superposition of a polariton condensed states in an all-inorganic perovskite microcavity at room temperature. We achieved the energy resonance of the two orthogonally polarized polariton modes with the same number of antinodes by exploiting the blue shift of the polariton condensed state. The polarization coupling between the condensed states results in a polarization switching in the polariton lasing emission. The orthorhombic crystal structure of the perovskite active layer and/or a slight off-axis orientation of the perovskite crystal axis from the normal direction of microcavity plane enables the interaction between the two orthogonally polarized states. These observations suggest the use of polariton polarization states as a promising room temperature quantum technology.
   Cavity polariton condensates are promising for room temperature quantum technologies, but realizing polaritonic qubit states remains challenging. Here, polarization superposition of polariton states and laser-induced polarization switching are observed in a perovskite microcavity at room temperature, suggesting a coupling between orthogonally polarized states that could enable polaritonic qubits.

TI Graph picture of near quantum networks and entanglement
SO QUANTUM
AB The indistinguishability of quantum particles is widely used as a resource for the generation of entanglement. Linear quantum networks (LQNs), in which identical particles linearly evolve to arrive at multimode detectors, exploit the indistinguishability to generate various multipartite entangled states by the proper control of transformation operators. However, it is challenging to devise a suitable LQN that carries a specific entangled state or compute the possible entangled state in a given LQN as the particle and mode number increase. This research presents a mapping process of arbitrary LQNs to graphs, which provides a powerful tool for analyzing and designing LQNs to generate multipartite entanglement. We also introduce the perfect matching diagram (PM diagram), which is a refined directed graph that includes all the essential information on the entanglement generation by an LQN. The PM diagram furnishes rigorous criteria for the entanglement of an LQN and solid guidelines for designing suitable LQNs for the genuine entanglement. Based on the structure of PM diagrams, we compose LQNs for fundamental N-partite genuinely entangled states.

TI Mitigation of systematic amplitude error in nonadiabatic holonomic
   operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic operations are based on nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phases, hence possessing the inherent geometric features for robustness against control errors. However, nonadiabatic holonomic operations are still sensitive to the systematic amplitude error induced by imperfect control of pulse timing or laser intensity. In this work, we present a scheme of nonadiabatic holonomic operations in order to mitigate the said systematic amplitude error. This is achieved by introducing a monitor qubit along with a conditional measurement on the monitor qubit that serves as an error correction device. We shall show how to filter out the undesired effect of the systematic amplitude error, thereby improving the performance of nonadiabatic holonomic operations.

In this work, a Faraday cage-based oblique angle etch method is applied to fabricate various functional photonic devices from 4H Silicon Carbide (SiC)-a material that has attracted attention in recent years, due to its potential in optomechanics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information. The processing conditions are detailed and the geometrical and optical characteristics of the fabricated devices are thoroughly addressed. Employing photoluminescence measurements high-quality factors are demonstrated for suspended microring resonators of up to 3500 in the visible range. Such devices will be applicable in the future to augment the properties of SiC in integrated on chip quantum photonics.

TI Multipartite entanglement of billions of motional atoms heralded by
   single photon
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum theory does not prevent entanglement from being created and observed in macroscopic physical systems, in reality however, the accessible scale of entanglement is still very limited due to decoherence effects. Recently, entanglement has been observed among atoms from thousands to millions levels in extremely low-temperature and well isolated systems. Here, we create multipartite entanglement of billions of motional atoms in a quantum memory at room temperature and certify the genuine entanglement via M-separability witness associated with photon statistics. The information contained in a single photon is found strongly correlated with the excitation shared by the motional atoms, which intrinsically address the large system and therefore stimulate the multipartite entanglement. Remarkably, our heralded and quantum memory built-in entanglement generation allows us to directly observe the dynamic evolution of entanglement depth and further to reveal the effects of decoherence. Our results verify the existence of genuine multipartite entanglement among billions of motional atoms at ambient conditions, significantly extending the boundary of the accessible scale of entanglement.

TI Dynamical Self-energy Mapping (DSEM) for Creation of Sparse Hamiltonians
   Suitable for Quantum Computing
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present a two-step procedure called the dynamical self-energy mapping (DSEM) that allows us to find a sparse Hamiltonian representation for molecular problems. In the first part of this procedure, the approximate self-energy of a molecular system is evaluated using a low-level method and subsequently a sparse Hamiltonian is found that best recovers this low-level dynamic self-energy. In the second step, such a sparse Hamiltonian is used by a high-level method that delivers a highly accurate dynamical part of the self-energy that is employed in later calculations. The tests conducted on small molecular problems show that the sparse Hamiltonian parameterizations lead to very good total energies. DSEM has the potential to be used as a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm for quantum computing where the sparse Hamiltonian containing only O(n(2)) terms on a Gaussian orbital basis, where n is the number of orbitals in the system, could reduce the depth of the quantum circuit by at least an order of magnitude when compared with simulations involving a full Hamiltonian.

TI Exceptional points and quantum dynamics in a non-Hermitian two-qubit
   system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study the exceptional-point (EP) structure and the associated quantum dynamics in a system consisting of a non-Hermitian qubit and a Hermitian qubit. We find that the system possesses two sets of EPs, which divide the system-parameter space into P T -symmetry unbroken, partially broken and fully broken regimes, each with distinct quantum-dynamics characteristics. Particularly, in the partially broken regime, while the P T -symmetry is generally broken in the whole four-dimensional Hilbert space, it is preserved in a two-dimensional subspace such that the quantum dynamics in the subspace are similar to those in the P T -symmetry unbroken regime. In addition, we reveal that the competition between the inter-qubit coupling and the intra-qubit driving gives rise to a complex pattern in the EP variation with system parameters.

TI Experimental adaptive Bayesian estimation for a linear function of
   distributed phases in photonic quantum networks
SO OPTICA
AB The bipartite and multipartite entanglement resources of quantum networks can enhance sensitivity for estimating distributed parameters beyond the classical limits. Recent experimental studies on distributed parameter estimation based on quantum networks have achieved high precision beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL) within certain portions of the parameter space. Towards a realistic distributed parameter estimation scenario, a next key issue is how to achieve the high precision parameter independently with limited measurement data. In this work, we present a photonic experiment employing an efficient Bayesian method to estimate a linear function of four spatially distributed unknown phases. For arbitrary true phase values, our experiment shows the capability of achieving high sensitivities beyond the SNL in a post- selected regime using a restricted amount of measurement rounds. Our work gives a start for the experimental study of distributed adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation. Additionally, this method holds promising utility for more intricate or universal tasks associated with sensing distributed parameters in quantum networks.

TI Suppressing Quantum Circuit Errors Due to System Variability
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a quantum circuit optimization technique that takes into account the variability in error rates that is inherent across present-day noisy quantum computing platforms. This method can be run after qubit routing or postcompilation and consists of computing isomorphic subgraphs to input circuits and scoring each using heuristic cost functions derived from system calibration data. Using an independent standard algorithmic test suite, we show that it is possible to recover on average nearly 40% of missing fidelity using better qubit selection via efficient to compute cost functions. We demonstrate additional performance gains by considering qubit placement over multiple quantum processors. The overhead from these tools is minimal with respect to other compilation steps, such as qubit routing, as the number of qubits increases. As such, our method can be used to find qubit mappings for problems at the scale of quantum advantage and beyond.

TI Quantum-Enabled Communication without a Phase Reference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A phase reference has been a standard requirement in continuous-variable quantum sensing and communication protocols. However, maintaining a phase reference is challenging due to environmental fluctuations, preventing quantum phenomena such as entanglement and coherence from being utilized in many scenarios. We show that quantum communication and entanglement-assisted communication without a phase reference arc possible, when a short-time memory effect is present. The degradation in the communication rate of classical or quantum information transmission decreases inversely with the correlation time. Exact solutions of the quantum capacity and entanglement-assisted classical and quantum capacity for pure dephasing channels are derived, where non-Gaussian multipartite-entangled states show strict advantages over usual Gaussian sources. For thermal-loss dephasing channels, lower bounds of the capacities are derived. The lower bounds also extend to scenarios with fading effects in the channel. In addition, for entanglement-assisted communication, the lower bounds can be achieved by a simple phase-encoding scheme on two-mode squeezed vacuum sources, when the noise is large.

TI Secretary bird optimization algorithm based on quantum computing and
   multiple strategies improvement for KELM diabetes classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The classification of chronic diseases has long been a prominent research focus in the field of public health, with widespread application of machine learning algorithms. Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases with a high prevalence worldwide and is considered a disease in its own right. Given the widespread nature of this chronic condition, numerous researchers are striving to develop robust machine learning algorithms for accurate classification. This study introduces a revolutionary approach for accurately classifying diabetes, aiming to provide new methodologies. An improved Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (QHSBOA) is proposed in combination with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for a diabetes classification prediction model. First, the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) is enhanced by integrating a particle swarm optimization search mechanism, dynamic boundary adjustments based on optimal individuals, and quantum computing-based t-distribution variations. The performance of QHSBOA is validated using the CEC2017 benchmark suite. Subsequently, QHSBOA is used to optimize the kernel penalty parameter \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:C$$\end{document} and bandwidth \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:c$$\end{document} of the KELM. Comparative experiments with other classification models are conducted on diabetes datasets. The experimental results indicate that the QHSBOA-KELM classification model outperforms other comparative models in four evaluation metrics: accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity. This approach offers an effective method for the early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes.

TI Real-time seedless post-processing for quantum random number generators
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum-proof randomness extraction is essential for handling quantum side information possessed by a quantum adversary, which is widely applied in various quantum cryptography tasks. In this study, the authors introduce a real-time two-source quantum randomness extractor against quantum side information. The authors' extractor is tailored for forward block sources, a novel category of min-entropy sources introduced in this work. These sources retain the flexibility to accommodate a broad range of quantum random number generators. The authors' online algorithms demonstrate the extraction of a constant fraction of min-entropy from two infinitely long independent forward block sources. Moreover, the authors' extractor is inherently block-wise parallelisable, presenting a practical and efficient solution for the timely extraction of high-quality randomness. Applying the authors' extractors to the raw data of one of the most commonly used quantum random number generators, a simulated extraction speed as high as 64 Gbps is achieved.

   1.5-μm 4I15/2-4I13/2 transitions of
   Er3+dopants at the C2-symmetry site in
   Y2O3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Erbium-doped solids are a promising platform for quantum technology due to the Er3+ 1.5-mu m optical transition in the telecom C band that can offer long coherence times. To characterize the intrinsic C2 site of Er3+ in Y2O3 for quantum information and photonic signal-processing applications, absorption and site-selective fluorescence spectroscopy were used to assign the Er3+ 4I15/2 H 4I13/2 transitions. The lowest-to-lowest transition occurs at 1535.608 nm and laser absorption determined an inhomogeneous linewidth of 780 MHz in a 0.005%doped crystal at 3.4 K. Time-resolved fluorescence established an upper limit for the excited-state lifetime of 8.5 ms. Angular-dependent Zeeman absorption was used to determine ground- and excited-state g tensors. The C2-site g tensor components for the ground state are gx = 1.60, gy = 4.71, and gz = 11.93 with a tipping angle of alpha = 2.06 degrees, whereas for the excited state the components are gx = 1.08, gy = 4.36, and gz = 10.07 with a tipping angle of alpha = -11.7 degrees. Optical decoherence can be suppressed by the application of a magnetic field parallel to (111) crystal axes where all C2 sites become nearly magnetically equivalent with large g values so that spin flips of neighboring Er3+ ions can be simultaneously suppressed. Using this magnetic field direction, two-pulse photon echoes gave a homogeneous linewidth of 5 kHz for an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T, narrowing and saturating at 2.5 kHz at 3.5 T. Decoherence over intermediate magnetic fields was described by spectral diffusion due to Er3+-Er3+ magnetic dipole interactions driven by the direct phonon process. With Er3+:Y2O3 absorption at a convenient telecom laser wavelength and the ability to fabricate waveguides, our study suggests that this is a promising material system for quantum information and spectral hole-burning signal-processing applications.

TI Entanglement-preserving measurement of the Bell parameter on a single
   entangled pair
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bell inequalities represent one of the cornerstones of quantum foundations, and a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. Although a lot of effort was put in exploring and generalizing them, because of the wave function collapse it was deemed impossible to estimate the entire Bell parameter from one entangled pair, since this would involve measuring incompatible observables on the same quantum state. Conversely, here it is reported the first implementation of a new generation of Bell inequality tests, able to extract a Bell parameter value from each entangled pair and, at the same time, preserve the pair entanglement instead of destroying it. This is obtained by exploiting sequences of weak measurements, allowing incompatible observable measurements on a quantum state without collapsing its wave function. On the fundamental side, by removing the need to choose between different measurement bases our approach stretches the concept of counterfactual definiteness, since it allows measuring the entangled pair in all the bases needed for the Bell inequality test, intrinsically eliminating the issues connected with the otherwise not-chosen bases. On the practical side, after our Bell parameter measurement the entanglement within the pair remains (basically) unaltered, hence exploitable for other quantum-technology-related or foundational purposes.

TI Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Entropy
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Geometric quantum mechanics, through its differential-geometric underpinning, provides additional tools of analysis and interpretation that bring quantum mechanics closer to classical mechanics: state spaces in both are continuous and equipped with symplectic geometry. This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of a geometric quantum state-the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's approach to information theory of continuous variables, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension, which is the rate of geometric quantum state compression, and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.

TI Quantum maximum power point tracking (QMPPT) for optimal solar energy
   extraction
SO SYSTEMS AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Solar energy is key to achieving a more environmentally responsible future. One way to exploit it is to use semiconductor technology through solar panels to generate clean, sustainable, and controllable energy. However, the use of such solutions must be optimised by methods such as maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to extract the maximum available solar energy. Although MPPT algorithms have been widely used and improved, the use of newer approaches, such as quantum computing, appears to hold the promise of achieving new performance levels, particularly for real-time MPPT implementation. The goal of this work is to develop and test a quantum algorithm for the photovoltaic (PV) energy MPPT problem using quantum particle swarm optimisation. The performance of the classic and quantum MPPT algorithms was evaluated under three main operating conditions: normal, high-temperature, and partial shading conditions. This represents a variety of environmental scenarios that can affect the efficiency of solar power generation. According to the study's results, the classical algorithm recorded 0.15% more power than the quantum algorithm in normal operating conditions, and the quantum algorithm generated 3.33% more power in higher temperature tests and 0.89% more power in the partial shading test. Moreover, the quantum algorithm recorded lower duty cycles for the three tests. While the classical algorithm may have a slight edge in power output under normal operation conditions, the quantum algorithm indicates superior performance in challenging conditions and consistently reveals more promising overall efficiency.

TI Impact of fragmentation in quantum signal channel of quantum key
   distribution enabled optical networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In QKD-enabled optical networks (QKD-enabled ONs), fragmentation is one of the serious issues which can be mitigated through appropriate management of network resources. Thus, efficient allocation of network resources during routing and resource assignment is important to minimise the impact of time slot fragmentation in the quantum signal channel (QSCh) of QKD-enabled ONs. The authors address the fragmentation problem in the QSCh and propose a new fragmentation-suppressed routing and resource assignment (FS-RRA) approach. To evaluate the performance and to analyse the effect of time slot fragmentation in QSCh of QKD-enabled ONs, the proposed FS-RRA approach is compared with two existing resource assignment approaches, namely, the first-fit (FF) and random-fit (RF) for two different networks. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces fragmentation by 2.97% and 6.69% for NSFNET and 1.77% and 5.91% for UBN24 in terms of external fragmentation compared to FF and RF, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach reduces blocking by 4.03% and 14.28% for NSFNET and 2.61% and 13.44% for UBN24 and improves resource utilisation up to 3.44% and 5.96% for NSFNET and 3.08% and 7.64% for UBN24 compared to FF and RF, respectively.
   The authors address the fragmentation problem in quantum signal channel during resource assignment in QKD-enabled optical networks and propose a fragmentation-suppressed routing and resource assignment approach. The proposed scheme outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of fragmentation metrics, blocking probability, and resource utilisation.image

AB A novel batch gradient descent algorithm for parameterized quantum circuits that significantly reduces the time complexity in terms of batch size for training quantum neural networks is proposed. Batch data constructed to quantum random access memory (qRAM) structure is mapped to one circuit that estimates average loss. As the number of circuits decreases, the range to which quantum amplitude estimation can be applied increases, speeding up with a quadratic scale in batch size.

TI Fighting Noise with Noise: A Stochastic Projective Quantum Eigensolver
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum era of quantum computation, available hardware is severely limited by both qubit count and noise levels, precluding the application of many current hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to nontrivial quantum chemistry problems. In this paper we propose applying some of the fundamental ideas of conventional Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms-stochastic sampling of both the wave function and the Hamiltonian-to quantum algorithms in order to significantly decrease quantum resource costs. In the context of an imaginary-time propagation based projective quantum eigensolver, we present a novel approach to estimating physical observables which can lead to an order of magnitude reduction in the required sampling of the quantum state to converge the ground state energy of a system relative to current state-of-the-art eigensolvers. The method can be equally applied to excited-state calculations and, combined with stochastic approximations of the system Hamiltonian, provides a promising near-term approach to Hamiltonian simulation for general chemistry on quantum devices.

AB One of the predominant causes of program distortion in the real quantum computing system may be attributed to the probability deviation caused by thermal relaxation. We introduce Barber (Balancing reAdout Results using Bit-invErted ciRcuits), a method designed to counteract the asymmetric thermal relaxation deviation and improve the reliability of near-term quantum programs. Barber collaborates with a bit-inverted quantum circuit, where the excited quantum state of qubits is assigned to the vertical bar 0 > and the unexcited state to the vertical bar 1 >. In doing so, bit-inverted quantum circuits can experience thermal relaxation in the opposite direction compared to standard quantum circuits. Barber can effectively suppress the thermal relaxation deviation in program's readout results by selectively merging distributions from the standard and bit-inverted circuits.

TI Quantum Sensing of Electron Transfer Pathways in Natural Photosynthesis
   Using Time-Resolved High-Field Electron Paramagnetic
   Resonance/Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Photosynthetic integral membrane reaction center (RC) proteins capture and convert sunlight into chemical energy via efficient charge separation achieved through a series of rapid, photoinitiated electron transfer steps. These fast electron transfers create an entangled spin qubit (radical) pair that contains detailed information about the weak magnetic interactions, structure, and dynamics of localized protein environments involved in charge separation events. Herein, we investigate how these entangled electron spin qubits interact with nuclear spins of the protein environment using the high spectral resolution of 130 GHz electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR). Spectroscopic interrogation enabled the observation and probing of protons located in the electron transfer pathway between the membrane-spanning electron pair P(+)Q(A)(-) (where P+ is the primary donor, a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls, and Q(A) is the primary quinone acceptor) in the bacterial RC. Spectroscopic analysis reveals hydrogen-bonding interactions involved in regulating the route that light-induced electrons travel through the RC protein during charge separation.

TI Modular low-cost 3D printed setup for experiments with NV centers in

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB With the advent of quantum technology, the need for affordable, flexible and robust laboratory experiments not only for students, but also at high school level is increasing. Here, for the first time, we report on a simple modular 3D printed low-cost (<250 euro) setup which fulfils these needs for quantum sensing experiments based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. Commercially available setups for optically detected magnetic resonance in microdiamonds used as quantum sensor for magnetic fields are not only beyond the reach of any high school (>10 000 euro), but also have shortcomings from a didactical point of view, as all the components of the setup are hidden within a 'black box', doomed to be successful 'plug and play'. In contrast, our open-source experimental kit consists of optical components that are placed inside 3D printed open-framed cubes, that can be arranged freely on a grid. This modular and flexible design can provide an inquiry-based learning experience both at undergraduate and high school level.

TI Formulating and Solving Routing Problems on Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The determination of vehicle routes fulfilling connectivity, time, and operational constraints is awell-studied combinatorial optimization problem. The NP-hard complexity of vehicle routing problems has fostered the adoption of tailored exact approaches, matheuristics, and metaheuristics on classical computing devices. The ongoing evolution of quantum computing hardware and the recent advances of quantum algorithms (i.e., VQE, QAOA, and ADMM) for mathematical programming make decision-making for routing problems an avenue of research worthwhile to be explored on quantum devices. In this article, we propose several mathematical formulations for inventory routing cast as vehicle routing with time windows and comment on their strengths and weaknesses. The optimization models are compared from a quantum computing perspective, specifically with metrics to evaluate the difficulty in solving the underlying quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Finally, the solutions obtained on simulated quantum devices demonstrate the relative benefits of different algorithms and their robustness when put into practice.

TI Counting stabilizer codes for arbitrary dimension
SO QUANTUM
AB In this work, we compute the number of [[n, k]]d stabilizer codes made up of d -dimensional qudits, for arbitrary positive integers d. In a seminal work by Gross (Ref. [23]) the number of [[n, k]]d stabilizer codes was computed for the case when d is a prime (or the power of a prime, i.e., d = pm, but when the qudits are Galois-qudits). The proof in Ref. [23] is inappli-cable to the non-prime case. For our proof, we introduce a group structure to [[n, k]]d codes, and use this in conjunction with the Chinese remainder theorem to count the number of [[n, k]]d codes. Our work over-laps with Ref. [23] when d is a prime and in this case our results match exactly, but the results differ for the more generic case. Despite that, the overall order of mag-nitude of the number of stabilizer codes scales agnostic of whether the dimension is prime or non-prime. This is surprising since the method employed to count the number of stabilizer states (or more gener-ally stabilizer codes) depends on whether d is prime or not. The cardinality of stabilizer states, which was so far known only for the prime-dimensional case (and the Galois qudit prime-power dimensional case) plays an important role as a quanti-fier in many topics in quantum computing. Salient among these are the resource the-ory of magic, design theory, de Finetti the-orem for stabilizer states, the study and optimisation of the classical simulability of Clifford circuits, the study of quantum contextuality of small-dimensional systems and the study of Wigner-functions. Our work makes available this quantifier for the generic case, and thus is an important step needed to place results for quantum com-puting with non-prime dimensional quan-tum systems on the same pedestal as prime-dimensional systems.

TI Heat currents in qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. the flow of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of coherences in the steady state.

AB We present a new post-processing method for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) that raises cubically the secret key rate in the number of double matching detection events. In Shannon's communication model, information is prepared at Alice's side, and it is then intended to pass it over a noisy channel. In our approach, secret bits do not rely in Alice's transmitted quantum bits but in Bob's basis measurement choices. Therefore, measured bits are publicly revealed, while bases selections remain secret. Our method implements sifting, reconciliation, and amplification in a unique process, and it just requires a round iteration; no redundancy bits are sent, and there is no limit in the correctable error percentage. Moreover, this method can be implemented as a post-processing software into QKD technologies already in use.

TI Geometrical Formalism for Dynamically Corrected Gates in Multiqubit
   Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ability to perform gates in multiqubit systems that are robust to noise is of crucial importance for the advancement of quantum information technologies. However, finding control pulses that cancel noise while performing a gate is made difficult by the intractability of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, especially in multiqubit systems. Here, we show that this issue can be sidestepped by using a formalism in which the cumulative error during a gate is represented geometrically as a curve in a multidimensional Euclidean space. Cancelation of noise errors to leading order corresponds to closure of the curve, a condition that can be satisfied without solving the Schrodinger equation. We develop and uncover general properties of this geometric formalism, and derive a recursion relation that maps control fields to curvatures for Hamiltonians of arbitrary dimension. We demonstrate the utility of the formalism by employing it to design pulses that simultaneously correct against both noise errors and crosstalk for two qubits coupled by an Ising interaction. We give examples both of a single-qubit rotation and a two-qubit maximally entangling gate. The results obtained in this example are relevant to both superconducting transmon qubits and semiconductor quantum-dot spin qubits. We propose this geometric formalism as a general technique for pulse-induced error suppression in quantum computing gate operations.

TI Hybrid quantum neural networks show strongly reduced need for free
   parameters in entity matching
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Modern technology and scientific experiments increasingly generate larger and larger amounts of data. This data is sometimes redundant, incomplete or inaccurate and needs to be cleaned and merged with other data before becoming useful for scientific exploration. Hence, entity matching, i.e. the process of linking data about a given entity gathered from multiple data sets, is a major problem in artificial intelligence with applications in science and industry. Typical methods for entity matching either use specialized algorithms or supervised machine learning. Although the problem has been well studied on classical computers, it is unclear how quantum approaches would tackle these challenges. In this paper, we evaluate quantum machine learning algorithms for entity matching on a hand-crafted data set and compare them to similar classical algorithms. We do this by implementing a neural network with a classical embedding layer and extending it with quantum layers. Our experimental results suggest that our hybrid quantum neural network reaches similar performance as classical approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we also show that a model trained on a quantum simulator is portable and thus transferable to a real quantum computer. From a practical perspective and as long as quantum hardware is a scarce resource, experiments, e.g. addressing performance, can profit from producing good initial configurations for quantum neural networks via a simulator, thus only leaving the fine-tuning to quantum computations.

TI Certification of multi-qubit quantum systems with temporal inequalities
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Demonstrating contextual correlations in quantum theory through the violation of a non-contextuality inequality necessarily needs some 'contexts' and thus assumes some compatibility relations between the measurements. As a result, any self-testing protocol based on the maximal violation of such inequality is not free from such assumptions. In this work, we propose temporal inequalities derived from non-contextuality inequalities for multi-qubit systems without assuming any compatibility relations among the measurements. We demonstrate that the new inequalities can be maximally violated via a sequential measurement scenario. Moreover, using the maximal violation of these temporal inequalities, we are able to certify the multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and the measurements.

TI Three individually addressable spin qubits in a single molecule
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB An asymmetric bis-phenol-beta-diketone (H4L) has been designed as a ligand programmed to promote the assembly of a molecular arrangement composed of three magnetically exchanged [NiCu] pairs, each exhibiting an S = 1/2 spin. The latter are shown by EPR and magnetometry to be good qubit realizations and non-equivalent within the molecule in the solid state, as required for conditional quantum gates.

TI Simulation of higher-order topological phases and related topological
   phase transitions in a superconducting qubit
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Higher-order topological phases give rise to new bulk and boundary physics, as well as new classes of topological phase transitions. While the realization of higher-order topological phases has been confirmed in many platforms by detecting the existence of gapless boundary modes, a direct determination of the higher-order topology and related topological phase transitions through the bulk in experiments has still been lacking. To bridge the gap, in this work we carry out the simulation of a twodimensional second-order topological phase in a superconducting qubit. Owing to the great flexibility and controllability of the quantum simulator, we observe the realization of higher-order topology directly through the measurement of the pseudo-spin texture in momentum space of the bulk for the first time, in sharp contrast to previous experiments based on the detection of gapless boundary modes in real space. Also through the measurement of the evolution of pseudo-spin texture with parameters, we further observe novel topological phase transitions from the second-order topological phase to the trivial phase, as well as to the first-order topological phase with nonzero Chern number. Our work sheds new light on the study of higher-order topological phases and topological phase transitions.

TI Cryptographic algorithm for multi-path distribution of entangled states
   of orbital angular momentum based on Fibonacci values
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Drawing inspiration from the Fibonacci sequence and its complementary Lucas sequence, this paper introduces an innovative encryption and decryption algorithm tailored for multi-path quantum key distribution. The algorithm capitalizes on the high-quality orbital angular momentum entangled states, harnessing the mathematical elegance of Fibonacci numbers to construct block diagonal matrices. These matrices serve as the foundation for the simultaneous execution of key distribution across multiple communication paths in a structured block distribution format. The encryption process is facilitated through a combination of linear mappings, employing specific transition matrices to manage the cryptographic flow. The security underpinning of this method is firmly rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, which ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the quantum communication channel. This approach paves the way for a novel encryption paradigm, fortifying the security framework of quantum communication networks.

TI Modular nanomagnet design for spin qubits confined in a linear chain
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB On-chip micromagnets enable electrically controlled quantum gates on electron spin qubits. Extending the concept to a large number of qubits is challenging in terms of providing large enough driving gradients and individual addressability. Here we present a design aimed at driving spin qubits arranged in a linear chain and strongly confined in directions lateral to the chain. Nanomagnets are placed laterally to one side of the qubit chain, one nanomagnet per two qubits. The individual magnets are "U"-shaped, such that the magnetic shape anisotropy orients the magnetization alternately towards and against the qubit chain even if an external magnetic field is applied along the qubit chain. The longitudinal and transversal stray field components serve as addressability and driving fields. Using micromagnetic simulations we calculate driving and dephasing rates and the corresponding qubit quality factor. The concept is validated with spin-polarized scanning electron microscopy of Fe nanomagnets fabricated on silicon substrates, finding excellent agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Several features required for a scalable spin qubit design are met in our approach: strong driving and weak dephasing gradients, reduced crosstalk and operation at low external magnetic field.

TI PhotoniQLAB: a framework for simulating photonic quantum information
   processing experiments
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulators for photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) experiments are essentially different with currently available quantum-circuit simulators. In PQIP experiments, photons are usually encoded by multiple degrees of freedom, some of which are multi-level or even infinite-level. Moreover, the evolution of indistinguishable photons cannot be described elegantly by the model used in quantum-circuit simulators. A simulator focusing on PQIP experiments is urgently needed, as it plays an important role in PQIP experiments designing and verification. We developed PhotoniQLAB, an object-oriented framework designed for simulating PQIP experiments, which provides a virtual-lab user experience. The core simulation unit is a computer algebraic system based on the second quantization method. PhotoniQLAB only requires users to enter the structure information of a target PQIP experiment to conduct a simulation, as it can understand the topological structure by itself. The mathematical foundation and technical details of PhotoniQLAB are discussed in the paper. The performance of PhotoniQLAB, which is analyzed and used to simulate several experimental schemes in this paper, has been shown to be efficient enough for near-term PQIP experiments. PhotoniQLAB shows its flexibility and universality, through simulating more than 60 existing PQIP experiments in published papers. We believe that PhotoniQLAB will become a fundamental PQIP software infrastructure facilitating the analyses and designs of PQIP experiments.

TI Qurts: Automatic Quantum Uncomputation by Affine Types with Lifetime
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Uncomputation is a feature in quantum programming that allows the programmer to discard a value without losing quantum information, and that allows the compiler to reuse resources. Whereas quantum information has to be treated linearly by the type system, automatic uncomputation enables the programmer to treat it affinely to some extent. Automatic uncomputation requires a substructural type system between linear and affine, a subtlety that has only been captured by existing languages in an ad hoc way. We extend the Rust type system to the quantum setting to give a uniform framework for automatic uncomputation called Qurts (pronounced quartz). Specifically, we parameterise types by lifetimes, permitting them to be affine during their lifetime, while being restricted to linear use outside their lifetime. We also provide two operational semantics: one based on classical simulation, and one that does not depend on any specific uncomputation strategy.

TI Self-testing of a single quantum device under computational assumptions
SO QUANTUM
AB Self-testing is a method to characterise an arbitrary quantum system based only on its classical input-output correlations, and plays an important role in device-independent quantum information processing as well as quantum complexity theory. Prior works on self-testing require the assumption that the system's state is shared among multiple parties that only perform local measurements and cannot communicate. Here, we replace the setting of multiple non-communicating parties, which is difficult to enforce in practice, by a single computationally bounded party. Specifically, we construct a protocol that allows a classical verifier to robustly certify that a single computationally bounded quantum device must have prepared a Bell pair and performed single-qubit measurements on it, up to a change of basis applied to both the device's state and measurements. This means that under computational assumptions, the verifier is able to certify the presence of entanglement, a property usually closely associated with two separated subsystems, inside a single quantum device. To achieve this, we build on techniques first introduced by Brakerski et al. (2018) and Mahadev (2018) which allow a classical verifier to constrain the actions of a quantum device assuming the device does not break post-quantum cryptography.

AB Quantum computing is tipped to lead the future of global technological progress. However, the obstacles related to quantum software development are an actual challenge to overcome. In this scenario, this work presents an implementation of the quantum search algorithm in Atos Quantum Assembly Language (AQASM) using the quantum software stack my Quantum Learning Machine (myQLM) and the programming development platform Quantum Learning Machine (QLM). We present the creation of a virtual quantum processor whose configurable architecture allows the analysis of induced quantum noise effects on the quantum algorithms. The codes are available throughout the manuscript so that readers can replicate them and apply the methods discussed in this article to solve their own quantum computing projects. The presented results are consistent with theoretical predictions and demonstrate that AQASM and QLM are powerful tools for building, implementing, and simulating quantum hardware.

TI Demonstration of the trapped-ion quantum CCD computer architecture
SO NATURE
AB The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal(1,2) lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments(3-5) by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture-a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport-into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement(6), negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume(7) of 2(6) = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers.

AB Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising family of quantum error-correcting codes for fault tolerant quantum computing with low overhead. Decoding quantum LDPC codes on quantum erasure channels has received more attention recently due to advances in erasure conversion for various types of qubits including neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. Belief propagation with guided decimation (BPGD) decoding of quantum LDPC codes has demonstrated good performance in bit-flip and depolarizing noise. In this work, we apply BPGD decoding to quantum erasure channels. Using a natural modification, we show that BPGD offers competitive performance on quantum erasure channels for multiple families of quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, we show that the performance of BPGD decoding on erasure channels can sometimes be improved significantly by either adding damping or adjusting the initial channel log-likelihood ratio for bits that are not erased. More generally, our results demonstrate BPGD is an effective general-purpose solution for erasure decoding across the quantum LDPC landscape.

TI Experimental study of secure quantum key distribution with source and
   detection imperfections
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), guaranteed by the principle of quantum physics, is a promising solution for future secure information and communication technology. However, device imperfections compromise the security of real-life QKD systems, restricting the wide deployment of QKD. This study reports a decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) QKD experiment that considers both source and detection imperfections. In particular, we achieve a rigorous finite-key security bound over fiber links of up to 75 km by applying a sys-tematic performance analysis. Furthermore, our study considers more device imperfections than most previous experiments, and the proposed theory can be extended to other discrete-variable QKD systems. These features constitute a crucial step toward securing QKD with imperfect practical devices.

TI Circuit depth scaling for quantum approximate optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms are the centerpiece of modern quantum programming. These algorithms involve training parametrized quantum circuits using a classical coprocessor, an approach adapted partly from classical machine learning. An important subclass of these algorithms, designed for combinatorial optimization on current quantum hardware, is the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Despite efforts to realize deeper circuits, experimental state-of-the-art implementations are limited to a fixed depth. However, it is known that problem density-a problem constraint to a variable ratio-induces underparametrization in fixed depth QAOA. Density-dependent performance has been reported in the literature, yet the circuit depth required to achieve fixed performance (henceforth called critical depth) remained unknown. Here, we propose a predictive model, based on a logistic saturation conjecture for critical depth scaling with respect to density. Focusing on random instances of MAX-2-SAT, we test our predictive model against simulated data with up to 15 qubits. We report the average critical depth, required to attain a success probability of 0.7, saturates at a value of 10 for densities beyond 4. We observe the predictive model to describe the simulated data within a 3 sigma confidence interval. Furthermore, based on the model, a linear trend for the critical depth with respect to problem size is recovered for the range of 5-15 qubits.

TI Platonic dynamical decoupling sequences for interacting spin systems
SO QUANTUM
AB In the NISQ era, where quantum information processing is hindered by the decoherence and dissipation of elementary quantum systems, developing new protocols to extend the lifetime of quantum states is of considerable practical and theoretical importance. A well-known technique, known as dynamical decoupling, uses a carefully designed sequence of pulses applied to a quantum system, such as a spin-j (which represents a qudit with d = 2j + 1 levels), to suppress the coupling Hamiltonian between the system and its environment, thereby mitigating dissipation. While dynamical decoupling of qubit systems has been widely studied, the decoupling of qudit systems has been far less explored and often involves complex sequences and operations. In this work, we design efficient decoupling sequences composed solely of global SU(2) rotations and based on tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral point groups, which we call Platonic sequences. We extend the Majorana representation for Hamiltonians to develop a simple framework that establishes the decoupling properties of each Platonic sequence and show its effectiveness on many examples. These sequences are universal in their ability to cancel any type of interaction with the environment for single spin-j with spin quantum number j <= 5/2, and they are capable of decoupling up to 5-body interactions in an ensemble of interacting spin-1/2 with only global pulses, provided that the interaction Hamiltonian has no isotropic component, with the exception of the global identity. We also discuss their inherent robustness to finite pulse duration and a wide range of pulse errors, as well as their potential application as building blocks for dynamically corrected gates.

TI Coherence-limited digital control of a superconducting qubit using a
   Josephson pulse generator at 3 K
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence three-dimensional transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable two-dimensional transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime T-1, coherence time T-2*, and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit vs the TSCE setup. We find agreement within the daily fluctuations for T-1 and T-2*, and agreement within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of 0.46% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.

TI Neural network enhanced measurement efficiency for molecular
   groundstates
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB It is believed that one of the first useful applications for a quantum computer will be the preparation of groundstates of molecular Hamiltonians. A crucial task involving state preparation and readout is obtaining physical observables of such states, which are typically estimated using projective measurements on the qubits. At present, measurement data is costly and time-consuming to obtain on any quantum computing architecture, which has significant consequences for the statistical errors of estimators. In this paper, we adapt common neural network models (restricted Boltzmann machines and recurrent neural networks) to learn complex groundstate wavefunctions for several prototypical molecular qubit Hamiltonians from typical measurement data. By relating the accuracy e of the reconstructed groundstate energy to the number of measurements, we find that using a neural network model provides a robust improvement over using single-copy measurement outcomes alone to reconstruct observables. This enhancement yields an asymptotic scaling near e (-1) for the model-based approaches, as opposed to e (-2) in the case of classical shadow tomography.

TI Inductive Construction of Variational Quantum Circuit for Constrained
   Combinatorial Optimization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using variational quantum circuits. Quantum computers are considered to have the potential to solve large combinatorial optimization problems faster than classical computers. Variational quantum algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have been studied extensively because they are expected to work on noisy intermediate scale devices. Unfortunately, many optimization problems have constraints, which induces infeasible solutions during VQE process. Recently, several methods for efficiently solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems have been proposed by designing a quantum circuit so as to output only the states that satisfy the constraints. However, the types of available constraints are still limited. Therefore, we have started to develop variational quantum circuits that can handle a wider range of constraints. The proposed method utilizes a forwarding operation that maps from feasible states for subproblems to those for larger subproblems. As long as appropriate forwarding operations can be defined, iteration of this process can inductively construct variational circuits outputting feasible states even in the case of multiple and complex constraints. In this paper, the proposed method was applied to facility location problem. As a result, feasible solutions were obtained with 100%, and the probability of obtaining optimal solutions was over 22 times higher than that of conventional VQEs. Nevertheless, the cost of the obtained circuit was comparable to that of conventional circuits.

TI Unsupervised interpretable learning of phases from many-qubit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Experimental progress in qubit manufacturing calls for the development of new theoretical tools to analyze quantum data. We show how an unsupervised machine-learning technique can be used to understand short -range entangled many-qubit systems using data of local measurements. The method successfully constructs the phase diagram of a cluster-state model and detects the respective order parameters of its phases, including string order parameters. For the toric code subject to external magnetic fields, the machine identifies the explicit forms of its two stabilizers. Prior information of the underlying Hamiltonian or the quantum states is not needed; instead, the machine outputs their characteristic observables. Our work opens the door for a first-principles application of hybrid algorithms that aim at strong interpretability without supervision.

TI Indirect measurement for optimal quantum communication enhanced by
   binary non-standard coherent states
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB It is well known that the Helstrom bound can be improved by generalizing the form of a coherent state. Thus, designing a quantum measurement achieving the improved Helstrom bound is important for novel quantum communication. In this paper, we analytically show that the improved Helstrom bound can be achieved by a projective measurement composed of orthogonal non-standard Schrodinger cat states. Moreover, we numerically show that the improved Helstrom bound can be nearly achieved by an indirect measurement based on the Jaynes-Cummings model. As the Jaynes-Cummings model describes an interaction between a light and a two-level atom, we emphasize that the indirect measurement considered in this paper has potential to be experimentally implemented.

TI A Semi-Quantum Secret-Sharing Protocol with a High Channel Capacity
SO ENTROPY
AB Semi-quantum cryptography communication stipulates that the quantum user has complete quantum capabilities, and the classical user has limited quantum capabilities, only being able to perform the following operations: (1) measuring and preparing qubits with a Z basis and (2) returning qubits without any processing. Secret sharing requires participants to work together to obtain complete secret information, which ensures the security of the secret information. In the semi-quantum secret sharing (SQSS) protocol, the quantum user Alice divides the secret information into two parts and gives them to two classical participants. Only when they cooperate can they obtain Alice's original secret information. The quantum states with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) are defined as hyper-entangled states. Based on the hyper-entangled single-photon states, an efficient SQSS protocol is proposed. The security analysis proves that the protocol can effectively resist well-known attacks. Compared with the existing protocols, this protocol uses hyper-entangled states to expand the channel capacity. The transmission efficiency is 100% higher than that of single-degree-of-freedom (DoF) single-photon states, providing an innovative scheme for the design of the SQSS protocol in quantum communication networks. This research also provides a theoretical basis for the practical application of semi-quantum cryptography communication.

   quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In this paper, we present a method for security analysis of Trojan-horse attacks (THAs) launched on a practical fiber-based quantum key distribution system across a wide spectral range. To achieve this, we use optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for spectral reflectance analysis in the near-infrared range lambda = 1100-1800 nm with centimeter-level resolution and a noise floor down to -80 dB. A total theoretical security analysis of the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind to be obtained across a wide spectral range.

TI Extreme Points and Factorizability for New Classes of Unital Quantum
   Channels
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We introduce and study two new classes of unital quantum channels. The first class describes a 2-parameter family of channels given by completely positive (CP) maps M-3(C) bar right arrow M-3(C) which are both unital and trace-preserving. Almost every member of this family is factorizable and extreme in the set of CP maps which are both unital and trace-preserving, but is not extreme in either the set of unital CP maps or the set of trace-preserving CP maps. We also study a large class of maps which generalize the Werner-Holevo channel for d = 3 in the sense that they are defined in terms of partial isometries of rank d - 1. Moreover, we extend this to maps whose Kraus operators have the form t vertical bar e(j)  e(j) vertical bar circle plus V with V is an element of Md-1(C) unitary and t is an element of (- 1, 1). We show that almost every map in this class is extreme in both the set of unital CP maps and the set of trace-preserving CP maps. We analyze in detail a particularly interesting family which is extreme unless t = -1/d-1. For d = 3, this includes a pair of channels which have a dual factorization in the sense that they can be obtained by taking the partial trace over different subspaces after using the same unitary conjugation in M-3(C) circle times M-3(C).

TI Quantum CDMA Communication Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Barcoding photons, atoms, and any quantum states can provide a host of functionalities that could benefit future quantum communication systems and networks beyond today's imagination. As a significant application of barcoding photons, we introduce code division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems for various applications. In this context, we introduce and discuss the fundamental principles of a novel quantum CDMA (QCDMA) technique based on spectrally encoding and decoding of continuous-mode quantum light pulses. In particular, we present the mathematical models of various QCDMA modules that are fundamental in describing an ideal and typical QCDMA system, such as quantum signal sources, quantum spectral encoding phase operators, MxM quantum broadcasting star-coupler, quantum spectral phase decoding operators, and the quantum receivers. Following the above discussions, we then elaborate on a QCDMA system with M users. In describing a QCDMA system, this paper considers a unified approach where the input continuous-mode quantum light pulses can take on any form of pure states such as quantum coherent (Glauber) states and quantum number (Fock) states. The mathematical presentation is independent of the form of the input pure quantum states. We show that the spectrally encoded quantum states of the light at the quantum star-coupler output are not, in general, factorized states, except for input Glauber states. For input number states, one can observe features like entanglement and quantum interference. Moreover and interestingly, as a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the quantum signals sent by photon number states obtain complete phase uncertainty at the time of measurement. Therefore, at the receiver output, the multiaccess inter-signal interference vanishes. Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the received signal intensity at the photodetector's output, right at the time of measurement, changes from coherent detection scheme for input Glauber states to incoherent detection scheme for input number states. We also would like to highlight that the mathematical models and tools developed in this paper, in the context of QCDMA, become very useful for developing and analyzing other quantum multiple-access techniques based on wavelength, space and time domain. Furthermore, our mathematical model is valuable in signal design and data modulations of point-to-point quantum communications, quantum pulse shaping, and quantum radar signals and systems where the inputs are continuous mode quantum signals. QCDMA may open up novel possibilities for various quantum technologies such as data privacy, distributed quantum computation, quantum internet, and anti-jamming quantum communication systems.

TI Mitigation of Routing Congestion on Data Networks: A Quantum Game Theory
   Approach
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Because of the sustained growth of information and mobile users transmitting a great amount of data packets, modern network performances are being seriously affected by congestion problems. In fact, congestion management is a challenging task that can be roughly summarized as a trade off between transmission latency and cost. In order to contribute to solve the congestion problem on communication networks, a novel framework based on a quantum game model is proposed, where network packets compete selfishly for their fastest route. Simulations show that final network routing and traveling times achieved with the quantum version outperform those obtained with a classical game model with the same options for packet transmission for both. Pareto optimality and Nash equilibrium are studied as well as the influence of simulated and real noise in the quantum protocol. This leads to the opportunity of developing full-stack protocols that may be capable of taking advantage of the quantum properties for optimizing communication systems. Due to its generality, this game approach can be applied both in classical complex networks and in future quantum networks in order to maximize the performance of the quantum internet.

TI Controlling qubit-oscillator systems using linear parameter sweeps
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the dynamics of a qubit-oscillator system under the influence of a linear sweep of system parameters. We consider two main cases. In the first case, we consider sweeping the parameters between the regime of a weakly correlated ground state and the regime of a strongly correlated ground state, a situation that can be viewed as a finite-duration quench between two phases of matter: the normal phase and the superradiant phase. Excitations are created as a result of this quench. We investigate the dependence of the excitation probabilities on the various parameters. We find a qualitative asymmetry in the dynamics between the cases of a normal-to-superradiant and superradiant-to-normal quench. The second case of parameter sweeps that we investigate is the problem of a Landau-Zener sweep in the qubit bias term for a qubit coupled to a harmonic oscillator. We analyze a theoretical formula based on the assumption that the dynamics can be decomposed into a sequence of independent Landau-Zener transitions. In addition to establishing the conditions of validity for the theoretical formula, we find that under suitable conditions, deterministic and robust multi-photon state preparation is possible in this system.

TI Stochastic quantum power flow for risk assessment in power systems
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB This paper introduces the first quantum computing framework for Stochastic Quantum Power Flow (SQPF) analysis in power systems. The proposed method leverages quantum states to encode power flow distributions, enabling the use of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently assess the probability of line overloads. Our approach significantly reduces the required sample size compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it particularly suited for risk assessments in scenarios involving high uncertainty, such as renewable energy integration. We validate the method on two test systems, demonstrating the computational advantage of quantum algorithms in reducing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy. This work represents a foundational step toward scalable quantum power flow analysis, with potential applications in future power system operations and planning. The results show promising computational speedups, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in addressing the increasing uncertainty in modern power grids.

TI Error-control information reconciliation scheme for continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution using fixed-bit polar codes
SO IEICE COMMUNICATIONS EXPRESS
AB A challenging issue in continuous -variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is the improvement in error correction efficiency because random number bits are encoded in a quadrature of faint optical pulses. Herein, we propose an error -control information reconciliation method for CV-QKD based on our recently proposed fixed -bit polar code. In the present scheme, unreliable bits are embedded in the prepared "fixed bits," enabling the detection and reproduction of errors in these bits without error correction, effectively improving the error -correction efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed scheme is 10% higher than that of polar code -based reconciliation without fixed bits.

TI Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement via machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, supervised and semisupervised machine learning methods such as neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), and semisupervised support vector machines (S4VMs) have been widely used in quantum entanglement and quantum steering verification problems. However, few studies have focused on detecting genuine multipartite entanglement based on machine learning. Here, we investigate supervised and semisupervised machine learning for detecting genuine multipartite entanglement of three-qubit states. We randomly generate three-qubit density matrices and train an SVM for the detection of genuine multipartite entangled states. Moreover, we improve the S4VM training method, which optimizes the grouping of prediction samples and then performs iterative predictions. Through numerical simulation, it is confirmed that this method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.

AB With recent advances on the capabilities of quantum computers and the seminal work by Shor on the prime factorization of integers with quantum algorithms, the threat of quantum computers is looming over public-key based cryptographic systems. Two distinct areas of research - post-quantum and quantum cryptography - provide the technical means to secure cryptographic systems against potentially powerful enough quantum computers. As both technologies are now becoming readily available, integration in a wide range of applications to understand their characteristics and trade-offs and the associated evaluation is of importance.
   In this work, we investigate the integration of quantum-resistant cryptography into secure messaging applications. Specifically, we target Delta Chat which is an end-to-end secure and open source messaging application. We integrate both post-quantum secure dig-ital signature schemes and public-key encryption schemes to keep the end-to-end secure messaging properties of the system, whereas the server-to-server communication is additionally secured via se-cret keys provided by a metropolitan quantum key distribution network. Since Delta Chat transports messages via the users' email accounts, we thus also obtain a quantum-resistant email infrastruc-ture. As such we also analyze mechanisms commonly employed to secure email communication and the required implementation steps to ensure quantum-system for users of S/MIME and OpenPGP.

TI Amplitude-controllable microwave pulse generator using
   single-flux-quantum pulse pairs for qubit control
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB To achieve large-scale quantum processors, cryogenic quantum-bit (qubit) interface circuits that can control qubits inside a dilution refrigerator are indispensable. Superconducting single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits are a promising building block for qubit interface circuits because SFQ circuits can operate with high clock frequencies and low power dissipation. In the present study, we developed an SFQ-based qubit interface circuit that we refer to as a pulse-pair microwave pulse generator (PP-MPG). The PP-MPG can generate microwave pulses for qubit control, with the microwave amplitude controlled based on the delay between paired SFQ pulses. By finely adjusting the delay with delay controlling circuits, the microwave amplitude can be controlled over a wide range. We fabricated a PP-MPG chip and tested it at 4.2 K, showing that the microwave amplitude can be controlled over a range of approximately 30 dB. Our results show that the PP-MPG has the potential for use in future large-scale quantum processors.

TI Flux-pulse-assisted readout of a fluxonium qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Much attention has focused on the transmon architecture for large-scale superconducting quantum devices; however, the fluxonium qubit has emerged as a possible successor. With a shunting inductor in parallel to a Josephson junction, the fluxonium offers larger anharmonicity and stronger protection against dielectric loss, leading to higher coherence times as compared to conventional transmon qubits. The interplay between the inductive and Josephson energy potentials of the fluxonium qubit leads to a rich dispersive-shift landscape when tuning the external flux. Here, we propose to exploit the features in the dispersive shift to improve qubit readout. Specifically, we report on theoretical simulations showing improved readout times and error rates by performing the readout at a flux-bias point with large dispersive shift. We expand the scheme to include different error channels and show that with an integration time of 155 ns, flux-pulse-assisted readout offers about a 5-times improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, we show that the performance improvement persists in the presence of finite measurement efficiency combined with quasistatic flux noise and also when considering the increased Purcell rate at the flux-pulseassisted readout point. We suggest a set of reasonable energy parameters for the fluxonium architecture that will allow for the implementation of our proposed flux-pulse-assisted readout scheme.

TI Temporal Wormholes From Temporal Quantum Correlations
SO ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recent developments in quantum theory suggest a unified treatment of space and time, where spatial and temporal correlations can be regarded as equivalent. Specifically, spatial correlations between two systems at one time have been shown to correspond to temporal correlations of a single system at two times, via partial transposition. This formal equivalence implies a revised framework in which temporal correlations are also defined on a tensor product of Hilbert spaces. In this work, we extend these ideas to the AdS/CFT correspondence by proposing that the thermofield double state-traditionally understood as encoding spatial correlations between two CFTs-is equivalent to temporal correlations of a single CFT across two times. On the gravity side, this implies that temporal correlations correspond to one black hole at different times or two temporally separated black holes connected by an Einstein-Rosen bridge. We interpret this connection as a temporal wormhole and explore its properties, concluding that such wormholes are nontraversable. We further analyze the dual spacetime of these temporal wormholes in the context of BTZ black holes and demonstrate that interchanging space and time in the BTZ metric yields a spacetime analogous to static de Sitter space. This leads us to propose a novel link between the interior geometry of BTZ black holes and the dS/CFT correspondence, wherein quantum temporal correlations are dual to de Sitter spacetime. This framework may provide new insights into the nature of quantum gravity and spacetime structure.

TI Implementing quantum dimensionality reduction for non-Markovian
   stochastic simulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Complex systems are embedded in our everyday experience. Stochastic modelling enables us to understand and predict the behaviour of such systems, cementing its utility across the quantitative sciences. Accurate models of highly non-Markovian processes - where the future behaviour depends on events that happened far in the past - must track copious amounts of information about past observations, requiring high-dimensional memories. Quantum technologies can ameliorate this cost, allowing models of the same processes with lower memory dimension than corresponding classical models. Here we implement such memory-efficient quantum models for a family of non-Markovian processes using a photonic setup. We show that with a single qubit of memory our implemented quantum models can attain higher precision than possible with any classical model of the same memory dimension. This heralds a key step towards applying quantum technologies in complex systems modelling.
   Quantum technologies allow memory advantages in simulating stochastic processes, but a demonstration of this for non-Markovian processes (where the advantage would be stronger) has been missing so far. Here the authors fill this gap analytically and experimentally, using a single qubit memory to model non-Markovian processes.

TI Two-qubit Fisher information and Jensen-Shannon nonlocality dynamics
   induced by a coherent cavity under dipole, intensity-dependent, and
   decoherence couplings
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB This study investigates two-qubit local quantum Fisher information correlation (LQFI), entanglement of formation (EoF), and two-qubit Jensen-Shannon coherence as a result of cavity-qubit coupling via intensity dependent and qubit-qubit interactions. Initially, the cavity is filled with coherent and even coherent fields, and the two-qubit state is pure. The cavity-qubit intensity dependent interaction, in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, can produce two-qubit local quantum Fisher information, entanglement of formation, and Jensen-Shannon coherence. This ability depends on dipole-qubit interactions, intrinsic decoherence, and initial cavity sates. The phenomena of sudden changes emerge in the dynamics behavior of the local quantum Fisher information, whereas the phenomenon of sudden birth-death occurs during the entanglement of formation dynamics. These phenomena can be enhanced by modifying the initial coherent field parameters, the mean photon number, and the non-classicality. The dipole qubit-qubit interaction improves the generated two-qubit correlation and coherence, while intrinsic decoherence decreases and stabilizes the generated two-qubit correlation and coherence. For a small initial coherent field intensity and dipole qubit-qubit interaction, the LQFI and EoF non-local correlations grow while the two-qubit Jensen-Shannon coherence diminishes. The qubit-qubit interaction coupling and the initial coherent field intensity can improve the produced stationary LQFI and EoF correlations and Jensen-Shannon coherence in the presence of the intrinsic decoherence.

TI A Scalable Quantum Key Distribution Network Testbed Using Parallel
   Discrete-Event Simulation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been promoted as a means for secure communications. Although QKD has been widely implemented in many urban fiber networks, the large-scale deployment of QKD remains challenging. Today, researchers extensively conduct simulation-based evaluations for their designs and applications of large-scale QKD networks for cost efficiency. However, the existing discrete-event simulators offer models for QKD hardware and protocols based on sequential event execution, which limits the scale of the experiments. In this work, we explore parallel simulation of QKD networks to address this issue. Our contributions lay in the exploration of QKD network characteristics to be leveraged for parallel simulation as well as the development of a parallel simulation framework for QKD networks. We also investigate three techniques to improve the simulation performance including (1) a ladder queue based event list, (2) memoization for computationally intensive quantum state transformation information, and (3) optimization of the network partition scheme for workload balance. The experimental results show that our parallel simulator is 10 times faster than a sequential simulator when simulating a 128-node QKD network. Our linear-regressionbased network partition scheme can further accelerate the simulation experiments up to two times over using a randomized network partition scheme.

TI Tight finite-key security for twin-field quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a reliable solution to communication problems that require long-term data security. For its widespread use, however, the rate and reach of QKD systems must be improved. Twin-field (TF) QKD is a step forward toward this direction, with early demonstrations suggesting it can beat the current rate-versus-distance records. A recently introduced variant of TF-QKD is particularly suited for experimental implementation, and has been shown to offer a higher key rate than other variants in the asymptotic regime, where users exchange an infinite number of signals. Here, we extend the security of this protocol to the finite-key regime, showing that it can overcome the fundamental bounds on point-to-point QKD with similar to 10(10) transmitted signals. In many practical regimes of interest, our analysis offers higher key rates than those of alternative variants. Moreover, some of the techniques we develop are applicable to the finite-key analysis of other QKD protocols.

TI Large flux-mediated coupling in hybrid electromechanical system with a
   transmon qubit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Mechanical resonators coupled to superconducting qubits are interesting platforms for quantum science and technology, but controlling them in quantum regime remains a challenge. The authors realize a hybrid device consisting of a superconducting transmon qubit and a mechanical resonator coupled using the magnetic-flux with the overall ability to increase the coupling strength and hence their control.
   Control over the quantum states of a massive oscillator is important for several technological applications and to test the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics. Addition of an internal degree of freedom to the oscillator could be a valuable resource for such control. Recently, hybrid electromechanical systems using superconducting qubits, based on electric-charge mediated coupling, have been quite successful. Here, we show a hybrid device, consisting of a superconducting transmon qubit and a mechanical resonator coupled using the magnetic-flux. The coupling stems from the quantum-interference of the superconducting phase across the tunnel junctions. We demonstrate a vacuum electromechanical coupling rate up to 4 kHz by making the transmon qubit resonant with the readout cavity. Consequently, thermal-motion of the mechanical resonator is detected by driving the hybridized-mode with mean-occupancy well below one photon. By tuning qubit away from the cavity, electromechanical coupling can be enhanced to 40 kHz. In this limit, a small coherent drive on the mechanical resonator results in the splitting of qubit spectrum, and we observe interference signature arising from the Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg effect. With improvements in qubit coherence, this system offers a platform to realize rich interactions and could potentially provide full control over the quantum motional states.

TI Detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum technology, and its quantification is a vital task in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This paper combines hybrid quantum-classical computation and quasi-probability decomposition to propose two variational quantum algorithms, called variational entanglement detection (VED) and variational logarithmic negativity estimation (VLNE), for detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices, respectively. VED makes use of the positive map criterion and works as follows. Firstly, it decomposes a positive map into a combination of quantum operations implementable on near-term quantum devices. It then variationally estimates the minimal eigenvalue of the final state, obtained by executing these implementable operations on the target state and averaging the output states. Deterministic and probabilistic methods are proposed to compute the average. At last, it asserts that the target state is entangled if the optimized minimal eigenvalue is negative. VLNE builds upon a linear decomposition of the transpose map into Pauli terms and the recently proposed trace distance estimation algorithm. It variationally estimates the well-known logarithmic negativity entanglement measure and could be applied to quantify entanglement on near-term quantum devices. Experimental and numerical results on the Bell state, isotropic states, and Breuer states show the validity of the proposed entanglement detection and quantification methods.

TI Pursuing high-fidelity control of spin qubits in natural Si/SiGe quantum
   dot
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Low-frequency noise, including nuclear spin fluctuations and charge noise, is a primary factor limiting gate fidelities. Suppressing this noise is crucial for high-fidelity qubit operations. Here, we report on a two-qubit quantum device in natural silicon with universal qubit control, designed to investigate the upper limits of gate fidelities in a non-purified Si/SiGe quantum dot device. By employing advanced device structures, qubit manipulation techniques, and optimization methods, we have achieved single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99% and a two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gate fidelity of 91%. Decoupled CZ gates are used to prepare Bell states with an average fidelity of 91%, typically exceeding previously reported values in natural silicon devices. These results underscore that even natural silicon has the potential to achieve high-fidelity gate operations, particularly with further optimization methods to suppress low-frequency noise.

TI Counter-propagating entangled photon pairs from monolayer GaSe
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum correlations in the telecom C-band from a monolayer SPDC source. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in the counter-propagating configuration. Our results revealed the emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched regime, and introduced atomically thin, counter-propagating SPDC as a scalable and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable via moir & eacute; superlattice engineering.

TI Usefulness of quantum entanglement for enhancing precision in frequency
   estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate strategies for reaching the ultimate limit on the precision of frequency estimation when the number of probes used in each run of the experiment is fixed. That limit is set by the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (QCRB), which predicts that the use of maximally entangled probes enhances the estimation precision, when compared with the use of independent probes. However, the bound is only achievable if the statistical model used in the estimation remains identifiable throughout the procedure. This in turn sets different limits on the maximal sensing time used in each run of the estimation procedure, when entangled and independent probes are used. When those constraints are taken into account, one can show that, when the total number of probes and the total duration of the estimation process are counted as fixed resources, the use of entangled probes is, in fact, disadvantageous when compared with the use of independent probes. In order to counteract the limitations imposed on the sensing time by the requirement of identifiability of the statistical model, we propose a time-adaptive strategy, in which the sensing time is adequately increased at each step of the estimation process, calculate an attainable error bound for the strategy, and discuss how to optimally choose its parameters in order to minimize that bound. We show that the proposed strategy leads to much better scaling of the estimation uncertainty with the total number of probes and the total sensing time than the traditional fixed-sensing-time strategy. We also show that, when the total number of probes and the total sensing time are counted as resources, independent probes and maximally entangled ones have now the same performance, in contrast to the nonadaptive strategy, where the use of independent is more advantageous than the use of maximally entangled ones.

TI Optimizing the deployment of quantum key distribution switch-based
   networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks provide an infrastructure for establishing information-theoretic secure keys between legitimate parties via quantum and authentic classical channels. The deployment of QKD networks in real-world conditions faces several challenges, which are related in particular to the high costs of QKD devices and the condition to provide reasonable secret key rates. In this work, we present a QKD network architecture that provides a significant reduction in the cost of deploying QKD networks by using optical switches and reducing the number of QKD receiver devices, which use single-photon detectors. We describe the corresponding modification of the QKD network protocol. We also provide estimations for a network link of a total of 670 km length consisting of 8 nodes and demonstrate that the switch-based architecture achieves significant resource savings of up to 28%, while the throughput is reduced by 8% only.

TI Quantum deep sets and sequences
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper introduces the quantum deep sets model, expanding the quantum machine learning tool-box by enabling the possibility of learning variadic functions using quantum systems. A couple of variants are presented for this model. The first one focuses on mapping sets to quantum systems through state vector averaging: each element of the set is mapped to a quantum state, and the quantum state of the set is the average of the corresponding quantum states of its elements. This approach allows the definition of a permutation-invariant variadic model. The second variant is useful for ordered sets, i.e., sequences, and relies on optimal coherification of tristochastic tensors that implement products of mixed states: each element of the set is mapped to a density matrix, and the quantum state of the set is the product of the corresponding density matrices of its elements. Such variant can be relevant in tasks such as natural language processing. The resulting quantum state in any of the variants is then processed to realise a function that solves a machine learning task such as classification, regression, or density estimation. Through synthetic problem examples, the efficacy and versatility of quantum deep sets and sequences (QDSs) are demonstrated.

TI Qubit motion as a microscopic model for the dynamical Casimir effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The generation of photons from the vacuum by means of the movement of a mirror is known as the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE). In general, this phenomenon is effectively described by a field with time-dependent boundary conditions. Alternatively, we introduce a microscopic model of the DCE capable of capturing the essential features of the effect with no time-dependent boundary conditions. Besides the field, such a model comprises a subsystem representing the mirror's internal structure. In this work, we study one of the most straightforward mirror systems: a qubit moving in a cavity and coupled to one of the bosonic modes. We find that under certain conditions on the qubit's movement that do not depend on its physical properties, a large number of photons may be generated without changing the qubit state, as should be expected for a microscopic model of the mirror.

TI AQEA-QAS: An Adaptive Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm for Quantum
   Architecture Search
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) represent an emerging technology that uses a quantum computer for neural network computations. The QNNs have demonstrated potential advantages over classical neural networks in certain tasks. As a core component of a QNN, the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) plays a crucial role in determining the QNN's overall performance. However, quantum circuit architectures designed manually based on experience or using specific hardware structures can suffer from inefficiency due to the introduction of redundant quantum gates, which amplifies the impact of noise on system performance. Recent studies have suggested that the advantages of quantum evolutionary algorithms (QEAs) in terms of precision and convergence speed can provide an effective solution to quantum circuit architecture-related problems. Currently, most QEAs adopt a fixed rotation mode in the evolution process, and a lack of an adaptive updating mode can cause the QEAs to fall into a local optimum and make it difficult for them to converge. To address these problems, this study proposes an adaptive quantum evolution algorithm (AQEA). First, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to the evolution process, and the strategy of combining two dynamic rotation angles is adopted. Second, to prevent the fluctuations of the population's offspring, the elite retention of the parents is used to ensure the inheritance of good genes. Finally, when the population falls into a local optimum, a quantum catastrophe mechanism is employed to break the current population state. The experimental results show that compared with the QNN structure based on manual design and QEA search, the proposed AQEA can reduce the number of network parameters by up to 20% and increase the accuracy by 7.21%. Moreover, in noisy environments, the AQEA-optimized circuit outperforms traditional circuits in maintaining high fidelity, and its excellent noise resistance provides strong support for the reliability of quantum computing.

TI Quantum simulation of a discrete-time quantum stochastic walk
SO EPL
AB Quantum walks have been shown to have a wide range of applications, from artificial intelligence, to photosynthesis, and quantum transport. Quantum stochastic walks (QSWs) generalize this concept to additional non-unitary evolution. In this paper, we propose a trajectory-based quantum simulation protocol to effectively implement a family of discrete-time QSWs in a quantum device. After deriving the protocol for a 2-vertex graph with a single edge, we show how our protocol generalizes to a graph with arbitrary topology and connectivity. The straightforward generalization leads to simple scaling of the protocol to complex graphs. Finally, we show how to simulate a restricted class of continuous-time QSWs by a discrete-time QSW, and how this is amenable to our simulation protocol for discrete-time QSWs. Copyright (C) 2021 EPLA

TI Implementation of a Frenkel exciton-based controlled phase shifter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Frenkel excitons are of interest for ultrafast switching applications due to the femtosecond timescale at which coherent exciton transfer between chromophores takes place. The Frenkel Hamiltonian, which governs the dynamics of Frenkel excitons, belongs to a class of Hamiltonians that enable universal quantum computation. It is thus of interest to determine how a complete set of exciton-based gates for quantum computing could be constructed as aggregates of chromophores. We demonstrate that a controlled phase shifter can be constructed as a pair of exciton transmission lines that employ two types of chromophores and that are cross coupled by a two-exciton interaction. This element facilitates the construction of controlled basis-change gates, thereby enabling the implementation of a complete set of exciton-based gates for universal quantum computation.

TI Quantum violations of Luders bound Leggett-Garg inequalities for
   non-unitary quantum channel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Leggett Garg inequalities (LGIs) provides an elegant way for probing the incompatibility between the notion of macrorealism and quantum mechanics. For unitary dynamics the optimal quantum violation of a LGI is constrained by the Luders bound. In this paper, we have studied two formulations of LGIs in three-time LG scenario, viz, the standard LGIs and third-order LGIs both for unbiased and biased measurement settings. We show that if system evolves under non-unitary quantum channel between two measurements, the quantum violations of both forms of LGIs exceed their respective Luders bounds and can even reach their algebraic maximum in sharp measurement settings. We found that when the measurement is unsharp the quantum violations of both standard and third-orderLGIs for non-unitary quantumchannel can be obtained for lower value of the unsharpness parameter compared to the unitary dynamics. We critically examined the violation of Luders bound of LGIs and its relation to the violation of various no-signaling in time conditions, another formalism for testing macrorealism. It is shown that mere violations of no-signaling conditions are not enough to warrant the violation of standard LGIs, an interplay between the violations of various NSIT condition along with a threshold value play an important role. On the other hand violation of third- order LGI is obtained when the degree of violation of a specific no-signaling in time condition reaches a different threshold value.

TI Dimension Reduction in Quantum Key Distribution for Continuous- and
   Discrete-Variable Protocols
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We develop a method to connect the infinite-dimensional description of optical continuous-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols to a finite-dimensional formulation. The secure key rates of the optical QKD protocols can then be evaluated using recently developed reliable numerical methods for key-rate calculations. We apply this method to obtain asymptotic key rates for discrete-modulated continuous-variable QKD protocols, which are of practical significance due to their experimental simplicity and potential for large-scale deployment in quantum-secured networks. Importantly, our security proof does not require the photon-number cutoff assumption relied upon in previous works. We also demonstrate that our method can provide practical advantages over the flag-state squasher when applied to discrete-variable protocols.

TI Intensity correlations in decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution
   systems
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbor correlations.

TI Low-depth simulations of fermionic systems on square-grid quantum
   hardware
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a general strategy for mapping fermionic systems to NISQ hardware with square qubit connectivity which yields low -depth quantum circuits, counted in the number of native two-qubit fSIM gates. We achieve this by leveraging novel operator decomposition and circuit compression techniques paired with specifically chosen low -depth fermion-toqubit mappings and allow for a high degree of gate cancellations and parallelism. Our mappings retain the flexibility to simultaneously optimize for qubit counts or qubit operator weights and can be used to investigate arbitrary fermionic lattice geometries. We showcase our approach by investigating the tight -binding model, the Fermi -Hubbard model as well as the multiorbital Hubbard-Kanamori model. We report unprecedentedly low circuit depths per single Trotter layer with up to a 70% improvement upon previous state-of-theart. Our compression technique also results in significant reduction of two-qubit gates. We find the lowest gate -counts when applying the XYZ-formalism to the DK mapping. Additionally, we show that our decomposition and compression formalism produces favourable circuits even when no native parameterized two-qubit gates are available.

TI Security Analysis of Phase Encoding Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution Based on K-Nearest Neighbor
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB This paper proposes a phase encoding, continuous-variable quantum key distribution quantum-state identification method based on the K- nearest neighbor algorithm. The algorithm achieves recognition using the phase features of the accepted quantum states, which are first learned from a training set consisting of known coherent states and then classified according to the phase features extracted from the unknown quantum states. Moreover, this paper derives the secure code rate of the K-nearest neighbor- based identification method under collective attack and reverse coordination and compares the performance of the method applied to four- state and eight-state protocols under different transmission distances, modulation variance, and excess noise. The results of numerical simulation results show that the method can effectively generate secure keys with a transmission distance of 250 km when the secure code rate is 10- 5 bit per symbol.

TI Continuous-variable multipartite vibrational entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A compact scheme for the preparation of macroscopic multipartite entanglement is proposed and analyzed. In this scheme, the vibrational modes of a mechanical resonator constitute continuous-variable (CV) subsystems that entangle with each other as a result of their interaction with a two-level system (TLS). By properly driving the TLS, we show that a selected set of modes can be activated and prepared in a multipartite entangled state. We first study the entanglement properties of a three-mode system by evaluating the genuine multipartite entanglement, and we investigate its usefulness as a quantum resource by computing the quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the robustness of the state against the qubit and thermal noises is studied, proving a long-lived entanglement. To examine the scalability and structural properties of the scheme, we derive an effective model for the multimode system through elimination of the TLS dynamics. This work provides a step toward a compact and versatile device for creating a multipartite noise-resilient entangled state in vibrational modes as a resource for CV quantum metrology, quantum communication, and quantum computation.

TI Realization of High-Fidelity CZ and ZZ-Free iSWAP Gates with a Tunable
   Coupler
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB High-fidelity two-qubit gates at scale are a key requirement to realize the full promise of quantum computation and simulation. The advent and use of coupler elements to tunably control two-qubit interactions has improved operational fidelity in many-qubit systems by reducing parasitic coupling and frequency crowding issues. Nonetheless, two-qubit gate errors still limit the capability of near-term quantum applications. The reason, in part, is that the existing framework for tunable couplers based on the dispersive approximation does not fully incorporate three-body multilevel dynamics, which is essential for addressing coherent leakage to the coupler and parasitic longitudinal (ZZ) interactions during two-qubit gates. Here, we present a systematic approach that goes beyond the dispersive approximation to exploit the engineered level structure of the coupler and optimize its control. Using this approach, we experimentally demonstrate CZ and ZZ-free iSWAP gates with two-qubit interaction fidelities of 99.76 +/- 0.07% and 99.87 +/- 0.23%, respectively, which are close to their T-1 limits.

We employ Lagrange interpolation polynomials and random numbers to blind the voting information on the bulletin board, so that it can minimize the public information. Furthermore, our receipt-free quantum voting protocol is information-theoretically secure, i.e., the eavesdropper cannot get any voting information by collecting both the quantum ciphertext and the public information. In addition, compared with the existing quantum voting protocols, our protocol can meet more security attributes, such as anonymity, unrepeatability, verifiability legitimacy and especially, receipt-freeness.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Rapidly and randomly drifted reference frames will shorten the transmission distance and decrease the secure key rate of realistic quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. In this article, we present a free-running reference-frame-independent (RFI) QKD scheme, where measurement events are classified into multiple slices with similar estimated classification parameter. We perform the free-running RFI QKD experiment with a fiber link of 100 km and reference frame misalignment more than 29 periods in 50.7 h. A key rate as high as 742.98 bps is achieved at the total loss of 31.5 dB benefiting from both the new protocol design and the 80 MHz repetition rate system in use. Our system runs 50.7 h freely without any reference frame alignment. In the experiment, the misalignment variation rate tolerance of the experiment is 0.262 rad/s, and could be optimized to 1.309 rad/s. Therefore, our free-running RFI scheme can be efficiently adapted into the satellite-to-ground and drone-based mobile communication scenarios.

TI Simple security proof of coherent-one-way quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Coherent-one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD), which requires a simple experimental setup and has the ability to withstand photon-number-splitting attacks, has been not only experimentally implemented but also commercially applied. However, recent studies have shown that the current COW-QKD system is insecure and can only distribute secret keys safely within 20 km of the optical fiber length. In this study, we propose a practical implementation of COW-QKD by adding a two-pulse vacuum state as a new decoy sequence. This proposal maintains the original experimental setup as well as the simplicity of its implementation. Utilizing detailed observations on the monitoring line to provide an analytical upper bound on the phase error rate, we provide a high-performance COW-QKD asymptotically secure against coherent attacks. This ensures the availability of COW-QKD within 100 km and establishes theoretical foundations for further applications.

TI A Parallel Quantum Circuit Implementations of LSH Hash Function for Use
   with Grover's Algorithm
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Grover's search algorithm accelerates the key search on the symmetric key cipher and the pre-image attack on the hash function. To conduct Grover's search algorithm, the target cipher algorithm should be efficiently implemented in a quantum circuit. Currently, small quantum computers are difficult to operate with large quantum circuits due to limited performance. Therefore, if a large quantum computer that can operate Grover's algorithm appears, it is expected that a cipher attack will be possible. In this paper, we propose a parallel structure quantum circuit for the Korean hash function standard (i.e., LSH). The proposed quantum circuit designed a parallel operation structure for the message expansion (i.e., MsgExp) function and the mix function, which are the internal structures of the LSH hash function. This approach shows an efficient result for quantum circuit implementation in terms of quantum resources by reducing the depth of the quantum circuit by about 96% through the trade-off of appropriate quantum resources compared to previous work. This result can be a reference for the implementation of a parallel quantum circuit in the future and is expected to advance the attack timing of the search algorithm for Grover's LSH hash function.

TI Some comments on unitary qubit lattice algorithms for classical problems
SO RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS
AB A qubit lattice algorithm (QLA), which consists of a set of interleaved unitary collision-streaming operators, is developed for electromagnetic wave propagation in tensor dielectric media. External potential operators are required to handle gradients in the refractive indices, and these operators are typically non-unitary but sparse. A similar problem arises in the QLA for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, as the potential operator that models the KdV nonlinear term is also non-unitary. Several QLAs are presented here that avoid the need of this non-unitary potential operator by perturbing the collision operator. These QLAs are fully unitary.

TI SimuQ: A Framework for Programming Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation with
   Analog Compilation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum Hamiltonian simulation, which simulates the evolution of quantum systems and probes quantum phenomena, is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that Hamiltonian-oriented analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over circuit-oriented digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware and software. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first framework for quantum Hamiltonian simulation that supports Hamiltonian programming and pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users specify the target quantum system with Hamiltonian Modeling Language, and the Hamiltonian-level programmability of analog quantum simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the abstract analog instruction set (AAIS) and programmed in AAIS Specification Language by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ generates executable pulse schedules for real devices to simulate the evolution of desired quantum systems, which is demonstrated on superconducting (IBM), neutral-atom (QuEra), and trapped-ion (IonQ) quantum devices. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of exposing the Hamiltonian-level programmability of devices with native operations or interaction-based gates and establish a small benchmark of quantum simulation to evaluate SimuQ's compiler with the above analog quantum simulators.

TI Device independent security of quantum key distribution from
   monogamy-of-entanglement games
SO QUANTUM
AB We analyse two party non-local games whose predicate requires Alice and Bob to generate matching bits, and their three party extensions where a third player receives all inputs and is required to output a bit that matches that of the original players. We propose a general device-independent quantum key distribution protocol for the subset of such non-local games that satisfy a monogamy-of-entanglement property characterised by a gap in the maximum winning probability between the bipartite and tripartite versions of the game. This gap is due to the optimal strategy for two players requiring entanglement, which due to its monogamy property cannot be shared with any additional players. Based solely on the monogamy-of entanglement property, we provide a simple proof of information theoretic security of our protocol. Lastly, we numerically optimize the finite and asymptotic secret key rates of our protocol using the magic square game as an example, for which we provide a numerical bound on the maximal tripartite quantum winning probability which closely matches the bipartite classical winning probability. Further, we show that our protocol is robust for depolarizing noise up to about 2.88%, providing the first such bound for general attacks for magic square based quantum key distribution.

TI On the Transmission Probabilities in Quantum Key Distribution Systems
   Over FSO Links
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this paper, we investigate the transmission probabilities in three cases (depending only on the legitimate receiver, depending only the eavesdropper, and depending on both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper) in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems over free-space optical links. To be more realistic, we consider a generalized pointing error scenario, where the azimuth and elevation pointing error angles caused by stochastic jitters and vibrations in the legitimate receiver platform are independently distributed according to a non-identical normal distribution. Taking these assumptions into account, we derive approximate expressions of transmission probabilities by using the Gaussian quadrature method. To simplify the expressions and get some physical insights, some asymptotic analysis on the transmission probabilities is presented based on asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function when the telescope gain at the legitimate receiver approaches to infinity. Moreover, from the asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function, the asymptotic outage probability over Beckmann fading channels (a general channel model including Rayleigh, Rice, and Hoyt fading channels) can be also easily derived when the average signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large, which shows the diversity order and array gain.

TI Realizing all-to-all couplings among detachable quantum modules using a
   microwave quantum state router
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the primary challenges in realizing large-scale quantum processors is the realization of qubit couplings that balance interaction strength, connectivity, and mode confinement. Moreover, it is very desirable for the device elements to be detachable, allowing components to be built, tested, and replaced independently. In this work, we present a microwave quantum state router, centered on parametrically driven, Josephson-junction based three-wave mixing, that realizes all-to-all couplings among four detachable quantum modules. We demonstrate coherent exchange among all four communication modes, with an average full-iSWAP time of 764 ns and average inferred inter-module exchange fidelity of 0.969, limited by mode coherence. We also demonstrate photon transfer and pairwise entanglement between module qubits, and parallel operation of simultaneous iSWAP exchange across the router. Our router-module architecture serves as a prototype of modular quantum computer that has great potential for enabling flexible, demountable, large-scale quantum networks of superconducting qubits and cavities.

TI Characterizing losses in InAs two-dimensional electron gas-based gatemon
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The tunneling of Cooper pairs across a Josephson junction (JJ) allows for the nonlinear inductance necessary to construct superconducting qubits, amplifiers, and various other quantum circuits. An alternative approach using hybrid superconductor-semiconductor JJs can enable superconducting qubit architectures with all electric control. Here we present continuous-wave and time-domain characterization of gatemon qubits and coplanar waveguide resonators based on an InAs two-dimensional electron gas. We show that the qubit undergoes a vacuum Rabi splitting with a readout cavity, and we drive coherent Rabi oscillations between the qubit ground and first excited states. We measure qubit relaxation times to be T1 = 100 ns over a 1.5 GHz tunable band. We detail the loss mechanisms present in these materials through a systematic study of the quality factors of coplanar waveguide resonators. While various loss mechanisms are present in III-V gatemon circuits, we detail future directions in enhancing the relaxation times of qubit devices on this platform.

TI Square Root Statistics of Density Matrices and Their Applications
SO ENTROPY
AB To estimate the degree of quantum entanglement of random pure states, it is crucial to understand the statistical behavior of entanglement indicators such as the von Neumann entropy, quantum purity, and entanglement capacity. These entanglement metrics are functions of the spectrum of density matrices, and their statistical behavior over different generic state ensembles have been intensively studied in the literature. As an alternative metric, in this work, we study the sum of the square root spectrum of density matrices, which is relevant to negativity and fidelity in quantum information processing. In particular, we derive the finite-size mean and variance formulas of the sum of the square root spectrum over the Bures-Hall ensemble, extending known results obtained recently over the Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble.

TI Clustering by Contour Coreset and Variational Quantum Eigensolver
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Recent work has proposed solving the k-means clustering problem on quantum computers via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and coreset techniques. Although the current method demonstrates the possibility of quantum k-means clustering, it does not ensure high accuracy and consistency across a wide range of datasets. The existing coreset techniques are designed for classical algorithms, and there is no quantum-tailored coreset technique designed to boost the accuracy of quantum algorithms. This study proposes solving the k-means clustering problem with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and a customized coreset method, the Contour coreset, which is formulated with a specific focus on quantum algorithms. Extensive simulations with synthetic and real-life data demonstrated that the VQE+Contour Coreset approach outperforms existing QAOA+Coreset k-means clustering approaches with higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. This research demonstrates that quantum-tailored coreset techniques can remarkably boost the performance of quantum algorithms compared to generic off-the-shelf coreset techniques.
   This study presents a novel solution for the k-means clustering problem, employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and a specialized coreset method, Contour coreset, tailored for quantum algorithms. Extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world data show superior performance of the VQE+Contour Coreset over existing Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)+generic coreset approaches regarding accuracy and standard deviation reduction, underscoring the effectiveness of quantum-tailored coreset techniques. image

TI Teleportation with embezzling catalysts
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum teleportation is the process of transferring quantum information using classical communication and pre-shared entanglement. This process can benefit from the use of catalysts, which are ancillary entangled states that can enhance teleportation without being consumed. While chemical catalysts undergoing deactivation invariably exhibit inferior performance compared to those unaffected by deactivation, quantum catalysts, termed embezzling catalysts, that are subject to deactivation, may outperform their non-deactivating counterparts. In this work, we present teleportation protocols with embezzling catalysts that can achieve arbitrarily high fidelity. This enables the teleported state to closely approximate the original message state with arbitrary precision, while maintaining arbitrarily small variations in the catalytic system through the use of finite-dimensional embezzling catalysts. We show that some embezzling catalysts are universal, meaning that they can improve the teleportation fidelity for any pre-shared entanglement. We also explore methods to reduce the dimension of catalysts without increasing catalyst consumption, an essential step towards realizing quantum catalysis in practice.
   Quantum teleportation offers superior performance in transmitting information over classical methods but is often hindered by environmental noise. To address this issue, the authors introduce a teleportation protocol with finite-dimensional embezzling catalysts to achieve arbitrarily high fidelity, with only negligible changes to the catalytic systems.

TI Mixed QuantumClassical Method for Fraud Detection With Quantum Feature
   Selection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article presents a first end-to-end application of a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) algorithm for a classification problem in the financial payment industry using the IBM Safer Payments and IBM Quantum Computers via the Qiskit software stack. Based on real card payment data, a thorough comparison is performed to assess the complementary impact brought in by the current state-of-the-art quantum machine-learning algorithms with respect to the classical approach. A new method to search for best features is explored using the QSVM's feature map characteristics. The results are compared using fraud-specific key performance indicators, i.e., accuracy, recall, and false positive rate, extracted from analyses based on human expertise (such as rule decisions), classical machine-learning algorithms (such as random forest and XGBoost), and quantum-based machine-learning algorithms using QSVM. In addition, a hybrid classical-quantum approach is explored by using an ensemble model that combines classical and quantum algorithms to better improve the fraud prevention decision. We found, as expected, that the results highly depend on feature selections and algorithms that are used to select them. The QSVM provides a complementary exploration of the feature space that led to an improved accuracy of the mixed quantum-classical method for fraud detection, on a drastically reduced dataset to fit current state of quantum hardware.

TI Photon-counting statistics-based support vector machine with multi-mode
   photon illumination for quantum imaging
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a photon-counting-statistics-based imaging process for quantum imaging where background photon noise can be distinguished and eliminated by photon mode estimation from the multi-mode Bose-Einstein distribution. Photon-counting statistics show multi-mode behavior in a practical, low-cost single-photon-level quantum imaging system with a short coherence time and a long measurement time interval. Different mode numbers in photon-counting probability distributions from single-photon illumination and background photon noise can be classified by a machine learning technique such as a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed photon-counting statistics-based support vector machine (PSSVM) learns the difference in the photon-counting distribution of each pixel to distinguish between photons from the source and the background photon noise to improve the image quality. We demonstrated quantum imaging of a binary-image object with photon illumination from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source. The experiment results show that the PSSVM applied quantum image improves a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gain of 2.89dB and a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) gain of 27.7% compared to the conventional direct single-photon imaging.

TI State leakage during fast decay and control of a superconducting
   transmon qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting Josephson junction qubits constitute the main current technology for many applications, including scalable quantum computers and thermal devices. Theoretical modeling of such systems is usually done within the two-level approximation. However, accurate theoretical modeling requires taking into account the influence of the higher excited states without limiting the system to the two-level qubit subspace. Here, we study the dynamics and control of a superconducting transmon using the numerically exact stochastic Liouville-von Neumann equation approach. We focus on the role of state leakage from the ideal two-level subspace for bath induced decay and single-qubit gate operations. We find significant short-time state leakage due to the strong coupling to the bath. We quantify the leakage errors in single-qubit gates and demonstrate their suppression with derivative removal adiabatic gates (DRAG) control for a five-level transmon in the presence of decoherence. Our results predict the limits of accuracy of the two-level approximation and possible intrinsic constraints in qubit dynamics and control for an experimentally relevant parameter set.

AB In this study, the security implications of utilizing the concept of entanglement in time in the quantum representation of a blockchain data structure are investigated. The analysis reveals that the fundamental idea underlying this representation relies on an uncertain interpretation of experimental results. A different perspective is provided by adopting the Copenhagen interpretation, which explains the observed correlations in the experiment without invoking the concept of entanglement in time. According to this interpretation, the qubits responsible for these correlations are not entangled, posing a challenge to the security foundation of the data structure. The study incorporates theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments using real quantum hardware. By employing a dedicated circuit for detecting genuine entanglement, the existence of entanglement in the process of generating a quantum blockchain is conclusively excluded.

TI Measuring qubit stability in a gate-based NISQ hardware processor
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Some of the most problematic issues that limit the implementation of applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines are the adverse impacts of both incoherent and coherent errors. We conducted an in-depth study of coherent errors on a quantum hardware platform using a transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian as a sample user application. We report here on the results from these computations using several error mitigation protocols that profile these errors and provide an indication of the qubit stability. Through a detailed set of measurements, we identify inter-day and intra-day qubit calibration drift and the impacts of quantum circuit placement on groups of qubits in different physical locations on the processor. This paper also discusses how these measurements can provide a better understanding of these types of errors and how they may improve efforts to validate the accuracy of quantum computations.

TI Big Data, Quantum Computing, and the Economic Calculation Debate: Will
   Roasted Cyberpigeons Fly into the Mouths of Comrades?
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB Advancements in cloud computing, machine learning and quantum processing are starting to erase long-standing conceptions on the scarcity of information. In this paper, we ask whether removing all limits on the volume, velocity, and variety of data will allow the messiness of the market process to be replaced by a more rational system of resource allocation and distribution that would generate less waste and more equity. We conclude that unlimited access to information will not solve the problem of economic calculation, as some have conjectured. The market process provides valuable benefits beyond the simple aggregation of spatially and temporally dispersed information. As such, it is unlikely to be displaced by more centralized forms of economic organization.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Tailoring potentials by simulation-aided design of gate layouts for
   spin-qubit applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Gate layouts of spin-qubit devices are commonly adapted from previous successful devices. As qubit numbers and device complexity increase, modeling new device layouts and optimizing for yield and performance become necessary. The simulation tools used in the advanced semiconductor industry need to be adapted for smaller structure sizes and electron numbers. Here, we present a general approach to electrostatically modeling new spin-qubit-device layouts, considering gate voltages, heterostructures, doping, reservoirs, and an applied source-drain bias. We identify key challenges in spin-qubit-device design: validating the impact on quantum-dot parameters, considering cross-coupling among gates and reservoirs, and ensuring robustness of the design to fabrication limits. We select a demanding target potential to investigate and optimize examples of gate layouts under these challenges. We verify our model by fabricating two simulated designs and indirectly probing the potential landscape through transport measurements.

TI Quantum algorithm for MMNG-based DBSCAN
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB DBSCAN is a famous density-based clustering algorithm that can discover clusters with arbitrary shapes without the minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters. However, DBSCAN is not suitable for databases with different local-density clusters and is also a very time-consuming clustering algorithm. In this paper, we present a quantum mutual MinPts-nearest neighbor graph (MMNG)-based DBSCAN algorithm. The proposed algorithm performs better on databases with different local-density clusters. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has a dramatic increase in speed compared to its classic counterpart.

TI Selection and Optimization of Hyperparameters in Warm-Started Quantum
   Optimization for the MaxCut Problem
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Today's quantum computers are limited in their capabilities, e.g., the size of executable quantum circuits. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) addresses these limitations and is, therefore, a promising candidate for achieving a near-term quantum advantage. Warm-starting can further improve QAOA by utilizing classically pre-computed approximations to achieve better solutions at a small circuit depth. However, warm-starting requirements often depend on the quantum algorithm and problem at hand. Warm-started QAOA (WS-QAOA) requires developers to understand how to select approach-specific hyperparameter values that tune the embedding of classically pre-computed approximations. In this paper, we address the problem of hyperparameter selection in WS-QAOA for the maximum cut problem using the classical Goemans- Williamson algorithm for pre-computations. The contributions of this work are as follows: We implement and run a set of experiments to determine how different hyperparameter settings influence the solution quality. In particular, we (i) analyze how the regularization parameter that tunes the bias of the warm-started quantum algorithm towards the pre-computed solution can be selected and optimized, (ii) compare three distinct optimization strategies, and (iii) evaluate five objective functions for the classical optimization, two of which we introduce specifically for our scenario. The experimental results provide insights on efficient selection of the regularization parameter, optimization strategy, and objective function and, thus, support developers in setting up one of the central algorithms of contemporary and near-term quantum computing.

TI Quantum key-based medical privacy protection and sharing scheme on
   blockchain
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in healthcare systems, security issues related to user privacy during data transmission and sharing have become increasingly prominent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a medical privacy protection and secure sharing scheme based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The scheme integrates multiple technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and Chebyshev chaotic mapping, to ensure secure data sharing and access control among multiple communication entities. Compared with existing solutions, our approach enhances key management security through quantum keys and improves communication resilience against attacks by leveraging chaotic systems. User identity privacy is protected via zero-knowledge proofs. Under the random oracle model, the security of the proposed scheme is formally proven. Moreover, comparative experiments with existing protocols demonstrate the scheme's comprehensive advantages in terms of security and performance, evaluated across throughput, computational overhead, communication overhead, and storage overhead.

TI Decoding Nature with Nature's Tools: Heterotic Line Bundle Models of
   Particle Physics with Genetic Algorithms and Quantum Annealing
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB The string theory landscape may include a multitude of ultraviolet embeddings of the Standard Model, but identifying these has proven difficult due to the enormous number of available string compactifications. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) represent a powerful class of discrete optimisation techniques that can efficiently deal with the immensity of the string landscape, especially when enhanced with input from quantum annealers. In this letter, we focus on geometric compactifications of the E8xE8$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string theory compactified on smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds with Abelian bundles. We make use of analytic formulae for bundle-valued cohomology to impose the entire range of spectrum requirements, something that has not been possible so far. For manifolds with a relatively low number of Kahler parameters, we compare the GA search results with results from previous systematic scans, showing that GAs can find nearly all the viable solutions while visiting only a tiny fraction of the solution space. Moreover, we carry out GA searches on manifolds with a larger numbers of Kahler parameters where systematic searches are not feasible.

TI Scientometric analysis of quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum algorithms, based on the principles of quantum mechanics, offer significant parallel processing capabilities with a wide range of applications. Nature-inspired stochastic optimization algorithms have long been a research hotspot. The fusion of quantum mechanics with optimization methods can potentially address NP-hard problems more efficiently and exponentially faster. The potential advantages provided by the ground-breaking paradigm have expedited the scientific output of quantum-inspired optimization algorithms locale. Consequently, a pertinent investigation is required to explain how ground-breaking scientific advancements have evolved. The scientometric approach utilizes quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze research publications to evaluate the structure of scientific knowledge. Henceforth, the current research presents a scientometric and systematic analysis of quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms (QiMs) literature from the Scopus database since its inception. The scientometric implications of the article offer a detailed exploration of the publication patterns, keyword co-occurrence network analysis, author co-citation analysis and country collaboration analysis corresponding to each opted category of QiMs. The analysis reveals that QiMs solely account to 26.66% of publication share in quantum computing and have experienced an impressive 42.59% growth rate in the past decade. Notably, power management, adiabatic quantum computation, and vehicle routing are prominent emerging application areas. An extensive systematic literature analysis identifies key insights and research gaps in the QiMs knowledge domain. Overall, the findings of the current article provide scientific cues to researchers and the academic fraternity for identifying the intellectual landscape and latest research trends of QiMs, thereby fostering innovation and informed decision-making.

TI Superconducting flux qubit with ferromagnetic Josephson π-junction
   operating at zero magnetic field
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Conventional superconducting flux qubits require the application of a precisely tuned magnetic field to set the operation point at half a flux quantum through the qubit loop, which complicates the on-chip integration of this type of device. It has been proposed that by inducing a pi-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter using a precisely controlled nanoscale-thickness superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction, commonly referred to as pi-junction, it is possible to realize a flux qubit operating at zero magnetic flux. Here, we report the realization of a zero-flux-biased flux qubit based on three NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions and a NbN/PdNi/NbN ferromagnetic pi-junction. The qubit lifetime is in the microsecond range, which we argue is limited by quasiparticle excitations in the metallic ferromagnet layer. Our results pave the way for developing quantum coherent devices, including qubits and sensors, that utilize the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity.

TI Polarization based discrete variables quantum key distribution via
   conjugated homodyne detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Optical homodyne detection is widely adopted in continuous-variable quantum key distribution for high-rate field measurement quadratures. Besides that, those detection schemes have been being implemented for single-photon statistics characterization in the field of quantum tomography. In this work, we propose a discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) implementation that combines the use of phase modulators for high-speed state of polarization (SOP) generation, with a conjugate homodyne detection scheme which enables the deployment of high speed QKD systems. The channel discretization relies on the application of a detection threshold that allows to map the measured voltages as a click or no-click. Our scheme relies also on the use of a time-multiplexed pilot tone-quantum signal architecture which enables the use of a Bob locally generated local oscillator and opens the door to an effective polarization drift compensation scheme. Besides that, our results shows that for higher detection threshold values we obtain a very low quantum bit error rate (QBER) on the sifted key. Nevertheless, due to huge number of discarded qubits the obtained secure key length abruptly decreases. From our results, we observe that optimizing the detection threshold and considering a system operating at 500 MHz symbol generation clock, a secure key rate of approximately 46.9 Mbps, with a sifted QBER of 1.5% over 40 km of optical fiber. This considering the error correction and privacy amplification steps necessary to obtain a final key.

TI A Fast Tunable 3D-Transmon Architecture for Superconducting Qubit-Based
   Hybrid Devices
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Superconducting qubits utilize the strong non-linearity of Josephson junctions. Control over the Josephson nonlinearity, either by a current bias or by the magnetic flux, can be a valuable resource that brings tunability in the hybrid system consisting of superconducting qubits. To enable such a control, here we incorporate a fast-flux line for a frequency tunable transmon qubit in 3D cavity architecture. We investigate the flux-dependent dynamic range, relaxation from unconfined states, and the bandwidth of the flux-line. Using time-domain measurements, we probe the transmon's relaxation from higher energy levels after populating the cavity with approximate to 2.1 x 10(4) photons. For the device used in the experiment, we find a resurgence time corresponding to the recovery of coherence to be 4.8 mu s. We use a fast-flux line to tune the qubit frequency and demonstrate the swap of a single excitation between cavity and qubit mode. By measuring the deviation in the transferred population from the theoretical prediction, we estimate the bandwidth of the flux line to be approximate to 100 MHz, limited by the parasitic effect in the design. These results suggest that the approach taken here to implement a fast-flux line in a 3D cavity could be helpful for the hybrid devices based on the superconducting qubit.

TI High-Stability Cryogenic System for Quantum Computing With Compact
   Packaged Ion Traps
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Cryogenic environments benefit ion trapping experiments by offering lower motional heating rates, collision energies, and an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment for maintaining long ion chains for extended periods of time. Mechanical vibrations caused by compressors in closed-cycle cryostats can introduce relative motion between the ion and the wavefronts of lasers used to manipulate the ions. Here, we present a novel ion trapping system where a commercial low-vibration closed-cycle cryostat is used in a custom monolithic enclosure. We measure mechanical vibrations of the sample stage using an optical interferometer, and observe a root-mean-square relative displacement of 2.4 nm and a peak-to-peak displacement of 17 nm between free-space beams and the trapping location. We packaged a surface ion trap in a cryopackage assembly that enables easy handling while creating a UHV environment for the ions. The trap cryopackage contains activated carbon getter material for enhanced sorption pumping near the trapping location, and source material for ablation loading. Using Yb-171(+) as our ion, we estimate the operating pressure of the trap as a function of package temperature using phase transitions of zig-zag ion chains as a probe. We measured the radial mode heating rate of a single ion to be 13 quanta/s on average. The Ramsey coherence measurements yield 330-ms coherence time for counter-propagating Raman carrier transitions using a 355-nm mode-locked pulse laser, demonstrating the high optical stability.

TI Electric field control for experiments with atoms in Rydberg states
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Atoms excited to Rydberg states have recently emerged as a valuable resource in neutral atom platforms for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum information processing. Atoms in Rydberg states have large polarizabilities, which makes them highly sensitive to electric fields. Therefore, stray electric fields can decohere these atoms, in addition to compromising the fidelity of engineered interactions between them. Therefore, it is essential to cancel these stray electric fields. Here, we present a novel, simple, and highly compact electrode assembly, implemented in a glass cell-based vacuum chamber design, for stray electric field cancellation. The electrode assembly allows for full 3D control of the electric field in the vicinity of the atoms while blocking almost no optical access. We experimentally demonstrate the cancellation of stray electric fields to better than 10 mV/cm using this electrode assembly. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Fast Readout and Reset of a Superconducting Qubit Coupled to a Resonator
   with an Intrinsic Purcell Filter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Coupling a resonator to a superconducting qubit enables various operations on the qubit, including dispersive readout and unconditional reset. The speed of these operations is limited by the external decay rate of the resonator. However, increasing the decay rate also increases the rate of qubit decay via the resonator, limiting the qubit lifetime. Here, we demonstrate that the resonator-mediated qubit decay can be suppressed by utilizing the distributed-element, multimode nature of the resonator. We show that the suppression exceeds 2 orders of magnitude over a bandwidth of 600 MHz. We use this "intrinsic Purcell filter" to demonstrate a 40-ns readout with 99.1% fidelity and a 100-ns reset with residual excitation of less than 1.7%.

TI Quantum algorithm for solving the advection equation using Hamiltonian
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum algorithm for solving the advection equation by embedding the discrete time-marching operator into Hamiltonian simulations is presented. One-dimensional advection can be simulated directly since the central finite-difference operator for first-order derivatives is anti-Hermitian. Here this is extended to industrially relevant multidimensional flows with realistic boundary conditions and arbitrary finite-difference stencils. A single copy of the initial quantum state is required and the circuit depth grows linearly with the required number of time steps, the sparsity of the time-marching operator, and the inverse of the allowable error. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a two-dimensional channel flow and lid-driven cavity configuration are presented as a proof of concept of the proposed approach.

TI Assembly and coherent control of a register of nuclear spin qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The generation of a register of highly coherent, but independent, qubits is a prerequisite to performing universal quantum computation. Here we introduce a qubit encoded in two nuclear spin states of a single Sr-87 atom and demonstrate coherence approaching the minute-scale within an assembled register of individually-controlled qubits. While other systems have shown impressive coherence times through some combination of shielding, careful trapping, global operations, and dynamical decoupling, we achieve comparable coherence times while individually driving multiple qubits in parallel. We highlight that even with simultaneous manipulation of multiple qubits within the register, we observe coherence in excess of 10(5) times the current length of the operations, with T-2(echo) = (40 +/- 7) seconds. We anticipate that nuclear spin qubits will combine readily with the technical advances that have led to larger arrays of individually trapped neutral atoms and high-fidelity entangling operations, thus accelerating the realization of intermediate-scale quantum information processors.

TI Quantum Testing of Recommender Algorithms on GPU-Based Quantum
   Simulators
SO COMPUTERS
AB This study explores the application of quantum computing in asset management, focusing on the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve specific classes of financial asset recommendation problems. While quantum computing holds promise for combinatorial optimization tasks, its application to portfolio management faces significant challenges in scalability for practical implementations. In this work, we model the problem using a graph representation where nodes represent investors, and edges reflect significant similarities in asset choices. We test the proposed method using quantum simulators, including cuQuantum, Cirq-GPU, and Cirq with IonQ, and compare the performance of quantum optimization against classical brute-force methods. Our results suggest that quantum algorithms may offer computational advantages for certain use cases, though classical heuristics also provide competitive performance for smaller datasets. This study contributes to the ongoing investigation into the potential of quantum computing for real-time financial decision-making, providing insights into both its applicability and limitations in asset management for larger and more complex investor datasets.

TI Few-Mode Fiber with Low Spontaneous Raman Scattering for Quantum Key
   Distribution and Classical Optical Communication Coexistence Systems
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, the theoretical model of spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) in few-mode fiber (FMF) is discussed. The influence of SpRS on quantum key distribution (QKD) in FMF is evaluated by combining wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and space division multiplexing (SDM) techniques. On this basis, an improved ring-assisted FMF is designed and characterized; the transmission distance can be increased by up to 54.5% when choosing different multi-channels. The effects of forward and backward SpRS on QKD are also discussed.

AB Enhancing quantum entanglement is important for many quantum information processing applications. In this paper, we consider a protocol for entanglement enhancing in a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVS), attained based on photon subtraction, photon catalysis, and photon addition. Central to such an operation is the task of mixing and detecting number states with each mode of TMSVS. We analyze various settings and find an optimal setup for improving the entanglement of the state.

TI Prospects of cooling a mechanical resonator with a transmon qubit in
   c-QED setup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid devices based on the superconducting qubits have emerged as a promising platform for controlling the quantum states of macroscopic resonators. The nonlinearity added by a qubit can be a valuable resource for such control. Here we study a hybrid system consisting of a mechanical resonator longitudinally coupled to a transmon qubit. The qubit readout can be done by coupling to a readout mode like in c-QED setup. The coupling between the mechanical resonator and transmon qubit can be implemented by the modulation of the superconducting quantum interference device inductance. In such a tripartite system, we analyze the steady-state occupation of the mechanical mode when all three modes are dispersively coupled. We use the quantum noise and the Lindblad formalism to show that the sideband cooling of the mechanical mode to its ground state is achievable. We further experimentally demonstrate that measurements of the thermomechanical motion are possible in the dispersive limit, while maintaining a large coupling between qubit and mechanical mode. Our theoretical calculations suggest that single-photon strong coupling is within the experimental reach in such hybrid devices.

We obtained the so-called Shannon entropy through the eigenfunctions of the system. The quantum states considered come from Schrodinger theory with the AB field in the background of curved space. With this entropy, we can explore the quantum information at the position space and reciprocal space. Furthermore, we discussed how the magnetic field, the AB flux, and the topological defect influence the quantum states and the information entropy.

TI Control of a qubit state by a soliton propagating through a Heisenberg

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We demonstrate that nonlinear magnetic solitary excitations (solitons) traveling through a Heisenberg spin chain may be used as a robust tool capable of coherent control of the qubit's state. The physical problem is described by a Hamiltonian involving the interaction between the soliton and the qubit. We show that under certain conditions the generic Hamiltonian may be mapped on that of a qubit two-level system with matrix elements depending on the soliton parameters. We considered the action of a bright and a dark soliton depending on the driving nonlinear wave function. We considered a local interaction restricted the closest to the qubit spin in the chain. We computed the expressions of the physical quantities of interest for all cases and analyzed their behavior in some special limits.

TI Is Heralded Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence with Single Absorbers
   Possible with Current Technology?
SO PHOTONICS
AB The interaction between single or a fixed number of photons with a single absorber is of fundamental interest in quantum technology. The harnessing of light matter interactions at the single particle limit has several potential applications ranging from quantum communication and quantum metrology to quantum imaging. In this perspective, a setup for heralded two-photon excited fluorescence at the single absorber level is proposed. The setup is based on a heralded two-photon source utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion, entanglement swapping and sum frequency generation for joint detection. This perspective aimed at triggering a discussion about the study of TPA and TPEF with only very few photons. The feasibility of the scheme is assessed by estimating the performance based on state-of-the-art technologies and losses, with the conclusion that the realization appears to be very challenging, but not completely impossible.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for the Classification of Patterns of Boolean
   Functions
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper introduces a novel quantum algorithm that is able to classify a hierarchy of classes of imbalanced Boolean functions. The fundamental characteristic of imbalanced Boolean functions is that the proportion of elements in their domain that take the value 0 is not equal to the proportion of elements that take the value 1. For every positive integer, n, the hierarchy contains a class of n-ary Boolean functions defined according to their behavioral pattern. The common trait of all the functions belonging to the same class is that they possess the same imbalance ratio. Our algorithm achieves classification in a straightforward manner as the final measurement reveals the unknown function with a probability of 1.0. Let us also note that the proposed algorithm is an optimal oracular algorithm because it can classify the aforementioned functions with just a single query to the oracle. At the same time, we explain in detail the methodology we followed to design this algorithm in the hope that it will prove general and fruitful, given that it can be easily modified and extended to address other classes of imbalanced Boolean functions that exhibit different behavioral patterns.

TI Compressed Space Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for
   Constrained Combinatorial Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Combinatorial optimization is a promising area for achieving quantum speedup. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to search for low-energy states of the Ising model, which correspond to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, effectively dealing with constraints of COPs remains a significant challenge. Existing methods, such as tailoring mixing operators, are typically limited to specific constraint types, such as one-hot constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a method for engineering a compressed space that represents the feasible solution space with fewer qubits than the original. Our approach includes a scalable technique for determining the unitary transformation between the compressed and original spaces on gate-based quantum computers. We then propose compressed space QAOA, which seeks near-optimal solutions within this reduced space while utilizing the Ising model formulated in the original Hilbert space. Experimental results on a quantum simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in solving various constrained COPs.

TI Single-qubit gates beyond the rotating-wave approximation for strongly
   anharmonic low-frequency qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In many quantum platforms, single-qubit gates are applied using a linear drive resonant with the qubit transition frequency, which is often theoretically described within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). However, for fast gates on low-frequency qubits, the RWA may not hold and we need to consider the contribution from counterrotating terms to the qubit dynamics. The inclusion of counterrotating terms into the theoretical description gives rise to two challenges. First, it becomes challenging to analytically calculate the time evolution as the Hamiltonian is no longer self-commuting. Moreover, the time evolution now depends on the carrier phase such that, in general, every operation in a sequence of gates is different. In this work, we derive and verify a correction to the drive pulses that minimizes the effect of these counterrotating terms in a two-level system. We then derive a second correction term that arises from noncomputational levels for a strongly anharmonic system. We experimentally implement these correction terms on a fluxonium superconducting qubit, which is an example of a strongly anharmonic, low-frequency qubit for which the RWA may not hold, and demonstrate how fast, high-fidelity single-qubit gates can be achieved without the need for additional hardware and calibration complexities.

TI Quasiparticle Poisoning of Superconducting Qubits with Active Gamma
   Irradiation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB When a high-energy particle, such as a gamma ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of gamma -ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a gamma -ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the gamma irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare these with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a gamma -ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.

TI Research on dynamic polarization control in continuous variable quantum
   key distribution systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In a commercial fiber-based quantum key distribution system, the local and signal optical fields are transmitted through long distance fibers by using time division multiplexing and polarization multiplexing. The state of polarization of the optical field is inevitably disturbed by random birefringence of the standard single-mode fiber caused by external complex environments. This drift of the state of polarization significantly affects the balanced homodyne detection results and the secret key rate. Therefore, the key technology of the dynamic polarization control unit is crucial for the system in a large-scale commercial application. We theoretically analyze and prove that the polarization control unit only needs the combination of two degrees of freedom when considering the result of an arbitrary polarization extinction ratio at the receiver of the system. To overcome the influence of polarization variations, we propose a chaotic monkey algorithm based on Bayesian parameter estimation method and implement intelligence algorithm on field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware under pulsed light with an integral-type detector for the dynamic polarization control unit. The simulation results show that the optimal combination is four degrees of freedom and the optimal prior distribution is an exponential distribution among various distributions in the dynamic polarization control unit. According to the simulation results, the experimental results show that the achieved polarization extinction ratio is over 30 dB and the average time of polarization control is 400 mu s for a single random polarization scrambling. By combining the dynamic polarization control unit with the system, we demonstrate the continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) under a continuous polarization scrambling scope of 0-2 krad/s and verify its effectiveness. In addition, the methods presented will improve the performance of the system and expand the range of applications even under strong external disturbance.

SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) offers higher information capacity and stronger resilience to noise compared with its binary counterpart. However, these advantages are often hindered by the difficulty of realizing the required high-dimensional measurements and transformations. Here, we implement a large-scale multi-plane light converter (MPLC) and program it as a high-dimensional mode sorter of spatial modes for QKD. Using the MPLC, we demonstrate five-dimensional QKD with six mutually unbiased bases and 25-dimensional QKD with two mutually unbiased bases in the same experimental setup. Furthermore, we propose a construction of pairs of mutually unbiased bases that are robust to experimental errors, with measurement complexity scaling only with the square root of the encoded dimension. This approach paves the way for QKD implementations in higher dimensions. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI QNet: A Scalable and Noise-Resilient Quantum Neural Network Architecture
   for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is promising for potential speedups and improvements in conventional machine learning (ML) tasks. Existing QML models that use deep parametric quantum circuits (PQC) suffer from a large accumulation of gate errors and decoherence. To circumvent this issue, we propose a new QML architecture called QNet. QNet consists of several small quantum neural networks (QNN). Each of these smaller QNN's can be executed on small quantum computers that dominate the NISQ-era machines. By carefully choosing the size of these QNN's, QNet can exploit arbitrary size quantum computers to solve supervised ML tasks of any scale. It also enables heterogeneous technology integration in a single QML application. Through empirical studies, we show the trainability and generalization of QNet and the impact of various configurable variables on its performance. We compare QNet performance against existing models and discuss potential issues and design considerations. In our study, we show 43% better accuracy on average over the existing models on noisy quantum hardware emulators. More importantly, QNet provides a blueprint to build noise-resilient QML models with a collection of small quantum neural networks with near-term noisy quantum devices.

TI QUANTUM CHEMISTRY AND QUANTUM NANOTECHNOLOGIES OF MATERIALS
SO EURASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Chemistry as a science about spin and electric charge of micro particles which provide driving forces of atomic interactions and molecular structure transformations fits pretty well to the modern Quantum Infor-mation Science (QIS) requirements. Today's computers operate only electric current signals in the semicon-ductor networks but the electron-spin properties are not exploited in a large extend. Spintronics provides spin-polarized currents and manipulates magnetic spin interactions; it uses mostly solid state chemistry of heavy elements. But a rich organic chemistry of solvents and fin films offers a great potential for molecular elec-tronics and quantum computing. Photo-excited organic complexes of the "chromophore-radical" type provide good promise for many technological applications in molecular spintronics and electronics, including QIS technology. The doublet state photo excitation of stable organic radical being delocalized onto the linked anthracene molecule within picoseconds and subsequently evolved into a quartet state for big radicals (a pure high spin state) of the mixed radical-triplet character presents a sensible spin-optical interface for qubit in quantum computing. This high-spin state is coherently addressable with EPR microwaves even at room tem-perature, with the optical read-out induced by intersystem crossing (ISC) to emissive triplet state. Such inte-gration of radical luminescence and high-spin states EPR provides the organic materials involvement into emerging QIS technologies.

TI Single-Shot Readout of a Driven Hybrid Qubit in a GaAs Double Quantum
   Dot
SO NANO LETTERS
AB We report a single-shot-based projective readout of a semiconductor hybrid qubit formed by three electrons in a GaAs double quantum dot. Voltage-controlled adiabatic transitions between the qubit operations and readout conditions allow high-fidelity mapping of quantum states. We show that a large ratio both in relaxation time vs tunneling time (approximate to 50) and singlet-triplet splitting vs thermal energy (approximate to 20) allows energy-selective tunneling-based spin-to-charge conversion with a readout visibility of approximate to 92.6%. Combined with ac driving, we demonstrate high visibility coherent Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a hybrid qubit in GaAs. Further, we discuss the generality of the method for use in other materials, including silicon.

TI Quantum squeezing in a nonlinear mechanical oscillator
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Mechanical degrees of freedom are natural candidates for continuous-variable quantum information processing and bosonic quantum simulations. However, these applications require the engineering of squeezing and nonlinearities in the quantum regime. Here we demonstrate squeezing below the zero-point fluctuations of a gigahertz-frequency mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit. This is achieved by parametrically driving the qubit, which results in an effective two-phonon drive. In addition, we show that the resonator mode inherits a nonlinearity from the off-resonant coupling with the qubit, which can be tuned by controlling the detuning. We, thus, realize a mechanical squeezed Kerr oscillator, in which we demonstrate the preparation of non-Gaussian quantum states of motion with Wigner function negativities and high quantum Fisher information. This shows that our results can also have applications in quantum metrology and sensing.
   Mechanical modes promise applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing, but only if the final two elements-squeezing and nonlinearity-are achieved. Experiments with an oscillator coupled to a transmon qubit now achieve this.

TI Long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution with standard
   optics tools
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key exchange between remote parties without any assumptions on the internal workings of the devices used for its implementation. However, its practical deployment remains severely constrained by the need for loophole-free Bell inequality violations, which are highly susceptible to losses and detection efficiencies. In this paper, we propose two longdistance DI-QKD protocols based on a heralding scheme using single-photon interference. Our protocols consist of only standard quantum optics tools such as two-mode squeezed states, displacement operations, and on-off detectors, making them experimentally accessible. To further enhance robustness against realistic imperfections, we integrate a classical noisy preprocessing technique during post-processing. We calculate key rates of the protocols by numerical optimization and show the supremacy of this implementation over existing protocols in terms of communication distances.

TI Efficient security analysis for quantum key distribution against
   side-channel leakage
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the transmission of keys with unconditional security. Nevertheless, a discrepancy remains between the theoretical framework and the practical implementation, as device imperfections are frequently neglected in most QKD protocols. Some previous works proposed to use Hong-Ou-Mandel interference to quantify information leakage from side-channels. However, the security bound was relatively loose, resulting in poor performance. In this paper, we present an improved method for the security analysis of practical QKD protocols and provide a more precise parameter estimation. Furthermore, we apply it to several important QKD protocols, including BB84, measurement-device-independent, and twin-field, and carry out corresponding numerical simulations. Our work demonstrates significant improvements in both the key rate and the transmission distance compared to previous methods, representing a crucial step towards the practical implementation of QKD.

TI Verification of colorable hypergraph states with stabilizer test
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Many-body quantum states, as a matter of fact, are extremely essential to solve certain mathematical problems or simulate quantum systems in measurement-based quantum computation. However, how to verify large-scale quantum states, such as hypergraph states, is an exceedingly hard task for many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a novel fault-tolerant solution for the verification of colorable hypergraph states by using the stabilizer test. Furthermore, our protocol is dramatically facilitated by making only Pauli-X and Pauli-Z measurements. For geometric structure hypergraph states, the computational complexity of our protocol is polynomial. As to appliance, it will be also applied to blind quantum computing based on the no-signaling principle.

TI Foiling zero-error attacks against coherent-one-way quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB To protect practical quantum key distribution (QKD) against photon-number-splitting attacks, one could measure the coherence of the received signals. One prominent example that follows this approach is coherentone-way (COW) QKD, which is commercially available. Surprisingly, however, it has been shown very recently that its secret key rate scales quadratically with the channel transmittance and thus this scheme is unsuitable for long-distance transmission. This result was derived by using a zero-error attack, which prevents the distribution of a secure key without introducing any error. Here we study various countermeasures to foil zero-error attacks against COW QKD. They require either monitoring some additional available detection statistics or increasing the number of quantum states emitted. We obtain asymptotic upper security bounds on the secret key rate that scale close to linearly with the channel transmittance, thus suggesting the effectiveness of the countermeasures to boost the performance of this protocol.

TI Photon echo, spectral hole burning, and optically detected magnetic
   resonance in 171Yb3+:LiNbO3 bulk
   crystal and waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent progress in the realization of high-quality optical resonators and waveguides along with the possibility to incorporate rare-earth ions, make lithium niobate a promising material to build integrated platforms for quantum information processing. 171Yb3+ is a particularly attractive system because it can show long coherence lifetimes at zero magnetic field thanks to transitions insensitive to magnetic field fluctuations. In this paper, we investigate the optical and spin properties of 171Yb3+ ions in LiNbO3 bulk crystals as well as implanted waveguides. Using hole-burning spectroscopy and optically detected magnetic resonance, we studied ground and excited state hyperfine structures and probed optical and spin spectral holes. Importantly, the hole linewidths suggest that part of the ions in the waveguides are in a similar environment as in the bulk sample. We furthermore characterized spin population relaxation and coherence lifetimes of 171Yb3+ ions in the bulk crystal at temperatures between 50 mK and 9 K. At low temperatures, T2 up to 9.5 ??s (34 kHz homogeneous linewidth) and spin relaxation rates as long as ???100 ms were measured. Our results show that 171Yb3+:LiNbO3 is a system that exhibits narrow optical homogeneous linewidths over a 50 GHz bandwidth together with an electron spin degree of freedom. This is of interest for a variety of applications in integrated quantum photonics such as quantum memories or quantum processors.

TI Enhanced quantum signal control and sensing under multicolored noise via
   generalized filter function framework
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The field of quantum control and sensing encounters challenges due to various forms of time-dependent noise. We introduce a generalized filter-function framework that treats noise coupling strength as a tunable control parameter, enabling target noise suppression across user-defined frequency bands. By optimizing this generalized filter function, we design band-selective control pulses that achieve high fidelity of single- and two-qubit gates under strong noise with diverse spectral profiles. We further extend the method to selectively enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for quantum sensing of AC signals with an enhanced precision of up to 12.58 dB. The resulting control pulses are experimentally feasible, offering a practical pathway toward robust quantum operations and high-precision sensing under spectrally complex noises.

TI Stark Tuning of Telecom Single-Photon Emitters Based on a Single
   Er3+
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The implementation of scalable quantum networks requires photons at the telecom band and long-lived spin coherence. The single Er3+ in solid-state hosts is an important candidate that fulfills these critical requirements simultaneously. However, to entangle distant Er3+ ions through photonic connections, the emission frequency of individual Er3+ in solid-state matrix must be the same, which is challenging because the emission frequency of Er3+ depends on its local environment. Herein, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the Stark tuning of the emission frequency of a single Er3+ in a Y2SiO5 crystal by employing electrodes interfaced with a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We obtain a Stark shift of 182.9 +/- 0.8 MHz, which is approximately 27 times of the optical emission linewidth, demonstrating promising applications in tuning the emission frequency of independent Er3+ into the same spectral channels. Our results provide a useful solution for construction of scalable quantum networks based on single Er3+ and a universal tool for tuning emission of individual rare-earth ions.

TI Practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution with composable
   security
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Continuous-variable QKD protocols are usually easier to implement than discrete-variables ones, but their security analyses are less developed. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate in the lab a CVQKD protocol that can generate composable keys secure against collective attacks.
   A quantum key distribution (QKD) system must fulfill the requirement of universal composability to ensure that any cryptographic application (using the QKD system) is also secure. Furthermore, the theoretical proof responsible for security analysis and key generation should cater to the number N of the distributed quantum states being finite in practice. Continuous-variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states, despite being a suitable candidate for integration in the telecom infrastructure, has so far been unable to demonstrate composability as existing proofs require a rather large N for successful key generation. Here we report a Gaussian-modulated coherent state CVQKD system that is able to overcome these challenges and can generate composable keys secure against collective attacks with N approximate to 2 x 10(8) coherent states. With this advance, possible due to improvements to the security proof and a fast, yet low-noise and highly stable system operation, CVQKD implementations take a significant step towards their discrete-variable counterparts in practicality, performance, and security.

TI Quantum computing and preconditioners for hydrological linear systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Modeling hydrological fracture networks is a hallmark challenge in computational earth sciences. Accurately predicting critical features of fracture systems, e.g. percolation, can require solving large linear systems far beyond current or future high performance capabilities. Quantum computers can theoretically bypass the memory and speed constraints faced by classical approaches, however several technical issues must first be addressed. Chief amongst these difficulties is that such systems are often ill-conditioned, i.e. small changes in the system can produce large changes in the solution, which can slow down the performance of linear solving algorithms. We test several existing quantum techniques to improve the condition number, but find they are insufficient. We then introduce the from O(N) to O(root N) and admits a quantum implementation. These results are a critical first step in inverse Laplacian preconditioner, which improves the scaling of the condition number of the system developing a quantum solver for fracture systems, both advancing the state of hydrological modeling and providing a novel real-world application for quantum linear systems algorithms.

TI Experimental measurement-device-independent type quantum key
   distribution with flawed and correlated sources
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is severely threatened by discrepancies between realistic devices and theoretical assumptions. Recently, a significant framework called the reference technique was proposed to provide security against arbitrary source flaws under current technology such as state preparation flaws, side channels caused by mode dependencies, the Trojan horse attacks and pulse correlations. Here, we adopt the reference technique to prove security of an efficient four-phase measurement-device-independent QKD using laser pulses against potential source imperfections. We present a characterization of source flaws and connect them to experiments, together with a finite-key analysis against coherent attacks. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol through a proof-of-principle experimental implementation and achieve a secure key rate of 253 bps with a 20 dB channel loss. Compared with previous QKD protocols with imperfect devices, our study considerably improves both the secure key rate and the transmission distance, and shows application potential in the practical deployment of secure QKD with device imperfections.

TI Keep it secret, keep it safe: teaching quantum key distribution in high
   school
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cryptography protocol based on the fundamental principles of quantum physics (QP). Teaching this subject does not require extensive knowledge beyond these principles, making it suitable for inclusion in high school (HS) curricula. Despite its relevance, teaching QKD in HS is yet understudied. In this study, we collected responses from 12th-grade students from various schools that adopted and applied the Discipline-Culture vision of the physics curriculum. We assessed their understanding through conceptual and quantitative problems and examined their attitudes regarding the motivation to study this subject. We analyzed the responses using content analysis, identifying the challenges and affordances of teaching QKD. The challenges faced by students have been categorized into three themes: difficulties with QP, difficulties with the QKD protocol, and difficulties with the mathematics involved in this context. Despite these challenges, we found that teaching QKD reinforces students' conceptual understanding of QP concepts and problem-solving skills. This work enhances educators' ability to address the challenges of teaching QP and suggests that teaching QKD in HS strengthens students' motivation to study QP.

TI Spatially Resolving Electron Spin Resonance of π-Radical in
   Single-molecule Magnet
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The spintronic properties of magnetic molecules have attracted significant scientific attention. Special emphasis has been placed on the qubit for quantum information processing. The singleof the best examined cases in which the delocalized pi-radical electron spin of the Pc ligand plays the key role in reading and intermediating the localized Tb spin qubits. We utilized the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique implemented on a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and use it to measure local the ESR of a single TbPc2 molecule decoupled from the Cu(100) substrate by a two-monolayer NaCl film to identify the pi-radical spin. We detected the ESR signal at the ligand positions under the resonance condition expected for an S = 1/2 spin. The results reveal that the pi-radical electron is delocalized within the ligands and exhibits intramolecular coupling susceptible to the chemical environment.

TI Multi-qubit dynamical decoupling for enhanced crosstalk suppression
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Dynamical decoupling (DD) is one of the simplest error suppression methods, aiming to enhance the coherence of qubits in open quantum systems. Moreover, DD has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing coherent crosstalk, one major error source in near-term quantum hardware, which manifests from two types of interactions. Static crosstalk exists in various hardware platforms, including superconductor and semiconductor qubits, by virtue of always-on qubit-qubit coupling. Additionally, driven crosstalk may occur as an unwanted drive term due to leakage from driven gates on other qubits. Here we explore a novel staggered DD protocol tailored for multi-qubit systems that suppresses the decoherence error and both types of coherent crosstalk. We develop two experimental setups-an 'idle-idle' experiment in which two pairs of qubits undergo free evolution simultaneously and a 'driven-idle' experiment in which one pair is continuously driven during the free evolution of the other pair. These experiments are performed on an IBM Quantum superconducting processor and demonstrate the significant impact of the staggered DD protocol in suppressing both types of coherent crosstalk. When compared to the standard DD sequences from state-of-the-art methodologies with the application of X2 sequences, our staggered DD protocol enhances circuit fidelity by 19.7% and 8.5%, respectively, in addressing these two crosstalk types.

TI Practical quantum multiparty signatures using quantum-key-distribution
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Digital signatures are widely used for providing security of communications. At the same time, the security of currently deployed digital signature protocols is based on unproven computational assumptions. An efficient way to ensure an unconditional (information-theoretic) security of communication is to use quantum key distribution (QKD), whose security is based on laws of quantum mechanics. In this work we develop an unconditionally secure signature scheme that guarantees authenticity and transferability of arbitrary length messages in a QKD network. In the proposed setup, the QKD network consists of two subnetworks: (i) an internal network that includes the signer and with limitation on the number of malicious nodes and (ii) an external network that has no assumptions on the number of malicious nodes. A consequence of the absence of the trust assumption in the external subnetwork is the necessity of assistance from internal subnetwork recipients for the verification of message-signature pairs by external subnetwork recipients. We provide a comprehensive security analysis of the developed scheme, perform an optimization of the scheme parameters with respect to the secret key consumption, and demonstrate that the developed scheme is compatible with the capabilities of currently available QKD devices.

TI Statistical mechanical models for quantum codes with correlated noise
SO ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE D
AB We give a broad generalisation of the mapping, originally due to Dennis, Kitaev, Landahl, and Preskill, from quantum error correcting codes to statistical mechanical models. We show how the mapping can be extended to arbitrary stabiliser or subsystem codes subject to correlated Pauli noise models, including models of fault tolerance. This mapping connects the error correction threshold of the quantum code to a phase transition in the statistical mechanical model. Thus, any existing method for finding phase transitions, such as Monte Carlo simulations, can be applied to approximate the threshold of any such code, without having to perform optimal decoding. By way of example, we numerically study the threshold of the surface code under mildly correlated bit-flip noise, showing that noise with bunching correlations causes the threshold to drop to p(corr) = 10.04(6)%, from its known iid value of p(iid) = 10.917(3)%. Complementing this, we show that the mapping also allows us to utilise any algorithm which can calculate/approximate partition functions of classical statistical mechanical models to perform optimal/approximately optimal decoding. Specifically, for 2D codes subject to locally correlated noise, we give a linear-time tensor network-based algorithm for approximate optimal decoding which extends the MPS decoder of Bravyi, Suchara and Vargo.

TI Hole-type superconducting gatemon qubit based on Ge/Si core/shell
   nanowires
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We demonstrate that superconducting gatemon qubits based on superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junctions can be constructed on hole-type Ge/Si core/shell nanowires. The frequency of the qubit can be set firstly by controlling the diffusion of Al in the nanowire via thermal annealing, which yields a suitable critical supercurrent allowing the qubit frequency to be within the experimentally accessible range, and then by fine tuning of a gate voltage, by which an accurate adjustment of the frequency can be realized. On the resulted qubit, Rabi oscillation with an energy relaxation time T-1 similar to 180 ns was observed in the time domain, an average decoherence time T'(2) similar to 15 ns was obtained, and the gate voltage dependence of both T-1 and T'(2) was investigated. Such a hole-type superconducting gatemon qubit, based on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and potentially the absence of hyperfine interaction after isotope purification, could be used for exploring the quantum coherence phenomena of hole-gas and even Majorana physics in Ge-based quantum devices.

TI Quantum information geometry of driven CFTs
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Driven quantum systems exhibit a large variety of interesting and sometimes exotic phenomena. Of particular interest are driven conformal field theories (CFTs) which describe quantum many-body systems at criticality. In this paper, we develop both a spacetime and a quantum information geometry perspective on driven 2d CFTs. We show that for a large class of driving protocols the theories admit an alternative but equivalent formulation in terms of a CFT defined on a spacetime with a time-dependent metric. We prove this equivalence both in the operator formulation as well as in the path integral description of the theory. A complementary quantum information geometric perspective for driven 2d CFTs employs the so-called Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori (BKM) metric, which is the counterpart of the Fisher metric of classical information theory, and which is obtained from a perturbative expansion of relative entropy. We compute the BKM metric for the universal sector of Virasoro excitations of a thermal state, which captures a large class of driving protocols, and find it to be a useful tool to classify and characterize different types of driving. For Mobius driving by the SL(2, Double-struck capital R) subgroup, the BKM metric becomes the hyperbolic metric on the disk. We show how the non-trivial dynamics of Floquet driven CFTs is encoded in the BKM geometry via Mobius transformations. This allows us to identify ergodic and non-ergodic regimes in the driving. We also explain how holographic driven CFTs are dual to driven BTZ black holes with evolving horizons. The deformation of the black hole horizon towards and away from the asymptotic boundary provides a holographic understanding of heating and cooling in Floquet CFTs.

TI A nonlinear journey from structural phase transitions to quantum
   annealing
SO CHAOS
AB Motivated by an exact mapping between equilibrium properties of a one-dimensional chain of quantum Ising spins in a transverse field (the transverse field Ising (TFI) model) and a two-dimensional classical array of particles in double-well potentials (the "phi(4) model") with weak inter-chain coupling, we explore connections between the driven variants of the two systems. We argue that coupling between the fundamental topological solitary waves in the form of kinks between neighboring chains in the classical phi(4) system is the analog of the competing effect of the transverse field on spin flips in the quantum TFI model. As an example application, we mimic simplified measurement protocols in a closed quantum model system by studying the classical phi(4) model subjected to periodic perturbations. This reveals memory/loss of memory and coherence/decoherence regimes, whose quantum analogs are essential in annealing phenomena. In particular, we examine regimes where the topological excitations control the thermal equilibration following perturbations. This paves the way for further explorations of the analogy between lower-dimensional linear quantum and higher-dimensional classical nonlinear systems.

TI Weak Randomness Analysis of Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution with Finite Resources
SO PHOTONICS
AB The ideal quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol requires perfect random numbers for bit encoding and basis selecting. Perfect randomness is of great significance to the practical QKD system. However, due to the imperfection of practical quantum devices, an eavesdropper (Eve) may acquire some random numbers, thus affecting the security of practical systems. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the weak randomness in the measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) with finite resources. We analytically derive concise formulas for estimating the lower bound of the single-photon yield and the upper bound of the phase error rate in the case of the weak randomness. The simulation demonstrates that the final secret key rate of MDI-QKD with finite resources is sensitive to state preparation, even with a small proportion of weak randomness, the secure key rate has a noticeable fluctuation. Therefore, the weak randomness of the state preparation may bring additional security risks. In order to ensure the practical security of the QKD system, we are supposed to strengthen the protection of state preparation devices.

TI Quantum generative learning for high-resolution medical image generation
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Integration of quantum computing in generative machine learning models has the potential to offer benefits such as training speed-up and superior feature extraction. However, the existing quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) fail to generate high-quality images due to their patch-based, pixel-wise learning approaches. These methods capture only local details, ignoring the global structure and semantic information of images. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a quantum image generative learning (QIGL) approach for high-quality medical image generation. Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples. Through a systematic set of simulations on x-ray images from knee osteoarthritis and medical MNIST datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Fr & eacute;chet inception distance scores compared to its classical counterpart and advanced QGAN models reported in the literature.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution with asymmetric CHSH
   inequalities
SO QUANTUM
AB The simplest device-independent quantum key distribution protocol is based on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality and allows two users, Alice and Bob, to generate a secret key if they observe sufficiently strong correlations. There is, however, a mismatch between the protocol, in which only one of Alice's measurements is used to generate the key, and the CHSH expression, which is symmetric with respect to Alice's two measurements. We therefore investigate the impact of using an extended family of Bell expressions where we give different weights to Alice's measurements. Using this family of asymmetric Bell expressions improves the robustness of the key distribution protocol for certain experimentally-relevant correlations. As an example, the tolerable error rate improves from 7.15% to about 7.42% for the depolarising channel. Adding random noise to Alice's key before the postprocessing pushes the threshold further to more than 8.34%. The main technical result of our work is a tight bound on the von Neumann entropy of one of Alice's measurement outcomes conditioned on a quantum eavesdropper for the family of asymmetric CHSH expressions we consider and allowing for an arbitrary amount of noise preprocessing.

The platform boasts an intuitive interface, powerful visualisation, and compatibility with high-performance computation for effective testing and optimisation of complex quantum algorithms or ideas across a range of quantum computing hardware. We create and explore five families of VQDs corresponding to trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy-centres, neutral atom arrays, silicon quantum dot spins, and superconducting devices. Each is highly configurable through a set of tailored parameters. We showcase the key characteristics of each virtual device, providing practical examples of the tool's usefulness and highlighting each device's specific attributes. By offering user-friendly encapsulated descriptions of diverse quantum hardware, the VQD platform offers researchers the ability to rapidly explore algorithms and protocols in a realistic setting; meanwhile hardware experts can create their own VQDs to compare with their experiments.

TI Interactive simulation of quantum key distribution protocols and
   application in Wi-Fi networks
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB Key distribution allows two parties to produce and share a random secret key, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages with symmetric cryptosystems. Thus, this is often considered the most fundamental cryptographic primitive of secret communications, especially in wireless networks. While the traditional method is based on the assumption about the hardness of some mathematical problem, the quantum key distribution (QKD) involves quantum mechanical components and can be considered unconditionally secure. This paper presents an implementation of the two QKD protocols known as E91 and B92, which includes an intuitive class structure representing the different relationships between the two collaborating entities in the simulated communication. In addition, this implementation made it possible to deepen the study and comparison of both algorithms. The main details of the implementation are described here, together with some conclusions obtained from the research carried out on its functionalities, illustrated in colorful heat maps. This work also includes a preliminary analysis of the potential of the application of these QKD protocols for their hybrid application in Wi-Fi networks based on the IEEE 802.11 standard.

AB Ion-exchanged glass as a platform for quantum photonics is proposed. Quantum projectors are implemented with integrated optical directional couplers fabricated by ion-exchange K+/Na+ in soda-lime glass. We consider devices composed of concatenated directional couplers which implement N-dimensional quantum projective measurements, and concomitantly the production of 1-qudit states. The fundamental units of these devices are 2 x 2 directional couplers that are experimentally studied in order to obtain, through an optical characterization, empiric relationships between fabrication and optical parameters of such couplers. Likewise, a two-dimensional quantum projector is demonstrated so that projective measurements are obtained for the states of bases X (diagonal) and Y (circular).

TI Realization of a discrete time crystal on 57 qubits of a quantum
   computer
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Unconventional dynamical phases that violate ergodicity have been a subject of extensive research in recent years. A periodically driven system is naively expected to lose all memory of its initial state due to thermalization, yet this can be avoided in the presence of many-body localization. A discrete time crystal represents a driven system whose local observables spontaneously break time translation symmetry and retain memory of the initial state indefinitely. Here, we report the observation of a discrete time crystal on a chain consisting of 57 superconducting qubits on a state-of-the-art quantum computer. We probe random initial states and compare the cases of vanishing and finite disorder to distinguish many-body localization from prethermal dynamics. We further report results on the dynamical phase transition between the discrete time crystal and a thermal regime, which is observed via critical fluctuations in the system's subharmonic frequency response and a substantial speedup of spin depolarization.

TI Symmetries and Geometries of Qubits, and Their Uses
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The symmetry SU(2) and its geometric Bloch Sphere rendering have been successfully applied to the study of a single qubit (spin-1/2); however, the extension of such symmetries and geometries to multiple qubits-even just two-has been investigated far less, despite the centrality of such systems for quantum information processes. In the last two decades, two different approaches, with independent starting points and motivations, have been combined for this purpose. One approach has been to develop the unitary time evolution of two or more qubits in order to study quantum correlations; by exploiting the relevant Lie algebras and, especially, sub-algebras of the Hamiltonians involved, researchers have arrived at connections to finite projective geometries and combinatorial designs. Independently, geometers, by studying projective ring lines and associated finite geometries, have come to parallel conclusions. This review brings together the Lie-algebraic/group-representation perspective of quantum physics and the geometric-algebraic one, as well as their connections to complex quaternions. Altogether, this may be seen as further development of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program for symmetries and geometries. In particular, the fifteen generators of the continuous SU(4) Lie group for two qubits can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with finite projective geometries, combinatorial Steiner designs, and finite quaternionic groups. The very different perspectives that we consider may provide further insight into quantum information problems. Extensions are considered for multiple qubits, as well as higher-spin or higher-dimensional qudits.

TI Impact of transmitter imbalances on the security of continuous variables
   quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) provides a theoretical unconditionally secure solution to distribute symmetric keys among users in a communication network. However, the practical devices used to implement these systems are intrinsically imperfect, and, as a result, open the door to eavesdropper attacks. In this work, we study the impact of transmitter stage imperfections on the performance and security of a Discrete Modulated (DM) CV-QKD system using M-symbol Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) and Amplitude and Phase Shift Keying (M-APSK) coupled with Probabilistic Constellation Shaping (PCS). Assuming two different modulation stage topologies, we first deform the constellations and then evaluate the secure key rate achievable with the deformed constellation. The presented results show that, due to the erroneously estimated channel parameters, non-monitored imbalances greatly reduce the system's performance, with situations where Bob and Alice estimate that no secure bits can be obtained while the real value of the key rate is still positive. Our results show the importance of monitoring these constellation imbalances and show that the optimal constellation may vary depending on the degree of device imperfection.

TI Experimental study on underwater continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution with discrete modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of an underwater continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system based on four-state protocol, which is promising to guarantee the unconditionally secure underwater wireless optical communication. CV-QKD parameter estimation is performed after transmitting quantum coherent signal from Alice to Bob through a water tank. The secure key rate under collective attack of the demonstrated CV-QKD system is estimated as 22.9 kbits/s at a channel loss of 12.4 dB. In addition, the performance is also investigated with various water types and the maximum underwater transmission distance of the demonstrated CV-QKD system is estimated as 148.7 m in the pure sea water.

TI Machine Learning-Assisted Measurement Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution on Reference Frame Calibration
SO ENTROPY
AB In most of the realistic measurement device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) systems, efficient, real-time feedback controls are required to maintain system stability when facing disturbance from either external environment or imperfect internal components. Traditionally, people either use a "scanning-and-transmitting " program or insert an extra device to make a phase reference frame calibration for a stable high-visibility interference, resulting in higher system complexity and lower transmission efficiency. In this work, we build a machine learning-assisted MDI-QKD system, where a machine learning model-the long short-term memory (LSTM) network-is for the first time to apply onto the MDI-QKD system for reference frame calibrations. In this machine learning-assisted MDI-QKD system, one can predict out the phase drift between the two users in advance, and actively perform real-time phase compensations, dramatically increasing the key transmission efficiency. Furthermore, we carry out corresponding experimental demonstration over 100 km and 250 km commercial standard single-mode fibers, verifying the effectiveness of the approach.

TI Quantum Microwave Radiometry with a Superconducting Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The interaction of photons and coherent quantum systems can be employed to detect electromagnetic radiation with remarkable sensitivity. We introduce a quantum radiometer based on the photon-induced dephasing process of a superconducting qubit for sensing microwave radiation at the subunit photon level. Using this radiometer, we demonstrate the radiative cooling of a 1 K microwave resonator and measure its mode temperature with an uncertainty similar to 0.01 K. We thus develop a precise tool for studying the thermodynamics of quantum microwave circuits, which provides new solutions for calibrating hybrid quantum systems and detecting candidate particles for dark matter.

TI Optimized topological quantum compilation of three-qubit controlled
   gates in the Fibonacci anyon model: A controlled-injection approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A method, termed controlled injection, is proposed for compiling three-qubit controlled gates within the non-Abelian Fibonacci anyon model. Building on single-qubit compilation techniques with three Fibonacci anyons, the approach showcases enhanced accuracy and reduced braid length compared to the conventional decomposition method for the controlled three-qubit gates. This method necessitates only four two-qubit gates for decomposition, a notable reduction from the conventional five. In conjunction, the study introduces a class of controlled three-qubit gates and conducts a numerical simulation of the topological iToffoli gate to validate the approach. In addition, we propose an optimization method for single-qubit gate approximation using algebraic relations and numerical methods, including distributed computing.

TI Spin environment of a superconducting qubit in high magnetic fields
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.

TI Using gradient-based algorithms to determine ground-state energies on a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational algorithms are promising candidates to be implemented on near-term quantum computers. In our work, we investigate the variational Hamiltonian ansatz (VHA), where a parametrized trial state of the quantum mechanical wave function is optimized to obtain the ground-state energy. In the VHA, the trial state is given by a noninteracting reference state modified by unitary rotations using generators that are part of the Hamiltonian describing the system. The lowest energy is obtained by optimizing the angles of those unitary rotations. A standard procedure to optimize the variational parameters is to use gradient-based algorithms. However, shot noise and the intrinsic noise of the quantum device affect the evaluation of the required gradients. We study how different methods for obtaining the gradient, specifically the finite-difference and the parameter-shift rule, are affected by shot noise and the noise of the quantum computer. To this end, we simulate a simple quantum circuit, as well as the two-site and six-site Hubbard models.

TI Transmon-qubit readout using an in situ bifurcation
   amplification in the mesoscopic regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate a transmon-qubit readout based on the nonlinear response to a drive of polaritonic meters in situ coupled to the qubit. Inside a three-dimensional readout cavity, we place a transmon molecule consisting of a transmon qubit and an ancilla mode interacting via nonperturbative cross-Kerr-coupling. The cavity couples strongly only to the ancilla mode, leading to hybridized lower and upper polaritonic meters. Both polaritons are anharmonic and dissipative, as they inherit a self-Kerr nonlinearity U from the ancilla and effective decay kappa from the open cavity. Via the ancilla, the polariton meters also inherit the nonperturbative cross-Kerr-coupling to the qubit. This results in a high qubit-dependent displacement 2 chi > kappa,U that can be read out via the cavity without causing Purcell decay. Moreover, the polariton meters, being nonlinear resonators, present bistability, and bifurcation behavior when the probing power increases. In this work, we focus on the bifurcation at low power in the few-photon regime, called the mesoscopic regime, which is accessible when the self-Kerr and decay rates of the polariton meter are similar, U similar to kappa. Capitalizing on a latching mechanism by bifurcation, the readout is sensitive to transmon-qubit relaxation error only in the first tens of nanoseconds. We thus report a single-shot fidelity of 98.6% while having an integration time of 500 ns and no requirement for an external quantum-limited amplifier.

TI Surface code design for asymmetric error channels
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Surface codes are quantum error correcting codes typically defined on a 2D array of qubits. A [d(x), d(z)] surface code design is being introduced, where d(x)(d(z)) represents the distance of the code for bit (phase) error correction, motivated by the fact that the severity of bit flip and phase flip errors in the physical quantum system is asymmetric. We present pseudo-threshold and threshold values for the proposed surface code design for asymmetric error channels in the presence of various degrees of asymmetry of Pauli (X) over cap, (Y) over cap, and (Z) over cap errors in a depolarisation channel. We demonstrate that compared to symmetric surface codes, our asymmetric surface codes can provide almost double the pseudo-threshold rates while requiring less than half the number of physical qubits in the presence of increasing asymmetry in the error channel. Our results show that for low degree of asymmetry, it is advantageous to increase d(x) along with d(z). However, as the asymmetry of the channel increases, higher pseudo-threshold is obtained with increasing d(z) when d(x) is kept constant at a low value. Additionally, we also show that the advantage in the pseudo-threshold rates begins to saturate for any possible degree of asymmetry in the error channel as the surface code asymmetry is continued to be increased.

TI Effects of experimental impairments on the security of
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO HELIYON
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cutting-edge communication method that enables secure communication between two parties. Continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) is a promising approach to QKD that has several advantages over traditional discrete-variable systems. Despite its potential, CV-QKD systems are highly sensitive to optical and electronic component impairments, which can significantly reduce the secret key rate. In this research, we address this challenge by modeling a CV-QKD system to simulate the impact of individual impairments on the secret key rate. The results show that laser frequency drifts and small imperfections in electro-optical devices such as the beam splitter and the balanced detector have a negative impact on the secret key rate. This provides valuable insights into strategies for optimizing the performance of CV-QKD systems and overcome limitations caused by component impairments. By offering a method to analyze them, the study enables the establishment of quality standards for the components of CV-QKD systems, driving the development of advanced technologies for secure communication in the future.

TI Quantum similarity learning for anomaly detection
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Anomaly detection is a vital technique for exploring signatures of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The vast number of collisions generated by the LHC demands sophisticated deep learning techniques. Similarity learning, a self-supervised machine learning, detects anomalous signals by estimating their similarity to background events. In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computers for anomaly detection through similarity learning, leveraging the power of quantum computing to enhance the known similarity learning method. In the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we employ a hybrid classical-quantum network to search for heavy scalar resonances in the di-Higgs production channel. In the absence of quantum noise, the hybrid network demonstrates improvement over the known similarity learning method. Moreover, we employ a clustering algorithm to reduce measurement noise from limited shot counts, resulting in 9% improvement in the hybrid network performance. Our analysis highlights the applicability of quantum algorithms for LHC data analysis, where improvements are anticipated with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Multi-Qubit Bose-Einstein Condensate Trap for Atomic Boson Sampling
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a multi-qubit Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) trap as a platform for studies of quantum statistical phenomena in many-body interacting systems. In particular, it could facilitate testing atomic boson sampling of the excited-state occupations and its quantum advantage over classical computing in a full, controllable and clear way. Contrary to a linear interferometer enabling Gaussian boson sampling of non-interacting non-equilibrium photons, the BEC trap platform pertains to an interacting equilibrium many-body system of atoms. We discuss a basic model and the main features of such a multi-qubit BEC trap.

TI Violation of Svetlichny's inequality in a system of spins j
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum multi-particle correlations are one of the most intriguing properties of quantum entanglement, arising from collective entangled states of multiple particles. Svetlichny's inequality (SI) was the first method proposed to test the existence of such correlations. Previous studies have primarily focused on 1/2-spin particle systems. In this paper, we present a unified scheme that enables the violation of SI in arbitrary non-zero spin particle systems. Specifically, for all fermion systems, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI for any number of particles. For boson systems, when the particle spin j >= 2, our scheme consistently realizes the violation of SI for any number of particles. When the particle spin j = 1, our scheme can yield SI violation for up to 7 particles. Furthermore, as the particle spin j approaches infinity, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI. To obtain these results, we also prove that the upper bound of Svetlichny's operator within the framework of local hidden variable theory is root 2N+1. These findings not only enhance our understanding of quantum correlations across various particle systems but also provide valuable insights for the development of quantum communication protocols that utilize entanglement and non-locality in multi-particle configurations.

TI iSWAP gate with polar molecules: Robustness criteria for entangling
   operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is, however, the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength-stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials-that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasistatic deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled-state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the adiabatic approximation, i.e., where molecular motion occurs on timescales comparable to, or faster, than that of the exchange interaction, the noise arising from thermal motion can be effectively treated as quasistatic variations of Hamiltonian parameters. This allows us to extend our treatment to the concrete experimental case of polar molecules.

TI Variational quantum simulation using non-Gaussian continuous-variable
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This work introduces an approach to quantum simulation by leveraging continuous-variable systems within a photonic hardware-inspired framework. The primary focus is on simulating static properties of the ground state of Hamiltonians associated with infinite-dimensional systems, such as those arising in quantum field theory. We present a continuous-variable variational quantum eigensolver compatible with state-of-the-art photonic technology. The framework we introduce allows us to compare discrete and continuous variable systems without introducing a truncation of the Hilbert space, opening the possibility to investigate the scenarios where one of the two formalisms performs better. We apply it to the study of static properties of the Bose-Hubbard model and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality, highlighting the potential of continuous-variable quantum simulations in addressing complex problems in quantum physics.

AB The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is one of the solid-state spin systems that can be manipulated as a qubit for quantum computing. However, scaling up the system to perform as a quantum register is challenging due to weak dipole interaction between two NV centers. On the other hand, C-13 nuclear spins that reside within the diamond lattice can be used as additional qubits for scaling up the system, as they have hyperfine interactions with the NV center electronic spin. In general, nuclear spins exhibit a longer coherence time compared to the electron spin due to the lower gyromagnetic ratio. Nevertheless, this weak interaction also makes it difficult to directly control the nuclear spin via RF transition. In this work, we demonstrated a scheme to control and observe the dynamics of nuclear spin with a hyperfine splitting of 6.5 MHz using an indirect pulse sequence that operated only the electron spin in absence of any RF signal. Our results reveal a nuclear spin free precession with a gyromagnetic ratio of 6.9 +/- 0.1 kHz/Gauss. Furthermore, one can observe the nuclear spin phase accumulation in electronic spin m(s) = -1 manifold and show the reduced contrast results from incomplete population transfer during the operation.

TI Entanglement model for mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Mode-pairing (MP) quantum key distribution (QKD) eliminates the requirements of phase locking and phase tracking compared with twin field (TF) QKD while still surpassing the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD. The complexity of the experimental implementation is reduced while the efficiency can still be guaranteed. In MP-QKD, two communication parties need to pair two effective rounds according to the announced results by the third party. Therefore it is not intuitive how to provide an entanglement protocol equivalent to the prepare-andmeasure protocol for proving security. At present, the security of MP-QKD is rigorously proven by examining the consistency of the states detailly between MP-QKD and the fixed-pairing scheme under all of Eve's possible interference to obtain the equivalence, and verifying the security of the latter. Here, we directly present an entanglement model for MP-QKD by proposing a free-pairing entanglement scheme that is equivalent to MPQKD. This entanglement model simplifies the security proof and provides a clearer insight into the foundation of MP-QKD. Besides, it could provide a theoretical framework for the comprehensive analysis of MP-QKD, such as facilitating practical security analysis. Additionally, we propose an optimized pairing strategy based on the entanglement model. The simulation results show an enhancement of 163% in pairing efficiency with a reasonable pairing interval 2 x 105.

TI Uncertainty principle of quantum processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which imposes intrinsic restrictions on our ability to predict the outcomes of incompatible quantum measurements to arbitrary precision, demonstrates one of the key differences between classical and quantum mechanics. The physical systems considered in the uncertainty principle are static in nature and described mathematically with a quantum state in a Hilbert space. However, many physical systems are dynamic in nature and described with the formalism of a quantum channel. In this paper, we show that the uncertainty principle can be reformulated to include process measurements that are performed on quantum channels. Since both the preparation of quantum states and the implementation of quantum measurements are themselves special cases of quantum channels, our formalism encapsulates the uncertainty principle in its utmost generality. More specifically, we obtain expressions that generalize the Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation and the universal uncertainty relations from quantum states to quantum channels.

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Based on Heralded Hybrid
   Linear Amplifier with a Local Local Oscillator
SO ENTROPY
AB An improved continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) approach based on a heralded hybrid linear amplifier (HLA) is proposed in this study, which includes an ideal deterministic linear amplifier and a probabilistic noiseless linear amplifier. The CVQKD, which is based on an amplifier, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and provides for fine control between high gain and strong noise reduction. We focus on the impact of two types of optical amplifiers on system performance: phase sensitive amplifiers (PSA) and phase insensitive amplifiers (PIA). The results indicate that employing amplifiers, local local oscillation-based CVQKD systems can enhance key rates and communication distances. In addition, the PIA-based CVQKD system has a broader application than the PSA-based system.

TI Quantum Coherence from a Few Incoherent Bosons
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An engineered hybrid interaction of a few incoherent bosons with a cooled discrete-level system may give rise to substantial quantum coherence, an essential resource with diverse applications for quantum technology. This is in contrast to the expected requirement of intense and coherent external drives in current technologies. Substituting such external drives with internal hybrid processes stimulated by mere thermal energy may then contribute to reduced energy consumption in observing and using quantum phenomena. This low-energy emergence of quantum coherence is then suitable for proof-of-principle exploration with recent experiments in platforms such as trapped ions and superconducting circuits.
   The emergence of quantum coherence in a single qubit from incoherent states, important for quantum technology, is a challenging task. Unitary qubit-oscillator dynamics is sufficient for large qubit coherence to emerge from incoherent states, over a wide variety of qubit-oscillator interactions even without deep strong coupling. Thermally driven nonlinear unitary dynamics, even including the free evolution, may substitute for strongly driven linearized dynamics for such tasks.image

TI Tailor-made unitary operations using dielectric metasurfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Qubit operation belonging to unitary transformation is the fundamental operation to realize quantum computing and information processing. Here, we show that the complex and flexible light-matter interaction between dielectric metasurfaces and incident light can be used to perform arbitrary U(2) operations. By incorporating both coherent spatial-mode operation together with two polarizations on a single metasurface, we further extend the discussion to single-photon two-qubit U(4) operations. We believe the efficient usage of metasurfaces as a potential compact platform can simplify optical qubit operation from bulky systems into conceptually subwavelength elements.

To leverage the properties of this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and real-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art technique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.

TI Differential phase encoded measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We present a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) using single photons in a linear superposition of three orthogonal time-bin states, for generating the key. The orthogonal states correspond to three distinct paths in the delay line interferometers used by two (trusted) sources. The key information is decoded based on the measurement outcomes obtained by an untrusted third party Charles, who uses a beamsplitter to measure the phase difference between pulses traveling through different paths of the two delay lines. The proposed scheme combines the best of both differential-phase-shift (DPS) QKD and MDI-QKD. It is more robust against phase fluctuations, and also ensures protection against detector side-channel attacks. We prove unconditional security by demonstrating an equivalent protocol involving shared entanglement between the two trusted parties. We show that the secure key rate for our protocol compares well to existing protocols in the asymptotic regime. For the decoy-state variant of our protocol, we evaluate the secure key rate by using a phase-post-selection technique. Finally, we estimate the bit error rate and the phase error rate, in the finite key regime.

TI Coexistence of quantum key distribution and optical communication with
   amplifiers over multicore fiber
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB In this paper, the influence of classical signals on quantum key distribution (QKD) is studied over multi-core fiber (MCF) when optical amplifiers exist. Firstly, the long-distance simultaneous transmission architectures of QKD and classical signals are proposed based on advanced asymmetric sending or not sending QKD (SNS-QKD) and classical Bennett-Brassard 1984-QKD (BB84-QKD), and the segment length between optical amplifiers can be adjusted according to requirement. Then, theoretical models of spontaneous Raman scattering noise and four-wave mixing noise are established based on the proposed architectures. Next, the calculation models of the secure key rate under the influence of noises from classical signals are derived. Finally, the experimental results show that the theoretical models match well with the experimental photons, and the maximum difference between experimental and simulated noise photons is less than 2.6 dB. Simulation results show that the performance of asymmetric SNS-QKD is better than that of BB84-QKD architecture when classical signals and quantum signals are transmitted in different cores of MCF.

TI Towards determining the (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
   running coupling with Monte Carlo and quantum computing methods
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The solution of strongly-interacting quantum field theories remains a major challenge in theoretical physics, often requiring numerical solutions. A first-principles approach in this direction is the lattice formulation, where spacetime is approximated with a finite grid. In this work, we examine the case of a compact pure-gauge U(1) lattice gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions, presenting a strategy to determine the running coupling of the theory and extracting the non-perturbative Lambda-parameter. This is achieved by combining Monte Carlo simulations and quantum computing techniques, matching the expectation value of the plaquette operator. We also present results for the static potential and static force, which can be related to the renormalized coupling. The outlined procedure can be extended to other Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter fields, and might provide a way towards studying lattice quantum chromodynamics utilizing both quantum and classical methods.

TI Quantum Sensing of Lanthandie Binding Tags with Relaxometer of NV Center

SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) stand out as a prominent group of fluorescent probes that are extensively utilized in biological detection. However, research on LBTs has predominantly emphasized their fluorescence properties, which frequently compromised by background fluorescence noise. Investigating magnetic properties could optimize detection methodologies that offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity. This study measures the response of a relaxometer based on ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to various amounts of LBTs with gadolinium ions, determining the detection limit of LBTs to be 25 fmol. A detection scheme employing the NV relaxometer to detect specific binding between LBTs and target is then proposed and demonstrated. Specifically, the study assesses the relaxometer's response to various concentrations of the interaction between the modified LBTs and Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-COVID-2 spike protein, with the detection threshold reaching approximate to 2 pmol. The research provides a potential application platform for biomarker detection under picomole concentration by using NV centers to detect the magnetism of LBTs.

TI Finite-size security proof of binary-modulation continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution using only heterodyne measurement
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has many practical advantages including compatibility with current optical communication technology. Implementation using heterodyne measurements is particularly attractive since it eliminates the need for active phase locking of the remote pair of local oscillators, but the full security of CV QKD with discrete modulation was only proved for a protocol using homodyne measurements. Here we propose an all-heterodyne CV-QKD protocol with binary modulation and prove its security against general attacks in the finite-key regime. Although replacing a homodyne measurement with a heterodyne measurement would be naively expected to incur a 3-dB penalty in the rate-distance curve, our proof achieves a key rate with only a 1-dB penalty.

TI Power-consumption back door in quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Over recent decades, quantum key distribution (QKD) has arisen as a promising solution for secure communications; however, like all cryptographic protocols, implementations of QKD can open security vulnerabilities. Until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has focused primarily on the optical channel. In classical cryptoanalysis, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis are powerful techniques that can be used to access secret information about the encryption key in symmetric-key algorithms. Such attacks have rarely been used in QKD, since they require an eavesdropper to have access to Alice's or Bob's setup; however, security proofs of QKD protocols generally assume that these setups are secure, making it crucial to understand the security measures required to ensure this protection. In this work, we propose and implement a power side-channel analysis of a QKD system by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. QKD modules typically require very precise electronic drivers, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Here, we show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation and consequently the transmitted key. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in predicting transmitted qubits at a 100-MHz repetition frequency. We also discuss possible countermeasures to prevent such an attack.

TI A generalizable TCAD framework for silicon FinFET spin qubit devices
   with electrical control
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB We present a TCAD-based simulation framework established for quantum dot spin qubits in a silicon FinFET platform with all-electrical control of the spin state. The framework works down to 1 K and consists of a two-step simulation chain, from definition of the quantum dot confinement potential with DC bias voltages, to calculation of microwave response electric field at qubit locations using small-signal AC analysis. An average field polarization vector at each quantum dot is extracted via a post-processing step. We demonstrate functionality of this approach by simulation of a recently reported two-qubit device in the form of a 5 -gate silicon FinFET. The impact of the number of holes in each quantum dot on the MW response E-field polarization direction is further investigated for this device. The framework is easily generalizable to study future multi-qubit large-scale systems.

TI Nanoscale quantum sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in nanodiamonds
   - A magnetic resonance perspective
SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY
AB Nanodiamonds containing fluorescent Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers are the smallest single particles, of which a magnetic resonance spectrum can be recorded at room temperature using optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). By recording spectral shift or changes in relaxation rates, various physical and chemical quantities can be measured such as the magnetic field, orientation, temperature, radical concentration, pH or even NMR. This turns NV-nanodiamonds into nanoscale quantum sensors, which can be read out by a sensitive fluorescence microscope equipped with an additional magnetic resonance upgrade. In this review, we introduce the field of ODMR spectroscopy of NV-nanodiamonds and how it can be used to sense different quantities. Thereby we highlight both, the pioneering contributions and the latest results (covered until 2021) with a focus on biological applications.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum computing quantum Monte Carlo with hybrid tensor network for
   electronic structure calculations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computers have a potential for solving quantum chemistry problems with higher accuracy than classical computers. Quantum computing quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) is a QMC with a trial state prepared in quantum circuit, which is employed to obtain the ground state with higher accuracy than QMC alone. We propose an algorithm combining QC-QMC with a hybrid tensor network to extend the applicability of QC-QMC beyond a single quantum device size. In a two-layer quantum-quantum tree tensor, our algorithm for the larger trial wave function can be executed than preparable wave function in a device. Our algorithm is evaluated on the Heisenberg chain model, graphite-based Hubbard model, hydrogen plane model, and MonoArylBiImidazole using full configuration interaction QMC. Our algorithm can achieve energy accuracy (specifically, variance) several orders of magnitude higher than QMC, and the hybrid tensor version of QMC gives the same energy accuracy as QC-QMC when the system is appropriately decomposed. Moreover, we develop a pseudo-Hadamard test technique that enables efficient overlap calculations between a trial wave function and an orthonormal basis state. In a real device experiment by using the technique, we obtained almost the same accuracy as the statevector simulator, indicating the noise robustness of our algorithm. These results suggests that the present approach will pave the way to electronic structure calculation for large systems with high accuracy on current quantum devices.

TI Impact-Ionization-Based High-Endurance One-Transistor Bulk CMOS
   Cryogenic Memory
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This paper presents a high-endurance capacitorless one-transistor (1T) cryogenic memory, fabricated in a 180 nm bulk CMOS technology, with a high memory window of (10(7) I-1/I-0 sense current ratio) and prolonged retention. The memory is enabled by the bistable I-D - V-G transistor characteristics due to impact ionization (II) at cryogenic temperatures (T < 30 K). Focusing on critical memory reliability parameters-switching time, endurance, and retention characteristics-we present write/erase speeds down to approximate to 45 ns at T < 10 K and cycling endurance surpassing 10(9) cycles while maintaining the I1 / I0 memory window. Retention times of >10 s with a 30x memory window were observed in extensive high-speed measurements. The fast switching and retention characteristics combine to yield a low power ( mu W-range) candidate for local cache memory to support quantum sensing or quantum computing control circuitry. Additionally, our study outlines essential measurements crucial for exploring the viability of alternative memory solutions for low-temperature quantum sensing and computation applications.

TI Tracing Information Flow from Open Quantum Systems
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Open quantum systems are highly relevant, both for practical applications as well as for fundamental questions about the nature of information and its transfer, encompassing for example decoherence and memory effects. Quantum mechanics introduces additional complexity to the transfer of information, e.g., storage of information in non-classical correlations. Yet, some of these aspects tend to be neglected by the usual framework of open system research. In this work, photons are used in a waveguide array to implement a quantum simulation of the coupling of a qubit with a low-dimensional discrete environment. Using the trace distance between quantum states as a measure of information, different types of information transfer are analyzed. Extending the usual perspective which is focused on the system alone, the presence of information is also investigated in the environment.

TI Quantum circuit optimization with AlphaTensor
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count optimization, that is, minimizing the number of T gates needed to implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship between optimizing the T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which substantially reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared without using gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating that it can save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.
   Ruiz and colleagues introduce AlphaTensor-Quantum, a deep reinforcement learning method for optimizing quantum circuits. It outperforms existing methods and is capable of finding the best human-designed solutions for relevant quantum computations in a fully automated way.

AB A remote phase sensing scheme is proposed, inspired by the high sensitivity of the entanglement produced by coherent multimode photon addition on the phase set in the remote heralding apparatus. By exploring the case of delocalized photon addition over two modes containing identical coherent states, the optimal observable to perform remote phase estimation from heralded quadrature measurements is derived. The technique is experimentally tested with calibration measurements and then used for estimating a remote phase with a sensitivity that is found to scale with the intensity of the local coherent states, which never interacted with the sample.

TI Secure and Scalable File Encryption for Cloud Systems via Distributed
   Integration of Quantum and Classical Cryptography
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We propose a secure and scalable file-encryption scheme for cloud systems by integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) within a distributed architecture. While prior studies have primarily focused on secure key exchange or authentication protocols (e.g., layered PQC-QKD key distribution), our scheme extends beyond key management by implementing a distributed encryption architecture that protects large-scale files through integrated PQC, QKD, and AES. To support high-throughput encryption, our proposed scheme partitions the target file into fixed-size subsets and distributes them across slave nodes, each performing parallel AES encryption using a locally reconstructed key from a PQC ciphertext. Each slave node receives a PQC ciphertext that encapsulates the AES key, along with a PQC secret key masked using QKD based on the BB84 protocol, both of which are centrally generated and managed by the master node for secure coordination. In addition, an encryption and transmission pipeline is designed to overlap I/O, encryption, and communication, thereby reducing idle time and improving resource utilization. The master node performs centralized decryption by collecting encrypted subsets, recovering the AES key, and executing decryption in parallel. Our evaluation using a real-world medical dataset shows that the proposed scheme achieves up to 2.37x speedup in end-to-end runtime and up to 8.11x speedup in encryption time over AES (Original). In addition to performance gains, our proposed scheme maintains low communication cost, stable CPU utilization across distributed nodes, and negligible overhead from quantum key management.

TI GBS-Assisted Quantum Unsupervised Machine Learning on a Universal
   Programmable Integrated Quantum Chip
SO RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning stands poised as a forefront application for near-term quantum devices, addressing scalability challenges posed by classical computers in handling large datasets. Gaussian boson sampling (GBS), an intricate quantum algorithm deemed computationally infeasible for classical counterparts, represents a substantial leap forward in computational tasks. However, to date, the benefits of GBS-assisted quantum unsupervised machine learning are not experimentally demonstrated. Here, we present the first experimental implementation of quantum unsupervised machine learning using the GBS protocol with a universal programmable integrated photonic chip. The experimental system contains 16 squeezing sources, a universal programmable unitary matrix network of 16 modes, and a multi-channel single-photon detector, producing substantial output data crucial for 2 typical types of unsupervised tasks: feature extraction and generative network. Compared to classical approaches, the study demonstrates quantum-enhanced capability in extracting complex features from high-dimensional spaces and improved performance in generating arbitrary curve points and reconstructing handwritten digit images. This work not only underscores the potential of GBS in expressing high-dimensional features but also charts a path toward practical implementations within scalable, dimension-enhanced quantum unsupervised machine learning frameworks. The quantum unsupervised machine learning paradigm, offering theoretical acceleration and reduced training parameters for high-dimensional datasets, shows significant promise for advancing real-world applications of quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Sensing of Free Radical Generation in Mitochondria of Human
   Keratinocytes during UVB Exposure
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is known to cause skin issues, such as dryness, aging, and even cancer. Among UV rays, UVB stands out for its ability to trigger problems within cells, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. Free radicals are implicated in these cellular responses, but they are challenging to measure due to their short lifetime and limited diffusion range. In our study, we used a quantum sensing technique (T1 relaxometry) involving fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) that change their optical properties in response to magnetic noise. This allowed us to monitor the free radical presence in real time. To measure radicals near mitochondria, we coated FNDs with antibodies, targeting mitochondrial protein voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (anti-VDAC2). Our findings revealed a dynamic rise in radical levels on the mitochondrial membrane as cells were exposed to UVB (3 J/cm2), with a significant increase observed after 17 min.

One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of O(N) with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.

TI Probing the Design Rules for Optimizing Electron Spin Relaxation in
   Densely Packed Triplet Media for Quantum Applications
SO ACS MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Quantum technologies using electron spins have the advantage of employing chemical qubit media with tunable properties. The principal objective of material engineers is to enhance photoexcited spin yields and quantum spin relaxation. In this study, we demonstrate a facile synthetic approach to control spin properties in charge-transfer cocrystals consisting of 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) and acetylated anthracene. We find that the extent and position of acetylation control the degree of charge-transfer and the optical band gap by modifying crystal packing and electronic structure. We further reveal that while the spin polarization of the triplet state is slightly reduced compared to prototypical Anthracene:TCNB, the phase memory (T m) and, for 9-acetylanthracene:TCNB spin-lattice relaxation (T 1) time, could be enhanced up to 2.4 times. Our findings are discussed in the context of quantum microwave amplifiers, known as masers, and show that acetylation could be a powerful tool for improving organic materials for quantum sensing applications.

We then provide families of paths and initial states for which we can determine whether there is pretty good state transfer based on the eigenvalue support of the initial state.

AB Quantum computers process information stored in quantum bits (qubits), which must be controlled and read out by a traditional electronic interface. Co-designing and cooptimizing such a quantum-classical complex system requires efficient simulators to emulate the qubits and their interaction with classical electronics. For spin-qubit readout, a single electron transistor (SET) is often employed. To build a toolset that can co-simulate the spin qubit system with the classical control and readout interface, a compact and efficient SET model is needed. This paper presents a new compact empirical SET model based on state-of-the-art SET measurement and extracted by a custom function-fitting python program. Within the target source-drain voltage range of +/- 1000 mu V, the model is accurate for circuit (SPICE) simulation. Furthermore, the empirical model is represented by a set of equations that enables instantaneous output response requiring a negligible simulation time. With this new SET model, a quantum-electronics co-simulator such as SPINE can now be enhanced to simulate the readout in addition to the control circuits of spin qubits, thus enabling the design of the complete integrated circuit (IC) required for large-scale quantum computers.

TI Dissipative state transfer and Maxwell's demon in single quantum
   trajectories: Excitation transfer between two noninteracting qubits via
   unbalanced dissipation rates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a protocol to transfer excitations between two noninteracting qubits via purely dissipative processes (i.e., in the Lindblad master equation there is no coherent interaction between the qubits). The fundamental ingredients are the presence of collective (i.e., nonlocal) dissipation and unbalanced local dissipation rates (the qubits dissipate at different rates). The resulting quantum trajectories show that the measurement back-action changes the system wave function and induces a passage of the excitation from one qubit to the other. While similar phenomena have been witnessed for a non-Markovian environment, here the dissipative quantum state transfer is induced by an update of the observer knowledge of the wave function in the presence of a Markovian (memoryless) environment-this is a single quantum trajectory effect. That is, a postselection of a jumpless trajectory allows a transfer even for a non-Markovian environment where no quantum jumps have taken place. Beyond single quantum trajectories and postselection, such an effect can be observed by histogramming the ratio of quantum jumps at different times along several realizations. By investigating the effect of the temperature in the presence of unbalanced local dissipation, we demonstrate that, if appropriately switched on and off, the collective dissipator can act as a Maxwell's demon. These effects are a generalized measure equivalent to the standard projective measure description of quantum teleportation and Maxwell's demon. They can be witnessed in state-of-the-art setups given the extreme experimental control in, e.g., superconducting qubits, Rydberg atoms, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution implemented with biphotons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a high-dimensional measurement device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol employing biphotons to encode information. We exploit the biphotons as qutrits to improve the tolerance to error rate. Qutrits have a larger quantum system; hence they carry more bits of classical information and have improved robustness against eavesdropping compared to qubits. Notably, our proposed protocol is independent of measurement devices, thus eliminating the possibility of side-channel attacks. Also, we employ the finite key analysis approach to study the performance of our proposed protocol under realistic conditions where finite resources are used. Furthermore, we simulated the secret key rate for the proposed protocol in terms of the transmission distance for different fixed amounts of signals. The results prove that this protocol achieves a considerable secret key rate for a moderate transmission distance of 90 km by using 10(16 )signals. Moreover, the expected secret key rate was simulated to examine our protocol's performance at various intrinsic error rate values, Q = (0.3%, 0.6%, 1%) caused by misalignment and instability due to the optical system. These results show that reasonable key rates are achieved with a minimum data size of about 10(14) signals which are realizable with the current technology. Thus, implementing MDI-QKD using finite resources while allowing intrinsic errors due to the optical system makes a giant step forward toward realizing practical QKD implementations.

TI Unveiling atom-photon quasi-bound states in hybrid plasmonic-photonic
   cavity
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Dissipation, often associated with plasmons, leads to decoherence and is generally considered fatal for quantum nonlinearities and entanglement. Counterintuitively, by introducing a dissipative plasmonic nanoantenna into a typical cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, we unveil the wide existence of the atom-photon quasi-bound state (qBS), a kind of exotic eigenstate with anomalously small decay, in the hybrid plasmonic-photonic cavity. To derive the analytical condition of atom-photon qBS, we formulate a quantized two-mode model of the local density of states by connecting the interacting uncoupled cavity modes to the macroscopic QED. With resonant plasmon-photon coupling, we showcase the single-atom qBS that improves the efficiency of single-photon generation over one order of magnitude; and the two-atom qBS that significantly enhances spontaneous entanglement generation compared with a bare photonic cavity. Notably, such single-atom and multi-atom qBS can be simultaneously accessed in realistic plasmonic-photonic cavities, providing a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies, such as quantum light sources, quantum computation, and quantum information.

TI Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data on Quantum Computing: An Exploratory
   Silver-Label Baseline Study
SO IET SOFTWARE
AB Quantum software engineering is advancing rapidly in parallel with equally ambitious hardware roadmaps. However, systematic evidence on how online audiences perceive these advances remains scarce. We present an exploratory baseline of Twitter sentiment toward quantum computing, using automated (silver-standard) labels for benchmarking. Six months of English-language tweets containing the hashtag #Quantum (December 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023) were processed, with #Quantum treated as a proxy for online discourse on quantum computing. We then applied a transparent natural language processing (NLP) methodology combining two zero-shot lexicon-based tools (TextBlob and the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner [VADER]) with three lightweight supervised classifiers (multinomial na & iuml;ve Bayes, Rocchio, and perceptron). Following standard preprocessing and a stratified 70/30 train-test split, we do not aim to measure definitive public opinion; rather, our primary contribution is to establish a transparent and reproducible baseline for future benchmarking. In this context, the multinomial na & iuml;ve Bayes classifier attained a macro F1-score of 0.88 on the 30% hold-out set when benchmarked against the TextBlob silver labels. This score captures internal agreement rather than accuracy against human annotation. All five methods converged on a largely-though not universally-positive sentiment orientation (approximate to 78%-81% of nonneutral tweets, depending on the tool). Grounded in the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), we interpret our results as indicating the constructs of curiosity and perceived usefulness, rather than unequivocal adoption readiness. These constructs were not operationalized and serve only as interpretative lenses. By documenting every preprocessing step and model configuration, and making tweet identifiers and code available upon request, the study delivers a reproducible benchmark against which future work can (i) extend the query vocabulary, (ii) incorporate neutral and fine-grained emotions, (iii) apply cross-validation protocols, and (iv) evaluate advanced transformer models on manually annotated data. Addressing these four points is essential before making any definitive claims about public opinion.

TI Channel capacity and quantum entanglement of autofocusing
   hypergeometric-Gaussian beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We establish propagation models for distributing autofocusing hypergeometric-Gaussian (HyGG) beams via non-Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence in the single-photon and biphoton cases. Analytical expressions of the channel capacity and entanglement are employed to explore the communication performance in turbulence. It can be demonstrated that in the single-photon case, a lower hollowness parameter and larger topological charge could contribute to the anti-interference ability of HyGG beams. Such an anti-interference ability could be affected by the autofocusing distance more severely for beams with larger topological charges. In addition, the channel capacity of beams at a certain distance decays rapidly at first before it grows steadily with the increase in the power-law exponent of the non-Kolmogorov spectrum. For the biphoton case, the higher hollowness parameter, larger power-law exponent of the non-Kolmogorov spectrum and larger topological charge make HyGG beams maintain a high concurrence at longer distances. We believe that our results could serve as a reference for improving the quality of orbital-angular-momentum communication of HyGG beams via atmospheric turbulence.

In this paper, we investigate the fundamental performance limits of decoy state BB84 protocol over turbulent underwater channels and provide a comprehensive performance characterization. We adopt a near field analysis to determine the average power transfer over a turbulent underwater path and use this to obtain a lower bound on the secret key rate. We quantify the performance of decoy BB84 protocol in different water types assuming various turbulence conditions. We further investigate the effect of system parameters such as transmit aperture size and detector field of view on the performance. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Design of Magnetic Field Control System for Atom Quantum Sensing with
   Optical Detection
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Magnetic field control provides a valuable method for manipulating atomic energy levels and interactions in quantum precision measurements during the interaction between atoms and light. In high-precision quantum sensing experiments, precise measurement cannot be achieved without the cooperation between magnetic field systems and optical detection systems. In order to meet the magnetic field requirements of different optical detection systems, a set of fast switching magnetic field systems and alternating magnetic field systems were developed, and this device was combined with Lee-Whiting coils to achieve kHz alternating magnetic field signals. In the experiment, the frequency adjustment of the alternating magnetic field can be achieved by adjusting the size of the inductance and capacitance components, as well as increasing the adjustable range of the components to expand the frequency spectrum of the alternating magnetic field. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of this method in generating alternating magnetic fields, which can be used for the study of cold atomic absorption spectroscopy under alternating magnetic fields.

TI Noise-tolerant object detection and ranging using quantum correlations
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Imaging, detection and ranging of objects in the presence of significant background noise is a fundamental challenge in optical sensing. Overcoming the limitations imposed in conventional methods, quantum light sources show higher resistance against noise in a time-correlation-based quantum illumination. Here, we introduce the advantage of using not only time correlations but also polarization correlations in photon pairs in the detection of an object that is embedded in a noisy background. In this direction, a time- and polarization-correlated photon pair source using the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process is exploited. We found that the joint measurement of correlated pairs allows distinguishing the signal from the noise photons and that leads to an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Our comparative study revealed that using polarization correlations in addition to time correlations provides improved noise rejection. Furthermore, we show that polarization correlation allows undoing the detector limitation where high background often leads to detector saturation.

TI Optimizing GaN Surface Morphology through Controlled Photo-Electroless
   Etching for Enhanced Optical Properties
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Nanostructured gallium nitride (GaN) shows strong potential in enhancing ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors through improved sensitivity and in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) via better spatial resolution. It is also promising for quantum photonics, particularly as a scalable, room-temperature single-photon emitter vital for quantum communication and sensing. A cost-effective photo-electroless etching (PEE) technique was employed to fabricate various GaN nanostructures, including vertically aligned nanowires (NWs) with a mean length of 1.75 +/- 0.21 mu m and a diameter of 39.36 +/- 11.28 nm, as well as complex nano- and microporous layers. The study evaluated how different illumination conditions, power levels, and etching durations influenced the etching efficiency and surface morphology. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses revealed the transition from porous layers to vertical NWs, which eventually detached from the substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed that the structures consist primarily of gallium and nitrogen, consistent with GaN composition, while photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopies were employed to investigate their optical properties. The efficiency of UV photon emission relative to visible emission was quantified, revealing a strong dependence on the morphology. These results prove how PEE enhances photon extraction, positioning GaN as a versatile platform for future quantum technologies.

TI Single-Shot Nondestructive Quantum Sensing for Gaseous Samples with
   Hundreds of Chiral Molecules
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Chiral discrimination that is efficient at detecting tiny amounts of chiral substances, especially at the single-molecule level, is in great demand. Here, we propose a single-shot nondestructive quantum sensing method addressing such an issue. Our scheme consists of two steps. In the first step, the two enantiomers are prepared in different rotational states via microwave enantio-specific state transfer. Then, chiral discrimination is transferred to quantum hypothesis testing. In the second step, we for the first time introduce a nondestructive quantum-state detection technique assisted with a microwave resonator for chiral discrimination, through which the molecular chirality is determined by the sign of the output signals. Using a typical chiral molecule, 1,2-propanediol, and an experimentally feasible model based on spherical Fabry-Perot cavity, we show that the molecular chirality of slowly moving enantiopure gaseous samples with 10(2)-10(3) molecules can be highly credibly distinguished in a single-shot detection. By further trapping chiral molecules, it is promising to achieve chiral discrimination at the single-molecule level by using our approach.

TI Fermionic quantum simulation on Andreev bound state superlattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Arrays of superconducting qubits and cavities offer a promising route for realizing artificial materials. However, many analog simulations on superconducting circuit hardware have focused on bosonic systems. Fermionic simulations, in contrast, have largely relied on digital approaches. Here, we propose and study an alternative approach for analog fermionic quantum simulation based on arrays of coherently coupled mesoscopic Josephson junctions. These Josephson junction arrays implement an effective superlattice of Andreev bound state atoms that can trap individual fermionic quasiparticles and, due to their wave-function overlap, mediate quasiparticles hoppings. By developing a Wannier function approach, we show that these Andreev bound state arrays form an all-superconducting platform for emulating lattice models of fermionic quasiparticles that are phase and gate programmable. Interestingly, the junction lattices can also undergo a topological transition and host fermionic boundary modes that can be probed by conductance measurements. We hope our results will inspire the realization of artificial and topological materials on Andreev bound state quantum simulators.

TI Experimentally Certified Transmission of a Quantum Message through an
   Untrusted and Lossy Quantum Channel via Bell's Theorem
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum transmission links are central elements in essentially all protocols involving the exchange of quantum messages. Emerging progress in quantum technologies involving such links needs to be accompanied by appropriate certification tools. In adversarial scenarios, a certification method can be vulnerable to attacks if too much trust is placed on the underlying system. Here, we propose a protocol in a device-independent framework, which allows for the certification of practical quantum transmission links in scenarios in which minimal assumptions are made about the functioning of the certification setup. In particular, we take unavoidable transmission losses into account by modeling the link as a completely positive trace-decreasing map. We also, crucially, remove the assumption of independent identically distributed samples, which is known to be incompatible with adversarial settings. Particular emphasis is put on a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which the sender possesses trusted resources. Finally, in view of the use of the certified transmitted states for follow-up applications, our protocol moves beyond certification of the channel to allow us to estimate the quality of the transmitted quantum message itself. To illustrate the practical relevance and the feasibility of our protocol with currently available technology, we provide an experimental implementation in the one-sided device-independent setting, based on a stateof-the-art polarization-entangled photon-pair source in a Sagnac configuration, and analyze its robustness for realistic losses and errors.

TI Quantum Speedup for Index Modulation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a quantum-assisted index modulation for next-generation IoT wireless networks. The NP-hard index selection problem is first formulated by a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem consisting of constraints of feasible solutions. To minimize the number of qubits required for a quantum circuit, this formulation is then simplified by a dictionary-based approach that partially exploits a classical computer. For both formulations, the numbers of required qubits and non-zero elements in QUBO matrices are analyzed algebraically, and found to be in close agreement with the actual measurement. It is observed that the Grover adaptive search can provide the quantum speedup for the index selection problem. This promising result implies that the on-off structure of index modulation is suitable for quantum computation, and future fault-tolerant quantum computers may be useful for obtaining high-performance index activation patterns.

TI Square-root measurements and degradation of the resource state in
   port-based teleportation scheme
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a protocol of quantum teleportation in which a receiver does not have to apply correction to the transmitted state. In this protocol two spatially separated parties can teleport an unknown quantum state only by exploiting joint measurements on number of shared d-dimensional maximally entangled states (resource state) together with a state to be teleported and one way classical communication. In this paper we analyse for the first time the recycling protocol for the deterministic PBT beyond the qubit case. In the recycling protocol the main idea is to re-use the remaining resource state after one or many rounds of PBT for further processes of teleportation. The key property is to learn how much the underlying resource state degrades after every round of the teleportation process. We measure this by evaluating quantum fidelity between respective resource states. To do so we first present analysis of the square-root measurements used by the sender in PBT by exploiting the symmetries of the system. In particular, we show how to effectively evaluate their square-roots and composition. These findings allow us to present the explicit formula for the recycling fidelity involving only group-theoretic parameters describing irreducible representations in the Schur-Weyl duality. For the first time, we also analyse the degradation of the resource state for the optimal PBT scheme and show its degradation for all d > 2. In the both versions, the qubit case is discussed separately resulting in compact expression for fidelity, depending only on the number of shared entangled pairs.

TI Few-Body Precursors of Topological Frustration
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Spin 1/2 quantum spin chains represent the prototypical model for coupled two-level systems. Consequently, they offer a fertile playground for both fundamental and technological applications ranging from the theory of thermalization to quantum computation. Recently, it has been shown that interesting phenomena are associated to the boundary conditions imposed on the quantum spin chains via the so-called topological frustration. In this work, we analyze the effects of such frustration on a few-spin system, with a particular focus on the strong even-odd effects induced in the ground-state energy. We then implement a topologically frustrated quantum spin chain on a quantum computer to show that our predictions are visible on current quantum hardware platforms.

TI Multi-attribute decision-making approach based on Aczel-Alsina power
   aggregation operators under bipolar fuzzy information & its application
   to quantum computing
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The main aim of this paper is to present a new multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach for solving the problems under the uncertain and complex environment. The key challenges during any MADM problem are how to quantify the objective uncertainty information in the data and how to aggregate such collective information. To answer this, in this paper, we utilize the concept of the bipolar fuzzy information to mark the information in terms of the positive and negative support. To aggregate this different information, we propose some power aggregation operators based on the Aczel-Alsina operators (AAO). The AAOs are the generalized t-norm based operations with an additional parameter to analyze the influence of the expert preferences. Based on these AAO and bipolar fuzzy information, we stated bipolar fuzzy AA power weighted averaging and geometric operators and investigate their features. Later, based on these operators, we establish a MADM algorithm to solve the decision-making problems. The applicability of the stated algorithm is demonstrated through a case study related to quantum computing. The comparative studies and advantages of the study are also analyzed with the various prevailing theories.

TI Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order Against Heralded Noise via
   Local Lindbladian Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions, against generic "heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a fully local Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian (Z2) and non-Abelian (D4) topological order whose steady states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed-state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian D4 case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.

TI Theory of Ergodic Quantum Processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The generic behavior of quantum systems has long been of theoretical and practical interest. Any quantum process is represented by a sequence of quantum channels. We consider general ergodic sequences of stochastic channels with arbitrary correlations and non-negligible decoherence. Ergodicity includes and vastly generalizes random independence. We obtain a theorem which shows that the composition of such a sequence of channels converges exponentially fast to a replacement (rank-one) channel. Using this theorem, we derive the limiting behavior of translation-invariant channels and stochastically independent random channels. We then use our formalism to describe the thermodynamic limit of ergodic matrix product states. We derive formulas for the expectation value of a local observable and prove that the two-point correlations of local observables decay exponentially. We then analytically compute the entanglement spectrum across any cut, by which the bipartite entanglement entropy (i.e., R ' enyi or von Neumann) across an arbitrary cut can be computed exactly. Other physical implications of our results are that most Floquet phases of matter are metastable and that noisy random circuits in the large depth limit will be trivial as far as their quantum entanglement is concerned. To obtain these results, we bridge quantum information theory to dynamical systems and random matrix theory.

TI Steady-state entanglement production in a quantum thermal machine with
   continuous feedback control
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum thermal machines can generate steady-state entanglement by harvesting spontaneous interactions with local environments. However, using minimal resources and control, the entanglement is typically weak. Here, we study entanglement generation in a two-qubit quantum thermal machine in the presence of a continuous feedback protocol. Each qubit is measured continuously and the outcomes are used for real-time feedback to control the local system-environment interactions. We show that there exists an ideal operation regime where the quality of entanglement is significantly improved, to the extent that it can violate standard Bell inequalities and uphold quantum teleportation. In agreement with (Khandelwal et al 2020 New J. Phys. 22 073039), we also find, for ideal operation, that the heat current across the system is proportional to the entanglement concurrence. Finally, we investigate the robustness of entanglement production when the machine operates away from the ideal conditions.

AB In addressing the challenge posed by noise in actual quantum devices, the application of quantum error mitigation techniques becomes essential. These techniques are resource-efficient, making them viable for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, unlike the resource-intensive quantum error correction codes. A prominent example among these techniques is Clifford Data Regression, which employs a supervised learning approach. This work explores two variants of this technique, both of which add a non-trivial set of gates to the original circuit. The first variant leverages copies of the original circuit, whereas the second approach adds a layer of 1-qubit rotations.

TI Research on time-division multiplexing for error correction and privacy
   amplification in post-processing of quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The post-processing of quantum key distribution mainly includes error correction and privacy amplification. The error correction algorithms and privacy amplification methods used in the existing quantum key distribution are completely unrelated. Based on the principle of correspondence between error-correcting codes and hash function families, we proposed the idea of time-division multiplexing for error correction and privacy amplification for the first time. That is to say, through the common error correction algorithms and their corresponding hash function families or the common hash function families and their corresponding error-correcting codes, error correction and privacy amplification can be realized by time-division multiplexing with the same set of devices. In addition, we tested the idea from the perspective of error correction and privacy amplification, respectively. The analysis results show that the existing error correction algorithms and their corresponding hash function families or the common privacy amplification methods and their corresponding error-correcting codes cannot realize time-division multiplexing for error correction and privacy amplification temporarily. However, according to the principle of correspondence between error-correcting codes and hash function families, the idea of time-division multiplexing is possible. Moreover, the research on time-division multiplexing for error correction and privacy amplification has some practical significance. Once the idea of time-division multiplexing is realized, it will further reduce the calculation and storage cost of the post-processing process, reduce the deployment cost of quantum key distribution, and help to remote the practical engineering of quantum key distribution.

TI Threshold in Quantum Correlated Interference for a Particle Interacting
   with Two Scatterers
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Correlated interference is calculated for a microscopic particle retro-reflecting from two spatially separated scatterers that are free to move, all three of which are treated as quantum bodies: the positions of the particle traversing this 1D interferometer and those of the interferometer components are all uncertain. Interference in a measurement of only the particle is shown to disappear for microscopic yet appear for mesoscopic scatterers, contrary to that of a quantum-classical transition. A measurement of this threshold can verify quantum correlations in many-body systems by measuring only the retro-reflected microscopic particle. The decoherence of a mesoscopic scatterer is determined by this threshold without it having to traverse slits or beamsplitters.

TI A topical review on time-independent perturbation theory in
   one-dimensional quantum systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This review presents time-independent perturbative methods for solving the one-dimensional Schr & ouml;dinger equation, highlighting representative cases that reveal key aspects of the theory. The focus is on their relevance to quantum computing applications, particularly in systems with finite-dimensional state spaces. The main link between these methods and quantum processing emerges when we consider systems with only a finite number of well-defined energy levels, e.g., two levels corresponding to the 'zero' and 'one' states of a quantum bit (qubit), for which the Schr & ouml;dinger equation describes a quantum algorithm corresponding to the unitary evolution of the qubits. Perturbative techniques can then be applied to this evolution to gain deeper insight into the algorithm or to simplify it in a controlled manner, as described in the last sections of this review. We initially discuss representative applications using benchmark cases that exemplify the essential features of perturbation theory while avoiding unnecessary technical complications. The methods presented involve direct approaches to solutions for quantum systems with small potential perturbations, with consideration of indirect and approximation techniques. Key cases examined include the particle in a potential well, the harmonic oscillator, and systems with polynomial or Dirac delta distribution perturbations, each chosen to highlight unique aspects of perturbative analysis. Starting with an overview of the unperturbed Schr & ouml;dinger equation, we derive canonical solutions and then use perturbative techniques to approximate energy shifts and wavefunction corrections in both non-degenerate and degenerate settings. By combining theoretical discussion with case studies, this review underscores how perturbative methods are applied across a range of elementary quantum mechanical problems especially for applications in the qubit model, which, in many cases of interest, can be reduced to the explicit calculations shown here.

TI Large scale structure-aware pronoun resolution using quantum natural
   language processing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Natural language consists of words, sentences, and larger units. Guided by grammatical structure, words compose with each other to form sentences. Similarly, guided by discourse structure, sentences compose with each other to form dialogues and documents. Classical machine learning algorithms have achieved significant success in learning the meanings of words. When it comes to meanings of sentences and discourse units, they however fall short of being compositional. The DisCoCat model of meaning, introduced by Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh in 2010, provides a solution-at the sentence level-using higher-order tensors, the learning of which has been a challenge. A recent initiative known as Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces a translation between the DisCoCat tensors and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). This offers the potential of learning these higher-order tensors more efficiently when the circuits are executed on quantum computers. In previous work, we lifted the DisCoCat framework from the sentence level to the discourse level using a Fock space semantics. In this paper, we extend the DisCoCat-VQC translation to this semantics and experiment with it in a discourse task. We develop a massive dataset with 16,400 entries inspired by a major coreference resolution task, known as the Winograd Schema Challenge, proposed as a test of machine intelligence. Noisy and noiseless simulations were executed on IBMQ software, and the parameters of the discourse VQCs were learnt. The model converged to 77.5% accuracy, surpassing a Bag-of-Words model that neglects any structure. It also outperformed 2 out of 3 state-of-the-art classical coreference resolution architectures. These findings highlight the significant potential of quantum machine learning in advancing discourse analysis and structured natural language processing.

TI Collider events on a quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB High-quality simulated data is crucial for particle physics discoveries. Therefore, parton shower algorithms are a major building block of the data synthesis in event generator programs. However, the core algorithms used to generate parton showers have barely changed since the 1980s. With quantum computers' rapid and continuous development, dedicated algorithms are required to exploit the potential that quantum computers provide to address problems in high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel approach to synthesising parton showers using the Discrete QCD method. The algorithm benefits from an elegant quantum walk implementation which can be embedded into the classical toolchain. We use the ibm_algiers device to sample parton shower configurations and generate data that we compare against measurements taken at the ALEPH, DELPHI and OPAL experiments. This is the first time a Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device has been used to simulate realistic high-energy particle collision events.

TI Quantum Jumps in the Non-Hermitian Dynamics of a Superconducting Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the dynamics of a driven non-Hermitian superconducting qubit which is perturbed by quantum jumps between energy levels, a purely quantum effect with no classical correspondence. The quantum jumps mix the qubit states leading to decoherence. We observe that this decoherence rate is enhanced near the exceptional point, owing to the cube-root topology of the non-Hermitian eigenenergies. Together with the effect of non-Hermitian gain or loss, quantum jumps can also lead to a breakdown of adiabatic evolution under the slow-driving limit. Our study shows the critical role of quantum jumps in generalizing the applications of classical non-Hermitian systems to open quantum systems for sensing and control.

TI Efficient Qubit Measurement with a Nonreciprocal Microwave Amplifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The act of observing a quantum object fundamentally perturbs its state, resulting in a random walk toward an eigenstate of the measurement operator. Ideally, the measurement is responsible for all dephasing of the quantum state. In practice, imperfections in the measurement apparatus limit or corrupt the flow of information required for quantum feedback protocols, an effect quantified by the measurement efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the efficient measurement of a superconducting qubit using a nonreciprocal parametric amplifier to directly monitor the microwave field of a readout cavity. By mitigating the losses between the cavity and the amplifier, we achieve a measurement efficiency of (72 +/- 4)%. The directionality of the amplifier protects the readout cavity and qubit from excess backaction caused by amplified vacuum fluctuations. In addition to providing tools for further improving the fidelity of strong projective measurement, this work creates a test bed for the experimental study of ideal weak measurements, and it opens the way toward quantum feedback protocols based on weak measurement such as state stabilization or error correction.

TI Generalized scaling of spin qubit coherence in over 12,000 host
   materials
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Spin defect centers with long quantum coherence times (T-2) are key solid-state platforms for a variety of quantum applications. Cluster correlation expansion (CCE) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool to simulate the T-2 of defect electron spins in these solid-state systems with good accuracy. Here, based on CCE, we uncover an algebraic expression for T-2 generalized for host compounds with dilute nuclear spin baths under a magnetic field that enables a quantitative and comprehensive materials exploration with a near instantaneous estimate of the coherence time. We investigated more than 12,000 host compounds at natural isotopic abundance and found that silicon carbide (SiC), a prominent widegap semiconductor for quantum applications, possesses the longest coherence times among widegap nonchalcogenides. In addition, more than 700 chalcogenides are shown to possess a longer T-2 than SiC. We suggest potential host compounds with promisingly long T-2 up to 47 ms and pave the way to explore unprecedented functional materials for quantum applications.

TI Nuclear electric resonance for spatially resolved spin control via
   pulsed optical excitation in the UV-visible spectrum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nuclear electric resonance (NER) spectroscopy is currently experiencing a revival as a tool for nuclear spin-based quantum computing. Compared to magnetic or electric fields, local electron density fluctuations caused by changes in the atomic environment provide a much higher spatial resolution for the addressing of nuclear spins in qubit registers or within a single molecule. In this article we investigate the possibility of coherent spin control in atoms or molecules via nuclear quadrupole resonance from first principles. An abstract, time-dependent description is provided which entails and reflects on commonly applied approximations. This formalism is then used to propose a method we refer to as "optical" nuclear electric resonance (ONER). It employs pulsed optical excitations in the UV-visible light spectrum to modulate the electric field gradient at the position of a specific nucleus of interest by periodic changes of the surrounding electron density. Possible realizations and limitations of ONER for atomically resolved spin manipulation are discussed and tested on 9Be as an atomic benchmark system via electronic structure theory.

TI Phase Coordinate Uncomputation in Quantum Recursive Fourier Sampling
SO ENTROPY
AB Recursive Fourier Sampling (RFS) was one of the earliest problems to demonstrate a quantum advantage, and is known to lie outside the Merlin-Arthur complexity class. This work contains a new description of quantum algorithms in phase space terminology, demonstrating its use in RFS, and how and why this gives a better understanding of the quantum advantage in RFS. Most importantly, describing the computational process of quantum computation in phase space terminology gives a much better understanding of why uncomputation is necessary when solving RFS: the advantage is present only when phase coordinate garbage is uncomputed. This is the underlying reason for the limitations of the quantum advantage.

TI Neural Network-Powered Nonlinear Compensation Framework for High-Speed
   Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we present a neural network-based framework to compensate for the nonlinear distortion of high-speed continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems. In practice, the nonlinear impairment of imperfect devices could bring interference to the measured quadrature values and thus compromise the parameter estimation procedure and the secure key rate. Specifically, for a high-speed CV-QKD system, the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) and the following analog-to-digital converter are the primary sources of nonlinear impairment. The nonlinear distortion effect will he more pronounced as the pulse repetition rate increases. We propose an autoencoder-based network to learn the inner patterns of distorted data and then compensate the quadrature measurements in real-time at the receiver's side. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the excess noise induced by nonlinear impairment is reduced to the 10(-3) level in the shot noise unit. Consequently, such a software approach has the ability to significantly boost the bandwidth efficiency of the BHD and the secure key hit rate.

TI Remote Generation of Magnon Schrodinger Cat State via Magnon-Photon
   Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The magnon cat state represents a macroscopic quantum superposition of collective magnetic excitations of large number spins that not only provides fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum effects but also finds applications in quantum metrology and quantum computation. In particular, remote generation and manipulation of Schrodinger cat states are particularly interesting for the development of long-distance and large-scale quantum information processing. Here, we propose an approach to remotely prepare magnon even or odd cat states by performing local non-Gaussian operations on the optical mode that is entangled with the magnon mode through pulsed optomagnonic interaction. By evaluating key properties of the resulting cat states, we show that for experimentally feasible parameters, they are generated with both high fidelity and nonclassicality, as well as with a size large enough to be useful for quantum technologies. Furthermore, the effects of experimental imperfections such as the error of projective measurements and dark count when performing single-photon operations have been discussed, where the lifetime of the created magnon cat states is expected to be t similar to 1 mu s.

TI Power-optimal, stabilized entangling gate between trapped-ion qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB To achieve scalable quantum computing, improving entangling-gate fidelity and its implementation efficiency are of utmost importance. We present here a linear method to construct provably power-optimal entangling gates on an arbitrary pair of qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. This method leverages simultaneous modulation of amplitude, frequency, and phase of the beams that illuminate the ions and, unlike the state of the art, does not require any search in the parameter space. The linear method is extensible, enabling stabilization against external parameter fluctuations to an arbitrary order at a cost linear in the order. We implement and demonstrate the power-optimal, stabilized gate on a trapped-ion quantum computer.

TI Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor
   qubit circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: All such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.

TI Entanglement of dark electron-nuclear spin defects in diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A promising approach for multi-qubit quantum registers is to use optically addressable spins to control multiple dark electron-spin defects in the environment. While recent experiments have observed signatures of coherent interactions with such dark spins, it is an open challenge to realize the individual control required for quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate the heralded initialisation, control and entanglement of individual dark spins associated to multiple P1 centers, which are part of a spin bath surrounding a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We realize projective measurements to prepare the multiple degrees of freedom of P1 centers-their Jahn-Teller axis, nuclear spin and charge state-and exploit these to selectively access multiple P1s in the bath. We develop control and single-shot readout of the nuclear and electron spin, and use this to demonstrate an entangled state of two P1 centers. These results provide a proof-of-principle towards using dark electron-nuclear spin defects as qubits for quantum sensing, computation and networks. The use of optically addressable spins to control dark electron-spins is promising for multi-qubit platforms; however, control over darks spins has remained challenging. Here, the authors realize entanglement between individual dark spins associated with substitutional nitrogen defects in diamond.

TI Holographic photonic neuron
SO NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING
AB The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to process complex datasets has brought about innovative computing paradigms. While recent developments in quantum-photonic computing have reached significant feats, mimicking our brain's ability to recognize images are poorly integrated in these ventures. Here, I incorporate orbital angular momentum (OAM) states in a classical Vander Lugt optical correlator to create the holographic photonic neuron (HoloPheuron). The HoloPheuron can memorize an array of matched filters in a single phase-hologram, which is derived by linking OAM states with elements in the array. Successful correlation is independent of intensity and yields photons with OAM states of lPLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI, which can be used as a transmission protocol or qudits for quantum computing. The unique OAM identifier establishes the HoloPheuron as a fundamental AI device for pattern recognition that can be scaled and integrated with other computing platforms to build-up a robust neuromorphic quantum-photonic processor.

TI Long-range CC4 gates via radio-frequency-induced Förster resonances
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. Here we present a CCU quantum phase gate protocol based on radio-frequency-induced F & ouml;rster resonant interactions in the array of highly excited 87Rb atoms. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by rf field application enables high-fidelity and robust gate performance for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, as well as it significantly facilitates the experimental implementation of the gate protocol. Taking into account finite Rydberg states lifetimes, we achieve an average theoretical gate fidelity of 99.27% under room-temperature conditions (improved up to 99.65% in a cryogenic environment), thus showing the protocol compatibility with modern quantum error correction techniques.

TI Computing Eigenvalues of Diagonalizable Matrices on aQuantum Computer
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Computing eigenvalues of matrices is ubiquitous in numerical linear algebra problems. Currently, fast quantum algorithms for estimating eigenvalues of Hermitian and unitary matrices are known. However, the general case is far from fully understood in the quantum case. Based on a quantum algorithm for solving linear ordinary differential equations, we show how to estimate the eigenvalues of diagonalizable matrices that only have real eigenvalues. The output is a superposition of the eigenpairs, and the overall complexity is polylog in the dimension for sparse matrices. Under an assumption, we extend the algorithm to diagonalizable matrices with complex eigenvalues.

TI Quantum algorithm for solving a quadratic nonlinear system of equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Solving a quadratic nonlinear system of equations (QNSE) is a fundamental, but important, task in nonlinear science. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for solving n-dimensional QNSE. Our algorithm embeds QNSE into a finite-dimensional system of linear equations using the homotopy perturbation method and a linearization technique; then we solve the linear equations with a quantum linear system solver and obtain a state which is e-close to the normalized exact solution of the QNSE with success probability Q(1). The complexity of our algorithm is O(polylog(n/e)), which provides an exponential improvement over the optimal classical algorithm in dimension n, and the dependence on e is almost optimal. Therefore, our algorithm exponentially accelerates the solution of QNSE and has wide applications in all kinds of nonlinear problems, contributing to the research progress of nonlinear science.

TI Three Carleman routes to the quantum simulation of classical fluids
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB We discuss the Carleman approach to the quantum simulation of classical fluids, as applied to (i) lattice Boltzmann, (ii) Navier-Stokes, and (iii) Grad formulations of fluid dynamics. Carleman lattice Boltzmann shows excellent convergence properties, but it is plagued by nonlocality which results in an exponential depth of the corresponding circuit with the number of Carleman variables. The Carleman Navier-Stokes offers a dramatic reduction of the number Carleman variables, which might lead to a viable depth, provided locality can be preserved and convergence can be achieved with a moderate number of iterates also at sizeable Reynolds numbers. Finally, it is argued that Carleman Grad might combine the best of Carleman lattice Boltzmann and Carleman Navier-Stokes.

Our technique is based on a power series expansion of the time-evolution operator in its of diagonal terms. The expansion decouples the dynamics due to the diagonal component of the Hamiltonian from the dynamics generated by its off-diagonal part, which we encode using the linear combination of unitaries technique. Our method has an optimal dependence on the desired precision and, as we illustrate, generally requires considerably fewer resources than the current state-of-the-art. We provide an analysis of resource costs for several sample models.

TI Resolving Nonclassical Magnon Composition of a Magnetic Ground State via
   a Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recently gained insights into equilibrium squeezing and entanglement harbored by magnets point toward exciting opportunities for quantum science and technology, while concrete protocols for exploiting these are needed. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a direct dispersive coupling between a qubit and a noneigenmode magnon enables detecting the magnonic number states' quantum superposition that forms the ground state of the actual eigenmode-squeezed magnon-via qubit excitation spectroscopy. Furthermore, this unique coupling is found to enable control over the equilibrium magnon squeezing and a deterministic generation of squeezed even Fock states via the qubit state and its excitation. Our work demonstrates direct dispersive coupling to noneigenmodes, realizable in spin systems, as a general pathway to exploiting the equilibrium squeezing and related quantum properties thereby motivating a search for similar realizations in other platforms.

TI Compact Hybrid Signature for Secure Transition to Post-Quantum Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent advances in quantum-computing technology have threatened the security of classical cryptographic algorithms. This initiated research on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization is in progress. Coping with the current situation in which the security of existing cryptographic algorithms is already in question and that of new cryptographic algorithms is not yet certain, there has been active research on hybrid schemes combining two algorithms such that the security of the combined scheme is based on both underlying algorithms. For digital signatures, a naive solution for a hybrid scheme is to simply concatenate a classical signature and a quantum-resistant signature. In this paper, however, we propose a compact hybrid signature construction method that combines two randomized signatures such that the size of the combined signature is shorter than that of naive concatenation. Our construction allows for selective verification, which provides backward compatibility and conformance with existing regulations. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by combining ECDSA P-256 and Falcon-512, which are representative classical and post-quantum signature schemes, respectively. We prove that the combined signature is existentially unforgeable against an adaptive chosen-message attack, even if one of the underlying signature schemes is completely broken and only the other one remains secure. Through experiments on a desktop PC and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, we verify that the proposed method effectively reduces the combined signature size with negligible computational overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is also applicable to PQC-PQC combinations.

TI Ground-state cooling in cavity optomechanical systems
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The development of quantum optomechanics enables the manipulation of the quantum state of a macroscopic object and the conversion of frequency in different domains in quantum information processing, which prompts the process of quantum network and quantum computing. However, to enter the regime of quantum optomechanics, it's necessary to prepare a mechanical object in its ground state. In this review, we briefly introduce the process of ground-state cooling in cavity optomechanical system. We first elucidate the theory of optomechanical cooling from both the classical and quantum perspective. Then we review experimental process about ground-state cooling in cavity optomechanical systems in these years, which includes the active feedback cooling and intrinsic optomechanical cooling. We selectively introduce the apparatus, samples and final cooling performance of some remarkable experiments. Finally, theoretical discussions on novel cooling approach will be reviewed, including cooling beyond resolved-sideband regime and multimode cooling, which may serve as a guidance for future experiment design.

TI Medical image diagnosis based on adaptive Hybrid Quantum CNN
SO BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Hybrid quantum systems have shown promise in image classification by combining the strengths of both classical and quantum algorithms. These systems leverage the parallel processing power of quantum computers to perform complex computations while utilizing classical algorithms to handle the vast amounts of data involved in imaging. The hybrid approach is intended to improve accuracy and speed compared to traditional classical methods. Further research and development in this area can revolutionize the way medical images are classified and help improve patient diagnosis and treatment. The use of Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification and diagnosis of medical images using big datasets requires, in most cases, the use of special high-performance computing machines, which are very expensive and hard to access by most researchers. A new form of Machine Learning (ML), Quantum machine learning (QML), is being introduced as an emerging strategy to overcome this problem. A hybrid quantum-classical CNN uses both quantum and classical convolution layers designed to use a parameterized quantum circuit. This means that the computing model utilizes a quantum circuits approach to construct QML algorithms, which are then used to transform the quantum state to extract image hidden features. This computational acceleration is expected to achieve better algorithm performance than classical CNNs. This study intends to evaluate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum CNN (HQCNN) against a conventional CNN. This is followed by some optimizer modifications for both proposed and classical CNN methods to investigate the possible further improvement of their performance. The optimizer modification is based on forcing the optimizer to be directly adaptive to model accuracy. The optimizer adaptiveness is based on the development of an optimizer with a loss base adaptive momentum. Several algorithms are developed to achieve the above-mentioned goals, including CNN, QCNN, CNN with the adaptive optimizer, and QCNN with the Adaptive optimizer. The four algorithms are tested against a Kaggle brain dataset containing over 7000 samples. The test results show the hybrid quantum circuit algorithm outperformed the conventional CNN algorithm. The performance of both algorithms was further improved by using a fully adaptive SGD optimizer.

TI Quantum-enhanced Chaotic Image Encryption: Strengthening Digital Data
   Security With 1-D Sine-based Chaotic Maps and Quantum Coding
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The proposed work delves into the utilization of chaotic maps along with the quantum mechanisms to strengthen the security of the digital images along with addressing the limitations posed by conventional 1-D chaotic systems characterized by their pseudorandom and periodic attributes. Leveraging the inherent uncertainty in quantum theory, the proposed research introduces a new image encryption scheme. This method is built upon the concepts of two-dimensional quantum coding and the 1-D sine -based chaotic map (1-D SBCM). In the proposed encryption scheme, initially, a random sequence is created using 1-D SBCM by varying the seed parameters. This sequence is subsequently utilized for the purpose of scrambling. After that, a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is meticulously devised, drawing inspiration from the concepts of quantum coherence. This PRNG generates a confidential code stream that defies predictability and remains incongruent with the plaintext image, thereby contributing to heightened security levels. Subsequently, the research employs the novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) model, capitalizing on its advanced capabilities. Within this framework, the study introduces a quantum right cyclic shift operator, as well as a quantum XOR operator. These operators play a vital role in the formation of highly robust encrypted images. The application of these quantum operators not only enhances the security measures but also increases the complexity of the encryption procedure Statistical evidence derived from comprehensive experimentation corroborates the efficacy of the proposed image encryption scheme. Through rigorous analysis, it becomes evident that the system exhibits a robust performance in terms of strong security. The integration of quantum principles and quantum coding demonstrates that the proposed encryption scheme is resilient against potential threats.

TI Microwave-activated gates between a fluxonium and a transmon qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose and analyze two types of microwave-activated gates between a fluxonium and a transmon qubit, namely a cross-resonance (CR) and a CPHASE gate. The large frequency difference between a transmon and a fluxonium makes the realization of a two-qubit gate challenging. For a medium-frequency fluxonium qubit, the transmon-fluxonium system allows for a cross-resonance effect mediated by the higher levels of the fluxonium over a wide range of transmon frequencies. This allows one to realize the cross-resonance gate by driving the fluxonium at the transmon frequency, mitigating typical problems of the cross-resonance gate in transmon-transmon chips related to frequency targeting and residual ZZ coupling. However, when the fundamental frequency of the fluxonium enters the low-frequency regime below 100 MHz, the cross-resonance effect decreases leading to long gate times. For this range of parameters, a fast microwave CPHASE gate can be implemented using the higher levels of the fluxonium. In both cases, we perform numerical simulations of the gate showing that a gate fidelity above 99% can be obtained with gate times between 100 and 300 ns. Next to a detailed gate analysis, we perform a study of chip yield for a surface code lattice of fluxonia and transmons interacting via the proposed cross-resonance gate. We find a much better yield as compared to a transmon-only architecture with the cross-resonance gate as native two-qubit gate.

TI Quantum simulation of an extended Dicke model with a magnetic solid
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The Dicke model describes the cooperative interaction of an ensemble of two-level atoms with a single-mode photonic field and exhibits a quantum phase transition as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Extending this model by incorporating short-range atom-atom interactions makes the problem intractable but is expected to produce new physical phenomena and phases. Here, we simulate such an extended Dicke model using a crystal of ErFeO3, where the role of atoms (photons) is played by Er3+ spins (Fe3+ magnons). Through terahertz spectroscopy and magnetocaloric effect measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we demonstrated the existence of a novel atomically ordered phase in addition to the superradiant and normal phases that are expected from the standard Dicke model. Further, we elucidated the nature of the phase boundaries in the temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, identifying both first-order and second-order phase transitions. These results lay the foundation for studying multiatomic quantum optics models using well-characterized many-body solid-state systems.
   The Dicke model, describing the cooperative coupling of an ensemble of two-level atoms with a single-mode light field, has a rich phenomenology in quantum optics and quantum information, but its analytical or numerical solution is beyond current reach. Here, a solid-state quantum simulator of an extended Dicke model is achieved using ErFeO3 crystals, where terahertz spectroscopy and magnetocaloric effect measurements reveal an atomically ordered phase in addition to the expected superradiant and normal phases.

The former showed disordered spin configurations for a specific mixture of values of the two fields. These insights mirror catalytic processes, where disorder within a catalyst can lead to inefficient reaction mechanisms. Results obtained from our proof-of-principle implementation make the case for kick-starting more concentrated efforts in harnessing existing quantum computational tools for computationally probing complex dynamical behavior arising in quantum matter. Our aim is to leverage tools from quantum information processing to bring about a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics and structure of glassy systems, ultimately informing the development of novel materials and technology.

TI Ancilla-Assisted Generation of Photons from Vacuum via Time-Modulation
   of Extracavity Qubit
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a scheme for the generation of photons from a vacuum via time-modulation of a quantum system indirectly coupled to the cavity field through some ancilla quantum subsystem. We consider the simplest case when the modulation is applied to an artificial two-level atom (we call 't-qubit', that can be located even outside the cavity), while the ancilla is a stationary qubit coupled via the dipole interaction both to the cavity and t-qubit. We find that tripartite entangled states with a small number of photons can be generated from the system ground state under resonant modulations, even when the t-qubit is far detuned from both the ancilla and the cavity, provided its bare and modulation frequencies are properly adjusted. We attest our approximate analytic results by numeric simulations and show that photon generation from vacuum persists in the presence of common dissipation mechanisms.

TI Quantum algorithm for the covariance matrix preparation and its
   application
SO EPL
AB - Performing the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of the dataset is of great significance in the field of machine learning. However, classical operations will become time-consuming when involving large data sets. In this paper, in order to address this problem, we design an efficient quantum algorithm to prepare the covariance matrix state by means of quantum amplitude estimation. After that, we research on its application in principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance calculation. Specifically, we obtain the transformation matrix for quantum principal component analysis based on the singular value estimation algorithm and the amplitude amplification algorithm. Furthermore, we invoke the quantum matrix inversion algorithm to calculate the Mahalanobis distance. The final complexity analysis shows that our proposed algorithms can achieve speedup compared to their classical counterparts under certain conditions.Copyright c 2023 EPLA

TI Preparation of two-qubit entangled states on a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg
   diamond spin cluster by controlling the measurement
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB The preparation of entangled quantum states is an inherent and indispensable step for the implementation of many quantum information algorithms. Depending on the physical system, there are different ways to control and measure them, which allow one to achieve the predefined quantum states. The diamond spin cluster is the system that can be applied for this purpose. Moreover, such a system appears in chemical compounds such as the natural mineral azurite, where the Cu2+ are arranged in a spin-1/2 diamond chain. Herein, we propose the method of preparation of pure entangled states on the Ising-Heisenberg spin-1/2 diamond cluster. We suppose that the cluster consists of two central spins which are described by an anisotropic Heisenberg model and interact with the side spins via Ising interaction. Controlling the measurement direction of the side (central) spins allows us to achieve predefined pure quantum states of the central (side) spins. We show that this directly affects the entanglement and fidelity of the prepared states. For example, we obtain conditions and fidelities for preparations of the Bell states. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Volumetric 23Na Single and Triple-Quantum Imaging at 7T:
   3D-CRISTINA
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR MEDIZINISCHE PHYSIK
AB Purpose: To measure multi-quantum coherence (MQC) 23Na signals for noninvasive cell physiological information in the whole-brain, the 2D-CRISTINA method was extended to 3D. This experimental study investigated the use and results of a new sequence, 3D-CRISTINA, on a phantom and healthy volunteers.Methods: The 3D Cartesian single and triple-quantum imaging of 23Na (3D-CRISTINA) was developed and implemented at 7T, favoring a non-selective volume excitation for increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and lower energy deployment than its 2D counterpart. Two independent phase cycles were used in analogy to the 2D method. A comparison of 6-steps cycles and 12-steps cycles was performed. We used a phantom composed of different sodium and agarose concentrations, 50 mM to 150 mM Na+, and 0-5% agarose for sequence validation. Four healthy volunteers were scanned at 7T for whole brain MQC imaging. The sequence 3DCRISTINA was developed and tested at 7T.Results: At 7T, the 3D-CRISTINA acquisition allowed to reduce the TR to 230 ms from the previous 390 ms for 2D, resulting in a total acquisition time of 53 min for a 3D volume of 4 x 4 x 8 mm resolution. The phase cycle evaluation showed that the 7T acquisition time could be reduced by 4-fold with moderate single and triple-quantum signals SNR loss. The healthy volunteers demonstrated clinical feasibility at 7T and showed a difference in the MQC signals ratio of White Matter (WM) and Grey Matter (GM).Conclusion: Volumetric CRISTINA multi-quantum imaging allowed whole-brain coverage. The non-selective excitation enabled a faster scan due to a decrease in energy deposition which enabled a lower repetition time. Thus, it should be the preferred choice for future in vivo multi-quantum applications compared to the 2D method. A more extensive study is warranted to explore WM and GM MQC differences.

TI Quantum classical hybrid convolutional neural networks for breast cancer
   diagnosis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The World Health Organization states that early diagnosis is essential to increasing the cure rate for breast cancer, which poses a danger to women's health worldwide. However, the efficacy and cost limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques increase the possibility of misdiagnosis. In this work, we present a quantum hybrid classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN) based breast cancer diagnosis approach with the goal of utilizing quantum computing's high-dimensional data processing power and parallelism to increase diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. When working with large-scale and complicated datasets, classical convolutional neural network (CNN) and other machine learning techniques generally demand a large amount of computational resources and time. Their restricted capacity for generalization makes it challenging to maintain consistent performance across multiple data sets. To address these issues, this paper adds a quantum convolutional layer to the classical convolutional neural network to take advantage of quantum computing to improve learning efficiency and processing speed. Simulation experiments on three breast cancer datasets, GBSG, SEER and WDBC, validate the robustness and generalization of QCCNN and significantly outperform CNN and logistic regression models in classification accuracy. This study not only provides a novel method for breast cancer diagnosis but also achieves a breakthrough in breast cancer diagnosis and promotes the development of medical diagnostic technology.

TI Experimental Demonstration of an Efficient Mach-Zehnder Modulator Bias
   Control for Quantum Key Distribution Systems
SO ELECTRONICS
AB A Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is necessary for implementing a decoy-state protocol in a practical quantum key distribution (QKD) system. However, an MZM bias control method optimized for QKD systems has been missing to date. In this study, we propose an MZM bias control method using N (>= 2) diagnostic pulses. The proposed method can be efficiently applied to a QKD system without any additional hardware such as light sources or detectors. Furthermore, it does not reduce the key rate significantly because it uses time slots allocated to existing decoy pulses. We conducted an experimental demonstration of the proposed method in a field-deployed 1 x 3 QKD network and a laboratory test. It is shown that our method can maintain the MZM extinction ratio stably over 20 dB (bit error rate <= 1%), even in an actual network environment for a significant period. Consequently, we achieved successful QKD performances.

TI An Improved Slice Reconciliation Protocol for Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Reconciliation is an essential procedure for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). As the most commonly used reconciliation protocol in short-distance CV-QKD, the slice error correction (SEC) allows a system to distill more than 1 bit from each pulse. However, the quantization efficiency is greatly affected by the noisy channel with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which usually limits the secure distance to about 30 km. In this paper, an improved SEC protocol, named Rotated-SEC (RSEC), is proposed through performing a random orthogonal rotation on the raw data before quantization, and deducing a new estimator for the quantized sequences. Moreover, the RSEC protocol is implemented with polar codes. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol can reach up to a quantization efficiency of about 99%, and maintain at around 96% even at the relatively low SNRs (0.5,1), which theoretically extends the secure distance to about 45 km. When implemented with the polar codes with a block length of 16 Mb, the RSEC achieved a reconciliation efficiency of above 95%, which outperforms all previous SEC schemes. In terms of finite-size effects, we achieved a secret key rate of 7.83x10-3 bits/pulse at a distance of 33.93 km (the corresponding SNR value is 1). These results indicate that the proposed protocol significantly improves the performance of SEC and is a competitive reconciliation scheme for the CV-QKD system.</p>

TI Efficient Integration of Rate-Adaptive Reconciliation with
   Syndrome-Based Error Estimation and Subblock Confirmation for Quantum
   Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB An effective post-processing algorithm is essential for achieving high rates of secret key generation in quantum key distribution. This work introduces an approach to quantum key distribution post-processing by integrating the three main steps into a unified procedure: syndrome-based error estimation, rate-adaptive reconciliation, and subblock confirmation. The proposed scheme employs low-density parity-check codes to estimate the quantum bit error rate using the syndrome information, and to optimize the channel coding rates based on the Slepian-Wolf coding scheme for the rate-adaptive method. Additionally, this scheme incorporates polynomial-based hash verification in the subblock confirmation process. The numerical results show that the syndrome-based estimation significantly enhances the accuracy and consistency of the estimated quantum bit error rate, enabling effective code rate optimization for rate-adaptive reconciliation. The unified approach, which integrates rate-adaptive reconciliation with syndrome-based estimation and subblock confirmation, exhibits superior efficiency, minimizes practical information leakage, reduces communication rounds, and guarantees convergence to the identical key. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the secret key throughput of this approach achieves the theoretical limit in the context of a BB84 quantum key distribution system.

TI Community detection in brain connectomes with hybrid quantum computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent advancements in network neuroscience are pointing in the direction of considering the brain as a small-world system with an efficient integration-segregation balance that facilitates different cognitive tasks and functions. In this context, community detection is a pivotal issue in computational neuroscience. In this paper we explored community detection within brain connectomes using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the Leap's Hybrid Solver in D-Wave. By reframing the modularity optimization problem into a Discrete Quadratic Model, we show that quantum annealers achieved higher modularity indices compared to the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm without the need to overcomplicate the mathematical formulation. We also found that the number of communities detected in brain connectomes slightly differed while still being biologically interpretable. These promising preliminary results, together with recent findings, strengthen the claim that quantum optimization methods might be a suitable alternative against classical approaches when dealing with community assignment in networks.

TI Subdiffusive dynamics and critical quantum correlations in a
   disorder-free localized Kitaev honeycomb model out of equilibrium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Disorder-free localization has recently emerged as a mechanism for ergodicity breaking in homogeneous lattice gauge theories. In this work we show that this mechanism can lead to unconventional states of quantum matter as the absence of thermalization lifts constraints imposed by equilibrium statistical physics. We study a Kitaev honeycomb model in a skew magnetic field subject to a quantum quench from a fully polarized initial product state and observe nonergodic dynamics as a consequence of disorder-free localization. We find that the system exhibits a subballistic power-law entanglement growth and quantum correlation spreading, which is otherwise typically associated with thermalizing systems. In the asymptotic steady state the Kitaev model develops volume-law entanglement and power-law decaying dimer quantum correlations even at a finite energy density. Our work sheds light on the potential for disorder-free localized lattice gauge theories to realize quantum states in two dimensions with properties beyond what is possible in an equilibrium context.

TI Solving the Schrodinger Equation with Genetic Algorithms: A Practical
   Approach
SO COMPUTERS
AB The Schrodinger equation is one of the most important equations in physics and chemistry and can be solved in the simplest cases by computer numerical methods. Since the beginning of the 1970s, the computer began to be used to solve this equation in elementary quantum systems, and, in the most complex case, a 'hydrogen-like' system. Obtaining the solution means finding the wave function, which allows predicting the physical and chemical properties of the quantum system. However, when a quantum system is more complex than a 'hydrogen-like' system, we must be satisfied with an approximate solution of the equation. During the last decade, application of algorithms and principles of quantum computation in disciplines other than physics and chemistry, such as biology and artificial intelligence, has led to the search for alternative techniques with which to obtain approximate solutions of the Schrodinger equation. In this work, we review and illustrate the application of genetic algorithms, i.e., stochastic optimization procedures inspired by Darwinian evolution, in elementary quantum systems and in quantum models of artificial intelligence. In this last field, we illustrate with two 'toy models' how to solve the Schrodinger equation in an elementary model of a quantum neuron and in the synthesis of quantum circuits controlling the behavior of a Braitenberg vehicle.

TI Long-range two-hybrid-qubit gates mediated by a microwave cavity with
   red sidebands
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Implementing two-qubit gates via strong coupling between quantum-dot qubits and a superconducting microwave cavity requires achieving coupling rates that are much faster than decoherence rates. Typically, this involves tuning the qubit either to a sweet spot, where it is relatively insensitive to charge noise, or to a point where it is resonant with the microwave cavity. Unfortunately, such operating points seldom coincide. Here we theoretically investigate protocols, based on transverse or longitudinal sideband driving, for implementing two-qubit gates between quantum-dot hybrid qubits, mediated by a microwave cavity. The rich physics in these qubits gives rise to two types of sweet spots, which can occur at operating points with strong charge dipole moments. Such strong interactions provide new opportunities for off-resonant gating, thereby removing one of the main obstacles for long-distance two-qubit gates. We find that the transverse driving scheme yields faster gates, while longitudinal driving yields gates that are more resilient to photon decay. Our results suggest that the numerous tuning knobs of quantum-dot hybrid qubits make them good candidates for strong coupling. In particular, we show that off-resonant red-sideband-mediated two-qubit gates can exhibit fidelities greater than 95% for realistic operating parameters, and we describe improvements that could potentially yield gate fidelities greater than 99%.

TI Security Analysis of a Passive Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution by Considering Finite-Size Effect
SO ENTROPY
AB We perform security analysis of a passive continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol by considering the finite-size effect. In the passive CV-QKD scheme, Alice utilizes thermal sources to passively make preparation of quantum state without Gaussian modulations. With this technique, the quantum states can be prepared precisely to match the high transmission rate. Here, both asymptotic regime and finite-size regime are considered to make a comparison. In the finite-size scenario, we illustrate the passive CV-QKD protocol against collective attacks. Simulation results show that the performance of passive CV-QKD protocol in the finite-size case is more pessimistic than that achieved in the asymptotic case, which indicates that the finite-size effect has a great influence on the performance of the single-mode passive CV-QKD protocol. However, we can still obtain a reasonable performance in the finite-size regime by enhancing the average photon number of the thermal state.

TI Shifting physics of vortex particles to higher energies via quantum
   entanglement
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Physics of structured waves is currently limited to relatively small particle energies as the available generation techniques are only applicable to the soft X-ray twisted photons, to the beams of electron microscopes, to cold neutrons, or non-relativistic atoms. The highly energetic vortex particles with an orbital angular momentum would come in handy for a number of experiments in atomic physics, nuclear, hadronic, and accelerator physics, and to generate them one needs to develop alternativemethods, applicable for ultrarelativistic energies and for composite particles. Here, we show that the vortex states of in principle arbitrary particles can be generated during photon emission in helical undulators, via Cherenkov radiation, in collisions of charged particles with intense laser beams, in such scattering or annihilation processes as e mu -> e mu, ep -> ep, e(-) e(+)-> pp(-), and so forth. The key element in obtaining them is the postselection protocol due to entanglement between a pair of final particles and it is largely not the process itself. The state of a final particle - be it a gamma -ray, a hadron, a nucleus, or an ion - becomes twisted if the azimuthal angle of the other particle momentum is measured with a large error or is not measured at all. As a result, requirements to the beam transverse coherence can be greatly relaxed, which enables the generation of highly energetic vortex beams at accelerators and synchrotron radiation facilities, thus making them a new tool for hadronic and spin studies.

TI Continuous Protection of a Collective State from Inhomogeneous Dephasing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We introduce and demonstrate a scheme for eliminating the inhomogeneous dephasing of a collective quantum state. The scheme employs off-resonant fields that continuously dress the collective state with an auxiliary sensor state, which has an enhanced and opposite sensitivity to the same source of inhomogeneity. We derive the optimal conditions under which the dressed state is fully protected from dephasing when using either one or two dressing fields. The latter provides better protection, circumvents qubit phase rotation, and suppresses the sensitivity to drive noise. We further derive expressions for all residual, higher-order sensitivities. We experimentally study the scheme by protecting a collective excitation of an atomic ensemble, where inhomogeneous dephasing originates from thermal motion. Using photon storage and retrieval, we demonstrate complete suppression of inhomogeneous dephasing and, consequently, a prolonged memory time. Our scheme may be applied to eliminate motional dephasing in other systems, improving the performance of quantum gates and memories with neutral atoms. It is also generally applicable to various gas, solid, and engineered systems, where sensitivity to variations in time, space, or other domains limits possible scale-up of the system.

TI Extending the spin coherence lifetimes of 167Er3+
   :Y2SiO5 at subkelvin temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Er3+:Y2SiO5 is a material of particular interest due to its suitability for telecom-band quantum memories and quantum transducers interfacing optical communication with quantum computers working in the microwave regime. Extending the coherence lifetimes of the electron spins and the nuclear spins is essential for implementing efficient quantum information processing based on such hybrid electron-nuclear spin systems. The electron spin coherence time of Er3+:Y2SiO5 is so far limited to several microseconds, and there are significant challenges in optimizing coherence lifetimes simultaneously for both the electron and nuclear spins. Here we perform a pulsed-electron-nuclear-double-resonance investigation for an Er3+-doped material at subkelvin temperatures. At the lowest working temperature, the electron spin coherence time reaches 290 ?? 17 ??s, which has been enhanced by 40 times compared with the previous results. In the subkelvin regime, a rapid increase in the nuclear spin coherence time is observed, and the longest coherence time of 738 ?? 6 ??s is obtained. These extended coherence lifetimes could be valuable resources for further applications of Er3+:Y2SiO5 in fiber-based quantum networks.

TI Explicit asymptotic secret key rate of continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution with an arbitrary modulation
SO QUANTUM
AB We establish an analytical lower bound on the asymptotic secret key rate of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with an arbitrary modulation of coherent states. Previously, such bounds were only available for protocols with a Gaussian modulation, and numerical bounds existed in the case of simple phase-shift-keying modulations. The latter bounds were obtained as a solution of convex optimization problems and our new analytical bound matches the results of Ghorai et al. (2019), up to numerical precision. The more relevant case of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) could not be analyzed with the previous techniques, due to their large number of coherent states. Our bound shows that relatively small constellation sizes, with say 64 states, are essentially sufficient to obtain a performance close to a true Gaussian modulation and are therefore an attractive solution for large-scale deployment of continuous-variable quantum key distribution. We also derive similar bounds when the modulation consists of arbitrary states, not necessarily pure.

AB We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.

TI Anti-Interference Performance Analysis and Optimization Strategy of
   Quantum Key Distribution Protocol in Noisy Environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS APPROACH
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) technology, a secure communication method based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, enables secure key sharing between two communication nodes. In theory, the unconditional security of the QKD protocol depends on ideal quantum devices, classical devices, and perfect random number generation. However, there are significant differences between the devices in the actual system and the ideal conditions, and QKD systems are inevitably affected by various noises that seriously affect the anti-interference performance and key generation efficiency of the system. In this article, the authors analyze the anti-interference performance of the QKD protocol in noisy environments and propose a QKD network routing algorithm based on trust relay. This algorithm effectively reduces the bit error rate during network transmission and improves the efficiency of key distribution by optimizing the selection strategy of relay nodes and key forwarding paths.

TI Molecular engineering of an inverse hexacopper(II) coordination complex
   with a photoactive metallacyclophane centroligand as prototype of a
   magnetic photoswitch
SO POLYHEDRON
AB A primary goal of molecular spintronics is detecting the response of the spins from a single magnetic molecule to an external stimulus and, eventually, being able to implement logic quantum memory capabilities for information data storage and processing applications in quantum computation. Having this in mind, a novel hexanuclear oxamatocopper(II) complex of formula {[Cu-2(naba)(2)][Cu(pmdien)](4)}(ClO4)(4)center dot 8H(2)O (2) [naba = N,N'-1,5-naphthalenebis(oxamate) and pmdien = N,N,N',N '',N ''-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine] has been prepared by the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of (nBu(4)N)(4)[Cu-2(naba)(2)] center dot 4H(2)O (1) (nBu(4)N+ = tetra-n-butylammo-nium cation) and [Cu(pmdien)](ClO4)(2) (1:4 molar ratio) in water. 2 exhibits a ladder-like "dimer-of-trinuclears " structure featuring a photoactive dicopper(II) naphthalenophane core acting as inverse coordination centre (centroligand) towards four peripheral [Cu(pmdien)](2+) groups through the outer amidate/carboxylate oxygen atoms of the oxamato fragments. 2 undergoes a unique magnetic photoswitching ON/OFF behaviour upon UV light irradiation because of an intramolecular ( "pseudo-bimolecular ") photocycloaddition of the two facing naphthalene spacers through the more reactive carbon atoms at the 1,4 and 1',4' positions of the benzene rings to afford the putative [4 + 4] cycloaddition product c-2. Hence, the two oxamato-bridged S = 1/2 Cu-3(II) linear units antiferromagnetically coupled within the Cu-6(II) precursor (2, ON state) become magnetically uncoupled in the corresponding [4 + 4] photocycloaddition product (c-2, OFF state) [j(eff) = -2.13 (2) and 0 cm(-1) (c-2); H = - j(eff)S(A)(center dot)S(B) with S-A = S-B = 1/2]. This new example of inverse coordination complex constitutes thus a potential candidate to molecular magnetic photoswitch in the "bottom-up " approach to nanometer-scale spintronic and quantum computing devices.

TI Multiplexed color centers in a silicon photonic cavity array
SO OPTICA
AB Entanglement distribution is central to the modular scaling of quantum processors and establishing quantum networks. Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution. However, high-bandwidth memory-enhanced quantum communication is limited by high-yield, scalable creation of efficient spin-photon interfaces. Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.

TI Learning high-accuracy error decoding for quantum processors
SO NATURE
AB Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems1. Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google's Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.
   A recurrent, transformer-based neural network, called AlphaQubit, learns high-accuracy error decoding to suppress the errors that occur in quantum systems, opening the prospect of using neural-network decoders for real quantum hardware.

TI Hierarchy of multipartite correlations based on concentratable
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multipartite entanglement is one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics and is central to quantum information processing. In this work we show that concentratable entanglement (CE), an operationally motivated entanglement measure, induces a hierarchy upon pure states from which different entanglement structures can be experimentally certified. In particular, we find that nearly all genuine multipartite entangled states can be verified through the CE. Interestingly, GHZ states prove to be far from maximally entangled according to this measure. Instead we find the exact maximal value and corresponding states for up to 18 qubits and show that these correspond to extremal quantum error correcting codes. The latter allows us to unravel a deep connection between CE and coding theory. Finally, our results also offer an alternative proof, on up to 31 qubits, that absolutely maximally entangled states do not exist.

TI Single-particle steering and nonlocality: The consecutive Stern-Gerlach
   experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum nonlocality and quantum steering are fundamental correlations of quantum systems which cannot be created using classical resources only. Nonlocality describes the ability to influence the possible results of measurements carried out in distant systems, in quantum steering where Alice remotely steers Bob's state. Research in nonlocality and steering is of fundamental interest for the development of quantum information and in many applications requiring nonlocal resources like quantum key distribution. On the other hand, the Stern-Gerlach experiment holds an important place in the history, development, and teaching of quantum mechanics and quantum information. In particular, the thought experiment of consecutive Stern-Gerlach experiments is commonly used to exemplify the concept of noncommutativity between quantum operators. However, to the best of our knowledge, the consecutive Stern-Gerlach experiments have not been treated in a fully fledged quantum manner yet, and it is a widely accepted idea that atoms crossing consecutive Stern-Gerlach experiments follow classical paths. Here we demonstrate that two consecutive Stern-Gerlach experiments generate nonlocality and steering, and these nonlocal effects strongly modify our usual understanding of this experiment. Also, we discuss the implications of this result and its relation with entanglement. This suggests the use of quantum correlations, of particles possessing mass, to generate nonlocal tasks using this experiment.

TI Robust and adaptable quantum key distribution network without trusted
   nodes
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks are promising to serve large numbers of users with information-theoretic secure communication. In QKD networks, the detection-safe protocol, termed measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, can naturally enhance realistic security by supporting untrusted measurement nodes. However, the environmental disturbances to quantum states degrade the performance of multi-user communication. Here we propose an MDI-QKD networking scheme with robustness against environmental disturbance and adaptability to multi-user access, where more than two users can generate keys simultaneously regardless of aligning reference frames and compensating channel disturbance on polarization. To achieve this, we introduce the reference-frame-independent protocol as well as a polarization-compensation-free method, design a multi-user measurement unit, and combine it with original two-user units. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated for the improvement of network robustness and adaptability in multi-user scenarios, and the time and device costs of disturbance compensation can be saved from O(N) to O(1) for an N-user network.

TI Shortcut-based generation of transmon-magnon entangled states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Optimized generation of entangled states between solid-state qubits is of fundamental significance to quantum information science and technology. Here, we develop an effective scheme to fast and robustly create the entangled states in a hybrid system containing a superconducting transmon qubit and a spin magnon of yttrium iron garnet. The transmon qubit and the magnon system are coupled via a microwave cavity field. Within the framework of invariant-based shortcuts to adiabaticity, the transmon-magnon entangled states can be rapidly induced by engineering the Rabi couplings between the cavity mode and transmon (magnon) with constant amplitudes. Compared with a non-shortcut counterpart, the shortcut-based operations of interest not only considerably shorten the generation time, but also greatly mitigate the decoherence effects. Furthermore, the fast dynamics is well insensitive to the control deviation of Rabi couplings. Thus our approach could lead to advances in information processing and state engineering with composite systems.

TI Quasiprobability decompositions with reduced sampling overhead
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum error-mitigation techniques can reduce noise on current quantum hardware without the need for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. For instance, the quasiprobability method simulates a noise-free quantum computer using a noisy one, with the caveat of only producing the correct expected values of observables. The cost of this error mitigation technique manifests as a sampling overhead which scales exponentially in the number of corrected gates. In this work, we present an algorithm based on mathematical optimization that aims to choose the quasiprobability decomposition in a noise-aware manner. This directly leads to a significantly lower basis of the sampling overhead compared to existing approaches. A key element of the novel algorithm is a robust quasiprobability method that allows for a tradeoff between an approximation error and the sampling overhead via semidefinite programming.

TI A singlet-triplet hole spin qubit in planar Ge
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Spin qubits are considered to be among the most promising candidates for building a quantum processor. Group IV hole spin qubits are particularly interesting owing to their ease of operation and compatibility with Si technology. In addition, Ge offers the option for monolithic superconductor-semiconductor integration. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit operating at fields below 10 mT, the critical field of Al, by exploiting the large out-of-plane hole g-factors in planar Ge and by encoding the qubit into the singlet-triplet states of a double quantum dot. We observe electrically controlled g-factor difference-driven and exchange-driven rotations with tunable frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and dephasing times of 1 mu s, which we extend beyond 150 mu s using echo techniques. These results demonstrate that Ge hole singlet-triplet qubits are competing with state-of-the-art GaAs and Si singlet-triplet qubits. In addition, their rotation frequencies and coherence are comparable with those of Ge single spin qubits, but singlet-triplet qubits can be operated at much lower fields, emphasizing their potential for on-chip integration with superconducting technologies.
   A singlet-triplet spin qubit using holes in a Ge quantum well is demonstrated, and can be operated at low magnetic fields of a few millitesla.

TI Relativistic quantum information measures from unequal-time QFT
   correlation functions
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB This paper continues on the program of developing a relativistic quantum information theory in terms of unequal-time correlation functions in quantum field theory (QFT) (Anastopoulos et al., 2023). Here, we focus on the definition of quantum resources from the irreducibly quantum behavior contained in the correlation functions of a QFT. We explain how set-ups with N particle detectors probe the information in the high order field correlation functions. Our main object is the associated hierarchy of probability densities of N-detector events. We show that classical probabilistic hierarchies are subject to two conditions: Kolmogorov additivity and measurement independence. QFT violates those conditions, and the degree of violation enables us to define novel quantum resources. We give specific examples in set-ups where the main observables are the times of particle detection events. The new resources capture instances of irreducibly quantum behavior that differs from the quantum behavior encapsulated in Bell inequalities. An interesting byproduct of our analysis is a relativistic state reduction rule for particles detected through scattering.

AB Although RF fingerprinting is one of the most commonly used techniques for localization, deploying it in a ubiquitous manner requires addressing the challenge of supporting a large number of heterogeneous devices and their variations. We present QHFP, a device-independent quantum fingerprint matching algorithm that addresses two of the issues for realizing worldwide ubiquitous large-scale location tracking systems: storage space and running time as well as devices heterogeneity. In particular, we present a quantum algorithm with a complexity that is exponentially better than the classical techniques, both in space and running time. QHFP also has provisions for handling the inherent localization error due to building the large-scale fingerprint using heterogeneous devices. We give the details of the entire system starting from extracting device-independent features from the raw RSS, mapping the classical feature vectors to their quantum counterparts, and showing a quantum cosine similarity algorithm for fingerprint matching.
   We have implemented our quantum algorithm and deployed it in a real testbed using the IBM Quantum machine simulator. Results confirm the ability of QHFP to obtain the correct estimated location with an exponential improvement in space and running time compared to the traditional classical counterparts. In addition, the proposed device-independent features lead to more than 20% better accuracy in median error. This highlights the promise of our algorithm for future ubiquitous large-scale worldwide device-independent fingerprinting localization systems.

TI Lattice regularizations of θ vacua: Anomalies and qubit models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Anomalies are a powerful way to gain insight into possible lattice regularizations of a quantum field theory. In this work, we argue that the continuum anomaly for a given symmetry can be matched by a manifestly symmetric, local, lattice regularization in the same spacetime dimensionality only if (i) the symmetry action is offsite, or (ii) if the continuum anomaly is reproduced exactly on the lattice. We consider lattice regularizations of a class of prototype models of QCD: the (1 + 1)-dimensional asymptotically free Grassmannian nonlinear sigma model (NLaMs) with a 0 term. Using the Grassmannian NLaMs as a case study, we provide examples of lattice regularizations in which both possibilities are realized. For possibility (i), we argue that Grassmannian NLaMs can be obtained from SU eth N THORN antiferromagnets with a well-defined continuum limit, reproducing both the infrared physics of 0 vacua and the ultraviolet physics of asymptotic freedom. These results enable the application of new classical algorithms to lattice Monte Carlo studies of these quantum field theories, and provide a viable realization suited for their quantum simulation. On the other hand, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the conventional lattice regularization of 0 vacua due to Berg and Luscher reproduces the anomaly exactly on the lattice, providing a realization of the second possibility.

We show that using an approximation instead of the exact expectation results in a quadratic improvement in the efficiency of QMV and thus the underlying quantum algorithm.

TI Superconducting wide strip photon detector with high critical current
   bank structure
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The single-photon detector is an essential technology in photonic quantum information science and technology. Large-scale photonic quantum computers and quantum networks inevitably require numerous high-performance single-photon detectors. Superconducting nanostrip single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) using around 100-nm-wide nanostrips are promising technologies with high detection efficiency, low dark count, and low jitter, but there has been room for evolution in terms of polarization dependence and productivity. Using wide strips with widths of tens of micrometers provides polarization-independent high detection efficiency and high-yield fabrication using high-throughput photolithography with submicron resolution. However, detecting photons with such wide strips has been challenging due to rapidly increasing intrinsic dark counts caused by the uneven distribution of the superconducting current in the strip. Here, we present a novel superconducting wide strip photon detector (SWSPD) with a high critical current bank (HCCB) structure. This new strip structure suppresses the intrinsic dark counts and provides highly efficient photon detection in the wide strips. We have simultaneously achieved a polarization-independent detection efficiency of over 78% for 1550-nm wavelength photons, a low dark count rate (DCR) of similar to 80 cps, and a low jitter of 29.8 ps using a 20-mu m-wide SWSPD with the HCCB structure. This result paves the way for a new class of photon detectors using ultra-wide superconducting strips. These photon detectors with excellent productivity and polarization-independent high detection performances would boost the advance of large-scale photonic quantum technologies.

TI Observing ground-state properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model using a
   scalable algorithm on a quantum computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Fermi-Hubbard model represents one of the benchmarks for testing quantum computational methods for condensed matter. Here, the authors are able to reproduce qualitative properties of the model on 1 x 8 and 2 x 4 lattices, by running a VQE-based algorithm on a superconducting quantum processor.
   The famous, yet unsolved, Fermi-Hubbard model for strongly-correlated electronic systems is a prominent target for quantum computers. However, accurately representing the Fermi-Hubbard ground state for large instances may be beyond the reach of near-term quantum hardware. Here we show experimentally that an efficient, low-depth variational quantum algorithm with few parameters can reproduce important qualitative features of medium-size instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model. We address 1 x 8 and 2 x 4 instances on 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor, substantially larger than previous work based on less scalable compression techniques, and going beyond the family of 1D Fermi-Hubbard instances, which are solvable classically. Consistent with predictions for the ground state, we observe the onset of the metal-insulator transition and Friedel oscillations in 1D, and antiferromagnetic order in both 1D and 2D. We use a variety of error-mitigation techniques, including symmetries of the Fermi-Hubbard model and a recently developed technique tailored to simulating fermionic systems. We also introduce a new variational optimisation algorithm based on iterative Bayesian updates of a local surrogate model.

TI Cavity QED Based on Strongly Localized Modes: Exponentially Enhancing
   Single-Atom Cooperativity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Large single-atom cooperativity in quantum systems is important for quantum information processing. Here, we propose to exponentially enhance the single-atom cooperativity parameter by exploiting the strongly localized effect of modes in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. By increasing the wing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference property allows us to exponentially improve the quality factor Q without altering the mode volume V for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes. This effectively overcomes the trade-off between Q and V in conventional subwavelength Fabry-Pe<acute accent>rot cavities. Consequently, we demonstrate the occurrence of ultralong vacuum Rabi oscillations and the generation of strong photon blockade by enhancing the single-atom cooperativity parameter. This Letter offers a promising approach for advancing coherent manipulation and holds significant potential for applications in establishing longer-distance quantum communication networks, enhancing the precision and stability of quantum sensors, and improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms.

TI Topological Methods for Studying Contextuality: N-Cycle Scenarios
   and Beyond
SO ENTROPY
AB Simplicial distributions are combinatorial models describing distributions on spaces of measurements and outcomes that generalize nonsignaling distributions on contextuality scenarios. This paper studies simplicial distributions on two-dimensional measurement spaces by introducing new topological methods. Two key ingredients are a geometric interpretation of Fourier-Motzkin elimination and a technique based on the collapsing of measurement spaces. Using the first one, we provide a new proof of Fine's theorem characterizing noncontextual distributions in N-cycle scenarios. Our approach goes beyond these scenarios and can describe noncontextual distributions in scenarios obtained by gluing cycle scenarios of various sizes. The second technique is used for detecting contextual vertices and deriving new Bell inequalities. Combined with these methods, we explore a monoid structure on simplicial distributions.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We report on work using a newly developed code, SpheriCo.jl, that computes the gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field, where the scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. By utilising summation-by-parts methods for the numerical derivatives we are able to simulate the collapse longer than was possible previously due to enhanced numerical stability. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability, both for the classical and quantum fields. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta.

TI Revisiting one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks with general coin
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Quantum walk (QW) is the quantum analog of the random walk. QW is an integral part of the development of numerous quantum algorithms. Hence, an in-depth understanding of QW helps us to grasp the quantum algorithms. We revisit the one-dimensional discrete-time QW and discuss basic steps in detail by incorporating the most general coin operator, constant in both space and time, and a localized initial state using numerical modeling. We investigate the impact of each parameter of the general coin operator on the probability distribution of the quantum walker. We show that by tuning the parameters of the general coin, one can regulate the probability distribution of the walker. We provide an algorithm for the one-dimensional quantum walk driven by the general coin operator. The study on general coin operators also includes the popular coins - Hadamard, Grover, and Fourier.

TI Why teach quantum in your own time: the values of grassroots
   organizations involved in quantum technologies education and outreach
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.

TI Comparative quantitation of DNA water tracers using OptiQ, Qubit, and
   Nanodrop
SO AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT
AB We have recently developed new synthetic DNA tracers for tracking sources and pathways of contamination in surface water and groundwater. The use of DNA tracers in natural water systems results in substantial and rapid dilutions, thus accurate quantitation of initial DNA tracer concentrations applied is crucial to ensure their successful downstream detections. We compared the sensitivity and accuracy of three portable analytical techniques for quantitation of these DNA tracers: Nanodrop, Qubit, and OptiQ. All three methods were about equally effective when measuring high concentrations of DNA tracers (e.g., for c-amine DNA tracer 1.54 x 10(5), 1.37 x 10(5), and 1.77 x 10(5) ng/mL for Nanodrop, Qubit, and OptiQ, respectively). However, the fluorescent methods of Qubit and OptiQ were significantly more sensitive at detecting lower concentrations of DNA tracers with limits of detection in the range 0.1-2 ng/mL, compared to 5 x 10(3) ng/mL for Nanodrop. The results of this work will facilitate the practical deployment of DNA tracers for tracking water contamination, and improving freshwater quality.

TI Classical shadows for quantum process tomography on near-term quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum process tomography is a powerful tool for understanding quantum channels and characterizing the properties of quantum devices. Inspired by recent advances using classical shadows in quantum state tomography [H.-Y. Huang, R. Kueng, and J. Preskill, Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020).], we have developed ShadowQPT, a classical shadow method for quantum process tomography. We introduce two related formulations with and without ancilla qubits. ShadowQPT stochastically reconstructs the Choi matrix of the device allowing for an a posteri classical evaluation of the device on arbitrary inputs with respect to arbitrary outputs. Using shadows, we then show how to compute overlaps, generate all k-weight reduced processes, and perform reconstruction via Hamiltonian learning. These latter two tasks are efficient for large systems as the number of quantum measurements needed scales only logarithmically with the number of qubits. A number of additional approximations and improvements are developed, including the use of a pair-factorized Clifford shadow and a series of postprocessing techniques that significantly enhance the accuracy for recovering the quantum channel. We have implemented ShadowQPT using both Pauli and Clifford measurements on the IonQ trapped ion quantum computer for quantum processes up to n = 4 qubits, and we achieved good performance.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The quantum phase diagram for a finite three-level system in the ? configuration, interacting with a two-mode electromagnetic field in a cavity, is determined by means of information measures such as fidelity, fidelity susceptibility and entanglement, applied to the reduced density matrix of the matter sector of the system. The quantum phases are explained by emphasizing the spontaneous symmetry breaking along the separatrix. Additionally, a description of the reduced density matrix of one atom in terms of a simplex allows a geometric representation of the entanglement and purity properties of the system. These concepts are calculated for both, the symmetry-adapted variational coherent states and the numerical diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian, and compared. The differences in purity and entanglement obtained in both calculations can be explained and visualised by means of this simplex representation.

TI Quantum Firefly Algorithm: A Novel Approach for Quantum Circuit
   Scheduling Optimization
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, as the scale of existing quantum hardware continues to expand, the demand for effective methods to schedule quantum gates and minimize the number of operations has become increasingly urgent. To address this demand, the Quantum Firefly Algorithm (QFA) has been designed by incorporating quantum information into the traditional firefly algorithm. This integration enables fireflies to explore multiple positions simultaneously, thereby increasing search space coverage and utilizing quantum tunneling effects to escape local optima. Through wave function evolution and collapse mechanisms described by the Schr & ouml;dinger equation, a balance between exploring new solutions and exploiting known solutions is achieved by the QFA. Additionally, random perturbation steps are incorporated into the algorithm to enhance search diversity and prevent the algorithm from being trapped in local optima. In quantum circuit scheduling problems, the QFA optimizes quantum gate operation sequences by evaluating the fitness of scheduling schemes, reducing circuit depth and movement operations, while improving parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional algorithms, the QFA reduces SWAP gates by an average of 44% and CNOT gates by an average of 16%. When compared to modern algorithms, it reduces SWAP gates by an average of 7% and CNOT gates by an average of 12%.

TI A Quantum MIMO-OFDM Framework with Transmit and Receive Diversity for
   High-Fidelity Image Transmission
SO TELECOM
AB This paper proposes a quantum multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) framework for image transmission, which combines quantum multi-qubit encoding with spatial and frequency diversity to enhance noise resilience and image quality. The system utilizes joint photographic experts group (JPEG), high efficiency image file format (HEIF), and uncompressed images, which are first source-encoded (if applicable) and then processed using classical channel encoding. The channel-encoded bitstream is mapped into quantum states via multi-qubit encoding and transmitted through a 2 x 2 MIMO system with varied diversity schemes. The spatially mapped qubits undergo the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to form quantum OFDM subcarriers, with a cyclic prefix added before transmission over fading quantum channels. At the receiver, the cyclic prefix is removed, the inverse QFT is applied, and the quantum MIMO decoder reconstructs spatially diverged quantum states. Then, quantum decoding reconstructs the bitstreams, followed by channel decoding and source decoding to recover the final image. Experimental results show that the proposed quantum MIMO-OFDM system outperforms its classical counterpart across all evaluated diversity configurations. It achieves peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values up to 58.48 dB, structural similarity index measure (SSIM) up to 0.9993, and universal quality index (UQI) up to 0.9999 for JPEG; PSNR up to 70.04 dB, SSIM up to 0.9998, and UQI up to 0.9999 for HEIF; and near-perfect reconstruction with infinite PSNR, SSIM of 1, and UQI of 1 for uncompressed images under high channel noise. These findings establish quantum MIMO-OFDM as a promising architecture for high-fidelity, bandwidth-efficient quantum multimedia communication.

TI Proposal for spin squeezing in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals with a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Achieving spin squeezing within solid-state devices is a long-standing research goal due to the promise of their particularities, for instance, their long coherence times, the possibility of low-temperature experiments, or the integration of entanglement-assisted sensors on-chip. In this work, we investigate an interferometer-free four-color scheme to achieve spin squeezing of rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. The proposal relies on an analytic derivation that starts from a Tavis-Cummings model for light-matter interaction, providing microscopic insights onto spin-squeezing generation. We evince the spin-squeezing signature in the light intensity variance. We consider the two particular cases of europium-and praseodymium-doped yttrium orthosilicates, workhorses of quantum technology developments. We show that up to 8 dB of spin squeezing can be obtained with readily accessible experimental resources, including noise due to photon scattering. Our results for rare-earth-ion-doped crystals add to the promising properties of these platforms for manipulating many-body entangled states and for high-precision measurements.

TI Optical Entanglement of Distinguishable Quantum Emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters are promising candidates for the realization of quantum networks, owing to their long-lived spin memories, high-fidelity local operations, and optical connectivity for long-range entanglement. However, due to differences in local environment, solid-state emitters typically feature a range of distinct transition frequencies, which makes it challenging to create optically mediated entanglement between arbitrary emitter pairs. We propose and demonstrate an efficient method for entangling emitters with optical transitions separated by many linewidths. In our approach, electro-optic modulators enable a single photon to herald a parity measurement on a pair of spin qubits. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol using two silicon-vacancy centers in a diamond nanophotonic cavity, with optical transitions separated by 7.4 GHz. Working with distinguishable emitters allows for individual qubit addressing and readout, enabling parallel control and entanglement of both colocated and spatially separated emitters, a key step toward scaling up quantum information processing systems.

TI Determining quantum topological semion code decoder performance and

SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum error correction technology is a vital method to eliminate noise during the operation of quantum computers. To solve the problem caused by noise, in this paper, reinforcement learning is used to encode defects of Semion codes, and the experience replay technique is used to realize the design of decoder. Semion codes are quantum topological error correction codes with the same symmetry group Z 2 as Kitaev toric codes, we used the topological characteristics of error correction codes to map qubits to multi-dimensional space, and error correction accuracy of the decoder is calculated to be 77.5%. Calculate the threshold of topological quantum Semion code, depending on the code distance, resulting in different thresholds, p ( threshold ) = 0.081574 when the code distance is d = 3, 5, 7 and threshold p ( threshold ) = 0.09542 when the code distance is d = 5, 7, 9. And we design the Q -network to optimize the cost of quantum circuit gates and compare the size of the cost reduction under different thresholds. Reinforcement learning is an important method for designing Semion code decoders and optimizing numerical values, providing more general error models and error correction codes for future machine engineering decoders.

TI Full-field quantum imaging with a single-photon avalanche diode camera
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays are essential tools in biophotonics, optical ranging and sensing, and quantum optics. However, their small number of pixels, low quantum efficiency, and small fill factor have so far hindered their use for practical imaging applications. Here, we demonstrate full-field entangled photon-pair correlation imaging using a 100-kpixel SPAD camera. By measuring photon coincidences between more than 500 million pairs of positions, we retrieve the full point spread function of the imaging system and subsequently high-resolution images of target objects illuminated by spatially entangled photon pairs. We show that our imaging approach is robust against stray light, enabling quantum imaging technologies to move beyond laboratory experiments towards real-world applications such as quantum light detection and ranging.

TI Quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for
   enhanced object detection: comment
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The paper [Opt. Express 32, 40150 (2024)] investigates quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for object detection in noisy environments. In this comment, we identify errors in the mathematical model for photon loss, particularly in the treatment of quantum entanglement under lossy channels. We show that the claimed robustness of polarization entanglement to photon loss contradicts established principles in quantum information theory, rendering the conclusions on detecting low-reflectivity objects unsupported.

TI Vanadium in silicon carbide: telecom-ready spin centres with long
   relaxation lifetimes and hyperfine-resolved optical transitions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Vanadium in silicon carbide (SiC) is emerging as an important candidate system for quantum technology due to its optical transitions in the telecom wavelength range. However, several key characteristics of this defect family including their spin relaxation lifetime (T1), charge state dynamics, and level structure are not fully understood. In this work, we determine the T1 of an ensemble of vanadium defects, demonstrating that it can be greatly enhanced at low temperature. We observe a large spin contrast exceeding 90% and long spin-relaxation times of up to 25 s at 100 mK, and of order 1 s at 1.3 K. These measurements are complemented by a characterization of the ensemble charge state dynamics. The stable electron spin furthermore enables high-resolution characterization of the systems' hyperfine level structure via two-photon magneto-spectroscopy. The acquired insights point towards high-performance spin-photon interfaces based on vanadium in SiC.

TI Airborne gravimetry with quantum technology: observations from Iceland
   and Greenland
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
AB We report on the availability of data from an airborne gravity campaign in Iceland and Greenland conducted during June and July 2023. The dataset includes observations from a platform-stabilised gravimeter based on cold-atom quantum technology and a strapdown gravimeter based on classical technology. The data are available at three different levels of processing, making them relevant to users interested in working with "quantum" and "hybrid" data as well as users interested in geophysical studies. The paper describes the data processing applied to derive the various levels of data and presents an evaluation of the accuracy of the data. This evaluation indicates an accuracy of 1-2 mGal for both sensors, depending on the roughness of the gravity field. Although the two technologies lead to similar performance, further analysis indicates that the error characteristics are different and that the final estimates would benefit from a combination.

TI Automated verification of countermeasure against detector-control attack
   in quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Attacks that control single-photon detectors in quantum key distribution using tailored bright illumination are capable of eavesdropping the secret key. Here we report an automated testbench that checks the detector's vulnerabilities against these attacks. We illustrate its performance by testing a free-running detector that includes a rudimentary countermeasure measuring an average photocurrent. While our testbench automatically finds the detector to be controllable in a continuous-blinding regime, the countermeasure registers photocurrent significantly exceeding that in a quantum regime, thus revealing the attack. We then perform manually a pulsed blinding attack, which controls the detector intermittently. This attack is missed by the countermeasure in a wide range of blinding pulse durations and powers, still allowing to eavesdrop the key. We make recommendations for improvement of both the testbench and countermeasure.

TI Further improving quantum algorithms for nonlinear differential
   equations via higher-order methods and rescaling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The solution of large systems of nonlinear differential equations is essential for many applications in science and engineering. We present three improvements to existing quantum algorithms based on the Carleman linearisation technique. First, we use a high-precision method for solving the linearised system that yields logarithmic dependence on the error and near-linear dependence on time. Second, we introduce a rescaling strategy that significantly reduces the cost, which would otherwise scale exponentially with the Carleman order, thus limiting quantum speedups for PDEs. Third, we derive tighter error bounds for Carleman linearisation. We apply our results to a class of discretised reaction-diffusion equations using higher-order finite differences for spatial resolution. We also show that enforcing a stability criterion independent of the discretisation can conflict with rescaling due to the mismatch between the max-norm and the 2-norm. Nonetheless, efficient quantum solutions remain possible when the number of discretisation points is constrained, as enabled by higher-order schemes.

TI Engineering Purely Nonlinear Coupling between Superconducting Qubits
   Using a Quarton
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Strong nonlinear coupling of superconducting qubits and/or photons is a critical building block for quantum information processing. Because of the perturbative nature of the Josephson nonlinearity, linear coupling is often used in the dispersive regime to approximate nonlinear coupling. However, this dispersive coupling is weak and the underlying linear coupling mixes the local modes, which, for example, distributes unwanted self-Kerr nonlinearity to photon modes. Here, we use the quarton to yield purely nonlinear coupling between two linearly decoupled transmon qubits. The quarton's zero phi(2) potential enables an ultrastrong gigahertz-level cross-Kerr coupling, which is an order of magnitude stronger compared to existing schemes, and the quarton's positive phi(4) potential can cancel the negative self-Kerr nonlinearity of qubits to linearize them into resonators. This ultrastrong cross-Kerr coupling between bare modes of qubit-qubit, qubit-photon, and even photon-photon is ideal for applications such as single microwave photon detection, ultrafast two-qubit gates, and readout.

TI Winning a CHSH Game without Entangled Particles in a Finite Number of
   Biased Rounds: How Much Luck Is Needed?
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum games, such as the CHSH game, are used to illustrate the puzzle and power of entanglement. These games are played over many rounds and in each round, the participants, Alice and Bob, each receive a question bit to which they each have to give an answer bit, without being able to communicate during the game. When all possible classical answering strategies are analyzed, it is found that Alice and Bob cannot win more than 75% of the rounds. A higher percentage of wins arguably requires an exploitable bias in the random generation of the question bits or access to "non-local" resources, such as entangled pairs of particles. However, in an actual game, the number of rounds has to be finite and question regimes may come up with unequal likelihood, so there is always a possibility that Alice and Bob win by pure luck. This statistical possibility has to be transparently analyzed for practical applications such as the detection of eavesdropping in quantum communication. Similarly, when Bell tests are used in macroscopic situations to investigate the connection strength between system components and the validity of proposed causal models, the available data are limited and the possible combinations of question bits (measurement settings) may not be controlled to occur with equal likelihood. In the present work, we give a fully self-contained proof for a bound on the probability to win a CHSH game by pure luck without making the usual assumption of only small biases in the random number generators. We also show bounds for the case of unequal probabilities based on results from McDiarmid and Combes and numerically illustrate certain exploitable biases.

TI Error Performance of Amplitude Shift Keying-Type Asymmetric Quantum
   Communication Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose an amplitude shift keying-type asymmetric quantum communication (AQC) system that uses an entangled state. As a first step toward development of this system, we evaluated and considered the communication performance of the proposed receiver when applied to the AQC system using a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TSVS), the maximum quasi-Bell state, and the non-maximum quasi-Bell state, along with an asymmetric classical communication (ACC) system using the coherent state. Specifically, we derived an analytical expression for the error probability of the AQC system using the quasi-Bell state. Comparison of the error probabilities of the ACC system and the AQC systems when using the TSVS and the quasi-Bell state shows that the AQC system using the quasi-Bell state offers a clear performance advantage under specific conditions. Additionally, it was clarified that there are cases where the universal lower bound on the error probability for the AQC system was almost achieved when using the quasi-Bell state, unlike the case in which the TSVS was used.

TI Continuous-variable multipartite entanglement in an integrated microcomb
SO NATURE
AB The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6, 7, 8, 9, 10-11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19-20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock-Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing. This work shows the potential of continuous-variable integrated photonic quantum devices for facilitating quantum computing, networking and sensing.

TI Unveiling the importance of nonshortest paths in quantum networks
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. We apply a statistical physics model-concurrence percolation-to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the (U, V) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, <= V. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.

TI Unitarization of pseudo-unitary quantum circuits in the S-matrix
   framework
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Pseudo-unitary circuits are recurring in both S-matrix theory and analysis of No-Go theorems. We propose a matrix and diagrammatic representation for the operation that maps S-matrices to T-matrices and, consequently, a unitary group to a pseudo-unitary one. We call this operation 'partial inversion' and show its diagrammatic representation in terms of permutations. We find the expressions for the deformed metrics and deformed dot products that preserve physical constraints after partial inversion. Subsequently, we define a special set that allows for the simplification of expressions containing infinities in matrix inversion. Finally, we propose a renormalized-growth algorithm for the T-matrix as a possible application. The outcomes of our study expand the methodological toolbox needed to build a family of pseudo-unitary and inter-pseudo-unitary circuits with full diagrammatic representation in three dimensions, so that they can be used to exploit pseudo-unitary flexibilization of unitary No-Go theorems and renormalized circuits of large scattering lattices.

TI Higher-order incompatibility improves distinguishability of causal
   quantum networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Higher-order quantum theory deals with causal quantum processes, described by quantum combs, and test procedures, described by quantum testers, 'measuring' these processes. In this work, we show that 'jointly non-implementable' or incompatible quantum testers perform better in distinguishability tasks than their compatible counterparts. To demonstrate our finding, we consider a specific two-party game based on distinguishing quantum combs. We show that the player does better at winning the game when they have exclusive access to incompatible testers over compatible ones. Moreover, we show that, using the resource theoretic measure convex weight, any general quantum resource present in testers is resourceful in quantum comb exclusion tasks. These investigations generalise, respectively, an earlier finding that incompatibility of quantum observables to be a bona fide resource in quantum state distinguishability tasks and another finding that any resource present in observables result in improved performance in state exclusion or antidistinguishability tasks.<br />

AB In this work the Madelung picture is applied to the single qubit systems. The projective aspect of the Madelung quantities and the polar expression of the components of the quantum state allow one to obtain a general dynamical system of equations. Even though this dynamical system of equations is nonlinear, it offers the advantage of designing single quibt gates in a straightforward manner. It only requires the specification of the initial and final points on the Bloch sphere, as well as the gate operation time. This application of the Madelung picture is particularily illustrated for the nuclear magnetic resonance processor case. It turns the problem of specifying the magnetic fields into a simpler problem of substitution.

TI Circuit-QED based time-averaged dispersive readout of a semiconductor
   charge qubit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Maturing hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures composed of semiconductor quantum dots and on-chip microwave resonators promise an effective approach for quantum nondemolition readouts in semiconductor systems. Here, we study quantum coherence in a semiconductor charge qubit coupled with a high-impedance resonator. The qubit is controlled by a periodic pulse sequence, and a dispersive measurement is performed by measuring the time-averaged resonator response. From the Rabi oscillation and Ramsey fringe measurements, the coherence time of the charge qubit is determined as T 2 , Rabi & AP; 2.7 ns and T 2 , Ramsey & AP; 3.5 ns. Compared with the time-resolved (pulsed) measurement, this time-averaged dispersive measurement process eliminates the limitation caused by the resonator response time, enabling a high repetition rate of the pulse sequence in the experiments.

TI Semantic Analysis of a Linear Temporal Extension of Quantum Logic and
   Its Dynamic Aspect
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC
AB Although various dynamic or temporal logics have been proposed to verify quantum protocols and systems, these two viewpoints have not been studied comprehensively enough. We propose Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (LTQL), a linear temporal extension of quantum logic with a quantum implication, and extend it to Dynamic Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (DLTQL). This logic has temporal operators to express transitions by unitary operators (quantum gates) and dynamic ones to express those by projections (projective measurement). We then prove some logical properties of the relationship between these two transitions expressed by LTQL and DLTQL. A drawback in applying LTQL to the verification of quantum protocols is that these logics cannot express the future operator in linear temporal logic. We propose a way to mitigate this drawback by using a translation from (D)LTQL to Linear Temporal Modal Logic (LTML) and a simulation. This translation reduces the satisfiability problem of (D)LTQL formulas to that of LTML with the classical semantics over quantum states.

TI Spectrum analysis with parametrically modulated transmon qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Exploring the noise spectrum impacting a qubit and extending its coherence duration are fundamental components of quantum technologies. In this study, we introduce parametric spectroscopy, a method that merges parametric modulation of a qubit's energy gap with dynamical decoupling sequences. The parametric modulation provides high sensitivity to extensive regions of the noise spectrum, while dynamical decoupling reduces the effect of driving noise. Our theoretical study shows that parametric spectroscopy enables access to the difficult high-frequency domain of the flux spectrum in transmons.

TI QDNN: deep neural networks with quantum layers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper, a quantum extension of classical deep neural network (DNN) is introduced, which is called QDNN and consists of quantum structured layers. It is proved that the QDNN can uniformly approximate any continuous function and has more representation power than the classical DNN. Moreover, the QDNN still keeps the advantages of the classical DNN such as the non-linear activation, the multi-layer structure, and the efficient backpropagation training algorithm. Furthermore, the QDNN uses parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) as the basic building blocks and hence can be used on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. A numerical experiment for an image classification task based on QDNN is given, where a high accuracy rate is achieved.

TI Magnetometry of neurons using a superconducting qubit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Iron plays important physiological and pathological roles in the human body. However, microscopic analysis including redox status by a conventional electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. Here we demonstrate magnetometry of cultured neurons on a polymeric film using a superconducting flux qubit that works as a sensitive magnetometer in a microscale area towards realizing ESR spectroscopy. By changing temperature (12.5-200 mK) and a magnetic field (2.5-12.5 mT), we observe a clear magnetization signal from the neurons that is well above the control magnetometry of the polymeric film itself. From ESR spectrum measured at 10 K, the magnetization signal is identified to originate from electron spins of iron ions in neurons. This technique to detect a bio-spin system can be extended to achieve ESR spectroscopy at the single-cell level, which will give the spectroscopic fingerprint of cells.
   Iron is one of the most abundant trace elements in the human body, however, detection at a single-cell level with redox status is challenging. Here, the authors demonstrate magnetometry of neurons with a microscale magnetometer using a superconducting flux qubit, and Fe (III) ions in the cells are identified at a single-cell level spatial resolution.

TI Training Hybrid Classical-Quantum Classifiers via Stochastic Variational
   Optimization
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Quantum machine learning has emerged as a potential practical application of near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study a two-layer hybrid classical-quantum classifier in which a first layer of quantum stochastic neurons implementing generalized linear models (QGLMs) is followed by a second classical combining layer. The input to the first, hidden, layer is obtained via amplitude encoding in order to leverage the exponential size of the fan-in of the quantum neurons in the number of qubits per neuron. To facilitate implementation of the QGLMs, all weights and activations are binary. While the state of the art on training strategies for this class of models is limited to exhaustive search and single-neuron perceptron-like bit-flip strategies, this letter introduces a stochastic variational optimization approach that enables the joint training of quantum and classical layers via stochastic gradient descent. Experiments show the advantages of the approach for a variety of activation functions implemented by QGLM neurons.

TI Multi-path-based quasi-real-time key provisioning in
   quantum-key-distribution enabled optical networks (QKD-ON)
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB With its information-theoretic security, quantum-key-distribution-enabled optical networks (QKD-ON) have become a promising candidate for future optical networks. The concept of quantum key pool (QKP) was introduced to offer an effective strategy for storing quantum keys. However, with the loss on its theoretical security due to storing these keys, balancing the storage of quantum keys and the security requirements of QKD-ONs poses a major challenge in their practical deployments. Hence, in this paper a concept of quasi-real-time key provisioning (QRT-KP) is introduced to address the tradeoff between quantum key storage and the degree of security. To satisfy the practical deployment of QRT-KP and the requirement of high-traffic flow, we propose a multi-path based QRT-KP (MP-QRT-KP) algorithm. Simulation results show that the MP-QRT-KP effectively enhances the performance of QKD-ONs in different scenarios, and it turns out that the algorithm performs better than single-path based QRT-KP (SP-QRT-KP) in terms of the success probability of key-allocation requests and key-resources utilization.

TI Simultaneous Operations in a Two-Dimensional Array of Singlet-Triplet
   Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In many physical approaches to quantum computation, error-correction schemes assume the ability to form two-dimensional qubit arrays with nearest-neighbor couplings and parallel operations at multiple qubit sites. While semiconductor spin qubits exhibit long coherence times relative to their operation speed and single-qubit fidelities above error correction thresholds, multiqubit operations in two-dimensional arrays have been limited by fabrication, operation, and readout challenges. We present a two-by-two array of four singlet-triplet qubits in gallium arsenide and show simultaneous coherent operations and four-qubit measurements via exchange oscillations and frequency-multiplexed single-shot measurements. A larger multielectron quantum dot is fabricated in the center of the array as a tunable interqubit link, which we utilize to demonstrate coherent spin exchange with selected qubits. Our techniques are extensible to other materials, indicating a path towards quantum processors with gate-controlled spin qubits.

TI Fiber-compatible photonic feed-forward with 99% fidelity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Both photonic quantum computation and the establishment of a quantum internet require fiber-based measurement and feed-forward in order to be compatible with existing infrastructure. Here we present a fiber-compatible scheme for measurement and feed-forward, whose performance is benchmarked by carrying out remote preparation of single-photon polarization states at telecom-wavelengths. The result of a projective measurement on one photon deterministically controls the path a second photon takes with ultrafast optical switches. By placing well-calibrated bulk passive polarization optics in the paths, we achieve a measurement and feed-forward fidelity of (99.0 +/- 1)%, after correcting for other experimental errors. Our methods are useful for photonic quantum experiments including computing, communication, and teleportation.

TI Towards a fictitious magnetic field trap for both ground and Rydberg
   state 87Rb atoms via the evanescent field of an optical
   nanofiber
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap. Here, we propose a trap for Rb-87 cold atoms that confines both the electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofiber (ONF) guided light and an external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarizations, and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by the nanofiber-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with ONFs to generate 1D atom arrays.

TI Time-multiplexed polarization drift compensation for

AB Polarization drift due to propagation medium birefringence is a primary cause increased quantum bit error ratio (QBER) in polarization-encoded quantum key distribution (QKD). The random nature of polarization drift and environmental instabilities cause it to vary over time, necessitating algorithms for effective polarization drift compensation in polarization encoded optical fiber QKD links. I propose an algorithm based on processing time-multiplexed control pulses by unscented Kalman filter that minimizes the number of additional measurements that interrupt key exchange. I evaluated the robustness of the algorithm under various conditions, including random polarization drift velocities, and additional noise due to depolarization for weak coherent BB84-like protocols, to determine the applicability limits of the proposed algorithm and its overhead.

TI Absorptive filters for quantum circuits: Efficient fabrication and
   cryogenic power handling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present an efficient fabrication method for absorptive microwave filters based on Eccosorb CR-124. Filters are fabricated from readily available parts, and their cutoff frequency can be set by their length. They exhibit desirable properties such as a very large and deep stop band with rejection beyond 120 dB at least up to 40 GHz, more than 10 dB return loss in both the pass and the stop band, and an error-function shaped step response without overshoot. Measurements at very low temperatures show that the filters thermalize on a time scale of approximately 100 s, and that they can absorb power as high as 100 nW with their noise temperature staying remarkably low, below 100 mK. These properties make the filters ideal for cryogenic filtering and filtering of intermediate frequency port signals of mixers. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI Quantum tug of war between randomness and symmetries on homogeneous
   spaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the interplay between symmetry and randomness in quantum information. Adopting a geometric approach, we consider states as H equivalent if related by a symmetry transformation characterized by the group H. We then introduce the Haar measure on the homogeneous space U /H, characterizing true randomness for H-equivalent systems. While this mathematical machinery is well studied by mathematicians, it has seen limited application in quantum information. Our work addresses this gap, providing an example of utilizing homogeneous spaces to characterize symmetry in quantum information. This is followed by a discussion of approximations of true randomness, commencing with t-wise independent approximations and defining t designs on U /H and H-equivalent states. Transitioning further, we explore pseudorandomness, defining pseudorandom unitaries and states within homogeneous spaces. Finally, as a practical demonstration of our findings, we study the expressibility of quantum machine learning Ans & auml;tze in homogeneous spaces. Our work provides a fresh perspective on the relationship between randomness and symmetry in the quantum world.

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose an implementation of a two-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory model on a shallow quan-tum circuit, involving a number of single-and two-qubit gates comparable to what can be achieved with present-day and near-future technologies. The ground-state preparation is numerically analyzed on a small lattice with a variational quantum algorithm, which requires a small number of parameters to reach high fidelities and can be efficiently scaled up on larger systems. Despite the reduced size of the lattice we consider, a transition between confined and deconfined regimes can be detected by measuring expectation values of Wilson loop operators or the topological entropy. Moreover, if periodic boundary conditions are implemented, the same optimal solution is transferable among all four different topological sectors, without any need for further optimization on the variational parameters. Our work shows that variational quantum algorithms provide a useful technique to be added in the growing toolbox for digital simulations of lattice gauge theories.

Covariance matrices, which are powerful tools in entanglement theory, have been also applied to the network scenario. We present simple proofs for the decomposition of such matrices into the sum of positive semi-definite block matrices and, based on that, develop analytical and computable necessary criteria for preparing states in quantum networks. These criteria can be applied to networks where nodes share at most one source, such as all bipartite networks.

TI Subcarrier wave continuous-variable quantum key distribution with
   Gaussian modulation: composable security analysis
SO COMPUTER OPTICS
AB In this paper, we continue the study of the quantum cryptographic GG02 protocol, performed using the approach based on the subcarrier waves. We modify the scheme via heterodyne detection and perform security analysis for the full trusted hardware noise model in the presence of collective attacks with finite-key effects. It is shown that the system can potentially distribute the key even if the level of losses in the channel is above 9 dB. This result is consistent with the general technical level and comply with modern standards of practical CV-QKD systems. Finally, the system under consideration fully meets the criterion of composability.

TI Energy cost of localization of relational quantum information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Entanglement of spatially separated quantum states is usually defined with respect to a reference frame provided by some external observer. Thus, if one wishes to localize the quantum information within a spatially separated entangled state, one must enact an entanglement extraction protocol also defined with respect to that external frame. Entanglement extraction for Gaussian ground states in such an external frame construction has been shown to require a minimum energy and is hence an interesting process for gravitational physics, where examinations of localization vs energy cost have a long history. General covariance, however, precludes dependence on external frames. In order to enact an extraction protocol in a generally covariant theory, dependence on the external reference frame must first be removed and the states made relational. We examine the implementation of an extraction protocol for Gaussian states, whose center of mass and relational degrees of freedom are entangled, in a relational toy model where translation invariance stands in for full diffeomorphism invariance. Constructing fully relational states and the corresponding extraction/localization can, in principle, be done in two ways. External frame position information can be removed through G-twirling over translations or one can spontaneously break the translation symmetry via the gradient of an auxiliary field, or Z-model. We determine the energetics of quantum information localization after the states have been made fully relational via both the G-twirl and Z-model. We also show one can obtain the G-twirl construction from a Z-model as a limit of positive operator valued measurements.

TI Quantum Circuit Components for Cognitive Decision-Making
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper demonstrates that some non-classical models of human decision-making can be run successfully as circuits on quantum computers. Since the 1960s, many observed cognitive behaviors have been shown to violate rules based on classical probability and set theory. For example, the order in which questions are posed in a survey affects whether participants answer 'yes' or 'no', so the population that answers 'yes' to both questions cannot be modeled as the intersection of two fixed sets. It can, however, be modeled as a sequence of projections carried out in different orders. This and other examples have been described successfully using quantum probability, which relies on comparing angles between subspaces rather than volumes between subsets. Now in the early 2020s, quantum computers have reached the point where some of these quantum cognitive models can be implemented and investigated on quantum hardware, by representing the mental states in qubit registers, and the cognitive operations and decisions using different gates and measurements. This paper develops such quantum circuit representations for quantum cognitive models, focusing particularly on modeling order effects and decision-making under uncertainty. The claim is not that the human brain uses qubits and quantum circuits explicitly (just like the use of Boolean set theory does not require the brain to be using classical bits), but that the mathematics shared between quantum cognition and quantum computing motivates the exploration of quantum computers for cognition modeling. Key quantum properties include superposition, entanglement, and collapse, as these mathematical elements provide a common language between cognitive models, quantum hardware, and circuit implementations.

TI Balancing the Quantum Speed Limit and Instantaneous Energy Cost in
   Adiabatic Quantum Evolution
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Adiabatic time-optimal quantum controls are extensively used in quantum technologies to break the constraints imposed by short coherence times. However, practically it is crucial to consider the trade-off between the quantum evolution speed and instantaneous energy cost of process because of the constraints in the available control Hamiltonian. Here, we experimentally show that using a transmon qubit that, even in the presence of vanishing energy gaps, it is possible to reach a highly time-optimal adiabatic quantum driving at low energy cost in the whole evolution process. This validates the recently derived general solution of the quantum Zermelo navigation problem, paving the way for energy-efficient quantum control which is usually overlooked in conventional speed-up schemes, including the well-known counter-diabatic driving. By designing the control Hamiltonian based on the quantum speed limit bound quantified by the changing rate of phase in the interaction picture, we reveal the relationship between the quantum speed limit and instantaneous energy cost. Consequently, we demonstrate fast and high-fidelity quantum adiabatic processes by employing energy-efficient driving strengths, indicating a promising strategy for expanding the applications of time-optimal quantum controls in superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Modulation of Steady-State Heat Transport in a Dissipative Multi-Mode
   Qubit-Photon System
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum heat transport is considered as an indispensable branch of quantum thermodynamics to potentially improve performance of thermodynamic devices. We theoretically propose a dissipative qubit-photon system composed of multiple coupled resonators interacting with a single two-level qubit, to explore the steady-state heat transport by tuning both the inter-resonator photon hopping and the qubit-photon coupling. Specifically in the three-mode case, the dramatic enhancement and suppression of the heat current into the central resonator can be modulated by the corresponding frequency, compared to the currents into two edge resonators. Moreover, fruitful cycle current components are unraveled at weak qubit-photon coupling, which are crucial to exhibit the nonmonotonic feature with increase of the reservoir temperature bias. In the one-dimensional case under the mean-field framework, the influence of the photon hopping on heat transport is analyzed. The steady-state heat current is comparatively enhanced to the single-mode limit at weak qubit-photon coupling, stemming from the nonvanishing mean-field photon excitation parameter and the additional cycle current component. We hope these obtained results may have possible applications in quantum thermodynamic manipulation and energy harvesting.

TI Spatial Manipulation of Fluorescent Colloidal Nanodiamonds for
   Applications in Quantum Sensing
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are of current interest as quantum sensors, single photon sources, and biological nanomaterials due to their unique optical and spin properties, biocompatibility, and robust structure. Though NV center in diamonds demonstrates longer coherence time and has been used for more sensing and quantum operations compared to nanodiamonds (NDs), the prospect of selecting NDs with single, few, or multiple NV centers and moving the NDs to the location of interest makes NDs suitable for various applications, due to which there is a significant boost in the last decade to manipulate and position the NDs on the surface or to achieve dynamic control in the fluidic environment. This work covers some of the basics of the materials and optical properties of nanodiamonds and discusses the capabilities and challenges for practical applications, followed by a detailed review of the various static and dynamic manipulation methods of nanodiamonds in microfluidic environments (colloidal NDs).
   Fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs) exhibit remarkable structural and optical properties, making them useful for diverse quantum applications ranging from single photon emission, nanophotonic devices to high-resolution sensing. As a result, there is a strong focus on the selection, manipulation, and precise placement of NDs in specific locations, driving active research in this field, which is discussed in this review. image

TI Quantum router: Storing and redirecting light at the photon level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method for spatially rerouting single photons or light in a coherent state with a small average photon number by purely electronic means, i.e., without using mechanical devices such as micromirror arrays. The method is based on mapping the quantum state of the incoming light onto a spin-wave in an atomic ensemble, as is done in quantum memories of light. Then the wave vector of the spin-wave is modified in a controlled way by an applied magnetic field gradient. Finally, by reapplying the same control beam as for storing, the signal pulse is released in a new direction that depends on the deflected wave vector of the spin-wave. We show by numerical simulation that efficiencies can be achieved for arbitrary deflection angles in the plane that are comparable with simple photon storage and reemission in the forward direction, and we propose a method for eliminating the stored momentum as a source of decoherence in the quantum memory. In a reasonable parameter regime, the rerouting should be achievable on a timescale on the order of a few to similar to 100 microseconds, depending on the deflection angle. The shifts in the wave vector that can be achieved using the Zeeman effect, with otherwise minimal changes to the spin-wave, can also be used to complement existing ac-Stark spin-wave manipulation methods.

TI Improving the estimation of environment parameters via a two-qubit
   scheme
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate how using two qubits can drastically improve the estimation of environment parameters compared to using only a single qubit. The two qubits are coupled to a common harmonic oscillator environment, and the properties of the environment are imprinted upon the dynamics of the two qubits. The reduced density matrix of only one of these qubits contains a decoherence factor and an additional factor taking into account the indirect interaction induced between the qubits due to the interaction with their common environment. This additional factor can drastically improve the estimation of the environment parameters, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. In particular, we investigate the estimation of the cutoff frequency, the coupling strength, and the temperature using our two-qubit scheme compared to simply using a single qubit. We find that the precision of the estimates can be improved by orders of magnitude.

AB Quantum computing has shown its strong potential in solving certain important problems. Due to the intrinsic limitations of current real quantum computers, quantum circuit simulation still plays an important role in both research and development of quantum computing. GPU-based quantum circuit simulation has been explored due to GPU's high computation capability. Despite previous efforts, existing quantum circuit simulation systems usually rely on a single method to improve poor data locality caused by complex quantum entanglement. However, we observe that existing simulation methods show significantly different performance for different circuit patterns. The optimal performance cannot be obtained only with any single method.
   To address these challenges, we propose HyQuas, a Hybrid partitioner based Quantum circuit Simulation system on GPU, which can automatically select the suitable simulation method for different parts of a given quantum circuit according to its pattern. Moreover, to make better support for HyQuas, we also propose two highly optimized methods, OShareMem and TransMM, as optional choices of HyQuas. We further propose a GPU-centric communication pipelining approach for effective distributed simulation. Experimental results show that HyQuas can achieve up to 10.71x speedup on a single GPU and 227x speedup on a GPU cluster over state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulation systems.

TI Assessment of the errors of high-fidelity two-qubit gates in silicon
   quantum dots
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Achieving high-fidelity entangling operations between qubits consistently is essential for the performance of multi-qubit systems. Solid-state platforms are particularly exposed to errors arising from materials-induced variability between qubits, which leads to performance inconsistencies. Here we study the errors in a spin qubit processor, tying them to their physical origins. We use this knowledge to demonstrate consistent and repeatable operation with above 99% fidelity of two-qubit gates in the technologically important silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot platform. Analysis of the physical errors and fidelities in multiple devices over extended periods allows us to ensure that we capture the variation and the most common error types. Physical error sources include the slow nuclear and electrical noise on single qubits and contextual noise that depends on the applied control sequence. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems and robust gate design to inform the design of future scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. Our results highlight both the capabilities and challenges for the scaling-up of silicon spin-based qubits into full-scale quantum processors.
   For solid-state qubits, the material environment hosts sources of errors that vary in time and space. This systematic analysis of errors affecting high-fidelity two-qubit gates in silicon can inform the design of large-scale quantum computers.

TI Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a SO(3) non-Abelian lattice
   gauge theory in 2+ 1D with quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian SO(3) lattice gauge theory in 2 + 1D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans & auml;tze in the Gauss-law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest-energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics-such as the energy and the infidelity-to assess the obtained results.

TI Experimental Bayesian estimation of quantum state preparation,
   measurement, and gate errors in multiqubit devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a Bayesian method for the estimation of single-qubit errors in quantum devices, and use it to characterize these errors on three superconducting 27-qubit devices. We self-consistently estimate up to seven parameters of each qubit's state preparation, readout, and gate errors, analyze the stability of these errors as a function of time, and demonstrate easily implemented approaches for mitigating different errors before a quantum computation experiment. On the investigated devices we find non-negligible qubit reset errors that cannot be parametrized as a diagonal mixed state, but manifest as a coherent phase in a superposition with a small contribution from the qubit's excited state. We are able to mitigate such errors by applying prerotations on the initialized qubits, which we demonstrate with multiqubit entangled states. Our results show that Bayesian estimation can resolve small parameters-including those pertaining to quantum gate errors-with a high relative accuracy, at a lower measurement cost as compared with standard characterization approaches.

TI Interatomic Potential For Carbon Based Quantum-Technology Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB To optimize parameters for laser processing of quantum-technology relevant materials, such as diamond, precise atomistic simulations of the light-matter interaction on large scales (on the order of 10(7) atoms) are essential. Classical empirical interatomic potentials are commonly employed for simulating such a large number of atoms, however they fail to accurately capture all relevant effects of light-matter interaction. Conversely, ab initio methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) can effectively incorporate quantum properties arising from photon excitations, but their applicability is limited to small systems containing at most approximately 10(3) atoms. Consequently, bridging the gap between achieving DFT precision and handling millions of atoms necessitates the development of innovative classes of interatomic potentials. In this paper, the construction of a highly accurate interatomic potential for diamond is presented, derived from an extensive dataset of DFT calculations. The parameters of the interatomic potential depend on the electronic temperature (T-e). The findings demonstrate that this newly developed interatomic potential can aptly describe the laser processing of diamond for nanophotonic applications, achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio methods for large systems.

TI Quantum protocol for secure multiparty XOR with application to secure
   communication in metropolitan area networks
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB This study first defined a new privacy protection problem, namely, quantum secure multiparty logical XOR (SMC_ XOR), and then designed corresponding quantum circuits where multiple participants could jointly calculate the logical XOR of their respective private bits. The proposed quantum SMC_XOR protocol can ensure unconditional security, i.e., information -theoretical security. Furthermore, we designed a grouping strategy to reduce communication complexity and presented an improved quantum SMC_XOR protocol. The improved quantum protocol is used to secure communication in metropolitan area networks, allowing two remote users to securely transmit confidential messages. Finally, we verified the correctness and feasibility of the proposed quantum SMC_XOR protocol by conducting circuit simulations on the IBM quantum system in Qiskit.

TI High-Fidelity Qubit Readout Using Interferometric Directional Josephson
   Devices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Nonreciprocal microwave devices, such as circulators and isolators, are needed in high-fidelity qubit readout schemes to unidirectionally route the readout signals and protect the qubits against noise coming from the output chain. However, cryogenic circulators and isolators are prohibitive in scalable supercon-ducting architectures because they rely on magnetic materials. Here we report a fast (750 ns) high-fidelity (95%) quantum nondemolition readout of a coherent superconducting qubit (T-1 = 52 mu s, T-2E = 35 mu s) without any nonreciprocal magnetic devices. We use in our readout chain a microwave-controlled qubit readout multichip module (QRMCM) that integrates interferometric directional Josephson devices con-sisting of an isolator and a reconfigurable isolator or amplifier device, and an off-chip low-pass filter. Using the QRMCM, we demonstrate isolation up to 45 dB within 13 MHz, when both directional devices are operated as isolators, and low-noise amplification in excess of 10 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of 10 MHz, when the reconfigurable device is operated as an amplifier. We also investigate the dependence of the qubit coherence times T-phi and T-2E on the isolation response of the QRMCM, which we control in situ using the microwave drives feeding the isolators. Furthermore, by directly comparing the QRMCM performance with that of a state-of-art configuration (with T-2E approximate to 2T(1)) that uses a pair of wideband mag-netic isolators, we find that the excess pure dephasing measured with the QRMCM (for which T-2E approximate to T-1) is likely limited by the residual thermal photon population in the readout resonator. Improved versions of the QRMCM could replace magnetic circulators and isolators in large superconducting quantum processors.

TI Quantum Sensing of Free Radical Generation in Mitochondria of Single
   Heart Muscle Cells during Hypoxia and Reoxygenation
SO ACS NANO
AB Cells are damaged during hypoxia (blood supply deprivation) and reoxygenation (oxygen return). This damage occurs in conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and organ transplantation, potentially harming the tissue and organs. The role of free radicals in cellular metabolic reprogramming under hypoxia is under debate, but their measurement is challenging due to their short lifespan and limited diffusion range. In this study, we employed a quantum sensing technique to measure the real-time production of free radicals at the subcellular level. We utilize fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) that exhibit changes in their optical properties based on the surrounding magnetic noise. This way, we were able to detect the presence of free radicals. To specifically monitor radical generation near mitochondria, we coated the FNDs with an antibody targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (anti-VDAC2), which is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria. We observed a significant increase in the radical load on the mitochondrial membrane when cells were exposed to hypoxia. Subsequently, during reoxygenation, the levels of radicals gradually decreased back to the normoxia state. Overall, by applying a quantum sensing technique, the connections among hypoxia, free radicals, and the cellular redox status has been revealed.

TI Realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We analyze realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) arising from the combination of laser damage attack (LDA) and unambiguous state discrimination (USD). While decoy-state QKD is designed to protect against photon-number-splitting and beam-splitting attacks by accurately estimating the single-photon fraction, it relies on stable attenuation to prepare pulses with fixed mean-photon numbers. An eavesdropper (Eve) can exploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side, effectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security regime. We show that once the alteration exceeds a critical threshold-on the order of 10-20 dB-Eve can implement an efficient USD-based intercept-resend strategy using current off-the-shelf technology, thus obtaining the entire secret key. Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated mean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state statistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further demonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can reduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack. Additionally, we introduce the pseudo-photon-number resolution USD attack, which allows Eve to emulate all observable gains at Bob's side so that she remains fully undetectable even with advanced statistical checks. Our findings emphasize the need for robust safeguards against high-power laser damage in QKD systems, including careful hardware selection, rigorous testing under high-power illumination, and real-time monitoring to ensure the integrity of the decoy-state protocol.

TI Fast universal control of a flux qubit via exponentially tunable
   wave-function overlap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fast, high-fidelity control and readout of protected superconducting qubits are fundamentally challenging due to their inherent insensitivity. We propose a flux qubit variation which enjoys a tunable level of protection against relaxation to resolve this outstanding issue. Our qubit design, the double-shunted flux qubit (DSFQ), realizes a generic double-well potential through its three-junction ring geometry. One of the junctions is tunable, making it possible to control the barrier height and thus the level of protection. We analyze single- and two-qubit gate operations that rely on lowering the barrier. We show that this is a viable method that results in high-fidelity gates as the noncomputational states are not occupied during operations. Further, we show how the effective coupling to a readout resonator can be controlled by adjusting the externally applied flux while the DSFQ is protected from decaying into the readout resonator. Finally, we also study a double-loop gradiometric version of the DSFQ which is exponentially insensitive to variations in the global magnetic field, even when the loop areas are nonidentical.

TI Quantum annealing for neural network optimization problems: A new
   approach via tensor network simulations
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Here, we focus on the problem of minimizing complex classical cost functions associated with prototypical discrete neural networks, specifically the paradigmatic Hopfield model and binary perceptron. We show that the adiabatic time evolution of QA can be efficiently represented as a suitable Tensor Network. This representation allows for simple classical simulations, well-beyond small sizes amenable to exact diagonalization techniques. We show that the optimized state, expressed as a Matrix Product State (MPS), can be recast into a Quantum Circuit, whose depth scales only linearly with the system size and quadratically with the MPS bond dimension. This may represent a valuable starting point allowing for further circuit optimization on near-term quantum devices.

SO ACS NANO
AB Defect emitters in silicon are promising contenders as building blocks of solid-state quantum repeaters and sensor networks. Here, we investigate a family of possible isoelectronic emitter defect complexes from a design standpoint. We show that the identification of key physical effects on quantum defect state localization can guide the search for telecom-wavelength emitters. We demonstrate this by performing first-principles calculations on the Q center, predicting its charged sodium variants possessing ideal emission wavelength near the lowest-loss telecom bands and ground state spin for possible spin-photon interface and nanoscale spin sensor applications yet to be explored in experiments.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study different quantum circuits that can discriminate between two arbitrary quantum evolution operators. These circuits can be used to check whether two quantum operators are equal or not and to estimate a fidelity measure telling how close the operators are. This operator comparison is related to the SWAP test for discriminating two quantum states. In terms of their practical realization, we comment possible laboratory implementations with light along the same lines of recent experimental realizations of quantum superpositions of causal orders exploiting the different degrees of freedom of photons. We also discuss hardware efficient realizations for noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. Finally, we comment potential applications to the discrimination of quantum communication channels and to the search for simpler quantum circuits in quantum compilers.

TI Analysis of loss correction with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a promising bosonic quantum error-correcting code, encoding logical qubits into a bosonic mode in such a way that many physically relevant noise types can be corrected effectively. A particularly relevant noise channel is the pure loss channel, which the GKP code is known to protect against. In particular, it is commonly pointed out that losses can be corrected by the GKP code by transforming the losses into random Gaussian displacements through a quantum-limited amplification channel. However, implementing such amplification in practice is not ideal and could easily introduce an additional overhead of noise from associated experimental imperfections. Here, we analyze the performance of teleportation-based GKP error correction against loss in the absence of an amplification channel. We show that amplification is not required to perform GKP error correction and that performing amplification actually worsens the performance for practically relevant parameter regimes.

TI Optical transmitter for time-bin encoding quantum key distribution
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce an electro-optical arrangement that can produce time-bin encoded symbols with the decoy state method over a standard optical fiber in the C-band telecom window. The device consists of a specifically designed pulse pattern generator for pulse production and a field-programmable gate array that controls timing and synchronization. The electrical pulse output drives a sequence of intensity modulators acting on a continuous laser that deliver bursts of weak optical pulse pairs of discrete intensity values. Such a transmitter allows for the generation of all the quantum states needed to implement a discrete variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol over a single-mode fiber channel. Symbols are structured in bursts; the minimum relative delay between pulses is 1.25 ns, and the maximum symbol rate within a burst is 200 MHz. We tested the transmitter on simulated optical channels of 7 dB and 14 dB loss, obtaining maximum extractable secure key rates of 3.0 kb/s and 0.57 kb/s, respectively. Time-bin-state parameters such as the symbol rate, pulse separation, and intensity ratio between the signal and decoy states can be easily accessed and changed, allowing the transmitter to adapt to different experimental conditions and contributing to the standardization of QKD implementations.

TI Deep-learning-based quantum imaging using NOON states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The phase sensitivity of photonic NOON states scales O(1/N), which reaches the Heisenberg limit and indicates a great potential in high-quality optical phase sensing. However, the NOON states with large photon number N are experimentally difficult both to prepare and to operate. Such a fact severely limits their practical use. In this article, we soften the requirements for high-quality imaging based on NOON states with large N by introducing deep-learning methods. Specifically, we show that, with the help of deep-learning network, the fluctuation of the images obtained by the NOON states when N = 2 can be reduced to that of the currently infeasible imaging by the NOON states when N = 8. We numerically investigate our results obtained by two types of deep-learning models-deep neural network and convolutional denoising autoencoders, and characterize the imaging quality using the root mean square error. By comparison, we find that small-N NOON state imaging data is sufficient for training the deep-learning models of our schemes, which supports its direct application to the imaging processes.

TI CPSR-HQKDN: A Hybrid Trusted Relay Quantum Key Distribution Network
   Routing Scheme Based on Classification of Packet Security Requirements
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB To ensure the security of information exchange in software-defined optical networks, quantum key distribution (QKD) based on quantum mechanics is introduced. However, the slow and valuable process of generating quantum key resources contradicts the high-speed data transmission requirements of optical networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes the CPSR-HQKDN scheme, which takes into account factors such as security requests, key demand, key residual, and key update rates for trusted and untrusted links. This approach improves resource utilization and service efficiency by optimizing the processing order of key requests. Moreover, the routing strategy dynamically adjusts based on the network resource environment, thereby increasing the success rate of key requests. Through simulation experiments comparing the performance of the CPSR-HQKDN routing scheme with existing schemes, it is observed that in high-concurrent scenarios, the CPSR-HQKDN routing scheme can improve the success rate of key requests by at least 5%.

TI Analyzing Prospects for Quantum Advantage in Topological Data Analysis
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Lloyd et al. [Nat. Commun. 7, 10138 (2016)] were first to demonstrate the promise of quantum algorithms for computing Betti numbers, a way to characterize topological features of data sets. Here, we propose, analyze, and optimize an improved quantum algorithm for topological data analysis (TDA) with reduced scaling, including a method for preparing Dicke states based on inequality testing, a more efficient amplitude estimation algorithm using Kaiser windows, and an optimal implementation of eigenvalue projectors based on Chebyshev polynomials. We compile our approach to a fault-tolerant gate set and estimate constant factors in the Toffoli complexity. Our analysis reveals that superquadratic quantum speedups are only possible for this problem when targeting a multiplicative error approximation and the Betti number grows asymptotically. Further, we propose a dequantization of the quantum TDA algorithm that shows that having exponentially large dimension and Betti number are necessary, but insufficient conditions, for superpolynomial advantage. We then introduce and analyze specific problem examples which have parameters in the regime where superpolynomial advantages may be achieved, and argue that quantum circuits with tens of billions of Toffoli gates can solve seemingly classically intractable instances.

TI HNN-QCn: Hybrid Neural Network with Multiple Backbones and
   Quantum Transformation as Data Augmentation Technique
SO AI
AB Purpose: The impact of hybrid quantum-classical neural network (NN) architectures with multiple backbones and quantum transformation as a data augmentation (DA) technique on image classification tasks was investigated using the CIFAR-10 and MedMNIST (DermaMNIST) datasets. These datasets were chosen for their relevance in general-purpose and medical-specific small-scale image classification, respectively. Methods: A series of quanvolutional transformations, utilizing random quantum circuits based on single-qubit rotation quantum gates (Y-axis, X-axis, and combined XY-axis transformations), were applied to create multiple quantum channels (QC) for input augmentation. By integrating these QCs with baseline convolutional NN architectures (LCNet050) and scalable hybrid NN architectures with multiple (n) backbones and separate QC (n) inputs (HNN-QCn), the scalability and performance enhancements offered by quantum-inspired data augmentation were evaluated. The proposed cross-validation workflow ensured reproducibility and systematic performance evaluation of hybrid models by mean and standard deviation values of metrics (such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic). Results: The results demonstrated consistent performance improvements by AUC and accuracy in HNN-QCn models with the number n (where n is an element of{4,5,9,10,17,18}) of backbones and QC inputs across both datasets. The different improvement rates were observed for the smaller increase in AUC and the larger increase in accuracy as input complexity (number of backbones and QCs inputs) increases. It is assumed that the prediction probability distribution is becoming sharpened with the addition of backbones and QC inputs, leading to larger improvements in accuracy. At the same time, AUC reflects these changes more slowly unless the model's ranking ability improves substantially. Conclusion: The findings highlight the scalability, robustness, and adaptability of HNN-QCn architectures, with superior performance by AUC (micro and macro) and accuracy across diverse datasets and potential for applications in high-stakes domains like medical imaging. These results underscore the utility of quantum transformations as a form of DA, paving the way for further exploration into the scalability and efficiency of hybrid architectures in complex datasets and real-world scenarios.

TI Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-Bond Qubit in a Double Quantum Dot with Circuit-QED
   Operation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads. Defining a qubit using these singlet-parity bonding states provides dotcharge-noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a double-quantum-dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit-quantumelectrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR-bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.

TI Narrow Optical Transitions in Erbium-Implanted Silicon Waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The realization of a scalable architecture for quantum information processing is a major challenge for quantum science. A promising approach is based on emitters in nanostructures that are coupled by light. Here, we show that erbium dopants can be reproducibly integrated at well-defined lattice sites by implantation into pure silicon. We thus achieve a narrow inhomogeneous broadening, less than 1 GHz, strong optical transitions, and an outstanding optical coherence even at temperatures of 8 K, with an upper bound to the homogeneous linewidth of around 10 kHz. Our study thus introduces a promising materials platform for the implementation of on-chip quantum memories, microwave-to-optical conversion, and distributed quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Oscillator Noise Spectroscopy via Displaced Cat States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum harmonic oscillators are central to many modem quantum technologies. We introduce a method to determine the frequency noise spectrum of oscillator modes through coupling them to a qubit with continuously driven qubit-state-dependent displacements. We reconstruct the noise spectrum using a series of different drive phase and amplitude modulation patterns in conjunction with a data-fusion routine based on convex optimization. We apply the technique to the identification of intrinsic noise in the motional frequency of a single trapped ion with sensitivity to fluctuations at the sub-Hz level in a spectral range from quasi-dc up to 50 kHz.

AB Quantum feedback makes the execution of dynamic quantum circuits possible and is widely used in quantum algorithms. However, due to the inherent computation and transmission cost, the latency of the quantum feedback becomes a considerable burden on the current quantum algorithm. The dynamic property of the feedback also makes the gates blocked until the feedback is finished. In this paper, we propose ARTERY, which uses branch prediction to support instruction pre-execution and speed up the feedback. ARTERY integrates historical statistics of branches and a real-time readout pulse analysis to predict the branch. With this idea, we build up a reconciled branch predictor that concatenates the historical statistics of branches and a real-time branch circuit speculation obtained from the readout-pulse trajectory predictor. We further explore the implementation of peripheral hardware for feedback, including a scalable inter-FPGA connection via the backplane, a feedback trigger mechanism for dynamic instruction timing, and an adaptive pulse sampling technique to maximize the hardware bandwidth. ARTERY accelerates quantum feedback process by 2.07x compared to the state-of-the-art method, with over 90% prediction accuracy, achieving 1.24x fidelity improvement.

TI Quantum Software Components and Platforms: Overview and Quality
   Assessment
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Quantum computing is the latest revolution in computing and will probably come to be seen as an advance as important as the steam engine or the information society. In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.

TI Reducing Entanglement with Physically Inspired Fermion-To-Qubit Mappings
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In ab initio electronic structure simulations, fermion-to-qubit mappings represent the initial encoding step from the problem of fermions into a problem of qubits. This work introduces a physically inspired method for constructing mappings that significantly simplify entanglement requirements when one is simulating states of interest. The presence of electronic excitations drives the construction of our mappings, reducing correlations for target states in the qubit space. To benchmark our method, we simulate ground-states of small molecules and observe an enhanced performance when compared with classical and quantum variational approaches from prior research using conventional mappings. In particular, on the quantum side, our mappings require a reduced number of entangling layers to achieve accuracy for LiH, H-2, (H-2)(2), H-4(not equal) stretching, and benzene's pi system using the RY hardware-efficient ansatz. In addition, our mappings also provide an enhanced ground-state simulation performance in the density matrix renormalization group algorithm for the N-2 molecule.

AB What does it mean to commit to a quantum state? In this work, we propose a simple answer: a commitment to quantum messages is binding if, after the commit phase, the committed state is hidden from the sender's view. We accompany this new definition with several instantiations. We build the first non-interactive succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially weaker than one-way functions.
   Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a quantum-communication version of Kilian's succinct arguments for any language that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality. Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under significantly weaker assumptions than required classically; moreover, if the quantum PCP conjecture holds, this extends to QMA. At the heart of our security proof is a new rewinding technique for extracting quantum information.

Recently, a novel approach using machine learning was introduced to address this challenge. The idea is to 'embed' nontrivial quantum correlations (quantum entanglement) into artificial neural networks. Through intensive developments, artificial neural network methods are becoming new powerful tools for analyzing quantum many-body problems. Among various artificial neural networks, this topical review focuses on Boltzmann machines and provides an overview of recent developments and applications.

Examples include but not limited to: muon scattering can occur at large angles, providing evidence of potential muon-philic dark matter or dark mediator candidates; muon-electron scattering can be used to detect new types of bosons associated with charged lepton flavor violation; precise measurements of GeV-scale muon-electron scattering can be employed to probe quantum correlations. This paper is a brief review of several relevant works.

TI Rydberg-Atom Graphs for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
   Problems
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB There is a growing interest in harnessing the potential of the Rydberg-atom system to address complex combinatorial optimization challenges. Here an experimental demonstration of how the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem can be effectively addressed using Rydberg-atom graphs is presented. The Rydberg-atom graphs are configurations of neutral atoms organized into mathematical graphs, facilitated by programmable optical tweezers, and designed to exhibit many-body ground states that correspond to the maximum independent set (MIS) of their respective graphs. Four elementary Rydberg-atom subgraph components are developed, not only to eliminate the need of local control but also to be robust against interatomic distance errors, while serving as the building blocks sufficient for formulating generic QUBO graphs. To validate the feasibility of the approach, a series of Rydberg-atom experiments selected to demonstrate proof-of-concept operations of these building blocks are conducted. These experiments illustrate how these components can be used to programmatically encode the QUBO problems to Rydberg-atom graphs and, by measuring their many-body ground states, how their QUBO solutions are determined subsequently.
   The study introduces and experimentally demonstrates the implementation of the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem using Rydberg atoms. Currently, QUBO stands as the most widely employed quantum algorithm in annealing-type quantum computing hardware, such as D-wave machines. The presented Rydberg-atom approach is expected to benefit from its ease of qubit connectivity and extended coherent operations. image

TI Solving the vehicle routing problem via quantum support vector machines
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is an example of a combinatorial optimization problem that has attracted academic attention due to its potential use in various contexts. VRP aims to arrange vehicle deliveries to several sites in the most efficient and economical manner possible. Quantum machine learning offers a new way to obtain solutions by harnessing the natural speedups of quantum effects, although many solutions and methodologies are modified using classical tools to provide excellent approximations of the VRP. In this paper, we employ 6 and 12 qubit circuits, respectively, to build and evaluate a hybrid quantum machine learning approach for solving VRP of 3- and 4-city scenarios. The approach employs quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) trained using a variational quantum eigensolver on a static or dynamic ansatz. Different encoding strategies are used in the experiment to transform the VRP formulation into a QSVM and solve it. Multiple optimizers from the IBM Qiskit framework are also evaluated and compared

TI Hiding and masking quantum information in complex and real quantum
   mechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Classical information can be completely hidden in the correlations of bipartite quantum systems. However, it is impossible to hide or mask all quantum information according to the no-hiding and no-masking theorems derived recently. Here we show that any set of informationally complete quantum states is neither hidable nor maskable, thereby strengthening the no-hiding and no-masking theorems known before. Then, by virtue of Hurwitz-Radon matrices (representations of the Clifford algebra), we show that information about real quantum states can be completely hidden in the correlations, although the minimum dimension of the composite Hilbert space required increases exponentially with the dimension of the original Hilbert space. Moreover, the set of real quantum states is a maximal maskable set within quantum theory and has a surprising connection with maximally entangled states. These results offer valuable insight on the potential and limit of hiding and masking quantum information, which are of intrinsic interest to a number of active research areas.

TI Security analysis of discretized polar modulation continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In experimental setups of Gaussian modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), the amplitude and phase of coherent states will be modulated and discretized due to the finite resolution of voltages that drive electro-optical modulators, resulting in Gaussian modulation discretization. We demonstrate that the impact of discretization on CV-QKD can be described as a multiplicative coefficient experimentally and modeled as a preparation noise imposed on ideal Gaussian modulation theoretically. To obtain an accurate estimation of quadrature fluctuation induced by discretized polar modulation, a data-filtering process named preselection can be applied before state transmission. Numerical results show that when amplitude resolution is 0.25 and phase resolution is 0.02, discretized polar modulation enables a transmission distance of 69 km under homodyne detection, reaching 89% of ideal Gaussian modulation. As for heterodyne detection, 55 km and 80% are achieved. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Can quantum entanglement increase the capacity of (classical) covert channels? To one familiar with Holevo's Theorem it is tempting to think that the answer is obviously no. However, in this work we show: quantum entanglement can in fact increase the capacity of a classical covert channel, in the presence of an active adversary; on the other hand, a zero-capacity channel is not improved by entanglement, so entanglement cannot create 'purely quantum' covert channels; the problem of determining the capacity of a given channel in the presence of entanglement is undecidable; but there is an algorithm to bound the entangled capacity of a channel from above, adapted from the semi-definite hierarchy from the theory of non-local games, whose close connection to channel capacity is at the core of all of our results.

AB The imminent advent of Quantum Computers poses a significant threat to the cryptographic algorithms supporting the public key infrastructure (PKI) of widely used communication protocols. High Performance Computing (HPC) data centers among other interested parties are well aware of the catastrophic consequences quantum attacks could have on their PKI and are consequently transitioning to Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) methods, despite the substantial overhead this introduces for handling incoming network packets. This work addresses the transition to PQC within the context of the Cloud-Edge Continuum by integrating the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library into the accelerated strongSwan developed by Mellanox for Data Processing Units (DPUs). This integration offloads cryptographic operations from central servers to data DPUs distributed across the cloud-edge continuum. Our solution ensures quantum security by providing PQ authentication through CRYSTALS-Dilithium or CRYSTALS-FALCON, PQ key exchanges via CRYSTALS-Kyber, and confidential data transmission using AES-256. Additionally, the deployment of this implementation on DPUs helps reduce the computational load on both HPC data centers and edge devices, promoting more efficient and secure operations across the entire cloud-edge continuum.

TI Entanglement of assistance in three-qubit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The entanglement of assistance quantifies the amount of entanglement that can be concentrated among a group of spatially separated parties using the assistance of some auxiliary system. In this paper we study the entanglement of assistance in the simplest scenario of three qubits. We consider how much entanglement is lost when the helper party becomes uncoupled by local measurement and classical communication. For three-qubit pure states, it is found that lossless decoupling is always possible when entanglement is quantified by the maximum probability of locally generating a Bell state. However, with respect to most other entanglement measures, such as concurrence and entanglement entropy, a lossless decoupling of the helper is possible only for a special family of states that we fully characterize.

TI Controlling transfer and chirality of topological quantum state through
   dissipation in quantum walk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Dissipation always exists in real environments, and it can cause decoherence during transfer of quantum states. To avoid decoherence, dissipation is usually shielded. However, dissipation is difficult to avoid in real cases. Thus, how to achieve efficient quantum state transfer in dissipation environments, although it will receive great attention, remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can be utilized to realize robust control of quantum state transfer instead of being avoided. Our scheme is realized by constructing Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP). By tuning dissipation, the exchange of eigenvectors and nonadiabatic transition near the LEP can be modulated, thereby controlling transfer and chirality of topological quantum state. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated such a scheme on a quantum walk platform. Our work opens up a different avenue for quantum information process in real systems.

TI Side-Channel Analysis of Arithmetic Encodings for Post-Quantum

AB The unprotected implementations of Kyber and Dilithium have recently been shown to offer a variety of side-channel attack paths. These attacks have in turn triggered the investigation of secure and efficient masked implementations. In this paper, we observe that the design and evaluation of such masked implementations come with new challenges, due to the manipulation of small and non-uniform secrets that is common in post-quantum encryption algorithms, which may hinder their good understanding. On the one hand, we show that using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) per share to select Points-of-Interest (POIs) in leakage traces, as it is common in symmetric cryptography, can lead to confusing outcomes where leakage samples that correspond to the manipulation of another share than the targeted one are detected. On the other hand, we show that the arithmetic encoding of small and non-uniform secrets leads to representation-dependencies so that summing or subtracting shares leads to different amounts of information leakage. We apply these observations to Kyber and show that they essentially vanish when increasing the number of shares. Incidentally, we also discuss the attack strategies to recover small and non-uniform secrets with side-channel attacks efficiently. We hope these observations can help implementers and evaluators to better interpret their security claims.

TI Unsupervised strategies for identifying optimal parameters in Quantum
   Approximate Optimization Algorithm
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB As combinatorial optimization is one of the main quantum computing applications, many methods based on parameterized quantum circuits are being developed. In general, a set of parameters are being tweaked to optimize a cost function out of the quantum circuit output. One of these algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm stands out as a promising approach to tackling combinatorial problems. However, finding the appropriate parameters is a difficult task. Although QAOA exhibits concentration properties, they can depend on instances characteristics that may not be easy to identify, but may nonetheless offer useful information to find good parameters. In this work, we study unsupervised Machine Learning approaches for setting these parameters without optimization. We perform clustering with the angle values but also instances encodings (using instance features or the output of a variational graph autoencoder), and compare different approaches. These angle-finding strategies can be used to reduce calls to quantum circuits when leveraging QAOA as a subroutine. We showcase them within Recursive-QAOA up to depth 3 where the number of QAOA parameters used per iteration is limited to 3, achieving a median approximation ratio of 0.94 for MaxCut over 200 Erdos-Renyi graphs. We obtain similar performances to the case where we extensively optimize the angles, hence saving numerous circuit calls.

TI Resource theory of imaginarity in distributed scenarios
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The resource theory of imaginarity studies the operational value of imaginary parts in quantum states, operations, and measurements. Here we introduce and study the distillation and conversion of imaginarity in distributed scenario. This arises naturally in bipartite systems where both parties work together to generate the maximum possible imaginarity on one of the subsystems. We give exact solutions to this problem for general qubit states and pure states of arbitrary dimension. We present a scenario that demonstrates the operational advantage of imaginarity: the discrimination of quantum channels without the aid of an ancillary system. We then link this scenario to local operations and classical communications(LOCC) discrimination of bipartite states. We experimentally demonstrate the relevant assisted distillation protocol, and show the usefulness of imaginarity in the aforementioned two tasks.
   This work examines imaginarity as a resource in quantum information theory. The authors extend the resource theory of imaginarity to distributed scenarios, discuss the operational meaning and its role in channel discrimination.

TI CONSTRUCTIONS OF SYMPLECTIC LCD MDS CODES FROM QUASI-CYCLIC CODES

In this paper, we construct some symplectic LCD codes from quasi-cyclic (QC) codes, and prove that these symplectic LCD codes with dimension two over F-2a are maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes. By extending the generator matrices of symplectic LCD MDS codes with dimension two, we obtain a series of symplectic LCD codes over F-2a. As an application, some new entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) over F-2a are constructed by symplectic LCD codes.

TI Circuit-level fault tolerance of cat codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Bosonic codes encode quantum information into a single infinite-dimensional physical system endowed with error correction capabilities. This reduces the need for complex management of many physical constituents compared with standard approaches employing multiple physical qubits. Recent discussions of bosonic codes centre around correcting only boson-loss errors, with phase errors either actively suppressed or deferred to subsequent layers of encoding with standard qubit codes. Rotationally symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, which include the well-known cat and binomial codes, are capable of simultaneous correction of loss and phase errors, offering an alternate route that deals with arbitrary errors already at the base layer. Here, we investigate the robustness of such codes, moving away from the more idealistic past studies towards a circuit-level noise analysis closer to the practical situation where every physical component in the device is potentially faulty. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to the case of RSB codes, and then examine the performance of two known error correction circuits under circuit-level noise. Our analysis reveals a significantly more stringent noise threshold for fault-tolerant operation than found in past works; nevertheless, we show how, through waiting-time optimization and the use of squeezing, we can restore the noise requirements to a regime achievable with near-term quantum hardware. While our focus here is on cat codes for concreteness, a similar analysis applies for general RSB codes.

TI Toffoli-depth reduction method preserving in-place quantum circuits and
   its application to SHA3-256
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB When implementing a quantum circuit for a desired reversible function, an attempt is made to design an accurate quantum circuit. Then, the quantum circuit is optimized based on a specific cost function, such as design cost, width (the number of qubits), depth, etc. In particular, if an in-place subcircuit itself can be optimized while maintaining its in-place property, it will be a very useful way to increase efficiency without changing the initial architecture of the entire quantum circuit. Furthermore, since its (clean) work qubits can easily be utilized in subsequent subroutines of the quantum circuit, it has an additional important advantage in terms of width. In this paper, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we present a global Toffoli-depth reduction methodology for an in-place version reversible circuit in the case that the given input circuit is optimized with Toffoli-count. We mainly introduce a process to optimize the chi \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\chi $$\end{document} internal function block in SHA3-256 to explain our Toffoli-depth reduction approach preserving the in-place property, and hence, well-balanced five chi \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\chi $$\end{document} quantum circuits are induced in terms of its width and T-depth. And then, we apply these five chi \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\chi $$\end{document} circuits to design the entire SHA3-256 cryptosystem. One of the proposed SHA3-256 quantum circuits has a width of 1600 and a T-depth of 264, and this shows a result of 50% and 38.9% reduction compared to the previous circuit in terms of width and T-depth, respectively. Other versions of our SHA3-256 circuits just required 10-33 qubits per one T-depth compared to the previous results which require over 1800 qubits per T-depth, and so this means that our SHA3-256 circuits are well-balanced. Finally, we constructed Grover's algorithm circuit using each version that realized SHA3-256. When output circuits for the presented method were used, quantum volume values of Grover's algorithm circuits became 33 and 50 % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document} of the value when the input circuit was used.

TI FORECASTING STOCK MARKET CRASHES VIA REAL-TIME RECESSION PROBABILITIES:
   A QUANTUM COMPUTING APPROACH
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB A fast and precise prediction of stock market crashes is an important aspect of economic growth, fiscal and monetary systems because it facilitates the government in the application of suitable policies. Many works have examined the behavior of the fall of stock markets and have built models to predict them. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the available research, and the literature calls for more investigation on the topic, as currently the accuracy of the models remains low and they have only been extended for the largest economies. This study provides a comparison of quantum forecast methods and stock market declines and, therefore, a new prediction model of stock market crashes via real-time recession probabilities with the power to accurately estimate future global stock market downturn scenarios is achieved. A 104-country sample has been used, allowing the sample compositions to take into account the regional diversity of the alert warning indicators. To obtain a robust model, several alternative techniques have been employed on the sample under study, being Quantum Boltzmann Machines, which have obtained very good prediction results due to their ability to remember features and develop long-term dependencies from time series and sequential data. Our model has large policy implications for the appropriate macroeconomic policy response to downside risks, offering tools to help achieve financial stability at the international level.

TI Witnessing multi-observer steering on both sides simultaneously via weak

AB The quantum steering as an intermediate form of quantum correlations, has various peculiarities differing from the Bell nonlocality and the quantum entanglement. In a specific scenario, each side of the observer shares one of the two entangled qubits, steering can be witnessed simultaneously between any two observers from different sides by performing weak or projective measurements successively, with independently chosen and unbiased inputs. Here, we demonstrate this steering scenario experimentally to simultaneously witness quartic EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen steerings of two successive observers between each side with the entangled pair with a state fidelity of 97.6% compared with a maximally-entangled one.

TI High-fidelity initialization and control of electron and nuclear spins
   in a four-qubit register
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Single electron spins bound to multi-phosphorus nuclear spin registers in silicon have demonstrated fast (0.8 ns) two-qubit root SWAP gates and long spin relaxation times (similar to 30 s). In these spin registers, when the donors are ionized, the nuclear spins remain weakly coupled to their environment, allowing exceptionally long coherence times. When the electron is present, the hyperfine interaction allows coupling of the spin and charge degrees of freedom for fast qubit operation and control. Here we demonstrate the use of the hyperfine interaction to enact electric dipole spin resonance to realize high-fidelity (F=100(-6)(+0%)) initialization of all the nuclear spins within a four-qubit nuclear spin register. By controllably initializing the nuclear spins to |double down arrow double down arrow double down arrow >, we achieve single-electron qubit gate fidelities of F = 99.78 +/- 0.07% (Clifford gate fidelities of 99.58 +/- 0.14%), above the fault-tolerant threshold for the surface code with a coherence time of T-2(& lowast;) = 12 mu s.

TI Measurement of two-photon position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
   correlations through single-photon intensity measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The measurement of the position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of a two-photon state is important for many quantum information applications ranging from quantum key distribution to coincidence imaging. However, all the existing techniques for measuring the position-momentum EPR correlations involve coincidence detection and thus suffer from issues that result in less accurate measurements. In this article, we propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme that does not require coincidence detection for measuring the EPR correlations. Our technique works for two-photon states that are pure, irrespective of whether the state is separable or entangled. We theoretically show that if the pure two-photon state satisfies a certain set of conditions then the position-momentum EPR correlations can be obtained by doing the intensity measurements on only one of the photons. We experimentally demonstrate this technique for pure two-photon states produced by type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the most accurate experimental measurement of position-momentum EPR correlations.

TI Quantum coherence of thermal biphoton orbital angular momentum state and
   its distribution in non-Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum coherence has been considered as a resource for quantum information process in recent years. Sharing the quantum resource distantly is a precondition for quantum communication. In this paper, we explore the quantum coherence properties of the prepared state starting from initially incoherent thermal light source. It is shown that the quantum coherence is directly proportional to the dimension of Hilbert space and therefore employ the orbital angular momentum (OAM) to encode resources. The distribution of biphoton thermal OAM state via the one-sided noisy channel (non-Kolmogorov turbulent atmosphere) is then investigated. It is found that the prepared OAM state can have large amount of quantum coherence, which is maximized when the thermal source is completely incoherent. The turbulence effects on quantum coherence are studied and compared to those on the fidelity and quantum channel capacity. Contrasting to the monotonic decay, the dynamics of coherence displays a peak during the propagation and the mechanism behind is presented. Finally, the dynamics of quantum thermal state can be more robust than that of Bell-like pure state since more interference can be induced. We believe our results is of importance to OAM quantum communication using quantum coherence as a resource.

TI A novel error correction protocol for continuous variable quantum key
   distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Reconciliation is a key element of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols, affecting both the complexity and performance of the entire system. During the reconciliation protocol, error correction is typically performed using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with a single decoding attempt. In this paper, we propose a modification to a conventional reconciliation protocol used in four-state protocol CV-QKD systems called the multiple decoding attempts (MDA) protocol. MDA uses multiple decoding attempts with LDPC codes, each attempt having fewer decoding iteration than the conventional protocol. Between each decoding attempt we propose to reveal information bits, which effectively lowers the code rate. MDA is shown to outperform the conventional protocol in regards to the secret key rate (SKR). A 10% decrease in frame error rate and an 8.5% increase in SKR are reported in this paper. A simple early termination for the LDPC decoder is also proposed and implemented. With early termination, MDA has decoding complexity similar to the conventional protocol while having an improved SKR.

This requires perfect mode overlap of the emitted light from different emitters, which necessitates the use of single-mode fibres. Here, we present an advanced manufacturing approach to accomplish this task. We combined 3D printed complex micro-optics, such as hemispherical and Weierstrass solid immersion lenses, as well as total internal reflection solid immersion lenses, on top of individual indium arsenide quantum dots with 3D printed optics on single-mode fibres and compared their key features. We observed a systematic increase in the collection efficiency under variations of the lens geometry from roughly 2 for hemispheric solid immersion lenses up to a maximum of greater than 9 for the total internal reflection geometry. Furthermore, the temperature-induced stress was estimated for these particular lens dimensions and results to be approximately 5 meV. Interestingly, the use of solid immersion lenses further increased the localisation accuracy of the emitters to less than 1 nm when acquiring micro-photoluminescence maps. Furthermore, we show that the single-photon character of the source is preserved after device fabrication, reaching a value of approximately 0.19 under pulsed optical excitation. The printed lens device can be g (2) (0) further joined with an optical fibre and permanently fixed. This integrated system can be cooled by dipping into liquid helium using a Stirling cryocooler or by a closed-cycle helium cryostat without the necessity for optical windows, as all access is through the integrated single-mode fibre. We identify the ideal optical designs and present experiments that demonstrate excellent high-rate single-photon emission.

TI Cloud-based semi-quantum money
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In the 1970s, Wiesner introduced the concept of quantum money, where quantum states serve as currency, offering physical-level unforgeability through quantum mechanics. Yet, traditional proposals often unrealistically assume personal quantum computing access for each user. To address these issues, we propose a cloud-based semi-quantum money (CSQM) scheme. This approach only requires semi-honest third-party quantum clouds, while the rest of the system, including transactions and banks, remains fully classical. We also estimate the computational power required by the quantum cloud and provide a thorough security analysis. Our approach significantly reduces the quantum resource demands on local users and facilitates seamless integration with current classical systems.

TI Converting Entanglement into Ensemble Basis-Free Coherence
SO ENTROPY
AB The resource theory of coherence addresses the extent to which quantum properties are present in a given quantum system. While coherence has been extensively studied for individual quantum states, measures of coherence for ensembles of quantum states remain an area of active research. The entanglement-based approach to ensemble coherence-arising from the measurement-ensemble duality principle and the Born rule-connects the ensemble coherence with both the entanglement resource and the measurement's uncertainty. This paper presents two methods for generating ensemble coherence from a fixed amount of entanglement between two qubit systems. The first method involves applying a von Neumann measurement to one part of a non-maximally entangled bipartite state, resulting in a pair of non-orthogonal states whose coherence can equal the initial entanglement. The second method considers a class of symmetric observables capable of generating ensembles used in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols such as B92, BB84, and three-state QKD. As a result, this work contributes to understanding how much ensemble coherence can be obtained from a given amount of entanglement.

TI Model-Predictive Quantum Control via Hamiltonian Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article proposes an end-to-end framework for the learning-enabled control of closed quantum systems. The proposed learning technique is the first of its kind to utilize a hierarchical design, which layers probing control, quantum state tomography, quantum process tomography, and Hamiltonian learning to identify both the internal and control Hamiltonians. Within this context, a novel quantum process tomography algorithm is presented, which involves optimization on the unitary group, i.e., the space of unitary operators, to ensure physically meaningful predictions. Our scalableHamiltonian learning algorithms have low memory requirements and tunable computational complexity. Once the Hamiltonians are learned, we formalize data-driven model-predictive quantum control (MPQC). This technique utilizes the learned model to compute quantum control parameters in a closed-loop simulation. Then, the optimized control input is given to a physical quantum system in an open-loop fashion. Simulations show model-predictive quantum control to be more efficient than the current state-of-the-art, quantum optimal control, when sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is used to solve each control problem.

TI Order-Stability in Complex Biological, Social, and AI-Systems from
   Quantum Information Theory
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper is our attempt, on the basis of physical theory, to bring more clarification on the question "What is life?" formulated in the well-known book of Schrodinger in 1944. According to Schrodinger, the main distinguishing feature of a biosystem's functioning is the ability to preserve its order structure or, in mathematical terms, to prevent increasing of entropy. However, Schrodinger's analysis shows that the classical theory is not able to adequately describe the order-stability in a biosystem. Schrodinger also appealed to the ambiguous notion of negative entropy. We apply quantum theory. As is well-known, behaviour of the quantum von Neumann entropy crucially differs from behaviour of classical entropy. We consider a complex biosystem S composed of many subsystems, say proteins, cells, or neural networks in the brain, that is, S = (S-i). We study the following problem: whether the compound system S can maintain "global order" in the situation of an increase of local disorder and if S can preserve the low entropy while other S-i increase their entropies (may be essentially). We show that the entropy of a system as a whole can be constant, while the entropies of its parts rising. For classical systems, this is impossible, because the entropy of S cannot be less than the entropy of its subsystem S-i. And if a subsystems's entropy increases, then a system's entropy should also increase, by at least the same amount. However, within the quantum information theory, the answer is positive. The significant role is played by the entanglement of a subsystems' states. In the absence of entanglement, the increasing of local disorder implies an increasing disorder in the compound system S (as in the classical regime). In this note, we proceed within a quantum-like approach to mathematical modeling of information processing by biosystems-respecting the quantum laws need not be based on genuine quantum physical processes in biosystems. Recently, such modeling found numerous applications in molecular biology, genetics, evolution theory, cognition, psychology and decision making. The quantum-like model of order stability can be applied not only in biology, but also in social science and artificial intelligence.

TI Reinventing EDHOC for the Post-Quantum Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Several lightweight protocols are being developed to secure communication in resource-constrained environments. Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) plays a key role in this lightweight protocol family by managing the key establishment process. However, due to the vulnerability of the discrete logarithm problem to Shor's algorithm, a quantum-resistant replacement for Diffie-Hellman is required. This work examines the quantum-resistant transition of EDHOC, focusing on its multiple authentication methods as a step toward enabling robust post-quantum security for IoT devices. A novel authentication method for EDHOC is introduced, utilizing Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) as a replacement for the static Diffie-Hellman (DH) authentication method, providing a post-quantum signature-free alternative. Among existing post-quantum algorithms for both KEMs and signatures, the NIST-standardized ML-KEM offers the fastest implementation at the lowest memory cost, both of which are crucial for resource-constrained devices. While compatible with various post-quantum KEMs, the method can exploit the computational efficiency of ML-KEM to bring a PQ Signature-free EDHOC to highly constrained devices, providing the same security guarantees as classical EDHOC once the handshake is complete. Additionally, an efficient three-message handshake KEM-based EDHOC Initiator Known Responder (IKR) variant is proposed for environments with pre-established peer awareness.

TI Steady motional entanglement between two distant levitated nanoparticles
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement in macroscopic systems is not only essential for practical quantum information processing, but also valuable for the study of the boundary between quantum and the classical world. However, it is very challenging to achieve the steady remote entanglement between distant macroscopic systems. We consider two distant nanoparticles, both of which are optically trapped in two cavities. Based on the coherent scattering mechanism, we find that the ultrastrong optomechanical coupling between the cavity modes and the motion of the levitated nanoparticles could be achieved. The large and steady entanglement between the filtered output cavity modes and the motion of nanoparticles can be generated if the trapping laser is under the red sideband. Then through entanglement swapping, the steady motional entanglement between the distant nanoparticles can be realized. We numerically simulate and find that the two nanoparticles with 10 km distance can be entangled for the experimentally feasible parameters, even in room temperature environments. The generated continuous variable multipartite entanglement is the key to realizing the quantum enhanced sensor network and the sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.

TI Qubit dynamics of ergotropy and environment-induced work
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamics of ergotropy in open systems under Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. In this scenario, we begin by formulating the ergotropy of an arbitrary qubit state in terms of energy and coherence. Thus we determine the conditions for ergotropy freezing and ergotropy sudden death as a consequence of the system -bath interaction. In order to use ergotropy as a resource for energy extraction in the form of work in an open -system scenario, we adopt the entropy -based formulation of quantum thermodynamics. In this approach, the work gains an additional environment -induced component, which may be present even for constant Hamiltonians. We then establish an analytical relationship between the environment -induced work and ergotropy, providing an interpretation of environment -induced work in terms of variation of ergotropy. In particular, energy transfer by environment -induced work can be performed up to a limit, which is governed by the energy cost to transit between the initial and final passive states of the quantum dynamics. We illustrate these results for qubit states evolving under nondissipative and dissipative quantum processes.

The latter description sets a stage for the phenomenon of quantum Hall effect (QHE), thereby elucidating the intrinsically topological nature of the pertinent gravity theories and demystifying their (pseudo)holographic connection to a broad class of the SYK-like models.

AB Entanglement, one of the most representative phenomena in quantum mechanics, has been widely used for fundamental studies and modern quantum technologies. In this paper, we report the observation of nonlocal cancellation and addition of optical rotations with polarization-entangled photons in fructose solutions. The entanglement also enables probing optical activities at a distance by joint measurements on the entangled photons. The good agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions demonstrates the potential for extending these measurements to other chiral molecules, with a sensitivity that improves as the number of entangled photons increases.

TI Coherent Erbium Spin Defects in Colloidal Nanocrystal Hosts
SO ACS NANO
AB We demonstrate nearly a microsecond of spin coherence in Er3+ ions doped in cerium dioxide nanocrystal hosts, despite a large gyromagnetic ratio and nanometric proximity of the spin defect to the nanocrystal surface. The long spin coherence is enabled by reducing the dopant density below the instantaneous diffusion limit in a nuclear spin-free host material, reaching the limit of a single erbium spin defect per nanocrystal. We observe a large Orbach energy in a highly symmetric cubic site, further protecting the coherence in a qubit that would otherwise rapidly decohere. Spatially correlated electron spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of Ce3+ at the nanocrystal surface, which likely acts as extraneous paramagnetic spin noise. Even with these factors, defect-embedded nanocrystal hosts show tremendous promise for quantum sensing and quantum communication applications, with multiple avenues, including core-shell fabrication, redox tuning of oxygen vacancies, and organic surfactant modification, available to further enhance their spin coherence and functionality in the future.

TI Single-qubit quantum classifier based on gradient-free optimization
   algorithm
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A single-qubit quantum classifier (SQC) based on a gradient-free optimization (GFO) algorithm, named the GFO-based SQC, is proposed to overcome the effects of barren plateaus caused by quantum devices. Here, a rotation gate RX (phi) is applied on the single-qubit binary quantum classifier, and the training data and parameters are loaded into phi in the form of vector multiplication. The cost function is decreased by finding the value of each parameter that yields the minimum expectation value of measuring the quantum circuit. The algorithm is performed iteratively for all parameters one by one until the cost function satisfies the stop condition. The proposed GFO-based SQC is demonstrated for classification tasks in Iris and MNIST datasets and compared with the Adam-based SQC and the quantum support vector machine (QSVM). Furthermore, the performance of the GFO-based SQC is discussed when the rotation gate in the quantum device is under different types of noise. The simulation results show that the GFO-based SQC can reach a high accuracy in reduced time. Additionally, the proposed GFO algorithm can quickly complete the training process of the SQC. Importantly, the GFO-based SQC has a good performance in noisy environments.

AB As quantum computing technology advances, the security of traditional cryptographic systems is becoming increasingly vulnerable. To address this issue, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a promising solution that can withstand the brute force of quantum computers. However, PQC is not immune to attacks that exploit weaknesses in implementation, such as Side Channel Attacks (SCAs). SCAs can extract secret keys by analyzing the physical characteristics such as power consumption of the device while performing cryptographic operation. Simple Power Analysis (SPA) is a type of SCA that uses power consumption measurements to extract sensitive information. By applying SPA to a specific hardware implementation of a PQC algorithm such as the NTRU, potential vulnerabilities can appear in the Arithmetic Unit (AU) in charge of the multiplication operation. The effectiveness of this analysis to extract sensitive information has been evaluated through extensive experiments in which different countermeasures and strategies have been proposed, as well as an accelerated algorithm has been implemented. The results demonstrate that SPA can point out security breaches in the NTRU implementation, indicating an issue that can affect the PQC in the future.

TI Improving the performance of practical decoy-state quantum key
   distribution with advantage distillation technology
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising solution for sharing information-theoretic secret keys between two remote legitimate parties. To improve the maximal transmission distance and the maximal error rate tolerance, we apply the advantage distillation technology to analyze the security of practical decoy-state QKD systems. Based on the practical experimental parameters, the device-dependent QKD protocols and the measurement-device-independent QKD protocols have been respectively analyzed, and our analysis results demonstrate that the advantage distillation technology can significantly improve the performance of various QKD protocols. In the four-state and six-state device-dependent QKD protocols, we prove that the maximal transmission distance can be improved from 142 km to 180 km and from 146 km to 187 km respectively. In the four-state and six-state measurement-device-independent QKD protocols, we prove that the maximal transmission distance can be improved from 195 km to 273 km and from 200 km to 282 km respectively.
   Advantage distillation technology increases the collection between raw keys in quantum key distribution systems. Combining a decoy state method with advantage distillation technology, the authors demonstrate improved maximal transmission distance and tolerable background error rates.

TI Pauli Blockade in Silicon Quantum Dots with Spin-Orbit Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computation relies on accurate measurements of qubits not only for reading the output of the calculation, but also to perform error correction. Most proposed scalable silicon architectures utilize Pauli blockade of triplet states for spin-to-charge conversion. In recent experiments there have been instances when instead of conventional triplet blockade readout, Pauli blockade is sustained only between parallel spin configurations, with vertical bar T-0 > relaxing quickly to the singlet state and leaving vertical bar T+> and vertical bar T-> states blockaded-which we call parity readout. Both types of blockade can be used for readout in quantum computing, but it is crucial to maximize the fidelity and understand in which regime the system operates. We devise and perform an experiment in which the crossover between parity and singlet-triplet readout can be identified by investigating the underlying physics of the vertical bar T-0 > relaxation rate. This rate is tunable over 4 orders of magnitude by controlling the Zeeman energy difference between the dots induced by spin-orbit coupling, which in turn depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. We suggest a theoretical model incorporating charge noise and relaxation effects that explains quantitatively our results. Investigating the model both analytically and numerically, we identify strategies to obtain on demand either singlet-triplet or parity readout consistently across large arrays of dots. We also discuss how parity readout can be used to perform full two-qubit state tomography and its impact on quantum error-detection schemes in large-scale silicon quantum computers.

TI Robustness of majorana zero-energy state
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Based on the principle of linearized stability proposed by Lyapunov, we investigate the robustness of Majorana zero-energy state (MZES), which plays an important role in topological quantum computation. We show that the MZES is not robust enough against the external perturbations, because mathematically it is critically stable instead of being asymptotically stable, and only the states with asymptotic stability can be regarded as robust, therefore, the MZES cannot be used to carry quantum information in topological quantum computation. Our study is different from previous works that usually make the numerical tests by some special perturbations, whereas our analytical derivation is suitable for arbitrary perturbations. As an example, we demonstrate this by the stability analysis of MZES in the spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor/superconductor junction.

TI A tweezer array with 6,100 highly coherent atomic qubits
SO NATURE
AB Optical tweezer arrays1,2 have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing3, 4, 5, 6, 7-8, simulation1,9, 10, 11-12 and metrology13, 14-15. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits and, recently, systems with around 1,000 atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control16, 17-18. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction (QEC)19,20. Here we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping more than 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) s, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of about 23 min, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of more than 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing5,21 and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments8,22, 23-24, indicate that universal quantum computing and QEC with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.

TI Spectra of perfect state transfer Hamiltonians on fractal-like graphs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this paper we study the spectral features, on fractal-like graphs, of Hamiltonians which exhibit the special property of perfect quantum state transfer (PQST): the transmission of quantum states without dissipation. The essential goal is to develop the theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between PQST, spectral properties, and the geometry of the underlying graph, in order to design novel protocols for applications in quantum information science. We present a new lifting and gluing construction, and use this to prove results concerning an inductive spectral structure, applicable to a wide variety of fractal-like graphs. We illustrate this construction with explicit examples for several classes of diamond graphs.

TI Hybrid discrimination strategy in quantum communication based on
   photon-number-resolving detectors and mesoscopic twin-beam states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB State discrimination is a key challenge in the implementation of quantum communication protocols. Most optical communication protocols rely on either coherent states of light or fragile single-photon states, making it often difficult to achieve robustness and security simultaneously. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy that operates in the mesoscopic intensity regime, leveraging robust quantum states of light. Our approach combines classical and quantum features: reliable state discrimination based on a classical property of light, and security stemming from nonclassical correlations. Specifically, the receiver uses photon-number-resolving detectors to access the mean photon number of the binary thermal signals encoding the information. The communication channel exploits twin-beam states, inherently sensitive to eavesdropping attacks, to provide a layer of security. This strategy is scalable, allowing for straightforward extension to more complex signal alphabets, and offers a promising route for robust and secure quantum communication in the mesoscopic intensity domain.

TI Non-Markovianity and a generalized Landauer bound for a minimal quantum
   autonomous thermal machine with a work qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We investigate the validity of the Landauer principle in the context of a non-Markovian environment, employing a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) comprised of two qubits, attached to different Markovian thermal reservoirs coupled to a single qubit acting as a quantum coherence reservoir, interpreted as a working qubit. We numerically demonstrate that the non-Markovianity, arising from the exchange of correlations between the QATM qubits and the work qubit, influences the Landauer bound. We analyze two distinct reservoir types: fermionic and bosonic, and show that the QATM, operating as a single entity, interacts with the work qubit at an effective virtual temperature, leading to a violation of the conventional Landauer bound. Consequently, we derive a lower bound for the minimal dissipation energy required to erase information during the energy exchange between the QATM and the work qubit. The QATM's information engine character and impact on the work qubit is further characterized by monitoring its information content, including coherence and population dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the work qubit's populations oscillate in time, while the coherence dissipates nonmonotonically.

TI Entanglement perspective on the quantum approximate optimization
   algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many quantum algorithms seek to output a specific bitstring solving the problem of interest-or a few if the solution is degenerate. It is the case for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) in the limit of large circuit depth, which aims to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Hence, the expected final state for these algorithms is either a product state or a low-entangled superposition involving a few bitstrings. What happens in between the initial N-qubit product state 10)(R) N and the final one regarding entanglement? Here, we consider the QAOA algorithm for solving the paradigmatic MaxCut problem on different types of graphs. We study the entanglement growth and spread resulting from randomized and optimized QAOA circuits and find that there is a volume-law entanglement barrier between the initial and final states. We also investigate the entanglement spectrum in connection with random matrix theory. In addition, we compare the entanglement production with a quantum annealing protocol aiming to solve the same MaxCut problems. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the simulation of QAOA circuits with tensor network-based methods relying on low-entanglement for efficiency, such as matrix product states.

TI Numerical solution of nonlinear Schrödinger equation by a hybrid
   pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The time-dependent one-dimensional nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation (NLSE) is solved numerically by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm that connects a pseudospectral step for the Hamiltonian term with a variational step for the nonlinear term. The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating factor by forward and backward Fourier transforms, which are here carried out classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration schemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining nonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid numerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is reproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over which a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while keeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy and complexity of the quantum algorithm, the expressibility of the ansatz circuit and compare it with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal step width and the depth of the quantum circuit.

TI On quantum information before the Page time
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB While recent progress in the black hole information problem has shown that the entropy of Hawking radiation follows a unitary Page curve, the quantum state of Hawking radiation prior the Page time is still treated as purely thermal, containing no information about the microstructure of the black hole. We demonstrate that there is significant quantum information regarding the quantum state of the black hole in the Hawking radiation prior to the Page time. By computing of the quantum fidelity in a 2D boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) model of black hole evaporation, we demonstrate that an observer outside of an evaporating black hole may distinguish different black holes via measurements of the Hawking radiation at any time during the evaporation process, albeit with an exponentially large number of measurements. Furthermore, our results are universal, applicable to general BCFTs including those with large central charge and rational BCFTs. The techniques we develop for computing the fidelity are more generally applicable to excited states in CFT. As such, we are able to characterize more general aspects of thermalization in 2D conformal field theory.

TI Spectral characterization of SPDC-based single-photon sources for
   quantum key distribution
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB In our laboratory, we employ two biphoton sources for quantum key distribution. The first is based on cw parametric down-conversion of photons at 404 nm in PPKTP waveguide chips, while the second is based on the pulsed parametric down-conversion of 775 nm photons in PPLN waveguides. The spectral characterization is important for the determination of certain side-channel attacks. A Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment employing the first photon source revealed a complex structure of the common Hong-Ou-Mandel dip. By measuring the spectra of the single photons at 808 nm, we were able to associate these structures to the superposition of different transverse modes of the pump photons in our waveguide chips. The pulsed source was characterized by means of single-photon spectra measured by a sensitive spectrum analyzer as well as dispersion-based measurements. Finally, we also describe Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments using the photons from the second source.

TI Optically Distributing Remote Two-Node Microwave Entanglement Using
   Doubly Parametric Quantum Transducers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Doubly parametric quantum transducers (DPTs), such as electro-optomechanical devices, show promise as quantum interconnects between the optical and microwave domains, thereby enabling long-distance quantum networks between superconducting qubit systems. However, any transducer will inevitably introduce loss and noise that will degrade the performance of a quantum network. We explore how DPTs can be used to construct a network capable of distributing remote two-mode microwave entanglement over an optical link by comparing 14 different network topologies. The 14 topologies we analyze consist of combinations of different transducer operations, entangled resources, and entanglement-swapping measurements. For each topology, we derive a necessary and sufficient analytic threshold on DPT parameters that must be exceeded in order to distribute microwave-microwave entanglement. We find that the thresholds are dependent on the given network topology, along with the available entanglement resources and measurement capabilities. In the high-optical-loss limit, which is relevant to realistic networks, we find that down-conversion of each half of an optical two-mode squeezed vacuum state is the most robust topology. Finally, using currently achievable experimental capabilities, we find the encouraging result that several of these topologies could produce microwave-microwave entanglement. However, most of these topologies cannot work given current transducer performance, which demonstrates the importance of thoroughly analyzing all possible networks.

TI Spin-EPR-pair separation by conveyor-mode single electron shuttling in
   Si/SiGe
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Long-ranged coherent qubit coupling is a missing function block for scaling up spin qubit based quantum computing solutions. Spin-coherent conveyor-mode electron-shuttling could enable spin quantum-chips with scalable and sparse qubit-architecture. Its key feature is the operation by only few easily tuneable input terminals and compatibility with industrial gate-fabrication. Single electron shuttling in conveyor-mode in a 420 nm long quantum bus has been demonstrated previously. Here we investigate the spin coherence during conveyor-mode shuttling by separation and rejoining an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) spin-pair. Compared to previous work we boost the shuttle velocity by a factor of 10000. We observe a rising spin-qubit dephasing time with the longer shuttle distances due to motional narrowing and estimate the spin-shuttle infidelity due to dephasing to be 0.7% for a total shuttle distance of nominal 560 nm. Shuttling several loops up to an accumulated distance of 3.36 mu m, spin-entanglement of the EPR pair is still detectable, giving good perspective for our approach of a shuttle-based scalable quantum computing architecture in silicon.
   Electron charge and spin shuttling is a promising technique for connecting distant spin qubits. Here the authors use conveyor-mode shuttling to achieve high-fidelity transport of a single electron spin in Si/SiGe by separation and rejoining of two spin-entangled electrons across a shuttling distance of 560 nm.

AB We use the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between Rydberg atoms and a periodic external microwave field to engineer XXZ spin Hamiltonians with tunable anisotropies. The atoms are placed in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) arrays of optical tweezers. As illustrations, we apply this engineering to two iconic situations in spin physics: the Heisenberg model in square arrays and spin transport in 1D. We first benchmark the Hamiltonian engineering for two atoms and then demonstrate the freezing of the magnetization on an initially magnetized 2D array. Finally, we explore the dynamics of 1D domain-wall systems with both periodic and open boundary conditions. We systematically compare our data with numerical simulations and assess the residual limitations of the technique as well as routes for improvement. The geometrical versatility of the platform, combined with the flexibility of the simulated Hamiltonians, opens up exciting prospects in the fields of quantum simulation, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing.

TI Gate modulation of the hole singlet-triplet qubit frequency in germanium
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spin qubits in germanium gate-defined quantum dots have made considerable progress within the last few years, partially due to their strong spin-orbit coupling and site-dependent g-tensors. While this characteristic of the g-factors removes the need for micromagnets and allows for the possibility of all-electric qubit control, relying on these g-tensors necessitates the need to understand their sensitivity to the confinement potential that defines the quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate a S - T_ qubit whose frequency is a strong function of the voltage applied to the barrier gate shared by the quantum dots. We find a g-factor that can be approximately increased by an order of magnitude adjusting the barrier gate voltage only by 12 mV. We show how this strong dependence could potentially be attributed to the dots moving through a variable strain environment in our device. This work not only reinforces previous findings that site-dependent g-tensors in germanium can be utilized for qubit manipulation, but reveals the sensitivity and tunability these g-tensors have to the electrostatic confinement of the quantum dot.

TI Manipulation and Certification of High-Dimensional Entanglement through
   a Scattering Medium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB High-dimensional entangled quantum states improve the performance of quantum technologies com-pared to qubit-based approaches. In particular, they enable quantum communications with higher infor-mation capacities or enhanced imaging protocols. However, the presence of optical disorder such as atmospheric turbulence or biological tissue perturbs quantum state propagation and hinders their practical use. Here, we demonstrate a wavefront shaping approach to transmit high-dimensional spatially entangled photon pairs through scattering media. Using a transmission matrix approach, we perform wave-front correction in the classical domain using an intense classical beam as a beacon to compensate for the disturbances suffered by a copropagating beam of entangled photons. Through violation of an Einstein-Podolski-Rosen criterion by 988 sigma, we show the presence of entanglement after the medium. Furthermore, we certify an entanglement dimensionality of 17. This work paves the way toward manipulation and transport of entanglement through scattering media, with potential applications in quantum microscopy and quantum key distribution.

TI Decoupling by Local Random Unitaries without Simultaneous Smoothing, and
   Applications to Multi-user Quantum Information Tasks
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We show that a simple telescoping sum trick, together with the triangle inequality and a tensorisation property of expected-contractive coefficients of random channels, allow us to achieve general simultaneous decoupling for multiple users via local actions. Employing both old (Dupuis et al. in Commun Math Phys 328:251-284, 2014) and new methods (Dupuis in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 69:7784-7792, 2023), we obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the one-shot setting in terms of smooth min-entropies, or the finite block length setting in terms of R & eacute;nyi entropies. These bounds are essentially optimal without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture, which remains unresolved. This leads to one-shot, finite block length, and asymptotic achievability results for several tasks in quantum Shannon theory, including local randomness extraction of multiple parties, multi-party assisted entanglement concentration, multi-party quantum state merging, and quantum coding for the quantum multiple access channel. Because of the one-shot nature of our protocols, we obtain achievability results without the need for time-sharing, which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems. We show that our one-shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates (so far only conjectured) for all four tasks in compound settings, which are additionally optimal for entanglement of assistance and state merging.

TI Towards a quantum-safe 5G: Quantum Key Distribution in core networks
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Service-Based Architecture (SBA) of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks introduced great advancements in flexibility, efficiency, and performance of modern networks, thanks to the distribution and softwarization of core network entities called Network Functions (NFs). Due to the distributed nature of 5G systems, these NFs are usually located in different sites to provide better Quality of Service (QoS) or specific services, which poses a great challenge regarding security. However, even though the 3GPP standard identifies security requirements by leveraging Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication and OAuth2.0 authorization, current experimental and commercial deployments often disregard these aspects for the sake of simplicity and performance. In fact, even though data and communication protection is crucial, the implementation of security protocols and mechanisms complicates the deployments and may reduce the efficiency of 5G systems. This paper presents a novel solution that implements TLS for authentication and encryption leveraging entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), ensuring that all the communications between NFs in the 5G core network are secured by QKD keys, and are therefore quantum-safe. Additionally, this paper presents a QKD key repository using the Network Repository Function (NRF), which stores and relays TLS session keys to authenticated consumer NFs to access producer NFs in a fast but quantum-safe process. The solution was validated in a real hardware environment, and obtained results demonstrate that the proposed solution enhances the security of the SBA communications in an efficient way, reducing an 85% the service request time compared to the traditional TLS-based procedure, as well as 29.96% fewer bytes transmitted throughout the process.

TI Experimental demonstration of improved reference-frame-independent
   quantum key distribution over 175km
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Reference -frame -independent (RFI) quantum key distribution (QKD) presents promising advantages, especially for mobile -platform -based implementations, as it eliminates the need for active reference frame calibration. While RFI-QKD has been explored in various studies, limitations in key rate and distance persist due to finite data collection. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate an improved RFI-QKD protocol proposed by Zhu et al. [Opt. Lett. 47 , 4219 (2022)], featuring a statistical quantity for bounding information leaked to Eve that exhibits more insensitivity to statistical fluctuations and more robustness to variations in the reference frame. Taking into account finite -size considerations and potential general attacks, RFI-QKD is implemented over a distance of 175 km in this work. We believe that our study extends the communication distance achievable by RFI-QKD, thereby constituting a notable advancement for its practical application.

TI Experimental secure quantum key distribution in the presence of
   polarization-dependent loss
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is theoretically secure using the principle of quantum mechanics; therefore, QKD is a promising solution for the future of secure communication. Although several experimental demonstrations of QKD have been reported, they have not considered the polarization-dependent loss in state preparation in the key-rate estimation. In this study, we experimentally characterized polarization-dependent loss in realistic state-preparation devices and verified that a considerable polarization-dependent loss exists in fiber-and silicon-based polarization modulators. Hence, the security of such QKD systems is compromised because of the secure key rate overestimation. Furthermore, we report a decoy-state BB84 QKD experiment considering polarization-dependent loss. Finally, we achieved rigorous finite-key security bound over up to 75 km fiber links by applying a recently proposed security proof. This study considers more realistic source flaws than most previous experiments; thus, it is crucial toward a secure QKD with imperfect practical devices.

TI Tight finite-key analysis for quantum key distribution without
   monitoring signal disturbance
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Unlike traditional communication, quantum key distribution (QKD) can reach unconditional security and thus attracts intensive studies. Among all existing QKD protocols, round-robin-differential-phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol can be running without monitoring signal disturbance, which significantly simplifies its flow and improves its tolerance of error rate. Although several security proofs of RRDPS have been given, a tight finite-key analysis with a practical phase-randomized source is still missing. In this paper, we propose an improved security proof of RRDPS against the most general coherent attack based on the entropic uncertainty relation. What's more, with the help of Azuma's inequality, our proof can tackle finite-key effects primely. The proposed finite-key analysis keeps the advantages of phase randomization source and indicates experimentally acceptable numbers of pulses are sufficient to approach the asymptotical bound closely. The results shed light on practical QKD without monitoring signal disturbance.

TI Quantum simulation and computing with Rydberg-interacting qubits
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Arrays of optically trapped atoms excited to Rydberg states have recently emerged as a competitive physical platform for quantum simulation and computing, where high-fidelity state preparation and readout, quantum logic gates, and controlled quantum dynamics of more than 100 qubits have all been demonstrated. These systems are now approaching the point where reliable quantum computations with hundreds of qubits and realistically thousands of multiqubit gates with low error rates should be within reach for the first time. In this article, the authors give an overview of the Rydberg quantum toolbox, emphasizing the high degree of flexibility for encoding qubits, performing quantum operations, and engineering quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The authors then review the state-of-the-art concerning high-fidelity quantum operations and logic gates as well as quantum simulations in many-body regimes. Finally, the authors discuss computing schemes that are particularly suited to the Rydberg platform and some of the remaining challenges on the road to general purpose quantum simulators and quantum computers.

TI Spontaneous decay of artificial atoms in a three-qubit system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB We study the evolution of qubits amplitudes in a one-dimensional chain consisting of three equidistantly spaced noninteracting qubits embedded in an open waveguide. The study is performed in the frame of single-excitation subspace, where the only qubit in the chain is initially excited. We show that the dynamics of qubits amplitudes crucially depend on the value of kd, where k is the wave vector and d is a distance between neighbor qubits. If kd is equal to an integer multiple of pi, then the qubits are excited to a stationary level. In this case, it is the dark states which prevent qubits from decaying to zero, even though they do not contribute to the output spectrum of photon emission. For other values of kd, the excitations of qubits exhibit the damping oscillations which represent the vacuum Rabi oscillations in a three-qubit system. In this case, the output spectrum of photon radiation is determined by a subradiant state which has the lowest decay rate. We also investigated the case with the frequency of a central qubit being different from that of the edge qubits. In this case, the qubits' decay rates can be controlled by the frequency detuning between the central and the edge qubits.
