TI Superconducting contact and quantum interference between two-dimensional
   van der Waals and three-dimensional conventional superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors enable uniform, flat, and clean van der Waals tunneling interfaces, motivating their integration into conventional superconducting circuits. However, fully superconducting contact must be made between the 2D material and three-dimensional (3D) superconductors to employ the standard microwave drive and readout of qubits in such circuits. We present a method for creating zero-resistance contacts between 2D NbSe2 and 3D aluminum that behave as Josephson junctions (JJs) with large effective areas compared to 3D-3D JJs. The devices formed from 2D TMD superconductors are strongly influenced by the geometry of the flakes themselves as well as the placement of the contacts to bulk 3D superconducting leads. We present a model for the supercurrent flow in a 2D-3D superconducting structure by a numerical solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations and find good agreement with experiment. These results demonstrate a crucial step towards a new generation of hybrid superconducting quantum circuits.

TI A random-walk benchmark for single-electron circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mesoscopic integrated circuits aim for precise control over elementary quantum systems. However, as fidelities improve, the increasingly rare errors and component crosstalk pose a challenge for validating error models and quantifying accuracy of circuit performance. Here we propose and implement a circuit-level benchmark that models fidelity as a random walk of an error syndrome, detected by an accumulating probe. Additionally, contributions of correlated noise, induced environmentally or by memory, are revealed as limits of achievable fidelity by statistical consistency analysis of the full distribution of error counts. Applying this methodology to a high-fidelity implementation of on-demand transfer of electrons in quantum dots we are able to utilize the high precision of charge counting to robustly estimate the error rate of the full circuit and its variability due to noise in the environment. As the clock frequency of the circuit is increased, the random walk reveals a memory effect. This benchmark contributes towards a rigorous metrology of quantum circuits.

TI Fine-Grained and Lightweight Quantum-Resistant Access Control System
   With Efficient Revocation for IoT Cloud
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in cloud-assisted environments raises urgent concerns regarding fine-grained access control, policy privacy, and resilience against quantum adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight and quantum-resistant access control framework that combines Ring-LWE-based Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) with a fog-assisted split-path partial encryption architecture. In our scheme, IoT devices encrypt raw data using AES-256-GCM, while fog nodes perform the RLWE-CP-ABE encapsulation of session keys, thereby reducing device-side computation while ensuring that neither plaintext nor session keys are exposed to semi-trusted fog nodes. To preserve policy confidentiality, we integrate a salted attribute-hashing mechanism into the Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS) matrices, concealing access policies even during fog-side processing. Furthermore, we design an epoch-based and blacklist-based revocation mechanism that supports both user-level and attribute-level revocation without requiring ciphertext re-encryption. Security is guaranteed through CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures and Poly1305 message authentication, which provide post-quantum authenticity and integrity. Experimental results confirm that our framework significantly reduces computational and communication overhead while achieving scalable, verifiable, and post-quantum-secure access control-outperforming existing lattice-based CP-ABE schemes in both efficiency and security.

TI A new lattice-based password authenticated key exchange scheme with
   anonymity and reusable key
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In this article, we propose a novel bilateral generalization inhomogenous short integer solution (BiGISIS)-based password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) scheme for post-quantum era security. The hardness assumption of the constructed PAKE is based on newly proposed hard lattice problem, BiGISIS. The main aim of this article is to provide a solution for the post-quantum secure PAKE scheme, which is one of the open problems in the literature. The proposed PAKE is the first BiGISIS-based PAKE that satisfies anonymity and reusable key features. The bilateral-pasteurization (BiP) approach is used to obtain the reusable key, and anonymity is achieved thanks to the additional identity components and hash functions. The reusable key structure reduces the time in the key generation, and anonymity prevents illegal user login attempts. The security analysis is done by following the real-or-random (RoR) model assumptions. As a result of security examinations, perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and integrity are satisfied, and the resistance against eavesdropping, manipulation-based attack (MBA), middle (MitM), known-key security (KKS), and offline password dictionary attack (PDA) is captured. According to the comparison analysis, the proposed PAKE is the first SLA-resistant lattice-based PAKE with reusable key and anonymity properties.

TI Low-noise short-wavelength pumped frequency downconversion for quantum
   frequency converters
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We present a highly efficient low-noise quantum frequency converter from the visible range to telecom wavelengths, combining a pump laser at intermediate frequency resonantly enhanced in an actively stabilized cavity with a monocrystalline bulk crystal. A demonstrator for photons emitted by nitrogen-vacancy-center qubits achieves 43% external efficiency with a noise photon rate per wavelength (frequency) band of 2 s-1/pm(17 s-1/GHz)-reducing the noise by two orders of magnitude compared with current devices based on periodically poled crystals with waveguides. With its tunable output wavelength, this device enables the generation of indistinguishable telecom photons from different network nodes and is, as such, a crucial component for a future quantum internet based on optical fiber.

TI Coherent scattering-mediated correlations between levitated nanospheres
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We explore entanglement generation between multiple optically levitated nanospheres interacting with a common optical cavity via the coherent scattering optomechanical interaction. We derive the many-particle Hamiltonian governing the unitary evolution of the system and show that it gives rise to quantum correlations among the various partitions of the setup, following a non-Markovian dynamics of entanglement birth, death and revivals. We also consider the effects of coupling the system to external environments and show that under reasonable experimental conditions entanglement between the mechanical modes can survive even at room temperature. Its dependence upon the number of nanoparticles, their initial temperature and coupling strength is studied. A numerical toolbox to simulate the closed and open dynamics of Gaussian optomechanical states and their informational measures is developed.

TI Laser-Painted Cavity-Mediated Interactions in a Quantum Gas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Experimental platforms based on ultracold atomic gases have significantly advanced the quantum simulation of complex systems, yet the exploration of phenomena driven by long-range interactions remains a formidable challenge. Currently available methods utilizing dipolar quantum gases or multimode cavities allow us to implement long-range interactions with a 1/r3 character or with a spatial profile fixed by the mode structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field surrounding the atoms, respectively. Here, we propose an experimental scheme employing laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions, which enables the realization of atom-atom interactions that are fully tunable in range, shape, and sign. Our approach combines the versatility of cavity quantum electrodynamics with the precision of laser manipulation, thus providing a highly flexible platform for simulating and understanding long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations describing the full dynamics of the atoms, the laser, and the cavity. These reveal the self-organization of domains in the density of the atomic cloud, confirming the finite-range nature of the induced interactions. We demonstrate that there is a wide and experimentally accessible parameter regime in which our protocol works robustly, with negligible heating of the quantum gas. The methodology not only paves the way for exploring new territories in quantum simulation but also enhances the understanding of fundamental physics, potentially leading to the discovery of novel quantum states and phases.

SO ZYGON
AB An extraordinary, if circumscribed, positive shift has occurred since the mid-twentieth century in the perceived status of Hugh Everett III's 1956 theory of the universal wave function of quantum mechanics, now widely called the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI). Everett's starkly new interpretation denied the existence of a separate classical realm, contending that the experimental data can be seen as presenting a state vector for the whole universe. Since there is no state vector collapse, reality as a whole is strictly deterministic. Explained jointly by the dynamical variables and the state vector, "this reality is not the reality we customarily think of, but is a reality composed of many worlds," wrote Everett's colleague Bryce DeWitt. In this essay, I account briefly for the change of status in conventional scientific terms, yet chiefly in extended terms of three sets of ideas that I argue can be understood to affect believability in both scientific and religious contexts, illuminating helpfully the MWI phenomenon, and its engagement with theology: orthodoxy and heresy, language and reference, and faith and agnosticism. One's orientation relative to the variable content of these dynamic, socially oriented categories helps to make belief in ideas as metaphysically challenging as Everettian Quantum Mechanics, or particular ideas about God, either more or less believable. The categories will have the same function in a theology engaging Everett's theory, and in any theology at all written in a society deeply marked by what I further argue is a subtle, powerful, and pervasive mode of quasi-scientific thinking we can call societal constructive agnosticism, of which anyone doing theology today must be aware.

TI Maximized Enhancement of Polarized and Unpolarized Emissions via
   Critical Coupling in Brillouin Zone Folding Metasurfaces
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Critical coupling can induce maximized field enhancement in resonant optical modes. Therefore, it is important for various photonic technologies. Here, it is shown that directional light sources with highly enhanced emission intensities can be realized via critical coupling. A clear experimental demonstration of maximized emission enhancement is presented in quantum dot (QD)-coated Brillouin zone folding (BZF) metasurfaces. BZF dielectric metasurfaces support guided-mode resonances, where the radiative quality factor can be gradually tuned by structural parameters, allowing critical coupling to occur at the QD emission wavelength. Maximized enhancements of polarized and unpolarized emissions are demonstrated in the normal direction, resulting in highly enhanced, directional, and narrow-angled emissions. The investigations indicate that light emission from quantum emitters can be optimized via critical coupling and that BZF metasurfaces can provide a highly tunable platform for both polarization-sensitive and polarization-insensitive critical coupling. Maximized field enhancement and highly enhanced light-matter interactions in BZF metasurfaces are important for a wide range of photonic technologies such as light sources, photodetectors, sensors, nonlinear enhancement, and quantum photonic devices.

The present narrative review explores potential links between Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure, dental materials and systemic health effects, with a particular focus on neurological manifestations. Drawing on principles from quantum biology and physics, the review examines unique clinical cases that defy conventional medical explanations yet may be interpreted through interactions between EMFs and metal restorations at the quantum level. These cases suggest that the human body may act as a biological interface where classical and quantum physical phenomena intersect. While the review emphasises evidence-based findings, it also presents quantum-level hypotheses-such as spin dynamics and Radical-Pair Mechanisms (RPM)-for interdisciplinary consideration, underscoring the complexity of EMF-biological interactions and the need for further investigation.

TI Characterization and Modeling of Self-Heating in Nanometer Bulk-CMOS at
   Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This work presents a self-heating study of a 40-nm bulk-CMOS technology in the ambient temperature range from 300 K down to 4.2 K. A custom test chip was designed and fabricated for measuring both the temperature rise in the MOSFET channel and in the surrounding silicon substrate, using the gate resistance and silicon diodes as sensors, respectively. Since self-heating depends on factors such as device geometry and power density, the test structure characterized in this work was specifically designed to resemble actual devices used in cryogenic qubit control ICs. Severe self-heating was observed at deep-cryogenic ambient temperatures, resulting in a channel temperature rise exceeding 50 K and having an impact detectable at a distance of up to 30 mu m from the device. By extracting the thermal resistance from measured data at different temperatures, it was shown that a simple model is able to accurately predict channel temperatures over the full ambient temperature range from deep-cryogenic to room temperature. The results and modeling presented in this work contribute towards the full self-heating-aware IC design-flow required for the reliable design and operation of cryo-CMOS circuits.

TI The critical role of ultra-low-energy vibrations in the relaxation
   dynamics of molecular qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Understanding phonon-induced relaxation in molecular qubits is a crucial step in realizing their application potential. Garlatti at al. use a combination of inelastic X-ray scattering and density functional theory to investigate the role of low-energy phonons on spin relaxation of a prototypical molecular qubit.
   Improving the performance of molecular qubits is a fundamental milestone towards unleashing the power of molecular magnetism in the second quantum revolution. Taming spin relaxation and decoherence due to vibrations is crucial to reach this milestone, but this is hindered by our lack of understanding on the nature of vibrations and their coupling to spins. Here we propose a synergistic approach to study a prototypical molecular qubit. It combines inelastic X-ray scattering to measure phonon dispersions along the main symmetry directions of the crystal and spin dynamics simulations based on DFT. We show that the canonical Debye picture of lattice dynamics breaks down and that intra-molecular vibrations with very-low energies of 1-2 meV are largely responsible for spin relaxation up to ambient temperature. We identify the origin of these modes, thus providing a rationale for improving spin coherence. The power and flexibility of our approach open new avenues for the investigation of magnetic molecules with the potential of removing roadblocks toward their use in quantum devices.

This advantage has been shown to exist even if one uses nonoptimal direct measurements on the two correlated modes. Here we present a protocol that mimics the behavior of quantum illumination, but does not use correlated or entangled modes. Instead, the protocol uses coherent (or phase-randomized coherent) pulses with randomly chosen intensities. The intensities are drawn from a distribution such that the average state looks thermal. Under appropriate conditions, the mimic protocol can perform similarly to quantum illumination schemes that use direct measurements. This holds even for a reflectance as low as 10-7. We also present an analytic condition which allows one to determine the sets of parameters in which each protocol works best.

TI A new robust PKC encryption method based on invertible matrix
   multiplication for HIE in medical IoT systems
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB Electronic health information exchange (HIE) allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient's vital medical information electronically-improving the speed, quality, safety and cost of patient care. At present, public key cryptography (PKC) is the most secure and practical cryptographic techniques to achieve this function in healthcare information exchange for medical IoT systems. ElGamal cryptosystem is one of the most well-known public key cryptosystems (they are also called asymmetric key cryptosystems), which is based on the discrete logarithm problem. At present, with the development of quantum computer technology, the ElGamal cryptosystem may be attacked by quantum algorithms. At the same time, since ElGamal requires several secure random integers to resist cryptographic analysis and ensure communication security and securing data sharing. Especially, when the encrypted information is large, multiple random numbers need to be used for grouping encryption, which makes the efficiency of ElGamal need to be improved. It is necessary to construct an alternative cryptographic algorithm that is more secure and efficient than ElGamal. In this paper, we construct a new public key cryptosystem (PKC) based on the discrete logarithm problem in GLn,p\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$GL\left(n,p\right)$$\end{document}, which is constructed by the invertible matrix multiplication and can become an alternative version of the ElGamal public key cryptosystem. We call it Matrix ElGamal cryptosystem (M-EPKC). It is proved that the proposed PKC is computationally secure, which can provide the same security as the ElGamal cryptosystem in a much smaller finite field and use fewer random integers when encrypting large amounts of messages. For matrices of size n\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n$$\end{document}, ElGamal PKC requires n\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n$$\end{document} times more random numbers to encrypt plaintext with the same amount of data. The proposed M-EPKC is not only proved to be resistant to Shor's algorithm attack (Shor in SIAM Rev 41: 303-332, 1999) on the integer field, but it can also improve its own computational efficiency by accelerating the decryption algorithm. Therefore, compare with the ElGamal cryptosystem, our proposed M-EPKC can provide a more secure and efficient method in healthcare information exchange for medical IoT systems.

TI Majorana fermions in Kitaev chains side-coupled to normal metals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a normal metal (NM) side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant used to characterize topological phases.

TI Quantum-compliant users scheduling optimization in joint transmission
   mobile access networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Joint Transmission (JT) is the dynamic coordination of transmission and/or reception at multiple geographically separated sites to improve end-user service quality. When user equipment receives signals from multiple sites, downstream performance improves. An optimization problem arises in selecting the best user subset for JT within a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. Unfortunately, a pure brute-force approach is not feasible due to exponential time growth with user combinations, unsuitable for real-time selection in mobile networks with users continuously changing in time. This article proposes quantum-compliant heuristics using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for JT user scheduling. QUBO handles initial user selection, followed by brute-force exploration for the solution. Numerical results indicate that quantum-compliant methods decrease solution time without substantial accuracy loss compared to brute-force methods.

   operational matrix
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
AB In this work, we present a numerical scheme based on the operational matrix of fractional Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) integration for handling fractional Bloch equation (FBE) in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The understanding of Bloch equation provides us a fundamental framework for describing magnetic resonance phenomena, facilitating breakthrough in diverse fields such as medical diagnostics, quantum computing and materials characterization. The non-integer order derivative and integration are presented in the Caputo-Fabrizio sense. To construct the operational matrix, Jacobi polynomial is used as a basis. The fractional Bloch equation is transformed into a set of algebraic equations by using the operational matrix. In order to examine the fractional order problem, we obtain an approximate solution for FBE and present the numerical results in graphical and tabular forms.

TI Noise suppression by differential detection of simultaneous
   electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption in
   counterpropagating bichromatic light
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Well-established electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) have been applied to various applications including quantum computing, light storage, and precision measurement. Here, we propose and implement a differential detection scheme based on coexisting EIT and EIA signals in a double-Lambda system with counterpropagating bichromatic laser fields, in which a differential coherent population trapping (diff-CPT) signal is extracted with a desired enhanced amplitude and highly suppressed common-mode noise. Compared to that of either EIT or EIA, the observed signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed method's diff-CPT signal improved by one order of magnitude, which would benefit the implementation of high-performance CPT clocks. This technique may also be applied to magnetometers and precision spectroscopy.

TI The polynomial learning with errors problem and the smearing condition
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB As quantum computing advances rapidly, guaranteeing the security of cryptographic protocols resistant to quantum attacks is paramount. Some leading candidate cryptosystems use the learning with errors (LWE) problem, attractive for its simplicity and hardness guaranteed by reductions from hard computational lattice problems. Its algebraic variants, ring-learning with errors (RLWE) and polynomial learning with errors (PLWE), gain efficiency over standard LWE, but their security remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we consider the "smearing" condition, a condition for attacks on PLWE and RLWE introduced in Elias et al. We expand upon some questions about smearing posed by Elias et al. and show how smearing is related to the coupon collector's problem. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for computing probabilities related to smearing. Finally, we present a smearing-based algorithm for solving the PLWE problem.

TI A new formulation of gradient boosting
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In the setting of regression, the standard formulation of gradient boosting generates a sequence of improvements to a constant model. In this paper, we reformulate gradient boosting such that it is able to generate a sequence of improvements to a nonconstant model, which may contain prior knowledge or physical insight about the data generating process. Moreover, we introduce a simple variant of multi-target stacking that extends our approach to the setting of multi-target regression. An experiment on a real-world superconducting quantum device calibration dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art calibration model even though it only receives a paucity of training examples. Further, it significantly outperforms a well-known gradient boosting algorithm, known as LightGBM, as well as an entirely data-driven reimplementation of the calibration model, which suggests the viability of our approach.

   characterization
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB The characterization of quantum states is a fundamental step of any application of quantum technologies. Nowadays, there exist several approaches addressing this problem, also based on machine and deep learning techniques. However, all these approaches usually require a number of measurements that scale exponentially with the number of parties composing the system. Threshold quantum state tomography (tQST) addresses this problem and, in some cases of interest, can significantly reduce the number of measurements. In this paper, we study how to combine a permutation-equivariant deep learning model with the tQST protocol. We test the model on quantum state tomography and purity estimation. Finally, we validate the robustness of the model to noise. We show results up to 4 qubits.

SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes are an important resource used in various branches of quantum science and technology due to their unique helical structure and countably infinite basis. Generating light that simultaneously carries high-order orbital angular momenta and exhibits quantum correlations is a challenging task. In this work, we present a theoretical approach to the generation of correlated Schmidt modes carrying OAM via parametric down-conversion (PDC) in cascaded nonlinear systems (nonlinear interferometers) pumped by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We demonstrate how the number of generated modes and their population can be controlled by varying the pump parameters, the gain of the PDC process, and the distance between the crystals. We investigate the angular displacement measurement uncertainty of these interferometers and demonstrate that it can overcome the classical shot noise limit.

TI Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range
   Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Driven-dissipative many-body systems support nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this Letter, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidence to support the existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from mean-field limit cycles to correlated BTCs featuring sizable quantum correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on the experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.

We consider two different types of particles' confinement: (i) trapping in a harmonic potential and (ii) constraining to the surface of a sphere. In such settings the most probable arrangements of particles correspond to characteristic geometric patterns resulting from the combined effect of confinement and the Pauli exclusion principle. We discuss the geometry of these optimal configurations as well as two different methods of extracting these shapes from a number of single shot pictures of the system.

AB We present a mechanism for efficiency increase in quantum heat engines containing internal energy levels that do not couple to the external work sink. The gain is achieved by using these levels to channel heat in a direction opposite to the one dictated by the second law. No quantum coherence, quantum correlations or ergotropy are required. A similar mechanism allows the engine to run "in reverse" and still produce useful work. We illustrate these ideas using a simple quantum Otto cycle in a coupled-spin system. We find this engine also exhibits other counterintuitive phenomenology. For example, its efficiency may increase as the temperature difference between the heat baths decreases. Conversely, it may cease to operate if the hotter bath becomes too hot or the colder bath too cold.

TI Many-body simulations of the fast flavor instability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The neutrino fast flavor instability dominates the evolution of neutrino flavor within the engines of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. However, theoretical models of neutrino flavor change that include many-body quantum correlations can differ starkly from similar mean-field calculations. We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could occur before mean-field instabilities are able to saturate. Our results have significant implications for astrophysical explosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observable neutrino signatures.

TI Topological Josephson Junction in Transverse Magnetic Field
SO JETP LETTERS
AB We consider Majorana zero modes in a Josephson junction on top of a topological insulator in transverse magnetic field. Majorana zero modes reside at periodically located nodes of Josephson vortices. We find that hybridization of these modes is prohibited by symmetries of the problem at vanishing chemical potential, which ensures better protection of zero modes and yields methods to control the tunnel coupling between Majorana modes for quantum information processing applications.

TI Purified pseudomode model for nonlinear system-bath interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The theory of purified pseudomodes (arXiv:2412.04264) was recently developed to provide a numerical tool for the analysis of the properties of a quantum system and the environment it couples to via linear system-bath interactions. Here we extend this theory to allow for the description of general nonlinear system-bath interactions. We demonstrate the validity of our method by considering the spontaneous decay of a two-level atom placed inside a single-mode lossy cavity, and furthermore, its potential application to nanophotonics by calculating the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a quantum dot in the presence of a phonon environment. Our method provides a useful tool for the study of phonon-assisted emission in quantum dots and holds the promise for broad applications in fields like quantum biology, nonlinear phononics, and nanophotonics.

TI Terahertz control and timing correlations in a transmission electron
   microscope
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Ultrafast electron microscopy provides a movie-like access to structural dynamics of materials in space and time, but fundamental atomic motions or electron dynamics are, so far, too quick to be resolved. Here, we report the all-optical control, compression, and characterization of electron pulses in a transmission electron microscope by the single optical cycles of laser-generated terahertz light. This concept provides isolated electron pulses and merges the spatial resolution of a transmission electron microscope with the temporal resolution that is offered by a single cycle of laser light. We also report the all-optical control of multi-electron states and find a substantial two-electron and three-electron anticorrelation in the time domain. These results open up the possibility to visualize atomic and electronic motions together with their quantum correlations on fundamental dimensions in space and time.

TI Biphoton phase-space correlations from Gouy-phase measurements using
   double slits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum correlations encoded in photonic Laguerre-Gaussian modes were shown to be related to the Gouyphase shifts [Kawase et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050501 (2008)], allowing for a nondestructive manipulation of photonic quantum states. In this work, we exploit the relation between phase-space correlations of biphotons produced by spontaneously parametric down-conversion (SPDC) as encoded in the logarithmic negativity (LN) and the Gouy phase as they are diffracted through an asymmetrical double-slit setup. Using an analytical approach based on a double-Gaussian approximation for type-I SPDC biphotons, we show that measurements of Gouy-phase differences provide information on their phase-space entanglement variation, governed by the physical parameters of the experiment and expressed by the LN via covariance matrix elements.

TI One-particle entanglement for one-dimensional spinless fermions after an
   interaction quantum quench
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Particle entanglement provides information on quantum correlations in systems of indistinguishable particles. Here, we study the one-particle entanglement entropy for an integrable model of spinless, interacting fermions both at equilibrium and after an interaction quantum quench. Using both large-scale exact diagonalization and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations, we numerically compute the one-body reduced density matrix for the J -V model, as well as its postquench dynamics. We include an analysis of the fermionic momentum distribution, showcasing its time evolution after a quantum quench. Our numerical results, extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, can be compared with field theoretic bosonization in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid regime. Excellent agreement is obtained using an interaction cutoff that can be determined uniquely in the ground state.

TI Quantum Solvers for Plane-Wave Hamiltonians: Abridging Virtual Spaces
   Through the Optimization of Pairwise Correlations
SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB For many-body methods such as MCSCF and CASSCF, in which the number of one-electron orbitals is optimized and independent of the basis set used, there are no problems with using plane-wave basis sets. However, for methods currently used in quantum computing such as select configuration interaction (CI) and coupled cluster (CC) methods, it is necessary to have a virtual space that is able to capture a significant amount of electron-electron correlation in the system. The virtual orbitals in a pseudopotential plane-wave Hartree-Fock calculation, because of Coulomb repulsion, are often scattering states that interact very weakly with the filled orbitals. As a result, very little correlation energy is captured from them. The use of virtual spaces derived from the one-electron operators has also been tried, and while some correlations are captured, the amount is quite low. To overcome these limitations, we have been developing new classes of algorithms to define virtual spaces by optimizing orbitals from small pairwise CI Hamiltonians, which we term as correlation optimized virtual orbitals with the abbreviation COVOs. With these procedures, we have been able to derive virtual spaces, containing only a few orbitals, which are able to capture a significant amount of correlation. The focus in this manuscript is on using these derived basis sets to target full CI (FCI) quality results for H-2 on near-term quantum computers. However, the initial results for this approach were promising. We were able to obtain good agreement with FCI/cc-pVTZ results for this system with just 4 virtual orbitals, using both FCI and quantum simulations. The quality of the results using COVOs suggests that it may be possible to use them in other many-body approaches, including coupled cluster and Moller-Plesset perturbation theories, and open up the door to many-body calculations for pseudopotential plane-wave basis set methods.

TI Bell inequalities for nonlocality depth
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB When three or more particles are considered, quantum correlations can be stronger than the correlations generated by so-called hybrid local hidden variable models, where some of the particles are considered as a single block inside which communication and signaling is allowed. We provide an exhaustive classification of Bell inequalities to characterize various hybrid scenarios in four-and five-particle systems. In quantum mechanics, these inequalities provide device-independent witnesses for the entanglement depth. In addition, we construct a family of inequalities to detect a nonlocality depth of (n - 1) in n-particle systems. Moreover, we present two generalizations of the original Svetlichny inequality, which was the first Bell inequality designed for hybrid models. Our results are based on the cone-projection technique, which can be used to completely characterize Bell inequalities under affine constraints; even for many parties, measurements, and outcomes.

TI Quantum signatures in a quadratic optomechanical heat engine with an
   atom in a tapered trap
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate how quantum signatures can emerge in a single atom heat engine consisting of an atom confined in a tapered trap and subjected to hot and cold thermal reservoirs. A similar system was realized experimentally in Science 352, 325 (2016). We model such a system using a quadratic optomechanical model and identify an effective Otto cycle in the system's dynamics. We compare the engine's performance in quantum and classical regimes by evaluating the power dissipated. We find that lowering the temperature is insufficient to make the single atom engine in Science 352, 325 (2016) a genuine quantum-enhanced heat engine. We show that it is necessary to make the trap more asymmetric and confined to ensure that quantum correlations cause an enhancement in the power output.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum Lyapunov control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.

TI NSI effects on tripartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB In this study, we investigate the impact of new physics on different measures of tripartite entanglement within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These measures encompass concurrence, entanglement of formation, and negativity. We analyze the influence of new physics on these measures across a range of experimental setups involving both reactors and accelerators. Reactor experiments under consideration include Daya Bay, JUNO, and KamLAND setups, while accelerator experiments encompass T2K, MINOS, and DUNE. Our analysis reveals that accelerator experiments demonstrate greater sensitivity to NSI, with the most pronounced impact observed in the DUNE experiment. Negativity, while a weaker metric compared to EOF and concurrence, exhibits maximal sensitivity to NSI effects, particularly evident when neutrinos possess moderate to high energies. Conversely, reactor experiments demonstrate less sensitivity to NSI, with concurrence and EOF displaying more prominent effects.

TI N-body antibunching in a degenerate Fermi gas of 3He∗ atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A key set of observables for investigating quantum systems are the n-body correlation functions, which provide a powerful tool for experimentally determining coherence and directly probing the many-body wave function. While the (bosonic) correlations of photonic systems are well explored, the correlations present in matter-wave systems, particularly for fermionic atoms, are still an emerging field. In this work, we use the unique single-atom detection properties of 3He* atoms to perform simultaneous measurements of the n-body quantum correlations, up to the fifth order, of a degenerate Fermi gas. In a direct demonstration of the Pauli exclusion principle, we observe clear antibunching at all orders and find good agreement with predicted correlation volumes. Our results pave the way for using correlation functions to probe some of the rich physics associated with fermionic systems.

TI Transport threshold in a quantum model for the KscA ion channel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The mechanism behind the high throughput rate in K+ channels is still an open problem. However, recent simulations have shown that the passage of potassium through the K+ channel core, the so-called selectivity filter (SF), is water-free against models where the strength of Coulomb repulsion freezes ions conduction. Thus, it has been suggested that coherent quantum hopping might be relevant in mediating ion conduction. Within the quantum approach and the hypothesis of desolvated ions along the pathway, we start with several particles in a source to see how they go across a SF, modeled by a linear chain of sites, to be collected in a drain. We show that the average SF occupancy is three ions, and the ion transfer rate is similar to 10(8) ions s(-1), results which agree with the recent findings in the literature.

TI Semi-Device-Independent Framework Based on Restricted Distrust in
   Prepare-and-Measure Experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A semi-device-independent framework for prepare-and-measure experiments is introduced in which an experimenter can tune the degree of distrust in the performance of the quantum devices. In this framework, a receiver operates an uncharacterized measurement device and a sender operates a preparation device that emits states with a bounded fidelity with respect to a set of target states. No assumption on Hilbert space dimension is required. The set of quantum correlations is investigated and bounded from both the interior and the exterior. Furthermore, the optimal performance of quantum state discrimination with bounded distrust is derived and applied to certification of detection efficiency. Quantum-over-classical advantages are demonstrated and the magnitude of distrust compatible with such advantages is explored. Finally, efficient schemes for semi-device-independent random number generation are developed.

TI Tunable momentum pair creation of spin excitations in dipolar bilayers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the temporal growth and spatial propagation of quantum correlations in a two-dimensional bilayer realizing a spin-1/2 quantum XXZ model with couplings mediated by long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions. Starting with an initial state consisting of spins with opposite magnetization in each of the layers, we predict a dynamic instability that results, at short times, in the creation of correlated pairs of excitations at specific momenta at exponentially fast rates and entanglement between spatially separated modes. The momentum structure of the created pairs can be controlled via the dipolar orientation, the layer separation, or the dipolar couplings. The predicted behavior remains observable at very low filling fractions, making it accessible in state-of-the-art experiments with Rydberg atoms, magnetic atoms, and polar molecule arrays.

TI Quantum-Monte-Carlo-based functional for dysprosium dipolar systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantum-Monte-Carlo-based density functional to describe droplet formation and supersolidity in dipolar systems. The usual Lee-Huang-Yang term, accounting for quantum correlations in the conventional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (eGPE), has been substituted by the correlation energy evaluated with quantum Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the ability of our functional to reproduce existing experimental data for the minimum critical number of atoms Nc required for droplet formation. Nc is a challenging quantity for theoretical predictions, and the eGPE provides only a qualitative description of it, mainly when it is applied to dysprosium. We also use our approach to characterize the BEC-supersolid transition. The quantum-MonteCarlo-based functional can be easily implemented in any existing eGPE code, improving the description of dipolar systems without increasing the computational cost.

TI Tuberculosis conundrum-current and future scenarios: A proposed
   comprehensive approach combining laboratory, imaging, and computing
   advances
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global threat, with the rise of multiple and extensively drug resistant TB posing additional challenges. The International health community has set various 5-yearly targets for TB elimination: mathematical modelling suggests that a 2050 target is feasible with a strategy combining better diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines to detect and treat both latent and active infection. The availability of rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic tools (Gene-Xpert, TB-Quick) will vastly facilitate population-level identification of TB (including rifampicin resistance and through it, multi-drug-resistant TB). Basic-research advances have illuminated molecular mechanisms in TB, including the protective role of Vitamin D. Also, Mycobacterium tuberculosis impairs the host immune response through epigenetic mechanisms (histone-binding modulation). Imaging will continue to be key, both for initial diagnosis and follow-up. We discuss advances in multiple imaging modalities to evaluate TB tissue changes, such as molecular imaging techniques (including pathogen-specific positron emission tomography imaging agents), non-invasive temporal monitoring, and computing enhancements to improve data acquisition and reduce scan times. Big data analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, notably in the AI sub-field called "Deep Learning ", can potentially increase the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. Additionally, Federated learning makes multi-institutional/multi-city AI-based collaborations possible without sharing identifiable patient data. More powerful hardware designs - e.g., Edge and Quantum Computing- will facilitate the role of computing applications in TB. However, "Artificial Intelligence needs real Intelligence to guide it! " To have maximal impact, AI must use a holistic approach that incorporates time tested human wisdom gained over decades from the full gamut of TB, i.e., key imaging and clinical parameters, including prognostic indicators, plus bacterial and epidemiologic data. We propose a similar holistic approach at the level of national/international policy formulation and implementation, to enable effective culmination of TB's endgame, summarizing it with the acronym "TB - REVISITED ".

TI Revealing the Origin and Nature of the Buried Metal-Substrate Interface
   Layer in Ta/Sapphire Superconducting Films
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Despite constituting a smaller fraction of the qubit's electromagnetic mode, surfaces and interfaces can exert significant influence as sources of high-loss tangents, which brings forward the need to reveal properties of these extended defects and identify routes to their control. Here, we examine the structure and composition of the metal-substrate interfacial layer that exists in Ta/sapphire-based superconducting films. Synchrotron-based X-ray reflectivity measurements of Ta films, commonly used in these qubits, reveal an unexplored interface layer at the metal-substrate interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy identified an intermixing layer (approximate to 0.65 +/- 0.05 nm) at the metal-substrate interface containing Al, O, and Ta atoms. Density functional theory modeling reveals that the structure and properties of the Ta/sapphire heterojunctions are determined by the oxygen content on the sapphire surface prior to Ta deposition for two atomic terminations of sapphire. Using a multimodal approach, we gained deeper insights into the interface layer between the metal and substrate, which suggests that the orientation of deposited Ta films depend on the surface termination of sapphire. The observed elemental intermixing at the metal-substrate interface influences the thermodynamic stability and electronic behavior of the film, which may also affect qubit performance.

TI Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase
   transition
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy-the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits-within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit subsystem, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state (DFS) during storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging DFS and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.

TI Extraction of Roads Using the Archimedes Tuning Process with the Quantum
   Dilated Convolutional Neural Network
SO SENSORS
AB Road network extraction is a significant challenge in remote sensing (RS). Automated techniques for interpreting RS imagery offer a cost-effective solution for obtaining road network data quickly, surpassing traditional visual interpretation methods. However, the diverse characteristics of road networks, such as varying lengths, widths, materials, and geometries across different regions, pose a formidable obstacle for road extraction from RS imagery. The issue of road extraction can be defined as a task that involves capturing contextual and complex elements while also preserving boundary information and producing high-resolution road segmentation maps for RS data. The objective of the proposed Archimedes tuning process quantum dilated convolutional neural network for road Extraction (ATP-QDCNNRE) technology is to tackle the aforementioned issues by enhancing the efficacy of image segmentation outcomes that exploit remote sensing imagery, coupled with Archimedes optimization algorithm methods (AOA). The findings of this study demonstrate the enhanced road-extraction capabilities achieved by the ATP-QDCNNRE method when used with remote sensing imagery. The ATP-QDCNNRE method employs DL and a hyperparameter tuning process to generate high-resolution road segmentation maps. The basis of this approach lies in the QDCNN model, which incorporates quantum computing (QC) concepts and dilated convolutions to enhance the network's ability to capture both local and global contextual information. Dilated convolutions also enhance the receptive field while maintaining spatial resolution, allowing fine road features to be extracted. ATP-based hyperparameter modifications improve QDCNNRE road extraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ATP-QDCNNRE system, benchmark databases are used to assess its simulation results. The experimental results show that ATP-QDCNNRE performed with an intersection over union (IoU) of 75.28%, mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 95.19%, F1 of 90.85%, precision of 87.54%, and recall of 94.41% in the Massachusetts road dataset. These findings demonstrate the superior efficiency of this technique compared to more recent methods.

TI Efficient simulation of potential energy operators on quantum hardware:
   a study on sodium iodide (NaI)
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study introduces a conceptually novel polynomial encoding algorithm for simulating potential energy operators encoded in diagonal unitary forms in a quantum computing machine. The current trend in quantum computational chemistry is effective experimentation to achieve high-precision quantum computational advantage. However, high computational gate complexity and fidelity loss are some of the impediments to the realization of this advantage in a real quantum hardware. In this study, we address the challenges of building a diagonal Hamiltonian operator having exponential functional form, and its implementation in the context of the time evolution problem (Hamiltonian simulation and encoding). Potential energy operators when represented in the first quantization form is an example of such types of operators. Through systematic decomposition and construction, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed polynomial encoding method in reducing gate complexity from O ( 2 n ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal {O}(2<^>n)$$\end{document} to O & sum; i = 1 r n C r \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal {O}\left( \sum _{i=1}<^>{r} {} <^>nC_r \right)$$\end{document} (for some r << n \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$r\ll n$$\end{document} ). This offers a solution with lower complexity in comparison to the conventional Hadamard basis encoding approach. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated with its implementation in the IBM quantum simulator and IBM quantum hardware. This study demonstrates the proposed approach by taking the example of the potential energy operator of the sodium iodide molecule (NaI) in the first quantization form. The numerical results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed method in quantum chemistry problems, while the analytical bound for error analysis and computational gate complexity discussed, throw light on issues regarding its implementation.

AB Experimental evaluation steers the development of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, and large-scale evaluation campaigns provide the field with a common infrastructure to conduct comparable evaluation exercises. Over the years, tools and platforms have been developed to manage and automate these activities, enhance the reproducibility of conducted experiments and facilitate data sharing. In this context, Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS) emerged as an approach to avoid distributing experimental collections, which may contain copyrighted or sensitive data, and instead execute containerised code on that data on remote servers. We propose Kubernetes Infrastructure for Managed Evaluation and Resource Access (KIMERA) as the next step from EaaS into Evaluation-in-the-Cloud (EitC), allowing researchers to directly code and execute their systems through their browsers, requiring only an internet connection. Moreover, recent advancements, such as Large Language Models, or new computing paradigms, such as quantum computers, require external thirdparty services and computational resources. In this respect, KIMERA streamlines and simplifies access to such services on-demand via their APIs. More in detail, KIMERA relies on state-of-the-art containerization and orchestration tools, such asDocker andKubernetes, to provide a robust, scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant IR evaluation platform. KIMERA monitors and stores all the participants' submissions, accurately keeping track of the resource usage, allowing for evaluating both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the deployed methods. Moreover, all participants can be assignedworkspaces sharing the same resources (i.e., CPU and RAM), thus enhancing reproducibility and comparability among systems. Finally, KIMERA has been designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing it to be easily adapted to new use cases and usage scenarios. KIMERA has been developed and adopted in the context of the QuantumCLEF lab, to allow for mixed experiments, comparing approaches running on traditional hardware and on real quantum annealers provided by external companies. KIMERA has also been used as a learning resource to provide Quantum Computing tutorials for IR at major conferences, such as ECIR and SIGIR. The source code of KIMERA is openly available at https://github.com/MjPaxter/KIMERA.

TI The second-order quasi-normal modes for AdS black branes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate second-order gravitational perturbations in asymptotically AdS black branes, developing a gauge-invariant framework to compute the amplitude ratio between quadratic and linear quasi-normal modes. Our analysis reveals resonant divergences of this ratio when the summed frequencies of two source modes coincide with the frequency of a third mode. These divergences are shown to manifest as poles in three-point fully retarded correlators of the energy-momentum tensor in the holographically dual quantum field theory, establishing a concrete connection between bulk gravitational nonlinearities and observables in the dual boundary theory. Our findings contribute to the understanding of nonlinearity in quantum many-body systems while deepening the holographic dictionary between spacetime dynamics and quantum correlations.

TI Transverse and Quantum Localization of Light: A Review on Theory and
   Experiments
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Anderson localization is an interference effect yielding a drastic reduction of diffusion-including complete hindrance-of wave packets such as sound, electromagnetic waves, and particle wave functions in the presence of strong disorder. In optics, this effect has been observed and demonstrated unquestionably only in dimensionally reduced systems. In particular, transverse localization (TL) occurs in optical fibers, which are disordered orthogonal to and translationally invariant along the propagation direction. The resonant and tube-shaped localized states act as micro-fiber-like single-mode transmission channels. Since the proposal of the first TL models in the early eighties, the fabrication technology and experimental probing techniques took giant steps forwards: TL has been observed in photo-refractive crystals, in plastic optical fibers, and also in glassy platforms, while employing direct laser writing is now possible to tailor and "design" disorder. This review covers all these aspects that are today making TL closer to applications such as quantum communication or image transport. We first discuss nonlinear optical phenomena in the TL regime, enabling steering of optical communication channels. We further report on an experiment testing the traditional, approximate way of introducing disorder into Maxwell's equations for the description of TL. We find that it does not agree with our findings for the average localization length. We present a new theory, which does not involve an approximation and which agrees with our findings. Finally, we report on some quantum aspects, showing how a single-photon state can be localized in some of its inner degrees of freedom and how quantum phenomena can be employed to secure a quantum communication channel.</p>

TI DynBlock: dynamic data encryption with Toffoli gate for IoT
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The emergence of 6G networks, coupled with the expansion of smart devices, necessitates robust and efficient cryptography solutions to ensure secure communication. However, the existing resource-constrained cryptography solutions that rely on static permutation, substitution methods, variable key sizes, and fixed block size are vulnerable to quantum computing-based cryptanalysis and side-channel attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight dynamic block cipher (DynBlock) algorithm. DynBlock is specifically suitable for resource-limited devices, and features a dynamic block size (64-128 bits), which is adaptable to symmetric encryption key sizes. Additionally, DynBlock includes dynamic permutation and substitution layers that enhance confusion and diffusion properties, along with a novel substitution-permutation network (SPN) algorithm that eliminates conventional substitution- and permutation-boxes. DynBlock leverages Tofoli gates and XOR operations to reduce the number of computation operations required to achieve optimal throughput and energy efficiency. Security validation of DynBlock is performed considering various metrics, including an average key avalanche effect of 53.85%, average plain-text avalanche effect of 57.82%, differential cryptanalysis (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Delta = 2<^>{-128}$$\end{document}), and cryptanalysis (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Lambda = 2<^>{-64}$$\end{document}). Performance is compared against various state-of-the-art schemes. We evaluate DynBlock with both 3 and 5 rounds to assess its security and computational efficiency. While the 5-round configuration offers stronger resistance to cryptanalytic attacks, the 3-round setup already delivers robust security, featuring high entropy and a strong avalanche effect, making it well-suited for resource-constrained environments. It is found that DynBlock significantly improves energy efficiency and throughput compared to its predecessors. Additionally, DynBlock demonstrates resistance to quantum computing-based attacks, improved side-channel attack resilience, and enhanced randomness and entropy.

TI Broadband, efficient extraction of quantum light by a photonic device
   comprised of a metallic nano-ring and a gold back reflector
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB To implement quantum light sources based on quantum emitters in applications, it is desirable to improve the extraction efficiency of single photons. In particular, controlling the directionality and solid angle of the emission are key parameters, for instance, to couple single photons into optical fibers and send the information encoded in quantum light over long distances, for quantum communication applications. In addition, fundamental studies of the radiative behavior of quantum emitters, including studies of coherence and blinking, benefit from such improved photon collection. Quantum dots grown via Stranski-Krastanov technique have shown to be good candidates for bright, coherent, indistinguishable quantum light emission. However, one of the challenges associated with these quantum light sources arises from the fact that the emission wavelengths can vary from one emitter to the other. To this end, broadband light extractors that do not rely on high-quality factor optical cavities would be desirable, so that no tuning between the quantum dot emission wavelength and the resonator used to increase the light extraction is needed. Here, we show that metallic nano-rings combined with gold back reflectors increase the collection efficiency of single photons, and we study the statistics of this effect when quantum dots are spatially randomly distributed within the nano-rings. We show an average increase in the brightness of about a factor 7.5, when comparing emitters within and outside the nanorings, in devices with a gold back reflector, and we measure count rates exceeding 7 x 10(6) photons per second and single photon purities as high as 85% +/- 1%. These results are important steps toward the realization of scalable, broadband, easy to fabricate sources of quantum light for quantum communication applications. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Quantum approximate multi-objective optimization
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB The goal of multi-objective optimization is to understand optimal trade-offs between competing objective functions by finding the Pareto front, that is, the set of all Pareto-optimal solutions, where no objective can be improved without degrading another one. Multi-objective optimization can be challenging classically, even if the corresponding single-objective optimization problems are efficiently solvable. Thus, multi-objective optimization represents a compelling problem class to analyze with quantum computers. Here we use a low-depth quantum approximate optimization algorithm to approximate the optimal Pareto front of certain multi-objective weighted maximum-cut problems. We demonstrate its performance on an IBM Quantum computer, as well as with matrix product state numerical simulation, and show its potential to outperform classical approaches.

TI Reconstructing thermal quantum quench dynamics from pure states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Simulating the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal states is a fundamental problem across scales from high-energy to condensed-matter physics. Quantum computers may provide a way to solve this problem efficiently. Preparing a thermal state on a quantum computer is challenging, but there exist methods to circumvent this by computing a weighted sum of time-dependent matrix elements in a convenient basis. While the number of basis states can be large, in this paper we show that it can be reduced by simulating only the largest density matrix elements by weight, capturing the density matrix to a specified precision. Leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries enables further reductions. This approach paves the way to more accurate thermal-state dynamics simulations on near-term quantum hardware.

TI Error mitigation, optimization, and extrapolation on a trapped-ion
   testbed
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) trapped-ion devices are subject to errors which can significantly impact the accuracy of calculations if left unchecked. A form of error mitigation called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) can decrease an algorithm's sensitivity to these errors without increasing the number of required qubits. Here we explore different methods for integrating this error mitigation technique into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for calculating the ground state of the HeH+ molecule at 0.8 & Aring; in the presence of experimental noise. Using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) trapped-ion device, we test three methods of scaling noise for extrapolation: time stretching the two-qubit gates, scaling the sideband detuning parameter, and inserting two-qubit gate identity operations into the ansatz circuit. We find that time stretching and sideband detuning scaling fail to scale the noise on our particular hardware in a way that can be extrapolated to zero noise. Scaling our noise with global gate identity insertions and extrapolating after variational optimization, we achieve error suppression of 96.8%, resulting in an energy estimate within -0.004 +/- 0.04 hartree of the ground state energy. This is an improvement, but still outside the chemical accuracy threshold of 0.0016 hartree. Our results show that the efficacy of this error mitigation technique depends on choosing the correct implementation for a given device architecture.

TI The Mystery of Dibenzoterrylene: a Clar-interlocked Biphenalenyl
   Biradical
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The first time in-depth characterization of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) was performed by a combination of various experimental and computational techniques. First structure confirmation and atom assignment were achieved by means of 2D-NMR and powder X-ray. DFT methods shed light on the conformational space of DBT and, more importantly, on the complex electronic structure of the molecule. DBT appears to be the first studied molecule, two low-lying conformers of which have drastically different biradical character. EPR and NMR studies show the effect of solvent on the population of the biradical state. This demonstrates the perspectives of the usage of DBT and its derivatives in spintronics and other quantum technologies.

TI LED-pumped room-temperature solid-state maser
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Room-temperature MASERs (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) amplify electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies with minimal noise. We demonstrate a cost-effective LED-pumped maser using pentacene-doped para-terphenyl as the gain medium. Here, we show that LED light, which is brightness-enhanced and guided via a cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet luminescent concentrator, achieves persistent maser emission at 1.45 GHz with a duration of 200 mu s and a microwave output power of 0.014 mW, surpassing previous non-laser pumped systems. Operating at low voltage, the LED-pumped maser ensures safety, reduced costs, and simple integration. Potential applications include sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, portable atomic clocks, quantum technologies, and enhanced deep-space radio astronomy.

TI Tuning the topological properties of the antiferromagnetic
   V(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 via Sb
   concentration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB The investigation of topological materials has uncovered groundbreaking phases of matter with significant implications for quantum technologies. Here, we explore the antiferromagnetic topological insulator family V(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (x = 0, 0.5, 1), formed by introducing vanadium telluride layers into the layered topological insulator (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3. Our results reveal the tunability of the spin Hall conductivity and its topological contribution, quantified by the recently introduced average spin Chern number, via Sb concentration. The materials' strong topological insulating behavior is established through spin-orbit-coupling-induced band inversions, nontrivial Z2 invariants, and the presence of topological surface states. These findings position V(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices and advanced quantum applications.

   Control, Single-Shot Detection, and Optical ? Phase Shift
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We demonstrate a new versatile building block for optical quantum technologies, enabling deterministic quantum engineering of light by combining the advantages of two complementary approaches: cavity quantum electrodynamics and interacting atomic ensembles. Our system is based on an intracavity Rydberg-blockaded atomic ensemble acting as a single two-level superatom. We coherently control its state and optically detect it in a single shot with 95% efficiency. Crucially, we demonstrate a superatom-statedependent ?? phase rotation on the light reflected from the cavity. Together with the state manipulation and detection, it is a key ingredient for implementing deterministic photonic entangling gates and for generating highly nonclassical light states.

TI Goal seeking Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
SO RESULTS IN CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
AB The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) modeling and solution framework is a requirement for quantum and digital annealers. However optimality for QUBO problems of any practical size is extremely difficult to achieve. In order to incorporate the problemspecific insights, a diverse set of solutions meeting an acceptable target metric or goal is the preference in high level decision making. In this paper, we present two alternatives for goalseeking QUBO for minimizing the deviation from a given target as well as a range of values around a target. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over Constraint Programming for quickly finding a satisficing set of solutions.

TI Robust spin squeezing from the tower of states of U(1)-symmetric spin
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spin squeezing-a central resource for quantum metrology-can be generated via the nonlinear, entangling evolution of an initially factorized spin state. Here we show that robust (i.e., persistent) squeezing dynamics is generated by a very large class of S = 1/2 spin Hamiltonians with axial symmetry, in relationship with the existence of a peculiar structure of the low-lying Hamiltonian eigenstates-the so-called Anderson's tower of states. Such states are fundamentally related to the appearance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum systems; and, for models with sufficiently high connectivity, they are parametrically close to the eigenstates of a planar rotor (Dicke states), in that they feature an anomalously large value of the total angular momentum. Our central insight is that starting from a coherent spin state, a generic U(1)-symmetric Hamiltonian featuring the Anderson's tower of states generates the same squeezing evolution at short times as the one governed by the paradigmatic one-axis-twisting (or planar-rotor) model of squeezing dynamics. The full squeezing evolution of the planar-rotor model is seemingly reproduced for interactions decaying with distance r as r-alpha when alpha < 5d/3 in d dimensions. Our results connect quantum simulation with quantum metrology by unveiling the squeezing power of a large variety of Hamiltonian dynamics that are currently implemented by different quantum simulation platforms.

TI Performance Projection of Vacuum Gate Dielectric Doping-Free Carbon
   Nanoribbon/Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors for Radiation-Immune
   Nanoelectronics
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB This paper investigates the performance of vacuum gate dielectric doping-free carbon nanotube/nanoribbon field-effect transistors (VGD-DL CNT/GNRFETs) via computational analysis employing a quantum simulation approach. The methodology integrates the self-consistent solution of the Poisson solver with the mode space non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) in the ballistic limit. Adopting the vacuum gate dielectric (VGD) paradigm ensures radiation-hardened functionality while avoiding radiation-induced trapped charge mechanisms, while the doping-free paradigm facilitates fabrication flexibility by avoiding the realization of a sharp doping gradient in the nanoscale regime. Electrostatic doping of the nanodevices is achieved via source and drain doping gates. The simulations encompass MOSFET and tunnel FET (TFET) modes. The numerical investigation comprehensively examines potential distribution, transfer characteristics, subthreshold swing, leakage current, on-state current, current ratio, and scaling capability. Results demonstrate the robustness of vacuum nanodevices for high-performance, radiation-hardened switching applications. Furthermore, a proposal for extrinsic enhancement via doping gate voltage adjustment to optimize band diagrams and improve switching performance at ultra-scaled regimes is successfully presented. These findings underscore the potential of vacuum gate dielectric carbon-based nanotransistors for ultrascaled, high-performance, energy-efficient, and radiation-immune nanoelectronics.

TI Spin-Selective Resonant Tunneling Induced by Rashba Spin-Orbit
   Interaction in Semiconductor Nanowire
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We consider a single electron confined within a quantum wire in a system of two electrostatically induced quantum dots defined by nearby gates. A time-varying electric field, of single gigahertz frequency, perpendicular to the quantum wire, is used to induce Rashba coupling and enable spin-dependent resonant tunneling of the electron between two adjacent potential wells with fidelity over 99.5%. This effect can be used for high-fidelity all-electric electron-spin initialization or readout in a spin-based quantum computer. In contrast to other spin-initialization methods, our technique can be performed adiabatically without an increase in the energy of the electron. Our simulations are supported by realistic self-consistent time-dependent Poisson-Schrodinger calculations.

The knapsack cryptosystem which is based on the subset sum problem has the potential to be a quantum -resistant cryptosystem. Murakami and Kasahara proposed a SOSI trapdoor sequence which is made by combining shifted -odd (SO) and super -increasing (SI) sequence in the modular knapsack cryptosystem. This paper firstly show that the key generation method could not achieve a secure density against the low -density attack. Second, we propose a high -density key generation method and confirmed that the proposed scheme is secure against the lowdensity attack.

TI Suppressing nonperturbative gauge errors in the thermodynamic limit
   using local pseudogenerators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB With recent progress in quantum simulations of lattice-gauge theories, it is becoming a pressing question how to reliably protect the gauge symmetry that defines such models. Recently, an experimentally feasible gauge-protection scheme has been proposed that is based on the concept of a local pseudogenerator, which is required to act identically to the full gauge-symmetry generator in the target gauge sector, but not necessarily outside of it. The scheme has been analytically and numerically shown to reliably stabilize lattice gauge theories in the presence of perturbative errors on finite-size analog quantum-simulation devices. In this work, through uniform matrix product state calculations, we demonstrate the efficacy of this scheme for nonperturbative errors in analog quantum simulators up to all accessible evolution times in the thermodynamic limit, where it is a priori neither established nor expected that this scheme will succeed. Our results indicate the presence of an emergent gauge symmetry in an adjusted gauge theory even in the thermodynamic limit, which is beyond our analytic predictions. Additionally, we show through quantum circuit model calculations that gauge protection with local pseudogenerators also successfully suppresses gauge violations on finite quantum computers that discretize time through Trotterization. Our results firm up the robustness and feasibility of the local pseudogenerator as a viable tool for enforcing gauge invariance in modern quantum simulators and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

AB Cavity electromagnonics explore the coupling between microwave cavity fields and magnons in micromagnets. This field has emerged as a promising platform for probing fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and advancing quantum technologies. This paper investigates a scheme involving two-tone frequency modulation to engineer simultaneous magnonphoton two-mode squeezing and beam-splitter-like interactions. We demonstrate that this scheme enables the direct generation of macroscopic magnonic squeezed and entangled states. Moreover, it facilitates ultra-sensitive magnon-based magnetic field sensing through quantum non-demolition (QND) interactions between magnons and photons. The present scheme provides promising opportunities for generating macroscopic nonclassical quantum states in solid magnetic materials and developing spintronics-related quantum devices.

TI Entropic lens on stabilizer states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The n-qubit stabilizer states are those left invariant by a 2n-element subset of the Pauli group. The Clifford group is the group of unitaries which take stabilizer states to stabilizer states; a physically motivated generating set, the Hadamard, phase, and controlled -NOT (CNOT) gates which comprise the Clifford gates, impose a graph structure on the set of stabilizers. We explicitly construct these structures, the "reachability graphs," at n 5. When we consider only a subset of the Clifford gates, the reachability graphs separate into multiple, often complicated, connected components. Seeking an understanding of the entropic structure of the stabilizer states, which is ultimately built up by CNOT gate applications on two qubits, we are motivated to consider the restricted subgraphs built from the Hadamard and CNOT gates acting on only two of the n qubits. We show how the two subgraphs already present at two qubits are embedded into more complicated subgraphs at three and four qubits. We argue that no additional types of subgraph appear beyond four qubits, but that the entropic structures within the subgraphs can grow progressively more complicated as the qubit number increases. Starting at four qubits, some of the stabilizer states have entropy vectors which are not allowed by holographic entropy inequalities. We comment on the nature of the transition between holographic and nonholographic states within the stabilizer reachability graphs.

TI Cavity Microscope for Micrometer-Scale Control of Atom-Photon
   Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers the possibility of observing and controlling the motion of a few or individual atoms, enabling the realization of various quantum technological tasks such as quantum enhanced metrology or quantum simulation of strongly correlated matter. A core limitation of these experiments lies in the mode structure of the cavity field, which is hard coded in the shape and geometry of the mirrors. As a result, most applications of cavity QED trade spatial resolution for enhanced sensitivity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a cavity-microscope device capable of controlling in space and time the coupling between atoms and light in a single-mode high-finesse cavity, reaching a spatial resolution an order of magnitude lower than the cavity-mode waist. This is achieved through local Floquet engineering of the atomic level structure, imprinting a corresponding atom-field coupling. We illustrate this capability by engineering micrometer-scale coupling, using cavity-assisted atomic measurements and optimization. Our system forms an optical device with a single optical axis, has the same footprint and complexity as a standard Fabry-Perot cavity or confocal lens pair, and can be used for any atomic species. This technique opens a wide range of perspectives, from ultrafast cavity-enhanced midcircuit readout to the quantum simulation of fully connected models of quantum matter such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

TI Verifying Measures of Quantum Entropy
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB This paper introduces a new measure of quantum entropy, called the effective quantum entropy (EQE). The EQE is an extension, to the quantum setting, of a recently derived classical generalized entropy. We present a thorough verification of its properties. As its predecessor, the EQE is a semi-strict quasi-concave function; it would be capable of generating many of the various measures of quantum entropy that are useful in practice. Thereafter, we construct a consistent estimator for our proposed measure and empirically test its estimation error, under different system dimensions and number of measurements. Overall, we build the grounds of the EQE, which will facilitate the analyses and verification of the next innovative quantum technologies.

TI Impact of interface traps on charge noise and low-density transport
   properties in Ge/SiGe heterostructures
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Hole spins in Ge/SiGe heterostructures have emerged as an interesting qubit platform with favourable properties such as fast electrical control and noise-resilient operation at sweet spots. However, commonly observed gate-induced electrostatic disorder, drifts, and hysteresis hinder reproducible tune-up of SiGe-based quantum dot arrays. Here, we study Hall bar and quantum dot devices fabricated on Ge/SiGe heterostructures and present a consistent model for the origin of gate hysteresis and its impact on transport metrics and charge noise. As we push the accumulation voltages more negative, we observe non-monotonous changes in the low-density transport metrics, attributed to the induced gradual filling of a spatially varying density of charge traps at the SiGe-oxide interface. With each gate voltage push, we find local activation of a transient low-frequency charge noise component that completely vanishes again after 30 hours. Our results highlight the resilience of the SiGe material platform to interface-trap-induced disorder and noise and pave the way for reproducible tuning of larger multi-dot systems.
   Hole spins in SiGe quantum dot arrays are a promising qubit platform, but suffer from gate-induced electrostatic disorder, drift and hysteresis. Here, Hall bar and quantum dot Ge/SiGe heterostructures are studied, obtaining a model for gate hysteresis and its effect on transport and charge noise.

TI Electronic and Magnetic Properties of a Monolayer of VOTPP Molecules
   Sublimated on Ag(100)
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Vanadyl(IV) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (VOTPP) is an S = 1/2 molecular system with remarkable spin qubit properties. Its structure offers a higher chemical tunability with respect to archetypal molecular qubits, such as vanadyl(IV)Phthalocyanines (VOPc), and a less rigid organic scaffold where peripheral phenyl rings can promote electron decoupling from the substrate. The properties of a VOTPP monolayer on the Ag(100) surface by photoemission spectroscopies and synchrotron radiation are studied. The results indicate that the electronic and spin features of the massive phase are retained in the monolayer. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the existence of two distinct species characterized by varying strengths of molecule-surface interactions. Like VOPc, these species can be assigned to molecules with the vanadyl group oriented upward or toward the surface. However, in contrast to VOPc, only subtle screening effects are observed in the oxygen-down configuration, suggesting a more pronounced decoupling effect inherent in the VOTPP structure. This opens broader perspectives for investigations focusing on spin characteristics at the single-molecule level.
   Vanadyl tetraphenyl porphyrin molecules (VOTPP) exhibit weak interaction with the Ag(100) surface, displaying only subtle screening effects in the monolayer. The preservation of electronic and spin properties holds promise for quantum applications. image

TI Efficient Quantum State Sample Tomography with Basis-Dependent Neural
   Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We use a metalearning neural-network approach to analyze data from a measured quantum state. Once our neural network has been trained, it can be used to efficiently sample measurements of the state in measurement bases not contained in the training data. These samples can be used to calculate expectation values and other useful quantities. We refer to this process as "state sample tomography." We encode the state's measurement outcome distributions using an efficiently parameterized generative neural network. This allows each stage in the tomography process to be performed efficiently even for large systems. Our scheme is demonstrated on recent IBM Quantum devices, producing a model for a six-qubit state's measurement outcomes with a predictive accuracy (classical fidelity) greater than 95% for all test cases using only 100 random measurement settings as opposed to the 729 settings required for standard full tomography using local measurements. This reduction in the required number of measurements scales favorably, with training data in 200 measurement settings, yielding a predictive accuracy greater than 92% for a ten-qubit state where 59 049 settings are typically required for full local measurement-based quantum state tomography. A reduction in the number of measurements by a factor, in this case, of almost 600 could allow for estimations of expectation values and state fidelities in practicable times on current quantum devices.

TI Unidirectional chiral scattering from single enantiomeric plasmonic
   nanoparticles
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlling scattering and routing of chiral light at the nanoscale is important for optical information processing and imaging, quantum technologies as well as optical manipulation. Here, we introduce a concept of rotating chiral dipoles in order to achieve unidirectional chiral scattering. Implementing this concept by engineering multipole excitations in helicoidal plasmonic nanoparticles, we experimentally demonstrate enantio-sensitive and highly-directional forward scattering of circularly polarised light. The intensity of this highly-directional scattering is defined by the mutual relation between the handedness of the incident light and the chirality of the structure. The concept of rotating chiral dipoles offers numerous opportunities for engineering scattering from chiral nanostructures and optical nano-antennas paving the way for innovative designs and applications of chiral light-matter interactions.

AB In recent development of quantum technologies, a frequency conversion of quantum signals has been studied widely. We investigate the optic-microwave entanglement that is generated by applying an electro-optomechanical frequency conversion scheme to one mode in an optical two-mode squeezed vacuum state. We quantify entanglement of the converted two-mode Gaussian state, where surviving entanglement of the state is analyzed with respect to the parameters of the electro-optomechanical system. Furthermore, we show that there exists an upper bound for the entanglement that survives after the conversion of highly entangled optical states.

TI Multipartite Entangled States in Dipolar Quantum Simulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The scalable production of multipartite entangled states in ensembles of qubits is a crucial function of quantum devices, as such states are an essential resource both for fundamental studies on entanglement, as well as for applied tasks. Here we focus on the U(1) symmetric Hamiltonians for qubits with dipolar interactions-a model realized in several state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms for lattice spin models, including Rydberg-atom arrays with resonant interactions. Making use of exact and variational simulations, we theoretically show that the nonequilibrium dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian shares fundamental features with that of the one-axis-twisting model, namely, the simplest interacting collectivespin model with U(1) symmetry. The evolution governed by the dipolar Hamiltonian generates a cascade of multipartite entangled states-spin-squeezed states, Schrodinger's cat states, and multicomponent superpositions of coherent spin states. Investigating systems with up to N = 144 qubits, we observe full scalability of the entanglement features of these states directly related to metrology, namely, scalable spin squeezing at an evolution time O(N-1/3)THORN and Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity of the spin parity to global rotations for cat states reached at times O(N). Our results suggest that the native Hamiltonian dynamics of state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms, such as Rydberg-atom arrays, can act as a robust source of multipartite entanglement.

TI Spin relaxation in a single-electron graphene quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The relaxation time of a single-electron spin is an important parameter for solid-state spin qubits, as it directly limits the lifetime of the encoded information. Thanks to the low spin-orbit interaction and low hyperfine coupling, graphene and bilayer graphene (BLG) have long been considered promising platforms for spin qubits. Only recently, it has become possible to control single-electrons in BLG quantum dots (QDs) and to understand their spin-valley texture, while the relaxation dynamics have remained mostly unexplored. Here, we report spin relaxation times (T-1) of single-electron states in BLG QDs. Using pulsed-gate spectroscopy, we extract relaxation times exceeding 200 mu s at a magnetic field of 1.9 T. The T-1 values show a strong dependence on the spin splitting, promising even longer T-1 at lower magnetic fields, where our measurements are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. The relaxation times are more than two orders of magnitude larger than those previously reported for carbon-based QDs, suggesting that graphene is a potentially promising host material for scalable spin qubits.
   Graphene has long been considered to be a promising host for spin qubits, however a demonstration of long spin relaxation times for a potential qubit has been lacking. Here, the authors report the electrical measurement of the single-electron spin relaxation time exceeding 200 mu s in a bilayer graphene quantum dot.

TI Modeling the unphysical pseudomode model with physical ensembles:
   Simulation, mitigation, and restructuring of non-Markovian quantum noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The influence of a Gaussian environment on a quantum system can be described by effectively replacing the continuum with a discrete set of ancillary quantum and classical degrees of freedom. This defines a pseudomode model which can be used to classically simulate the reduced system dynamics. Here we consider an alternative point of view and analyze the potential benefits of an analog or digital quantum simulation of the pseudomode model itself. Superficially, such a direct experimental implementation is, in general, impossible due to the unphysical properties of the effective degrees of freedom involved. However, we show that the effects of the unphysical pseudomode model can still be reproduced using measurement results over an ensemble of physical systems involving ancillary harmonic modes and an optional stochastic driving field. This is done by introducing an extrapolation technique whose efficiency is limited by stability against imprecision in the measurement data. We examine how such a simulation would allow us to (i) perform a quantum simulation of the effects of complex nonperturbative and non-Markovian environments in regimes that are challenging for classical simulation; (ii) conversely, mitigate potential unwanted non-Markovian noise present in quantum devices; and (iii) restructure some of the properties of a given physical bath, such as its temperature.

TI Complete conversion between one and two photons in nonlinear waveguides:
   theory of dispersion engineering
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-efficiency photon-pair production is a long-sought-after goal for many optical quantum technologies, and coherent photon conversion (CPC) processes are promising candidates for achieving this. We show theoretically how to control coherent conversion between a narrow-band pump photon and broadband photon pairs in nonlinear optical waveguides by tailoring frequency dispersion for broadband quantum frequency mixing. We reveal that complete deterministic conversion as well as pump-photon revival can be achieved at a finite propagation distance. We also find that high conversion efficiencies can be realised robustly over long propagation distances. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering is a promising way to tune and optimise the CPC process.

Even for moderate-sized networks, this amounts to exploring an extremely vast parameter space in search for the couplings defining the network topology. Here, we explore the use of a genetic algorithm to retrieve the topology of a network from the measured probability distribution obtained from the evolution of a continuous-time quantum walk on the network. We show that we can successfully retrieve the topology of different networks with efficiencies above 70% in all the examined scenarios and that the algorithm is capable of efficiently retrieving the required information even in the presence of noise.

TI Navigating Secrecy in Innovation: Coping Mechanisms for Public-Private
   Collaboration in Intelligence and Security
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
AB Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and quantum technologies are transforming intelligence and security organizations, introducing both challenges and opportunities. Rather than leading through in-house innovation, these organizations are shifting toward a fast-follower approach-adopting externally developed technologies in response to rapid market-driven advancements. This shift requires closer collaboration with the private sector, challenging the secrecy inherent to these organizations. This article explores how intelligence and security practitioners navigate secrecy while fostering public-private innovation. Focusing on the Netherlands Intelligence and Security community, the study uses an inductive approach drawing on 48 interviews with active practitioners to reveal three coping mechanisms that facilitate effective boundary spanning: individual risk appetite, communal familiarity, and perceived trustworthiness.

We show results about the source performance considering different parameters, like gas flow rate, nozzle size, and internal cell volume. The beam contains 2.5 x 1014 molecules/(s sr) at about 160 m/s. Moreover, for two rotational states we observe an unexpected population distribution that we tentatively attribute to a lower temperature inside the cell. Considering the importance of buffer-gas cooling for experiments on ultracold molecules prepared with direct laser cooling, we believe that our work will improve this key first-stage cooling, accelerating the adoption of molecules in the framework of quantum technologies.

TI Multipartite entanglement in a Josephson junction laser
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the entanglement in a model Josephson photonics system in which a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction couples a collection of cavity modes and populates them with microwave photons. Using an approximate quadratic Hamiltonian model, we study the Gaussian entanglement that develops between the modes as the Josephson energy of the system is increased. We find that the modes in the system fall into a series of blocks, with bipartite entanglement generated between modes within a given block. Tripartite entanglement between modes within a given block is also widespread, though it is limited to certain ranges of the Josephson energy. The system could provide an alternative route to generating multimode microwave entanglement, an important resource in quantum technologies, without the need for ac excitation.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB The ground state of an artificial atom ultrastrongly coupled to quantized modes is entangled and contains an arbitrary number of virtual photons. The problem of their detection has been raised since the very birth of the field, but despite the theoretical efforts still awaits experimental demonstration. Recently, experimental problems have been addressed in detail showing that they can be overcome by combining an unconventional design of the artificial atom with advanced coherent control. In this work, we study a simple scheme of control-integrated continuous measurement, which makes remarkably favorable the tradeoff between measurement efficiency and backaction showing that the unambiguous detection of virtual photons can be achieved within state-of-the-art quantum technologies.

TI Preparation of entangled W states based on the cavity QED system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We present a qubit-loss-free (QLF) fusion scheme for generating large-scale atom W states in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. Compared to the most current fusion schemes which are conditioned on the case where one particle can be extracted from each initial W state to the fusion process, our scheme will access one or two particles from each W state. Based on the atom-cavity-field detuned interaction, three |W > n+m+t states can be generated from the |W > n, |W > m, and |W > t states with the help of two auxiliary atoms, and three |W > n+m+t+q states can be generated from |W > n, |W > m, |W > t, and a |W > q state with the help of three auxiliary atoms. Comparing the numerical simulations of the resource cost of fusing three small-size W states based on the previous schemes, our fusion scheme seems to be more efficient. This QLF fusion scheme can be generalized to the case of fusing k different or identical particle W states. Furthermore, with no qubit loss, it greatly reduces the number of fusion steps and prepares W states with larger particle numbers.

TI A numerical approach for calculating exact non-adiabatic terms in
   quantum dynamics
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Understanding how non-adiabatic terms affect quantum dynamics is fundamental to improving various protocols for quantum technologies. We present a novel approach to computing the Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP), which gives information on the non- adiabatic terms that arise from time dependence in the Hamiltonian. Our approach uses commutators of the Hamiltonian to build up an appropriate basis of the AGP, which can be easily truncated to give an approximate form when the exact result is intractable. We use this approach to study the AGP obtained for the transverse field Ising model on a variety of graphs, showing how the different underlying graph structures can give rise to very different scaling for the number of terms required in the AGP.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Scaling up photonic quantum devices to reach complexities allowing to solve real-world problems requires a platform enabling scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitter with a high yield. Their nanometer-size together with their excellent quantum optical properties make them the ideal candidates for on-chip photonic quantum technologies. However, robust, scalable integration remains elusive. Here, we discuss the state-of-the-art methods to integrate quantum emitters into photonic integrated circuits, emphasizing the pros and cons of the integration methods applicable for specific quantum emitters. Based on our thorough comparison we give our perspective on the most promising approaches and how to overcome the remaining challenges.

TI Perturbative algorithm for rotational decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent advances in levitated optomechanics provide new perspectives for the use of rotational degrees of freedom for the development of quantum technologies as well as for testing fundamental physics. As for the translational case, their use, especially in the quantum regime, is limited by environmental noises, the characterization of which is fundamental in order to assess, control, and minimize their effect, in particular decoherence. Here, we present a general perturbative approach to compute decoherence for a quantum system in a superposition of its rotational degrees of freedom. The specific cases of the dipole-dipole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions are solved explicitly, and we show that the rotational degrees of freedom decohere on a time scale that can be longer than the translational one.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state quantum dots are promising candidates for efficient light-matter interfaces connecting internal spin degrees of freedom to the states of emitted photons. However, selection rules prevent the combination of efficient spin control and optical cyclicity in this platform. By utilizing a photonic crystal waveguide we here experimentally demonstrate optical cyclicity up to approximate to 15 through photonic state engineering while achieving high fidelity spin initialization and coherent optical spin control. These capabilities pave the way towards scalable multiphoton entanglement generation and on-chip spin-photon gates.

TI General, Efficient, and Robust Hamiltonian Engineering
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Implementing the time evolution under a desired target Hamiltonian is critical for various applications in quantum science. Due to the exponential increase of parameters in the system size and due to experimental imperfections, this task can be challenging in quantum many-body settings. We introduce an efficient and robust scheme to engineer arbitrary local many-body Hamiltonians. To this end, our scheme applies single-qubit pi or pi /2 pulses to an always-on system Hamiltonian, which we assume to be native to a given platform. These sequences are constructed by efficiently solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes the total evolution time. In this way, we can engineer target Hamiltonians that are only limited by the locality of the interactions in the system Hamiltonian. Based on average Hamiltonian theory and by using robust composite pulses, we make our schemes robust against errors, including finite-pulse-time errors and various control errors. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we provide numerical simulations. In particular, we solve the Hamiltonian-engineering problem on a laptop for arbitrary two-local Hamiltonians on a two-dimensional square lattice with 196 qubits in only 60 s. Moreover, we simulate the engineering of general Heisenberg Hamiltonians from Ising Hamiltonians with imperfect single-qubit pulses for smaller system sizes, and achieve a fidelity larger than 99.9%, which is orders of magnitude better than nonrobust implementations.

TI Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors-such as fluxonium-phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov-Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find that the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not 1/f. Numerical simulations indicate that this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design trade-offs, relevant for the numerous superconducting-qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.

TI Identifying Pauli blockade regimes in bilayer graphene double quantum
   dots
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Recent experimental observations of current blockades in 2D material quantum-dot platforms have opened new avenues for spin and valley-qubit processing. Motivated by experimental results, we construct a model capturing the delicate interplay of Coulomb interactions, inter-dot tunneling, Zeeman splittings, and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in a double quantum dot (DQD) structure to simulate the Pauli blockades. Analyzing the relevant Fock-subspaces of the generalized Hamiltonian, coupled with the density matrix master equation technique for transport across the setup, we identify the generic class of blockade mechanisms. Most importantly, and contrary to what is widely recognized, we show that conducting and blocking states responsible for the Pauli-blockades are a result of the coupled effect of all degrees of freedom and cannot be explained using the spin or the valley pseudo-spin only. We then numerically predict the regimes where Pauli blockades might occur, and, to this end, we verify our model against actual experimental data and propose that our model can be used to generate data sets for different values of parameters with the ultimate goal of training on a machine learning algorithm. Our work provides an enabling platform for a predictable theory-aided experimental realization of single-shot readout of the spin and valley states on DQDs based on 2D-material platforms.

TI Quantum switch instabilities with an open control
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The superposition of causal orders shows promise in various quantum technologies. However, the fragility of quantum systems arising from environmental interactions, leading to dissipative behavior and irreversibility, demands a deeper understanding of the possible instabilities in the coherent control of causal orders. In this work, we employ a collisional model to investigate the impact of an open control system on the generation of interference between two causal orders. We present the environmental instabilities for the switch of two arbitrary quantum operations and examine the influence of environmental temperature on each potential outcome of control post-selection. Additionally, we explore how environmental instabilities affect protocol performance, including switching between mutually unbiased measurement observables and refrigeration powered by causal order superposition, providing insights into broader implications.

TI Probing the Variation of the Intervalley Tunnel Coupling in a Silicon
   Triple Quantum Dot
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Electrons confined in silicon quantum dots exhibit orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom. The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk band structure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The degeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic confinement, but the "valley splitting" of the two lowest-lying valleys is known to be sensitive to atomic scale disorder. Large valley splittings are desirable to have a well-defined spin qubit. In addition, an understanding of the intervalley tunnel coupling that couples different valleys in adjacent quantum dots is extremely important, as the resulting gaps in the energy-level diagram may affect the fidelity of charge-and spin-transfer protocols in silicon quantum-dot arrays. Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe variations in the valley splitting, and the intra- and intervalley tunnel couplings (t(ij) and t'(ij)) that couple dots i and j in a triple quantum dot. We uncover large variations in the ratio of intervalley to intravalley tunnel couplings t'(12)/t(12) = 0.90 and t'(23)/t(23) = 0.56. By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show that t'(ij) scales linearly with t(ij), as expected from theory. The results indicate strong interactions between different valley states on neighboring dots, which we attribute to local inhomogeneities in the silicon quantum well.

TI Enhancement of Rydberg Blockade via Microwave Dressing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitation dynamics, atomic density distribution, and phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.

Factorizable maps with a finite dimensional ancilla are parametrized by finite dimensional traces on M-n(C)(*C)M-n(C), and factorizable maps that approximately factor through finite dimensional C*-algebras are parametrized by traces in the closure of the finite dimensional ones. The latter set of traces is shown to be equal to the set of hyperlinear traces on M-n(C)(*C)M-n(C). We finally show that each metrizable Choquet simplex is a face of the simplex of tracial states on M-n(C)(*C)M-n(C).

In this work, the formation of the I-3 basal stacking faults is investigated at the atomistic level, and results are compared to the experimental findings. We propose that these extended defects are caused by dislocation lines elongated in < 1120 > directions, which in turn arise from glide terminations of the step edges when two growing fronts run into each other.

TI Ultrastrong coupling between electron tunneling and mechanical motion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ultrastrong coupling of single-electron tunneling and nanomechanical motion opens exciting opportunities to explore fundamental questions and develop new platforms for quantum technologies. We have measured and modeled this electromechanical coupling in a fully suspended carbon nanotube device and report a ratio of gm/omega m = 2.72 +/- 0.14, where gm/2 pi = 0.80 +/- 0.04 GHz is the coupling strength and omega m/2 pi = 294.5 MHz is the mechanical resonance frequency. This is well within the ultrastrong coupling regime and the highest among all other electromechanical platforms. We show that, although this regime was present in similar fully suspended carbon nanotube devices, it went unnoticed. Even higher ratios could be achieved with improvement on device design.

TI The femtosecond laser fabrication of waveguide structures in transparent
   crystals
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB An optical waveguide is the basic structure of quantum optics, which has a strong confinement effect on light. It can complete the low-loss transmission of light and the enhancement of the nonlinear effect. Direct writing of optical waveguide structures in transparent crystals can enhance the electro-optic, acousto-optic, and nonlinear optical properties of crystals, making them widely used in the optical field. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is a non-contact processing technology without thermal damage. The direct writing accuracy is high, and it is easy to fabricate the three-dimensional optical waveguide structure in the crystal. It is the best choice of a direct writing optical waveguide structure in a transparent crystal. This paper reviews the recent progress of femtosecond laser direct writing of transparent crystal materials to form optical waveguide structures. The basic mechanism of optical waveguide fabrication by femtosecond laser direct writing in transparent crystal, the methods of waveguide fabrication combined with different techniques, and the obtained optical waveguide structures are introduced, including single-line waveguides, double-line waveguides, depressed-cladding waveguides, ridge waveguides, and photonic crystal waveguides. The applications of optical waveguide structures in lasers, quantum memories, and quantum telecommunication devices are also presented.

TI Efficient scaling of VCSELs to wavelength dimensions via
   lithographically defined cavities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB The miniaturization of lasers is critical for on-chip optical communication and high-speed data processing beyond the limits of electronics and current high-speed lasers. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are the leading technology due to their compact size, low power consumption, and high-speed modulation capabilities. However, achieving broader modulation bandwidth and more energy-efficient transmission requires scaling to near- and sub-wavelength dimensions, presenting challenges for conventional VCSELs. Here, we introduce a lithographic approach utilizing an intracavity phase-shifting mesa that can provide transverse photonic and electrical confinement, reducing optical losses and enhancing scalability. We demonstrate lithographically defined VCSELs with high quality factors, supporting wavelength-scale devices with diameters ranging from 0.75 to 2.0 mu m. These devices achieve continuous-wave operation at room temperature with single-mode emission and high efficiency. Furthermore, the resonance wavelength can be tuned via a wavelength-tuning layer, enhancing spectral flexibility. Our experimental results align well with numerical analysis, representing a significant step toward ultra-compact, electrically pumped lasers for next-generation photonic technologies, including data center interconnects and quantum photonic applications.

TI Modeling nonlinear exciton-polariton microcavities using the
   transfer-matrix method: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and self-focusing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The transfer-matrix method (TMM) is a widely used technique for modeling linear propagation of electromagnetic waves through stratified layered media. However, since its extension to inhomogeneous and nonlinear systems is not straightforward, much more computationally demanding methods such as finite difference time domain or method of lines are typically used. In this paper, we extend the TMM framework to incorporate the effects of nonlinearity. We consider the case where strong coupling between excitons (electron-hole pairs) and photons leads to the formation of exciton polaritons. This extension is crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of light in polariton microcavities, where nonlinearities arising from exciton-exciton interactions play a key role. We perform efficient simulations of light transmission and reflection in a multidimensional system using the plane-wave basis. Additionally, we compare our extended TMM approach with the state-of-the-art admittance transfer method, and highlight the computational advantage of extended TMM for large-scale systems. The extended TMM not only provides a robust and computationally efficient numerical framework, but also paves the way for the development of future low-power nonlinear optical devices, polariton-based photonic circuits, and quantum photonic technologies.

TI Simulating open-system molecular dynamics on analog quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Interactions of molecules with their environment influence the course and outcome of almost all chemical reactions. However, classical computers struggle to accurately simulate complicated molecule-environment interactions because of the steep growth of computational resources with both molecule size and environment complexity. Therefore, many quantum-chemical simulations are restricted to isolated molecules, whose dynamics can dramatically differ from what happens in an environment. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can simulate open molecular systems by using the native dissipation of the simulator and injecting additional controllable dissipation. By exploiting the native dissipation to simulate the molecular dissipation-rather than seeing it as a limitation-our approach enables longer simulations of open systems than are possible for closed systems. In particular, we show that trapped-ion simulators using a mixed qudit-boson (MQB) encoding could simulate molecules in a wide range of condensed phases by implementing widely used dissipative processes within the Lindblad formalism, including pure dephasing and both electronic and vibrational relaxation. The MQB open-system simulations require significantly fewer additional quantum resources compared to both classical and digital quantum approaches.

TI Demonstration of high-impedance superconducting NbRe Dayem bridges
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Here, we demonstrate superconducting Dayem-bridge weak-links made of different stoichiometric compositions of NbRe. Our devices possess a relatively high critical temperature, normal-state resistance, and kinetic inductance. In particular, the high kinetic inductance makes this material a good alternative to more conventional niobium-based superconductors (e.g., NbN or NbTiN) for the realization of superinductors and high-quality factor resonators, whereas the high normal-state resistance yields a large output voltage in superconducting switches and logic elements realized upon this compound. Moreover, out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exceeding 2 T ensure that possible applications requiring high magnetic fields can also be envisaged. Altogether, these features make this material appealing for a number of applications in the framework of quantum technologies.

TI Tapered Optical Fibers Coated with Rare-Earth Complexes for Quantum
   Applications
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Crystals and fibers doped with rare-earth (RE) ions provide the basis for most of today's solid-state optical systems, from lasers and telecom devices to emerging potential quantum applications such as quantum memories and optical to microwave conversion. The two platforms, doped crystals and doped fibers, seem mutually exclusive, each having its own strengths and limitations, the former providing high homogeneity and coherence and the latter offering the advantages of robust optical waveguides. Here we present a hybrid platform that does not rely on doping but rather on coating the waveguide-a tapered silica optical fiber -with a monolayer of complexes, each containing a single RE ion. The complexes offer an identical, tailored environment to each ion, thus minimizing inhomogeneity and allowing tuning of their properties to the desired application. Specifically, we use highly luminescent Yb3+[Zn(II)MC (QXA)] complexes, which isolate the RE ion from the environment and suppress nonradiative decay channels. We demonstrate that the beneficial optical transitions of the Yb3+ are retained after deposition on the tapered fiber and observe an excited-state lifetime of over 0.9 ms, on par with state-of-theart Yb-doped inorganic crystals.

TI First-principles studies of Schottky barriers and tunneling properties
   at Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi2(111)/Si(111) interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present first-principles calculations of Schottky barrier heights at interfaces relevant for silicon-based merged-element transmon qubit devices. Focusing on Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi2(111)/Si(111), we consider various possible interfacial structures, for which we study the relaxations of the atoms near the interface, calculate the formation energies and Schottky barrier heights, and provide estimates of the Josephson critical currents based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) tunneling formalism as implemented in the Simmons/TsuEsaki model. We find that the formation energies and SBHs are very similar for all Al(111)/Si(111) structures, yet vary significantly for the CoSi2(111)/Si(111) structures. We attribute this to the more covalent character of bonding at CoSi2/Si, which leads to configurations with distinct atomic and electronic structure. Our estimated Josephson critical currents, which govern the behavior of merged-element transmons, provide insight into the trends as a function of Schottky-barrier height. We show that desirable qubit frequencies of 4-5 GHz can be obtained with a Si barrier thickness of about 5-10 nm, and demonstrate that the critical current density as a function of Schottky barrier height can be modeled based on the tunneling probability for a rectangular barrier.

TI Spectral properties versus magic generation in T-doped random
   Clifford circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the emergence of complexity in deep random N-qubit T-gate-doped Clifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic generation, characterized by the stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy distribution and the nonstabilizing power of the circuit. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits, a unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies peculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies. T-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior, described by random matrix theory. We compare these complexity indicators with magic generation properties of the Clifford +T ensemble, and determine the distribution of magic, as well as the average nonstabilizing power of the quantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, N-T << N, magic generation is governed by single-qubit behavior. Magic is generated in approximate quanta, increases approximately linearly with the number of T gates, N-T, and displays a discrete distribution for small N-T. At N-T approximate to N, the distribution becomes quasicontinuous, and for N-T >> N, it converges to that of Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, m(2), lim(N ->infinity)< m(2)>(Haar)=1. This is in contrast to the spectral transition, where O(1) T gates suffice to remove spectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of complexity.

TI On-chip quantum states generation by incoherent light
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB On-chip quantum sources based on nonlinear processes are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Usually, the pump coherence has been considered to be crucial for ensuring the quality of generated states, therefore incoherent light is rarely used in quantum information processing. In this work, we explore and reveal the constructive influence of pumped temporal incoherence on the quantum properties of photon sources. Taking silicon waveguides as nonlinear media, we theoretically show that temporal incoherence of light can improve pump utilization efficiency, resulting in higher source brightness in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process. Compared with coherent lasers, the frequency-uncorrelated character of incoherent light reduces spectral correlations in the generated photons, facilitating higher state purity in practice. Experimentally, we obtain a higher photon pair generation rate and the lower heralded second-order autocorrelation with an Amplified Spontaneous Emission source. Additionally, we successfully generate a polarization-entangled state with Bell inequality violation of S = 2.64 +/- 0.02 and a fidelity of 95.7% +/- 0.1%. Our study reveals the mechanism behind incoherently pumped quantum states and presents a method for generating photon sources using an easily accessible incoherent light.

TI Emergent Quantum State Designs from Individual Many-Body Wave Functions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum chaos in many-body systems provides a bridge between statistical and quantum physics with strong predictive power. This framework is valuable for analyzing properties of complex quantum systems such as energy spectra and the dynamics of thermalization. While contemporary methods in quantum chaos often rely on random ensembles of quantum states and Hamiltonians, this is not reflective of most real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective: across a wide range of exam-ples, a single nonrandom quantum state is shown to encode universal and highly random quantum state ensembles. We characterize these ensembles using the notion of quantum state k-designs from quantum information theory and investigate their universality using a combination of analytic and numerical tech-niques. In particular, we establish that k-designs emerge naturally from generic states in a Hilbert space as well as physical states associated with strongly interacting Hamiltonian dynamics. Our results offer a new approach for studying quantum chaos and provide a practical method for sampling approximately uniformly random states; the latter has wide-ranging applications in quantum information science from tomography to benchmarking.

TI Entanglement between two gravitating universes
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We study two disjoint universes in an entangled pure state. When only one universe contains gravity, the path integral for the nth Renyi entropy includes a wormhole between the n copies of the gravitating universe, leading to a standard `island formula' for entanglement entropy consistent with unitarity of quantum information. When both universes contain gravity, gravitational corrections to this configuration lead to a violation of unitarity. However, the path integral is now dominated by a novel wormhole with 2n boundaries connecting replica copies of both universes. The analytic continuation of this contribution involves a quotient by Z(n) replica symmetry, giving a cylinder connecting the two universes. When entanglement is large, this configuration has an effective description as a 'swap wormhole', a geometry in which the boundaries of the two universes are glued together by a 'swaperator'. This description allows precise computation of a generalized entropy-like formula for entanglement entropy. The quantum extremal surface computing the entropy lives on the Lorentzian continuation of the cylinder/swap wormhole, which has a connected Cauchy slice stretching between the universes-a realization of the ER = EPR idea. The new wormhole restores unitarity of quantum information.

With the added benefit of inherent high-fidelity detection capability, atomic quantum systems in high-energy internal states, such as metastable noble gas atoms, promote themselves as ideal candidates for advancing quantum science in fundamental aspects and technological applications. Using laser-cooled neon atoms in the metastable P-3(2) state of state 1s (2)2s (2)2p (5)3s (LS-coupling notation) (Racah notation: (2) P (3/2)3s[3/2](2)) with five m ( J )-sublevels, experimental methods for the preparation of all Zeeman sublevels |m ( J )⟩ = |+2⟩, |+1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩, |-2⟩ as well as the coherent control of superposition states in the five-level system |+2⟩, horizontal ellipsis , |-2⟩, in the three-level system |+2⟩, |+1⟩, |0⟩, and in the two-level system |+2⟩, |+1⟩ are presented. The methods are based on optimized radio frequency and laser pulse sequences. The state evolution is described with a simple, semiclassical model. The coherence properties of the prepared states are studied using Ramsey and spin echo measurements.

AB Coherent many-body states are highly promising for robust quantum information processing. While far-reaching theoretical predictions have been made for various implementations, direct experimental evidence of their appealing properties can be challenging. Here, we demonstrate optical manipulation of the nuclear spin ensemble in the lead halide perovskite semiconductor FAPbBr(3) (FA = formamidinium), targeting a long-postulated collective dark state that is insensitive to optical pumping after its build-up. Via optical orientation of localized hole spins we drive the nuclear many-body system into this entangled state, requiring a weak magnetic field of only a few milli-Tesla strength at cryogenic temperatures. During its fast establishment, the nuclear polarization along the optical axis remains small, while the transverse nuclear spin fluctuations are strongly reduced, corresponding to spin squeezing as evidenced by a strong violation of the generalized nuclear squeezing-inequality with xi(s) < 0.5. The dark state corresponds to an similar to 35-body entanglement between the nuclei. Dark nuclear spin states can be exploited to store quantum information benefiting from their long-lived many-body coherence and to perform quantum measurements with a precision beyond the standard limit.

TI Quantum scars in spin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg clusters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the influence of the external fields on the statistics of energy levels and towers of eigenstates in spin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg clusters, including chain, ladder, square and triangular lattices. In the presence of uniform field in one direction, the SU(2) symmetry of the system allows that almost whole spectrum consists of a large number of towers with identical level spacing. Exact diagonalization on finite clusters shows that random transverse fields in other two directions drive the level statistics from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson distributions with different values of mean level spacing ratio, indicating the transition from integrability to non-integrability. However, for the three types of clusters, it is found that the largest tower still hold approximately even the symmetry is broken, resulting to a quantum scar. Remarkably, the non-thermalized states cover the Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger and W states, which maintain the feature of revival while a Neel state decays fast in the dynamic processes. In addition, some dynamic schemes for experimental detection are proposed. Our finding reveals the possibility of quantum information processing that is immune to the thermalization in finite size quantum spin clusters.

TI Quantifying quantumness in (A)dS spacetimes with Unruh-DeWitt detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Probing quantumness in curved spacetime is regarded as one of the fundamental and important topics in the framework of relativistic quantum information. In this work, we focus on the theoretical feasibility of probing quantum properties in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes via detectors. By employing the Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled with a massless scalar field, which is treated as an open system, quantum uncertainty and quantum coherence in both dS and AdS spacetimes are investigated. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration in dS spacetime and the boundary conditions in AdS spacetime significantly impact the detector's evolution in the initial stage. Notably, both of the uncertainty and coherence will oscillate with the initial state being in a superposition state, however the high temperature is able to suppress their oscillation. Interestingly, it is found that the constant values of the final uncertainty and coherence are identical as those in dS and AdS spacetimes, which are determined by the ratio of energy gap to temperature. Hence, the current exploration offers insight into quantumness in dS and AdS spacetimes, and might be helpful to facilitate the curved-spacetime-based quantum information processing.

TI Identifying key players in complex networks via network entanglement
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Empirical networks exhibit significant heterogeneity in node connections, resulting in a few vertices playing critical roles in various scenarios, including decision-making, viral marketing, and population immunization. Thus, identifying key vertices is a fundamental research problem in Network Science. In this paper, we introduce vertex entanglement (VE), an entanglement-based metric capable of quantifying the perturbations caused by individual vertices on spectral entropy, residing at the intersection of quantum information and network science. Our analytical analysis reveals that VE is closely related to network robustness and information transmission ability. As an application, VE offers an approach to the challenging problem of optimal network dismantling, and empirical experiments demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, VE also contributes to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with significant distinctions in hub disruption indices based on VE between ASD and typical controls, promising a diagnostic role for VE in ASD assessment.
   Key players are a small number of vertices that govern the structure and function of a complex network, and their identification can grant answers in many disciplines. By tapping into quantum information, the authors introduce an entanglement-based metric capable of quantifying the perturbations caused by individual vertices on spectral entropy.

TI Phase vortex lattices in neutron interferometry
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Neutron Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) is an additional quantum mechanical degree of freedom, useful in quantum information, and may provide more complete information on the neutron scattering amplitude of nuclei. Various methods for producing OAM in neutrons have been discussed. In this work we generalize magnetic methods which employ coherent averaging and apply this to neutron interferometry. Two aluminium prisms are inserted into a nested loop interferometer to generate a phase vortex lattice with significant extrinsic OAM, & LANGBRAC;L-z & rang; & AP; 0.35, on a length scale of & AP; 220 & mu;m, transverse to the propagation direction. Our generalized method exploits the strong nuclear interaction, enabling a tighter lattice. Combined with recent advances in neutron compound optics and split crystal interferometry our method may be applied to generate intrinsic neutron OAM states. Finally, we assert that, in its current state, our setup is directly applicable to anisotropic ultra small angle neutron scattering.
   Orbital angular momentum in thermal neutrons holds many promises for quantum information and neutron scattering, however the production thereof remains challenging. The authors detail a coherent averaging method, which can generate neutron vortices smaller than previously possible and can be applied to anisotropic ultra small angle scattering.

TI Integrated Si3N4 microresonator-based quantum
   light sources with high brightness using a subtractive wafer-scale
   platform
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform, demonstrating a moderate third-order optical nonlinearity and a low optical loss compared with those of silicon, is suitable for integrated quantum photonic circuits. However, it is challenging to develop a crack-free, wafer-scale, thick Si3N4 platform in a single deposition run using a subtractive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible fabrication process suitable for dispersion-engineered quantum light sources. In this paper, we demonstrate our unique subtractive fabrication process by introducing a stress-release pattern prior to the single Si3N4 film deposition. Our Si3N4 platform enables 950 nm-thick and 8 mu m-wide microring resonators supporting whispering-gallery modes for quantum light sources at 1550 run wavelengths. We report a high photon-pair generation rate of similar to 1.03 MHz/mW(2), with a high spectral brightness of similar to 5x10(6) pairs/s/mW(2)/GHz. We demonstrate the first heralded single-photon measurement on the Si3N4 platform, which exhibits a high quality of conditional self-correlation g(H)((2))(0) of 0.008 +/- 0.003.

TI Multiply charged vortex states of polariton condensates
SO OPTICA
AB The existence of quantized vortices is a key feature of Bose-Einstein condensates. In equilibrium condensates, only quantum vortices of unit topological charge are stable, due to the dynamical instabilities of multiply charged defects, unless supported by strong external rotation. Due to immense interest in the physics of these topological excitations, a great deal of work has been done to understand how to force their stability. Here we show that in photonic Bose-Einstein condensates of exciton-polariton quasiparticles pumped in an annular geometry, not only do the constant particle fluxes intrinsic to the system naturally stabilize multiply charged vortex states, but that such states can indeed form spontaneously during the condensate formation through a dynamic symmetry breaking mechanism. We elucidate the properties of these states, notably finding that they radiate acoustically at topologically quantized frequencies. Finally, we show that the vorticity of these photonic fluids is limited by a quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and therefore by the condensate radius and pumping intensity. This reported instability in a quantum photonic fluid represents a fundamental result in fluid dynamics.

TI Multimessenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global
   Magnetometer Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The history of astronomy has shown that advances in sensing methods open up new windows to the Universe and often lead to unexpected discoveries. Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multimessenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-standard model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers, such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g., weakly interacting massive particles), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles. We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically, we use the global network of optical magnetometers for exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational-wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311_115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the March 11, 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multimessenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events and, consequently, we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.

TI Evolution of nanopores in hexagonal boron nitride
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB The engineering of atomically-precise nanopores in two-dimensional materials presents exciting opportunities for both fundamental science studies as well as applications in energy, DNA sequencing, and quantum information technologies. The exceptional chemical and thermal stability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) suggest that exposed h-BN nanopores will retain their atomic structure even when subjected to extended periods of time in gas or liquid environments. Here we employ transmission electron microscopy to examine the time evolution of h-BN nanopores in vacuum and in air and find, even at room temperature, dramatic geometry changes due to atom motion and edge contamination adsorption, for timescales ranging from one hour to one week. The discovery of nanopore evolution contrasts with general expectations and has profound implications for nanopore applications of two-dimensional materials.
   Nanopore engineering holds great promise for energy, DNA sequencing, and quantum information technologies, but pore evolution, particularly in presumably stable materials such as boron nitride, is largely unexplored. Here, the authors use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to show that different nanopores formed in mono- and multi-layer hexagonal boron nitride are stable in vacuum but undergo dramatic changes in air.

TI A numerically exact description of ultrafast vibrational decoherence in
   vibration-coupled electron transfer
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Broadband pump-probe spectroscopy has been widely used to measure vibrational de- coherence associated with the reaction coordinate in photoinduced ultrafast vibration- coupled electron transfer (VCET) reactions. These experiments provide insight into the interplay of intramolecular coordinates along the reaction coordinate. However, a general theoretical foundation for analyzing, and even for explaining rigorously, these data is lacking. In this work, we study vibrational decoherence in a model VCET reaction using the nearly exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulation method. We explore how analyzing the density matrix with quantum information measures can help elucidate the evolution of vibrational coherence in simulations of dynamics. We examine how vibrational coherence is affected by electron transfer on the timescale of approximately 100 femtoseconds. Our results suggest that electron transfer, in the nonadiabatic model, changes the vibrational equilibrium position abruptly-an example of a "quantum quench" event. This explains the concomitant vibrational decoherence. We find that abrupt vibrational decoherence can be mitigated by wavepacket motion occurring on the timescale of the electron transfer.

TI High-temperature quantum coherence of spinons in a rare-earth spin chain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Conventional wisdom dictates that quantum effects become unimportant at high temperatures. In magnets, when the thermal energy exceeds interactions between atomic magnetic moments, the moments are usually uncorrelated, and classical paramagnetic behavior is observed. This thermal decoherence of quantum spin behaviors is a major hindrance to quantum information applications of spin systems. Remarkably, our neutron scattering experiments on Yb chains in an insulating perovskite crystal defy these conventional expectations. We find a sharply defined spectrum of spinons, fractional quantum excitations of spin-1/2 chains, to persist to temperatures much higher than the scale of the interactions between Yb magnetic moments. The observed sharpness of the spinon continuum's dispersive upper boundary indicates a spinon mean free path exceeding approximate to 35 inter-atomic spacings at temperatures more than an order of magnitude above the interaction energy scale. We thus discover an important and highly unique quantum behavior, which expands the realm of quantumness to high temperatures where entropy-governed classical behaviors were previously believed to dominate. Our results have profound implications for spin systems in quantum information applications operating at finite temperatures and motivate new developments in quantum metrology.

TI Analysis and optimization of quantum adaptive measurement protocols with
   the framework of preparation games
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A preparation game is a task whereby a player sequentially sends a number of quantum states to a referee, who probes each of them and announces the measurement result. Many experimental tasks in quantum information, such as entanglement quantification or magic state detection, can be cast as preparation games. In this paper, we introduce general methods to design n-round preparation games, with tight bounds on the performance achievable by players with arbitrarily constrained preparation devices. We illustrate our results by devising new adaptive measurement protocols for entanglement detection and quantification. Surprisingly, we find that the standard procedure in entanglement detection, namely, estimating n times the average value of a given entanglement witness, is in general suboptimal for detecting the entanglement of a specific quantum state. On the contrary, there exist n-round experimental scenarios where detecting the entanglement of a known state optimally requires adaptive measurement schemes. Finding a general way to come up with optimal strategies for quantum information tasks is a matter of both fundamental and practical interest. Here, the authors tackle the problem using the formalism of quantum preparation games, finding applications for entanglement detection and quantification.

TI Quantum kernel evaluation via Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One of the fastest growing areas of interest in quantum computing is its use within machine learning methods, in particular through the application of quantum kernels. Despite this large interest, there exist very few proposals for relevant physical platforms to evaluate quantum kernels. In this article, we propose and simulate a protocol capable of evaluating quantum kernels using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, an experimental technique that is widely accessible to optics researchers. Our proposal utilises the orthogonal temporal modes of a single photon, allowing one to encode multi-dimensional feature vectors. As a result, interfering two photons and using the detected coincidence counts, we can perform a direct measurement and binary classification. This physical platform confers an exponential quantum advantage also described theoretically in other works. We present a complete description of this method and perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate a sample application for binary classification of classical data.

TI Code-Based Conjunction Obfuscation
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB The pattern-matching problem with wildcards can be formulated as a conjunction where an accepting string is same as the pattern for all non-wild-cards. A scheme of conjunction obfuscation is a algorithm that "encrypt " the pattern to prevent some adversary from forging any accepting string. Since 2013, there are abundant works about conjunction obfuscation which discussed with weak/strong functionality preservation and distributed black-box security. These works are based on generic group model, learning with error assumption, learning with noise assumption, etc. Our work proposes the first conjunction obfuscation with strong functionality preservation and distributed black-box security from a standard assumption. Our scheme with some parameter constraints can also resist some related attacks such as the information set decoding attack and the structured error arrack.

AB Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a recent trend - focused on unifying the principles of quantum mechanics and practices of software engineering - to design, develop, validate, and evolve quantum age software systems and applications. Software architecture for quantum computing (a.k.a. quantum software architectures (QSA)) supports the design, development, and maintenance etc. phases of quantum software systems using architectural components and connectors. QSA can enable quantum software designers and developers to map the operations of Qubits to architectural components and connectors for implementing quantum software. This research aims to explore the role of QSAs by investigating (i) architectural process having architecting activities, and (ii) human roles that can exploit available tools to automate and customise architecture-centric implementation of quantum software. Results of this research can facilitate knowledge transfer, enabling researchers and practitioners, to address challenges of architecture-centric implementation of quantum software systems.

TI Giant oscillatory Gilbert damping in

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Interfaces between materials with differently ordered phases present unique opportunities for exotic physical properties, especially the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in the ferromagnet/ superconductor heterostructures. The investigation of zero- and pi-junctions has been of particular interest for both fundamental physical science and emerging technologies. Here, we report the experimental observation of giant oscillatory Gilbert damping in the superconducting niobium/nickel-iron/niobium junctions with respect to the nickel-iron thickness. This observation suggests an unconventional spin pumping and relaxation via zero-energy Andreev bound states that exist not only in the niobium/nickel-iron/niobium pi-junctions but also in the niobium/nickel-iron/niobium zero-junctions. Our findings could be important for further exploring the exotic physical properties of ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures and potential applications of ferromagnet pi-junctions in quantum computing, such as half-quantum flux qubits.

TI Controlling single rare earth ion emission in an electro-optical
   nanocavity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Probing single rare earth ions is highly desirable for several quantum applications, but it is difficult due to low emission rates. Here, the authors demonstrate the detection and control of single Erbium ions emission using electro-optically active photonic crystal cavities patterned from thin-film lithium niobate.
   Rare earth emitters enable critical quantum resources including spin qubits, single photon sources, and quantum memories. Yet, probing of single ions remains challenging due to low emission rate of their intra-4f optical transitions. One feasible approach is through Purcell-enhanced emission in optical cavities. The ability to modulate cavity-ion coupling in real-time will further elevate the capacity of such systems. Here, we demonstrate direct control of single ion emission by embedding erbium dopants in an electro-optically active photonic crystal cavity patterned from thin-film lithium niobate. Purcell factor over 170 enables single ion detection, which is verified by second-order autocorrelation measurement. Dynamic control of emission rate is realized by leveraging electro-optic tuning of resonance frequency. Using this feature, storage, and retrieval of single ion excitation is further demonstrated, without perturbing the emission characteristics. These results promise new opportunities for controllable single-photon sources and efficient spin-photon interfaces.

TI Do Black Holes Store Negative Entropy?
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB The Bekenstein-Hawking equation states that black holes should have entropy proportional to their areas to make black hole physics compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. However, this equation leads to an inconsistency among the first law of black hole mechanics, the entropy conservation law of quantum mechanics, and a heuristic picture for Hawking radiation-creation of entangled pairs near the horizon. Here we propose an equation alternative to the Bekenstein-Hawking equation from the viewpoint of quantum information, to resolve this inconsistency without changing Hawking's original pair-creation picture for the radiation. This argues that the area of any stationary black hole, including Kerr and charged ones, is proportional to the coherent information-which is "minus" the conditional entropy defined only in the quantum regime-from the outside, to the black hole excluding negative-frequency particles generated by Hawking's pair creation. Our equation suggests that negative-frequency particles inside a black hole behave as if they have "negative" entropy. Our result implies that a black hole stores purely quantum information, rather than classical information, and the area of the event horizon describes the number of Bell pairs that can be distilled between the interior and exterior.

TI Peculiarities of Electron Wave Packet Dynamics in Planar Nanostructures
   in the Presence of Magnetic and Electric Fields
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Currently, spatially localized electron densities and currents are considered to be candidates for use in the encoding of quantum information. For this reason, the control of their temporal dynamics is an important task. In this work, the spatiotemporal evolution of an electron wave packet in planar nanostructure in the presence of transverse magnetic and lateral electric fields is investigated by direct analytical solution of the non-stationary Schrodinger equation. Methods to control and manage the dynamics of the spatially localized electron density distribution are developed. The production of photon-like quantum states of electrons opens up opportunities for applications similar to quantum optical and quantum information technologies but implemented with charge carriers. Quantum control of the trajectory of the electron wave packet, accompanied by dramatic suppression of its spreading, is demonstrated. This study discovered methods to manage spatially localized electron behavior in a nanostructure that allows a controllable charge quantum transfer and gives rise to new prospects for quantum nanoelectronics technology.

AB We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV6Sn6, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 mu B per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number |C| = 1 and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 Omega Omega-1 Omega-1cm Omega-1cm-1 Omega-1cm-1. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of approximate to approximate to 0.40 eV/angstrom. These findings position 2D ScV6Sn6 as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.

SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Topological superconductors hosting Majorana zero modes are of great interest for both fundamental physics and potential quantum computing applications. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 (MBT). In normal transport measurements, we observe the presence of chiral edge channels, though with deviations from perfect quantization due to factors such as non-uniform thickness, domain structures, and the presence of quasi-helical edge states. Subsequently, we fabricate superconducting junctions using niobium leads on MBT exfoliated flakes, which show an onset of supercurrent with clear Josephson coupling. The interference patterns in the superconducting junctions reveal interesting asymmetries, suggesting changes in the magnetic ordering of the MBT flakes under small applied magnetic fields. Moreover, the modulation of the critical current by magnetic field reveals a SQUID-like pattern, suggesting the presence of supercurrent through the quasi-helical edge states.

AB Quasi-1D nanoribbons provide a unique route to diversifyingtheproperties of their parent 2D nanomaterial, introducing lateral quantumconfinement and an abundance of edge sites. Here, a new family ofnanomaterials is opened with the creation of arsenic-phosphorusalloy nanoribbons (AsPNRs). By ionically etching the layered crystalblack arsenic-phosphorus using lithium electride followed bydissolution in amidic solvents, solutions of AsPNRs are formed. Theribbons are typically few-layered, several micrometers long with widthstens of nanometers across, and both highly flexible and crystalline.The AsPNRs are highly electrically conducting above 130 K due to theirsmall band gap (ca. 0.035 eV), paramagnetic in nature, and have highhole mobilities, as measured with the first generation of AsP devices,directly highlighting their properties and utility in electronic devicessuch as near-infrared detectors, quantum computing, and charge carrierlayers in solar cells.

TI Valley-polarized and enhanced transmission in graphene with a smooth
   strain profile
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We explore the influence of strain on the valley-polarized transmission of graphene by employing the wave-function matching and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique. When the transmission is along the armchair direction, we show that the valley polarization and transmission can be improved by increasing the width of the strained region and increasing (decreasing) the extensional strain in the armchair (zigzag) direction. It is noted that the shear strain does not affect transmission and valley polarization. Furthermore, when we consider the smooth strain barrier, the valley-polarized transmission can be enhanced by increasing the smoothness of the strain barrier. We hope that our finding can shed new light on constructing graphene-based valleytronic and quantum computing devices by solely employing strain.

TI Multicomponent odd-parity superconductivity in UAu2 at high pressure
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We report that high-quality single crystals of the hexagonal heavy fermion material uranium diauride (UAu2) become superconducting at pressures above 3.2 GPa, the pressure at which an unusual antiferromagnetic state is suppressed. The antiferromagnetic state hosts a marginal fermi liquid and the pressure evolution of the resistivity within this state is found to be very different from that approaching a standard quantum phase transition. The superconductivity that appears above this transition survives in high magnetic fields with a large critical field for all field directions. The critical field also has an unusual angle dependence suggesting that the superconductivity may have an order parameter with multiple components. An order parameter consistent with these observations is predicted to host half-quantum vortices (HQVs). Such vortices can be topologically entangled and have potential applications in quantum computing.

TI Quantum attacks on two-round even-mansour
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Even-Mansour is one of the most important constructions in symmetric cryptography, both from a theoretical and practical perspective. With the rapid development of quantum computing, the security of Even-Mansour construction in quantum setting needs to be considered. For one round Even-Mansour construction, it is well settled by classical and quantum attacks. While for the iterated scheme, the situation is much more complex. In this paper, we study the next case in line in detail and depth: quantum attacks against two rounds case. We first make an asymptotic comparison with existing classical and quantum attacks. Then we give concrete resource estimation for the proposed quantum attacks on round reduced LED cipher and AES(2). The resource estimation allows to deduce the most efficient attacks based on the trade-off of the number of qubits and Toffoli depth.

TI Validation of a noisy Gaussian boson sampler via graph theory
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Quantum photonic processors are emerging as promising platforms to prove preliminary evidence of quantum computational advantage toward the realization of universal quantum computers. In the context of nonuniversal noisy intermediate quantum devices, photonic-based sampling machines solving the Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) problem currently play a central role in the experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. A relevant issue is the validation of the sampling process in the presence of experimental noise, such as photon losses, which could undermine the hardness of simulating the experiment. We test the capability of a validation protocol that exploits the connection between GBS and graph perfect match counting to perform such an assessment in a noisy scenario. In particular, we use as a test bench the recently developed machine Borealis, a large-scale sampling machine that has been made available online for external users, and address its operation in the presence of noise. The employed approach to validation is also shown to provide connections with the open question on the effective advantage of using noisy GBS devices for graph similarity and isomorphism problems and thus provides an effective method for certification of quantum hardware.

TI Nonlocal thermoelectric detection of interaction and correlations in
   edge states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonlocal thermoelectricity is proposed as a direct probe of interactions, nonthermal states, and the effect of correlations in the nonequilibrium heat transport between 1D quantum channels. In copropagating quantum Hall edge states contacted at different temperatures, the nonlocal thermoelectrical response is only expected if the electron-electron interaction mediates the heat exchange directly measuring the interaction strength. Considering the low-energy limit of zero-range interactions, we analytically solve the charge and energy currents of a nonequilibrium interacting system, determining the universal scaling law in terms of an interaction-dependent energy-relaxation length. Further, a setup with two controllable quantum point contacts allows thermoelectricity to monitor the thermalization of an interacting system as well as the fundamental role of cross-correlations in the heat exchange at intermediate length scales.

TI Variational Quantum Regression Application in Modeling Monthly River
   Discharge
SO WATER
AB In the framework of efficient water resources management, the hydrological forecast is the basis of the pertinent management of water resources. Therefore, this study applies the variational quantum regression (VQR), a novel machine learning approach inspired by quantum computing principles, to the series of water discharges from a river in Romania. The models were evaluated against the quantum neural network (QNN) and other classic artificial intelligence (AI) outputs on the same dataset. Performance was assessed based on the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE). VQR outperformed classical neural networks and hybrid models with respect to MSE and MAE, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization capability. Notably, the models exhibited exceptional skill in capturing monthly maxima-an area where other models often struggle, underscoring the potential of VQR as a powerful and reliable tool for hydrological forecasting, particularly in the context of nonlinear and high-variability data series.

TI Fractal Quasi-Coulomb Crystals in Ion Trap with Cantor Dust Electrode
   Configuration
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB We propose a new concept of fractal quasi-Coulomb crystals. We have shown that self-similar quasi-Coulomb crystals can be formed in surface electrodynamic traps with the Cantor Dust electrode configuration. Quasi-Coulomb crystal fractal dimension appears to depend on the electrode parameters. We have identified the conditions for transforming trivial quasi-Coulomb crystals into self-similar crystals and described the features of forming 25 Ca+ self-similar quasi-Coulomb crystals. The local potential well depth and width have been shown to take a discrete value dependent on the distance from the electrode surface. Ions inside the crystals studied possess varied translational secular frequencies. We believe that the extraordinary properties of self-similar quasi-Coulomb crystals may contribute to the new prospects within levitated optomechanics, quantum computing and simulation.

TI Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits with
   gap-asymmetric junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Superconducting qubits hold promise for quantum computing, but their operation is challenged by various sources of noise, including excitations known as quasiparticles. Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: (i) nonequilibrium, (ii) local quasiequilibrium, (iii) global quasiequilibrium, and (iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.

TI Observation of spin precession resonance in a stirred quantum fluid of
   light
SO OPTICA
AB External driving of spins by magnetic or optical fields in different systems underpins numerous applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging to coherent state control in quantum computing. Here, we reveal the effect of an all-optically driven spin precession in microcavity polariton condensates. It is achieved through a radio frequency modulation of a spatially rotating, asymmetric exciton reservoir that both confines and actively replenishes the polariton condensate. The non-resonant stirring profile is realized by the beating note of two structured and frequency-detuned laser beams. We realize the GHz driven spin precession with striking phase stability, which occurs only in the resonance with the internal condensate self-induced Larmor precession frequency. From the shape of the revealed resonance, we estimate the spin coherence time (T2) for the polariton condensate. Our observations are supported by numerical simulations and evidence a quantum fluidic analogue of the nuclear magnetic resonance effect.

SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB This paper outlines the centralized design and production of the ultra-high-vacuum sidearm and laser-stabilization systems for the AION Ultra-Cold Strontium Laboratories. Commissioning data on the residual gas and steady-state pressures in the sidearm chambers, on magnetic field quality, on laser stabilization, and on the loading rate for the 3D magneto-optical trap are presented. Streamlining the design and production of the sidearm and laser stabilization systems enabled the AION Collaboration to build and equip in parallel five state-of-the-art Ultra-Cold Strontium Laboratories within 24 months by leveraging key expertise in the collaboration. This approach could serve as a model for the development and construction of other cold atom experiments, such as atomic clock experiments and neutral atom quantum computing systems, by establishing dedicated design and production units at national laboratories.

TI When is the Chernoff Exponent for Quantum Operations Finite?
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We consider the problem of testing two hypotheses of quantum operations in a setting of many uses where an arbitrary prior probability distribution is given. The Chernoff exponent for quantum operations is investigated to track the minimal average error probability of discriminating two quantum operations asymptotically. We answer the question, "When is the Chernoff exponent for quantum operations finite?" We show that either two quantum operations can be perfectly distinguished with finite uses, or the minimal discrimination error decays exponentially with respect to the number of uses asymptotically. That is, the Chernoff exponent is finite if and only if the quantum operations can not be perfectly distinguished with finite uses. This rules out the possibility of super-exponential decay of error probability. Upper bounds of the Chernoff exponent for quantum operations are provided.

AB Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising quantum heuristics for combinatorial optimization. While QAOA has been shown to perform well on small-scale instances and to provide an asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems, fault-tolerance is understood to be required to realize this speedup in practice. The low resource requirements of QAOA make it particularly suitable to benchmark on early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) hardware. However, the performance of QAOA depends crucially on the choice of the free parameters in the circuit. The task of setting these parameters is complicated in the EFTQC era by the large overheads, which preclude extensive classical optimization. In this paper, we summarize recent advances in parameter setting in QAOA and show that these advancements make EFTQC experiments with QAOA practically viable.

TI Reversible Transformation between Isolated Skyrmions and Bimerons
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Skyrmions and bimerons are versatile topological spin textures that can be used as information bits for both classical and quantum computing. The transformation between isolated skyrmions and bimerons is an essential operation for computing architecture based on multiple different topological bits. Here we report the creation of isolated skyrmions and their subsequent transformation to bimerons by harnessing the electric current induced Oersted field and temperature-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy variation. The transformation between skyrmions and bimerons is reversible, which is controlled by the current amplitude and scanning direction. Both skyrmions and bimerons can be created in the same system through the skyrmion-bimeron transformation and magnetization switching. Deformed skyrmion bubbles and chiral labyrinth domains are found as nontrivial intermediate transition states. Our results may provide a unique way for building advanced information-processing devices using different types of topological spin textures in the same system.

TI Conductivity and size quantization effects in semiconductor δ-layer
   systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present an open-system quantum-mechanical 3D real-space study of the conduction band structure and conductive properties of two semiconductor systems, interesting for their beyond-Moore and quantum computing applications: phosphorus delta-layers and P delta-layer tunnel junctions in silicon. In order to evaluate size quantization effects on the conductivity, we consider two principal cases: nanoscale finite-width structures, used in transistors, and infinitely-wide structures, electrical properties of which are typically known experimentally. For devices widths W < 10 nm, quantization effects are strong and it is shown that the number of propagating modes determines not only the conductivity, but the distinctive spatial distribution of the current-carrying electron states. For W > 10 nm, the quantization effects practically vanish and the conductivity tends to the infinitely-wide device values. For tunnel junctions, two distinct conductivity regimes are predicted due to the strong conduction band quantization.

TI Iterator-Based Design of Generic C plus plus Algorithms for Basic Tensor
   Operations
SO FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
AB Numerical tensor calculus has recently gained increasing attention in many scientific fields including quantum computing and machine learning which contain basic tensor operations such as the pointwise tensor addition and multiplication of tensors. We present a C++ design of multi-dimensional iterators and iterator-based C++ functions for basic tensor operations using mode-specific iterators only, simplifying the implementation of algorithms with recursion and multiple loops. The proposed C++ functions are designed for dense tensor and subtensor types with any linear storage format, mode and dimensions. We demonstrate our findings with Boost's latest uBlas tensor extension and discuss how other C++ frameworks can utilize our proposal without modifying their code base. Our runtime measurements show that C++ functions with iterators can compute tensor operations at least as fast as their pointer-based counterpart.

TI Cryogenic microwave loss in epitaxial Al/GaAs/Al trilayers for
   superconducting circuits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Epitaxially grown superconductor/dielectric/superconductor trilayers have the potential to form high-performance superconducting quantum devices and may even allow scalable superconducting quantum computing with low-surface-area qubits such as the merged-element transmon. In this work, we measure the power-independent loss and two-level-state (TLS) loss of epitaxial, wafer-bonded, and substrate-removed Al/GaAs/Al trilayers by measuring lumped element superconducting microwave resonators at millikelvin temperatures and down to single-photon powers. The power-independent loss of the device is
   ( 4.8 +/- 0.1 ) x
   10
   - 5, and the resonator-induced intrinsic TLS loss is
   ( 6.4 +/- 0.2 ) x
   10
   - 5. Dielectric loss extraction is used to determine a lower bound of the intrinsic TLS loss of the trilayer of
   7.2 x
   10
   - 5. The unusually high power-independent loss is attributed to GaAs's intrinsic piezoelectricity.

TI Real classical shadows
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Efficiently learning expectation values of a quantum state using classical shadow tomography has become a fundamental task in quantum information theory. In a classical shadows protocol, one measures a state in a chosen basis W after it has evolved under a unitary transformation randomly sampled from a chosen distribution U. In this work we study the case where U corresponds to either local or global orthogonal Clifford gates, and W consists of real-valued vectors. Our results show that for various situations of interest, this 'real' classical shadow protocol improves the sample complexity over the standard scheme based on general Clifford unitaries. For example, when one is interested in estimating the expectation values of arbitrary real-valued observables, global orthogonal Cliffords typically decrease the required number of samples by a factor of two. More dramatically, for k-local observables composed only of real-valued Pauli operators, sampling local orthogonal Cliffords leads to a reduction by an exponential-in-k factor in the sample complexity over local unitary Cliffords. Finally, we show that by measuring in a basis containing complex-valued vectors, orthogonal shadows can, in the limit of large system size, exactly reproduce the original unitary shadows protocol.

TI On approximating the symplectic spectrum of infinite-dimensional
   operators
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The symplectic eigenvalues play a significant role in the finite-mode quantum information theory, and Williamson's normal form proves to be a valuable tool in this area. Understanding the symplectic spectrum of a Gaussian Covariance Operator is a crucial task. Recently, in 2018, an infinite-dimensional analogue of Williamson's Normal form was discovered, which has been instrumental in studying the infinite-mode Gaussian quantum states. However, most existing results pertain to finite-dimensional operators, leaving a dearth of literature in the infinite-dimensional context. The focus of this article is on employing approximation techniques to estimate the symplectic spectrum of certain infinite-dimensional operators. These techniques are well-suited for a particular class of operators, including specific types of infinite-mode Gaussian Covariance Operators. Our approach involves computing the Williamson's Normal form and deriving bounds for the symplectic spectrum of these operators. As a practical application, we explicitly compute the symplectic spectrum of Gaussian Covariance Operators. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the understanding of symplectic eigenvalues in the context of infinite-dimensional operators, opening new avenues for exploration in quantum information theory and related fields.

TI Local strain-dependent Zeeman splitting in GaN:Eu
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The electronic spins of rare-earth materials are attractive candidates for spin qubits and quantum memories. To access individual spins, tuning of the g-factor is desirable. Here, we report on local strain-dependent g-factors of the D-5(0)-F-7(2) transitions of Eu3+ centers in GaN:Eu thin films. We have found a clear correlation between the effective g-factor and the emission energy shift induced by the local strain. The combination of micro-photoluminescence and scanning electron microscope/electron backscattering diffraction measurements has revealed that the compressive strain of 0.2%-0.4%, relative to a surrounding reference point, induces an energy shift of about 3 meV. The strain decreases the g-factor of the emission at 1.991 eV from 2.5 to 1.5, while the strain increases the g-factor of the emission at 1.994 eV from 1.1 to 1.7. The result suggests that the g-factor can be tuned by the local strain. On the basis of the strain-induced energy shift and the g-factor, we have identified the optical sites. The D-5(0)-F-7(2) transitions observed in this study consist of three optical sites with C-3v symmetry and one site with C-1h symmetry. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI An efficient lattice-based integrated revocable identity-based
   encryption
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Revocable identity-based encryption (RIBE) enables data encryption without certificates and allows for the revocation of users, thereby offering a more streamlined and secure approach to dynamic member management. However, the existing revocation models lack strong scalability, rendering the RIBE scheme unsuitable for scenarios where the key generation center (KGC) experiences high workloads and users face heavy storage burdens. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated revocation model that maintains both the workload for the KGC and the size of the secret keys at a constant level, while also relieving the encryptor of the burden of handling revocation information. By combining online and offline encryption, we construct an OO-IRIBE-EnDKER scheme from lattices, which possesses properties such as anonymity, decryption key exposure resistance (DKER), resistance to quantum computing attacks, and selective security. Finally, the effectiveness of the OO-IRIBE-EnDKER scheme is demonstrated through experimental results.

TI Optimizing link-length fitting between an operator and a robot with
   compensation for habitual movements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB Teleoperation has become increasingly important for the real-world application of robots. However, in current teleoperation applications, operators need to visually recognize any physical deviations between the robot and themselves and correct its operation accordingly. Even when humans move their bodies, achieving high positional accuracy can be difficult for them, which can limit their speed of movement and place a heavy burden on them. In this study, we proposed a parameter optimization method for feedforward compensation of the link-length deviation and operator's habitual body movements in leader-follower control in 3D space. To optimize the parameters, we used Digital Annealer developed by Fujitsu Ltd, which could rapidly solve the combinatorial optimization problem. The objective function minimized the difference between the hand positions of the robot and targets. Simulations verified that the proposed method could reduce hand positional differences.

TI Financial risk management on a neutral atom quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Machine learning models capable of handling the large data sets collected in the financial world can often become black boxes expensive to run. The quantum computing paradigm suggests new optimization techniques that, combined with classical algorithms, may deliver competitive, faster, and more interpretable models. In this paper we propose a quantum-enhanced machine learning solution for the prediction of credit rating downgrades, also known as fallen-angels forecasting in the financial risk management field. We implement this solution on a neutral atom quantum processing unit with up to 60 qubits on a real-life data set. We report performance that is competitive with the state-of-the-art random forest benchmark, whereas our model achieves better interpretability and comparable training times. We examine how to improve performance in the near term, validating our ideas with tensor-networks-based numerical simulations.

TI Ferromagnetic resonances in single-crystal yttrium iron garnet nanofilms
   fabricated by metal-organic decomposition
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Tunable microwave and millimeter wave oscillators and bandpass filters with ultra-low phase noise play a critical role in electronic devices, including wireless communication, microelectronics, and quantum computing. Magnetic materials, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), possess ultra-low phase noise and a ferromagnetic resonance tunable up to tens of gigahertz. Here, we report structural and magnetic properties of single-crystal 60 and 130 nm-thick YIG films prepared by metal-organic decomposition epitaxy. These films, consisting of multiple homoepitaxially grown monolayers, are atomically flat and possess magnetic properties similar to those grown with liquid-phase epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition, and sputtering. Our approach does not involve expensive high-vacuum deposition systems and is a true low-cost alternative to current commercial techniques that have the potential to transform the industry.

TI High-Performance and Fabrication-Tolerant 3 dB Adiabatic Coupler Based
   on Ultralow-Loss Silicon Waveguide by Tri-Layer Hard Mask Etching
   Process
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Silicon photonics has emerged as critical for advancing photonic integrated circuits (PICs), but waveguide losses, primarily resulting from sidewall roughness, remain a primary challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a tri-layer hard mask etching process that produces strip silicon waveguides with propagation losses as low as 1.48 dB/cm, i.e., a 37% improvement over the conventional Si3N4 hard mask technique. Based on the abovementioned approach, the fabricated 3 dB adiabatic directional couplers achieve a nearly ideal splitting ratio of 50.2:49.8 as well as an excess loss of 0.067 dB. These results indicate that the tri-layer hard mask etching process enables scalable and ultralow-loss PICs to be fabricated for high-speed optical interconnects and quantum computing systems.

This paper presents a broad and flexible roadmap for securing 6G networks, exploring the diverse range of threats posed by advanced technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), quantum computing, and AI/ML. Rather than focusing on a singular problem or solution, the paper emphasizes the need for adaptable frameworks capable of addressing the multifaceted and evolving security landscape of 6G. Key areas of focus include quantum-safe cryptography, AI-based threat detection, and privacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption and federated learning. The paper also underscores the critical role of standardization efforts by key organizations such as ETSI, ITU, and 3GPP in shaping secure, resilient, and trustworthy 6G networks. By maintaining a general perspective, this roadmap offers a foundation for future research and collaboration, guiding the development of context-specific security solutions as 6G technology advances.

AB The rapid development of quantum computing technologies already made it possible to manipulate a collective state of several dozens of qubits, which poses a strong demand on efficient methods for characterization and verification of large-scale quantum states. Here, we propose a numerically cheap procedure to distinguish quantum states which is based on a limited number of projective measurements in at least two different bases and computing inter-scale dissimilarities of the resulting bit-string patterns via coarse-graining. The information one obtains through this procedure can be viewed as a 'hash function' of quantum state-a simple set of numbers which is specific for a concrete wave function and can be used for certification. We show that it is enough to characterize quantum states with different structure of entanglement, including the chaotic quantum states. Our approach can also be employed to detect phase transitions in quantum magnetic systems.

TI Zero-Field Splitting Calculations by Multiconfiguration Pair-Density
   Functional Theory
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Zero-field splitting (ZFS) is a fundamental molecular property that is especially relevant for single-molecule magnets (SMMs), electron paramagneticresonance spectra, and quantum computing. Developing a method that can accuratelypredict ZFS parameters can be very powerful for designing new SMMs. One of thechallenges is to include external correlation in an inherently multiconfigurationalopen-shell species for the accurate prediction of magnetic properties. Previouslyavailable methods depend on expensive multireference perturbation theorycalculations to include external correlation. In this paper, we present spin-orbit-inclusive multiconfiguration and multistate pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) calculations of ZFSs; these calculations have a cost comparable to complete-active-space self-consistentfield (CASSCF) theory, but they include correlation external to the active space. We found that combining a multistate formulation of MC-PDFT, namely, compressed-state multistate pair-density functional theory, with orbitals optimized by weighted-state-averaged CASSCF, yields reasonably accurate ZFS results

TI Temporal Coherence of Single Photons Emitted by Hexagonal Boron Nitride
   Defects at Room Temperature
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e., their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are 4 orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong electron-phonon coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.

TI Quantum gate sets for lattice QCD in the strong-coupling limit:
   Nf=1
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We derive the primitive quantum gate sets to simulate lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) in the strong-coupling limit with one flavor of massless staggered quarks. This theory is of interest for studies at non-zero density as the sign problem can be overcome using Monte Carlo methods. In this work, we use it as a testing ground for quantum simulations. The key point is that no truncation of the bosonic Hilbert space is necessary as the theory is formulated in terms of color-singlet degrees of freedom ("baryons" and "mesons"). The baryons become static in the limit of continuous time and decouple, whereas the dynamics of the mesonic theory involves two qubits per lattice site. Lending dynamics also to the "baryons" simply requires to use the derived gate set in its controlled version.

TI Degradation of Ta2O5 / SiO2 dielectric cavity mirrors in ultra-high
   vacuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In order for optical cavities to enable strong light-matter interactions for quantum metrology, networking, and scalability in quantum computing systems, their mirrors must have minimal losses. However, high-finesse dielectric cavity mirrors can degrade in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), increasing the challenges of upgrading to cavity-coupled quantum systems. We observe the optical degradation of high-finesse dielectric optical cavity mirrors after high-temperature UHV bake in the form of a substantial increase in surface roughness. We provide an explanation of the degradation through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), selective wet etching, and optical measurements. We find the degradation is explained by oxygen reduction in Ta2O5 followed by growth of tantalum sub-oxide defects with height to width aspect ratios near ten. We discuss the dependence of mirror loss on surface roughness and finally give recommendations to avoid degradation to allow for quick adoption of cavity-coupled systems.

TI Laser Cavity-Temperature and 3D Nonlinear Thermal Model of VCSEL From
   2.6 to 130 K
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Oxide-confined vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) operating from 2.6 to 295 K are investigated to establish reliable thermal design guidelines for cryogenic photonic interconnects. Lasing-wavelength shifts due to self-heating are converted to an effective cavity temperature through calibrated spectral thermometry. The 3D finite-element VCSEL model of semiconductor and oxide nanoscale layers is developed to solve the nonlinear heat-conduction equation with thermal conductivities dependent on temperature, material composition, and doping. The combined 3D modeling-and-measurement framework provides a predictive tool for engineering next-generation cryogenic VCSELs with reduced self-heating and improved reliability in high-speed superconducting computing links.

TI Fast thermo-optic switching through parity-time symmetry breaking
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are key elements for emerging applications like photonic sensing, LiDAR, and quantum computing. In such applications, optical switches with fast response and robust fabrication methods are crucial for reprogramming linear optical transformations on demand. Here, we demonstrate a fast thermo-optic switching mechanism on the silicon nitride on insulator platform, leveraging parity-time symmetry breaking. The cladding-free design operating at 775 nm enables optical propagation in a partially metal-covered waveguide with minimal loss-an uncommon phenomenon given the typical absorption associated with metal proximity. The fabricated device exhibits a 7.1 mu s rise time for a pi phase shift, despite the weak thermo-optic coefficient in silicon nitride. Our design provides reproducible fabrication metrics and holds promises for large-scale photonic networks operating at visible wavelengths.

TI Solving MaxCut with quantum imaginary time evolution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We introduce a method to solve the MaxCut problem efficiently based on quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). We employ a linear Ansatz for unitary updates and an initial state involving no entanglement, as well as an imaginary-time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between a given graph and a subgraph with two edges excised. We apply the method to thousands of randomly selected graphs with up to fifty vertices. We show that our algorithm exhibits a 93% and above performance converging to the maximum solution of the MaxCut problem for all considered graphs. Our results compare favorably with the performance of classical algorithms, such as the greedy and Goemans-Williamson algorithms. We also discuss the overlap of the final state of the QITE algorithm with the ground state as a performance metric, which is a quantum feature not shared by other classical algorithms.

TI Low-loss integrated dynamic polarization controller based on silicon
   photonics
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A dynamic polarization controller (DPC) is an important component in fiber optic communication, optical imaging, and quantum technologies. The DPC can transform any input state of polarization (SOP) into any desired SOP to overcome polarization -related impairments resulting from high internally and externally induced birefringence. In this work, a low -loss silicon photonics-integrated DPC is designed and demonstrated experimentally. The whole chip is fabricated by using industry -standard silicon -on -insulator technology. Using the edge -coupling method, the coupler loss is reduced to less than 2 dB, and the total loss of DPC is reduced to 5.7 dB. Using a variable -step simulated annealing method, for a low -noise photodetector and high -staticextinction -ratio device, a dynamic polarization extinction ratio can reach more than 30 dB. The size of the DPC on the chip is 5.20 mm x 0.12 mm x 0.80 mm. The DPC utilizes a 0 degrees/45 degrees/0 degrees/45 degrees structure, which can realize arbitrary polarization -based coordinate conversion with endless polarization control. The 0 degrees and 45 degrees transform structures and matrices are presented, and the principle of the 0 degrees and 45 degrees structures is explained in detail by using the Poincare sphere. A simulation using Lumerical is conducted to optimize the polarization rotator -splitter, which can transform the TM0 mode light in one waveguide into the TE0 mode light in the other waveguide while the TE0 mode light in one waveguide remains unchanged. Based on the optimized structure, the static polarization extinction ratio of DPC can be measured to be a value greater than 40 dB. The thermal phase shift (TPS) is characterized by using a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The length of the TPS is 400 mu m, and the resistance of the metal heater is 2.00 k omega. The maximum power consumed by the four TPSs is a total of 0.2 W. The modulation bandwidth of the DPC designed by our group is approximately 30 kHz. By considering an applied voltage of 5.6 V in the case of the TPS, the bandwidth-voltage product is 5.6 x 30 = 168 kHz center dot V. To optimize the DPC parameters, such as the step length, electronic noise, and static polarization extinction ratio, numerical simulation results of the simulated annealing approach are analyzed in detail. In conclusion, a low -loss silicon photonics-integrated DPC is designed and demonstrated experimentally. A dynamic polarization extinction ratio is obtained to be greater than 30 dB by using the variable -step simulated annealing method. The DPC is expected to be utilized in fiber or quantum communication systems to minimize size and further decrease costs.

TI All-fiber device for single-photon detection
SO PHOTONIX
AB Fiber components form the standard not only in modern telecommunication but also for future quantum information technology. For high-performance single-photon detection, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SPDs) are typically fabricated on a silicon chip and fiber-coupled for easy handling and usage. The fiber-to-chip interface hinders the SPD from being an all-fiber device for full utilization of its excellent performance. Here, we report a scheme of SPD that is directly fabricated on the fiber tip. A bury-and-planar fabrication technique is developed to improve the roughness of the substrate for all-fiber detectors' performance for single-photon detection with amorphous molybdenum silicide (MoSi) nanowires. The low material selectivity and universal planar process enable fabrication and packaging on a large scale. Such a detector responds to a broad wavelength range from 405 nm to 1550 nm at a dark count rate of 100 cps. The relaxation time of the response pulse is similar to 15 ns, which is comparable to that of on-chip SPDs. Therefore, this device is free from fiber-to-chip coupling and easy packaging for all-fiber quantum information systems.

TI Ground-state cooling of mechanical resonators by quantum reservoir
   engineering
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Cooling a mechanical oscillator to its ground state underpins many applications ranging from ultra-precise sensing to quantum information processing. The authors propose a new scheme that addresses the problem of the simultaneous cooling of many mechanical resonators with nearby frequencies.
   Ground-state cooling of multiple mechanical resonators becomes vital to employ them in various applications ranging from ultra-precise sensing to quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for simultaneous cooling of multiple degenerate or near-degenerate mechanical resonators to their quantum ground-state, which is otherwise a challenging goal to achieve. As opposed to standard laser cooling schemes where coherence renders the motion of a resonator to its ground-state, we consider an incoherent thermal source to achieve the same aim. The underlying physical mechanism of cooling is explained by investigating a direct connection between the laser sideband cooling and "cooling by heating". Our advantageous scheme of cooling enabled by quantum reservoir engineering can be realized in various setups, employing parametric coupling of a cooling agent with the target systems. We also discuss using non-thermal baths to simulate ultra-high temperature thermal baths for cooling.

These states include the ground states of stoquastic Hamiltonians and they are of interest since they avoid the Sign Problem and can thus be efficiently simulated. In optimization theory, the convex cone generated by such states is called the set of completely positive (CP) matrices (not be confused with completely positive superoperators). We introduce quantum channels which preserve these states and call them completely positive completely positive.

TI Quantum Chosen-Cipher Attack on Camellia
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The Feistel structure represents a fundamental architectural component within the domain of symmetric cryptographic algorithms, with a substantial body of research conducted within the context of classical computing environments. Nevertheless, research into specific symmetric cryptographic algorithms utilizing the Feistel structure is relatively scarce in quantum computing environments. This paper, for the first time, proposes a five-round distinguisher for Camellia under the quantum chosen-ciphertext attack (qCCA) setting, with its effectiveness empirically validated. Additionally, by combining Grover's algorithm and Simon's algorithm, we construct a nine-round key-recovery attack model against Camellia. Through an in-depth analysis of Camellia's key expansion algorithm, we significantly reduce the complexity of the key-recovery attack. The proposed attack achieves a time complexity of 261.5 for recovering the correct key bits and requires 531 quantum bits.

AB Quantum computing exhibits the unique capability to natively and efficiently encode various natural phenomena, promising theoretical speedups of several orders of magnitude. However, not all computational tasks can be efficiently executed on quantum machines, giving rise to hybrid systems, where some portions of an application run on classical machines, while others utilize quantum resources. However, existing methods often to identify candidates to quantum execution (quantum candidates) involve a trial-and-error approach, relying on the intuition and expertise of computer scientists, resulting in varying identification durations ranging from minutes to days for a single application.
   This paper aims to systematically formalize the process of identifying quantum candidates and their proper encoding within classical programs. Our work addresses the critical initial step in the development of automated reasoning techniques for code-to-code translation, laying the foundation for more efficient quantum software engineering.

TI Circuit of Quantum Fractional Fourier Transform
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB In this paper, we first use the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and quantum phase estimation (QPE) to realize the quantum fractional Fourier transform (QFrFT). As diverse definitions of the discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) exist, the relationship between the QFrFT and a classical algorithm is then established; that is, we determine the classical algorithm corresponding to the QFrFT. Second, we observe that many definitions of the multi-fractional Fourier transform (mFrFT) are flawed: when we attempt to propose a design scheme for the quantum mFrFT, we find that there are many invalid weighting terms in the definition of the mFrFT. This flaw may have very significant impacts on relevant algorithms for signal processing and image encryption. Finally, we analyze the circuit of the QFrFT and the reasons for the observed defects.

TI Analysis of Josephson junction barrier variation: A combined electron
   microscopy, breakdown, and Monte Carlo approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimize. Here, we consider complementary techniques and assess what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges in forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.

TI Shortcuts to adiabatic non-Abelian braiding on silicon photonic chips
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Non-Abelian braiding describes the exchange behavior of anyons, useful for encoding qubits for quantum computing. Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and hindering practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.

TI Spin-Spin Correlations in the Kitaev Model at Finite Temperatures:
   Approximate and Exact Results via Green's Function Equation of Motion
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The Kitaev model, defined fi ned on a honeycomb lattice, features an exactly solvable ground state with fractionalized Majorana fermion excitations, which can potentially form non-Abelian anyons crucial for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Although Majorana fermions are essential for obtaining the exact ground state, their physical interpretation in terms of spin operators remains unclear. In this study, we employ a Green's ' s function approach that maintains SU(2) symmetry to address this issue and explore the model's ' s fi nite temperature properties. Our results demonstrate that the computed temperature dependence of the correlation functions closely approximates the exact values at zero temperature, confirming fi rming the accuracy of our method. We also present several exact results concerning the spin Green's ' s function and spin-spin - spin correlation functions that are specific fi c to the Kitaev model.

TI Robust observable control of open and closed quantum systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In recent work, we introduced the asymptotic theory of quantum robust control, which enables control of moments of quantum observables and gates in the presence of Hamiltonian uncertainty or field noise. In this paper, we extend this theory of quantum robust control to encompass two of the most important generalizations: robust control of arbitrary quantum observables and robust control of quantum systems sustaining environmental decoherence. In addition, we present deterministic Pareto optimization algorithms that can be applied in conjunction with either asymptotic or leading order measures of robustness. This enables robust control of any observable in quantum systems with any initial density matrix, and for which the entropy can change arbitrarily during the time evolution. Methods for robust optimal control of open quantum systems are presented that maximize the expected value of a quantum control objective while minimizing the expected environmentally induced decoherence.

TI Multiparty quantum anonymous voting with discrete modulated coherent
   states and an optical frequency comb
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A key challenge for quantum information science is to realize large-scale, precisely controllable, practical systems for multiparty secure communications. Recently, Guidry et al. [Nat. Photonics 16, 52 (2022)] have investigated the quantum optics of a Kerr-based optical frequency comb (OFC), which lays out the way for OFC acting as a quantum resource to realize a low-cost and stable multiparty continuous-variable quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a distributed quantum anonymous voting (DQAV) protocol based on discrete modulated coherent states, in which a Kerr-based OFC serves as the resource to generate multi-frequency quantum signals for multiparty voting. We consider both the single-selection and multiple-selection ballot scenarios, and design the phase compensation method for the OFC-based protocol. Voting security is ensured by the basic laws of quantum mechanics, while voting anonymity is achieved by the random assignment of different frequency sources and the homogeneity of the quantum operations taken on the same voting choice. Numerical analysis calculates the secure voting distance over the thermal-lossy channel, showing the advancement of the proposed protocol under multiparty and multivalued voting tasks.

TI Exact Emergent Quantum State Designs from Quantum Chaotic Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present exact results on a novel kind of emergent random matrix universality that quantum manybody systems at infinite temperature can exhibit. Specifically, we consider an ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem, generated from projective measurements of the remainder of the system in a local basis. We rigorously show that the ensemble, derived for a class of quantum chaotic systems undergoing quench dynamics, approaches a universal form completely independent of system details: it becomes uniformly distributed in Hilbert space. This goes beyond the standard paradigm of quantum thermalization, which dictates that the subsystem relaxes to an ensemble of quantum states that reproduces the expectation values of local observables in a thermal mixed state. Our results imply more generally that the distribution of quantum states themselves becomes indistinguishable from those of uniformly random ones, i.e., the ensemble forms a quantum state design in the parlance of quantum information theory. Our work establishes bridges between quantum many-body physics, quantum information and random matrix theory, by showing that pseudorandom states can arise from isolated quantum dynamics, opening up new ways to design applications for quantum state tomography and benchmarking.

TI Quantum-walk search in motion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In quantum computing, the quantum walk search algorithm is designed for locating fixed marked nodes within a graph. However, when multiple marked nodes exist, the conventional search algorithm lacks the capacity to simultaneously amplify the marked nodes as well as identify the correct chronological ordering between the marked nodes, if any. To address this limitation, we explore a potential extension of the algorithm by introducing additional quantum states to label the marked nodes. The labels resolve the ambiguity of simultaneous amplification of the marked nodes. Additionally, by associating the label states with a chronological ordering, we can extend the algorithm to track a moving particle on a two-dimensional surface. Our algorithm efficiently searches for the trajectory of the particle and is supported by a proposed quantum circuit. This concept holds promise for a range of applications, from real-time object tracking to network management and routing.

AB Current NIQST machines have a relatively small number of qubits and a limited circuit depth. In this regard, a class of quantum variational algorithms (VQAs) have been developed to be able to split the computational cost between classical and quantum hardware. In this study, the VQE algorithm has been used in order to solve the problem of propagation modes in rectangular waveguides described analytically by the Helmholtz partial differential equation. The IBM quantum device called manila was used in these calculations to provide noise present in physical hardware. In order to implement the VQE, IBM's proprietary framework called Qiskit has been used. The results show good agreement between calculations run on simulated quantum hardware and those run on real quantum hardware. This agreement between theory and experiment is evidence that high fidelity modeling of electromagnetic fields utilizing quantum hardware is possible.

AB High-frequency trading (HFT) offers an excellent use case and a potential killer application of the commercially available, first generation quasi-quantum computers. To this end, we offer here a simple game-theoretic model of HFT as the famous two player game, Prisoner's Dilemma. We explore the implementation of HFT as an instance of Prisoner's Dilemma on the (quasi) quantum cloud using the Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein quantum mediated communication protocol, and how this implementation can not only increase transaction speed but also improve the lot of the players in HFT. Using cooperative game-theoretic reasoning, we also note that in the near future when the internet is properly quantum, players will be able to achieve Pareto-optimality in HFT as an instance of reinforced machine learning.

TI Comparison of Two Optimization Methods for a Rydberg Quantum Gate
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.

AB Open set anomaly detection (OSAD) is a crucial task that aims to identify abnormal patterns or behaviors in data sets, especially when the anomalies observed during training do not represent all possible classes of anomalies. The recent advances in quantum computing in handling complex data structures and improving machine learning models herald a paradigm shift in anomaly detection methodologies. This study proposes a Quantum Scoring Module (Qsco), embedding quantum variational circuits into neural networks to enhance the model's processing capabilities in handling uncertainty and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments conducted across eight real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance in detecting anomalies across varied settings and reveal that integrating quantum simulators does not result in prohibitive time complexities. At the same time, the experimental results under different noise models also prove that Qsco is a noise-resilient algorithm. Our study validates the feasibility of quantum-enhanced anomaly detection methods in practical applications.

While cryptographic algorithms that current PKI systems depend on are mostly resilient against hacks and other threats launched from computers we use today, the advancement of quantum computing technology introduces new security threats. This calls for current PKI systems to be modified with quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. However, transitioning to Quantum-safe (QS) PKI systems remains complex, and the challenges are sociotechnical. The research aims to guide organizations transitioning towards QS PKI systems. In doing so, we will deconstruct the QS transition into a series of stages and paths using growth models and examine how organizations can transit over time towards QS PKI systems.

TI A silicon-based ion trap chip protected from semiconductor charging
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Silicon-based ion trap chips can benefit from existing advanced fabrication technologies, such as multi-metal layer techniques for two-dimensional architectures and silicon photonics for the integration of on-chip optical components. However, the scalability of these technologies may be compromised by semiconductor charging, where photogenerated charge carriers produce electric potentials that disrupt ion motion. Inspired by recent studies on charge distribution mechanisms in semiconductors, we developed a silicon-based chip with gold coated on all exposed silicon surfaces. This modification significantly stabilized ion motion compared to a chip without such metallic shielding, a result that underscores the detrimental effects of exposed silicon. With the mitigation of background silicon-induced fields to negligible levels, quantum operations such as sideband cooling and two-ion entangling gates, which were previously infeasible with the unshielded chip, can now be implemented.

TI Toward a 2D Local Implementation of Quantum Low-Density-Check Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Geometric locality is an important theoretical and practical factor for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that affects code performance and ease of physical realization. For device architectures restricted to two-dimensional (2D) local gates, naively implementing the high-rate codes suitable for low- overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing incurs prohibitive overhead. In this work, we present an error- correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate-bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome-measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit- level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes, bivariate-bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.

TI Helico-conical vector beams for intensity and polarization 3D light
   shaping
SO OPTICA
AB While vector beams offer an intriguing way to structure optical beams and enhance light-based technologies across many fields, their generation remains a challenging task in practical applications. Disclosing an unprecedented manipulation of light at the subwavelength scale, metaoptics have inspired smart and efficient solutions for spatially variant polarization structuring. Concurrently, the generalization of non-separability in polarization and phase manipulation extends the vectorial nature beyond standard vector vortices. In this work, we present the design and test of dual-functional metasurfaces for the compact generation of a new type of vector beam, so-called helico-conical vector beam, providing an inhomogeneous polarization pattern over customizable one-arm or two-arm 3D spirals of light. These devices pave the way to integrated optical architectures for dynamic optical manipulation and trapping in many fields, from optofluidics to quantum computing.

TI A methodology to select and adjust quantum noise models through
   emulators: benchmarking against real backends
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently, access to quantum processors is costly in terms of time, and power. There are quantum simulators and emulators on the market that offer alternatives for evaluating the behavior of a real quantum processor. However, these emulation environments present accuracy deviations from real devices, mainly because of difficult-to-model error sources. In this study, a methodology is proposed that allows the selection of noise models and adjustment of their parameters, considering the nature of the backends (technology, topology, vendor, model, etc.). The proposed methodology is illustrated using a small superconducting example based on the ibm_perth backend (seven qubits) and a comparison between the quantum emulators Qaptiva and Qiskit, where six different noise models are applied, achieving a fidelity deviation of 0.686% at best with respect to the real device.

TI Visible light photonic integrated Brillouin laser
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Narrow linewidth visible light lasers are critical for atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics including atomic clocks, quantum computing, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and sensing. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is a promising approach to realize highly coherent on-chip visible light laser emission. Here we report demonstration of a visible light photonic integrated Brillouin laser, with emission at 674nm, a 14.7mW optical threshold, corresponding to a threshold density of 4.92mW mu m(-2), and a 269Hz linewidth. Significant advances in visible light silicon nitride/silica all-waveguide resonators are achieved to overcome barriers to SBS in the visible, including 1dB/meter waveguide losses, 55.4 million quality factor (Q), and measurement of the 25.110GHz Stokes frequency shift and 290MHz gain bandwidth. This advancement in integrated ultra-narrow linewidth visible wavelength SBS lasers opens the door to compact quantum and atomic systems and implementation of increasingly complex AMO based physics and experiments.

TI Optical manipulation of domains in chiral topological superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optical control of chirality in chiral superconductors bears potential for future topological quantum computing applications. When a chiral domain is written and erased by a laser spot, the Majorana modes around the domain can be manipulated on ultrafast timescales. Here we study topological superconductors with two chiral order parameters coupled via light fields by a time-dependent real-space Ginzburg-Landau approach. Continuous optical driving, or the application of supercurrent, hybridizes the two chiral order parameters, allowing one to induce and control the superconducting state beyond what is possible in equilibrium. We show that superconductivity can even be enhanced if the mutual coupling between two order parameters is sufficiently strong. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short optical pulses with spot size larger than a critical one can overcome a counteracting diffusion effect and write, erase, or move chiral domains. Surprisingly, these domains are found to be stable, which might enable optically programmable quantum computers in the future.

TI Stabilized Classification Control using Multi-Stage Quantum
   Convolutional Neural Networks for Autonomous Driving
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Real-time processing with high classification accuracy is a fundamental requirement in autonomous driving systems. However, existing neural network models for classification often face a tradeoff between computational efficiency and accuracy, necessitating the development of advanced optimization methods to address this limitation. Additionally, dynamic driving environments offer opportunities to enhance classification performance by leveraging the principles of quantum computing, particularly the properties of superposition and entanglement. In response to these challenges, a multi-stage quantum convolutional neural network (MS-QCNN) approach is proposed, designed to improve image analysis performance by effectively utilizing the multi-stage structure of QCNN. A Lyapunov optimization framework is applied to achieve optimal performance, which maximizes time-averaged efficiency while ensuring system stability. This framework dynamically adjusts the MS-QCNN model in response to environmental variations, promoting enhanced queue stability and achieving optimal time-averaged performance.

TI Capturing many-body correlation effects with quantum and classical
   computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Theoretical descriptions of excited states of molecular systems in high-energy regimes are crucial for supporting and driving many experimental efforts at light source facilities. However, capturing their complicated correlation effects requires formalisms that provide a hierarchical infrastructure of approximations. These approximations lead to an increased overhead in classical computing methods and, therefore, decisions regarding the ranking of approximations and the quality of results must be made on purely numerical grounds. The emergence of quantum computing methods has the potential to change this situation. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency of the quantum phase estimator (QPE) in identifying core-level states relevant to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We compare and validate the QPE predictions with exact diagonalization and real-time equation-of-motion coupled-cluster formulations, which are some of the most accurate methods for states dominated by collective correlation effects.

TI Local control of superconductivity in a NbSe2/CrSBr van der
   Waals heterostructure
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional magnets and superconductors are emerging as tunable building-blocks for quantum computing and superconducting spintronic devices, and have been used to fabricate all two-dimensional versions of traditional devices, such as Josephson junctions. However, novel devices enabled by unique features of two-dimensional materials have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we present NbSe2/CrSBr van der Waals superconducting spin valves that exhibit infinite magnetoresistance and nonreciprocal charge transport. These responses arise from a unique metamagnetic transition in CrSBr, which controls the presence of localized stray fields suitably oriented to suppress the NbSe2 superconductivity in nanoscale regions and to break time reversal symmetry. Moreover, by integrating different CrSBr crystals in a lateral heterostructure, we demonstrate a superconductive spin valve characterized by multiple stable resistance states. Our results show how the unique physical properties of layered materials enable the realization of high-performance quantum devices based on novel working principles.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning for generative chemistry and
   drug design
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery. However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome with hybrid architectures combining quantum computers with deep classical networks. As the first step toward this goal, we built a compact discrete variational autoencoder (DVAE) with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) of reduced size in its latent layer. The size of the proposed model was small enough to fit on a state-of-the-art D-Wave quantum annealer and allowed training on a subset of the ChEMBL dataset of biologically active compounds. Finally, we generated 2331 novel chemical structures with medicinal chemistry and synthetic accessibility properties in the ranges typical for molecules from ChEMBL. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of using already existing or soon-to-be-available quantum computing devices as testbeds for future drug discovery applications.

TI Two-dimensional three-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The interactions between dipoles are called dipole-dipole interactions. One type of dipole-dipole interaction is van der Waals interaction. Similar to van der Waals interactions, the interactions between quadrupoles are called quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. Atoms can be treated not only as dipoles but also as quadrupoles. In this article, we study the quadrupole interactions between highly excited atoms or Rydberg atoms. In addition, unlike many other calculations, in which the primary focus was on the one-dimensional two-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, the primary aim of this article is to study the two-dimensional few-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. Specifically, the two-dimensional three-body interactions are investigated. This research has many applications, such as quadrupole-blockade for quantum computing, creating molecules based on quadrupole interactions, or quadrupole-quadrupole molecules.

TI An Algebraic Axiomatisation of ZX-calculus
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
CY SEP 08-10, 2021
CL Hagenberg, AUSTRIA
AB ZX-calculus is a graphical language for quantum computing which is complete in the sense that cal-culation in matrices can be done in a purely diagrammatic way. However, all previous universally complete axiomatisations of ZX-calculus have included at least one rule involving trigonometric functions such as sin and cos which makes it difficult for application purpose. In this paper we give an algebraic complete axiomatisation of ZX-calculus instead such that there are only ring operations involved for phases. With this algebraic axiomatisation of ZX-calculus, we are able to establish for the first time a simple translation of diagrams from another graphical language called ZH-calculus and to derive all the ZX-translated rules of ZH-calculus. As a consequence, we have a great ben-efit that all techniques obtained in ZH-calculus can be transplanted to ZX-calculus, which can't be obtained by just using the completeness of ZX-calculus.

TI Steady-state Fano coherences in a V-type system driven by polarized
   incoherent light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the properties of steady-state noise-induced (Fano) coherences generated in a three-level V-system continuously pumped by polarized incoherent light in the absence of coherent driving. By solving the nonsecular Bloch-Redfield quantum master equation, we obtain the ratio of the stationary coherences to excited-state populations, C = (1 + Delta(2)/gamma(r+gamma))(-1), which quantifies the impact of steady-state coherences on excited-state dynamical observables of the V-system. The ratio is maximized when the excited-state splitting Delta is small compared to either the spontaneous decay rate gamma or the incoherent pumping rate r. We demonstrate that while the detrimental effects of a strongly decohering environment generally suppress the coherence-to-population ratio by the factor similar or equal to gamma(d)/gamma, an intriguing regime exists where the C ratio displays a maximum as a function of the dephasing rate gamma(d). We attribute the surprising dephasing-induced enhancement of stationary Fano coherences to the environmental suppression of destructive interference of individual incoherent excitations generated at different times. We clarify the physical basis for the steady-state Fano coherence, whose imaginary part is identified with the nonequilibrium flux across a pair of qubits coupled to two independent thermal baths or, equivalently, the spontaneous emission flux from the right qubit to the right bath, unraveling a direct connection between the seemingly unrelated phenomena of incoherent driving of multilevel quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum transport in qubit networks. We further establish the equivalence between the two-qubit system and a V-system, each of whose transitions is driven simultaneously by both baths. The real part of the steady-state Fano coherence is found to be proportional to the deviation of excited-state populations from their values in thermodynamic equilibrium, making it possible to observe signatures of steady-state Fano coherences in excited-state populations. Finally, we put forward an experimental proposal for observing steady-state Fano coherences by detecting the total fluorescence signal emitted by Calcium atoms excited by polarized versus isotropic incoherent light. Our analysis paves the way toward further theoretical and experimental studies of nonequilibrium coherent steady states in thermally driven atomic and molecular systems and for the exploration of their potential role in quantum thermodynamics and in biological processes.

TI Direct growth of crystalline SiGe nanowires on superconducting NbTiN
   thin films
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Novel heterostructures created by coupling one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires with a superconducting thin film show great potential toward next-generation quantum computing. Here, by growing high-crystalline SiGe nanowires on a NbTiN thin film, the resulting heterostructure exhibits Ohmic characteristics as well as a shift of the superconducting transition temperature (T (c)). The structure was characterized at atomic resolution showing a sharp SiGe/NbTiN interface without atomic interdiffusion. Lattice spacing, as calculated from large-area x-ray diffraction experiments, suggests a potential preferred d-spacing matching between (200) NbTiN and (110) SiGe grains. The observed out-of-plane compressive strain within the NbTiN films coupled with SiGe nanowires explains the downward shift of the superconductivity behavior. The presented results post scientific insights toward functional heterostructures by coupling multi-dimensional materials, which could enable tunable superconductivity that benefits the quantum science applications.

TI Analysis and Enhancement of a Lattice-Based Data Outsourcing Scheme With

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING
AB Recently, Zhang et al. proposed a lattice-based data outsourcing scheme with public integrity verification (DOPIV), which enables an original data owner to delegate a proxy to generate the signatures of data and outsource them to the cloud server. They employed a third party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of the outsourced data and any TPA can verify the data integrity efficiently. DOPIV is claimed to achieve proxy-oriented secure data outsourcing as well as storage correctness guarantee. Unfortunately, we find that there exist vulnerabilities in DOPIV which allow the cloud server to simply delete the received data without being noticed by the TPA. Fortunately, we come up with a simple and efficient solution to thwart the proposed attack. Our improved scheme maintains all the features claimed in DOPIV.

TI Lattice-Based Self-Enhancement Authorized Accessible Privacy
   Authentication for Cyber-Physical Systems
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Healthcare cyber-physical system significantly facilitates healthcare services and patient treatment effectiveness by analyzing patients' health information data conveniently. Nevertheless, it also develops the threats to the confidentiality of health information, patients' privacy, and decidability of medical disputes. And, with the advances of quantum computing technology, most existing anonymous authentication schemes are becoming a growing threat to traditional cryptosystems. To address these problems, for healthcare cyber-physical systems, we propose a new lattice-based self-enhancement authorized accessible privacy authentication scheme by using a strong designated verifier double-authentication-preventing signature technique, called SEAPA. The SEAPA achieves three security and privacy requirements including unforgeability, anonymity for patients' information, and self-enhancement for patients themselves. A detailed security proof shows our proposal achieves those required security goals. Finally, our construction is demonstrated by parameter analysis and performance evaluation to have reasonable efficiency.

TI Motional Squeezing for Trapped Ion Transport and Separation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Transport, separation, and merging of trapped ion crystals are essential operations for most large-scale quantum computing architectures. In this Letter, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the dynamics of ions in time-varying potentials with a motional squeeze operator, followed by a motional displacement operator. Using this framework, we develop a new, general protocol for trapped ion transport, separation, and merging. We show that motional squeezing can prepare an ion wave packet to enable transfer from the ground state of one trapping potential to another. The framework and protocol are applicable if the potential is harmonic over the extent of the ion wave packets at all times. As illustrations, we discuss two specific operations: changing the strength of the confining potential for a single ion and separating same-species ions with their mutual Coulomb force. Both of these operations are, ideally, free of residual motional excitation.

TI TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM SPACE USING SPOOKY PEBBLING ∗
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB . Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.

TI A Threshold for Quantum Advantage in Derivative Pricing
SO QUANTUM
AB We give an upper bound on the resources required for valuable quantum advantage in pricing derivatives. To do so, we give the first complete resource estimates for useful quantum derivative pricing, using autocallable and Target Accrual Redemption Forward (TARF) derivatives as benchmark use cases. We uncover blocking challenges in known approaches and introduce a new method for quantum derivative pricing - the re-parameterization method - that avoids them. This method combines pre-trained variational circuits with fault-tolerant quantum computing to dramatically reduce resource requirements. We find that the benchmark use cases we examine require 8k logical qubits and a T-depth of 54 million. We estimate that quantum advantage would require executing this program at the order of a second. While the resource requirements given here are out of reach of current systems, we hope they will provide a roadmap for further improvements in algorithms, implementations, and planned hardware architectures.

TI Rigidity of Superdense Coding
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The famous superdense coding protocol of Bennett and Wiesner demonstrates that it is possible to communicate two bits of classical information by sending only one qubit and using a shared EPR pair. Our first result is that an arbitrary protocol for achieving this task (where there are no assumptions on the sender's encoding operations or the dimension of the shared entangled state) is locally equivalent to the canonical Bennett-Wiesner protocol. In other words, the superdense coding task is rigid. In particular, we show that the sender and receiver only use additional entanglement (beyond the EPR pair) as a source of classical randomness.
   We also investigate several questions about higher-dimensional superdense coding, where the goal is to communicate one of d(2) possible messages by sending a d-dimensional quantum state, for general dimensions d. Unlike the d = 2 case (i.e., sending a single qubit), there can be inequivalent superdense coding protocols for higher d. We present concrete constructions of inequivalent protocols, based on constructions of inequivalent orthogonal unitary bases for all d > 2. Finally, we analyze the performance of superdense coding protocols where the encoding operators are independently sampled from the Haar measure on the unitary group. Our analysis involves bounding the distinguishability of random maximally entangled states, which may be of independent interest.

TI Efficient quantum readout-error mitigation for sparse measurement
   outcomes of near-term quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The readout error on near-term quantum devices is one of the dominant noise factors, which can be mitigated by classical postprocessing called quantum readout error mitigation (QREM). The standard QREM applies the inverse of noise calibration matrix to the outcome probability distribution using exponential computational resources to the number of measured qubits. This becomes infeasible for the current quantum devices with tens of qubits or more. Here we propose two efficient QREM methods finishing in O(ns(2)) time for probability distributions of n qubits and s shots, which mainly aim at mitigating sparse probability distributions such that only a few states are dominant. We compare the proposed methods with several recent QREM methods in the following three cases: expectation values of the GHZ state, its fidelities, and the estimation error of maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) algorithm with a modified Grover iterator. The two cases of the GHZ state are on real IBM quantum devices, while the third is with numerical simulation. Using the proposed method, the mitigation of the 65-qubit GHZ state takes only a few seconds, and we witness the fidelity of the 29-qubit GHZ state exceeding 0.5. The proposed methods also succeed in reducing the estimation error in the MLAE algorithm, outperforming the results by other QREM methods in general.

TI Semi-quantum dialogue scheme based on hyperentangled Bell states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum dialogue enables two communicators to send their own secret information to each other, but most of the current quantum dialogue protocols have high requirements for the hardware equipment and capabilities of the communicators. In order to reduce the cost of participant, a semi-quantum dialogue scheme based on hyperentangled Bell states is studied in this paper. In our protocol, we combines the idea of semi-quantum key distribution and semi-quantum secure direct communication to realize the exchange of secret information between Alice and Bob, Alice's information is transmitted to Bob through semi-quantum secure direct communication, while Bob's message is extracted by Alice through semi-quantum key distribution and one-time pad encryption. This is different from the previous semi-quantum dialogue protocols, and is a new way of thinking. The security analysis shows that our protocol can not only resist the conventional attack strategies, but also has not the drawback of 'information leakage' problem. Compared with the existing semi-quantum dialogue protocols, it has some advantages, such as high communication efficiency, saving classical participant's consumption and security. Although this protocol requires the preparation and analysis of hyperentangled Bell state, which are slightly more complex, it will be shown that all these are achievable by current technology. Our protocol is fully implementable, so it has good application prospects.

TI CHECKING CONTINUOUS STOCHASTIC LOGIC AGAINST QUANTUM CONTINUOUS-TIME
   MARKOV CHAINS
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Verifying quantum systems has attracted a lot of interest in the last decades. In this paper, we study the quantitative model-checking of quantum continuous-time Markov chains (quantum CTMCs). The branching-time properties of quantum CTMCs are specified by continuous stochastic logic (CSL), which is well-known for verifying real-time systems, including classical CTMCs. The core of checking the CSL formulas lies in tackling multiphase until formulas. We develop an algebraic method using proper projection, matrix exponentiation, and definite integration to symbolically calculate the probability measures of path formulas. Thus the decidability of CSL is established. To be efficient, numerical methods are incorporated to guarantee that the time complexity is polynomial in the encoding size of the input model and linear in the size of the input formula. A running example of Apollonian networks is further provided to demonstrate our method.

TI Accelerated quantum circuit Monte Carlo simulation for heavy quark
   thermalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Thermalization of heavy quarks in the quark -gluon plasma is one of the most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction. The energy loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. Recent advances in quantum computing, in particular, quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), promise to provide a quadratic speedup in simulating stochastic processes. We introduce and formalize an accelerated quantum circuit Monte Carlo (aQCMC) framework to simulate heavy quark thermalization. With simplified drag and diffusion coefficients connected by Einstein 's relation, we simulate the thermalization of a heavy quark in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum simulator and compare that to thermal expectations. With Grover -like QAE, we calculate physical observables with quadratically fewer resources, which is a boost over the classical MC simulation that usually requires a large sampling number at the same estimation accuracy.

TI Innovative cryogenic cooling material using spin frustration from
   abundant elements
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cryogenic cooling technology is essential for modern applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging and quantum computing; however, it currently relies heavily on critical resources such as helium and heavy rare-earth elements. As demand for cryogenic cooling increases, developing alternative technologies that reduce reliance on these scarce resources is crucial. This study introduces regenerator materials from abundant elements-copper, iron, and aluminum-that function as Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocoolers. These materials achieve cryogenic cooling through the spin frustration effect, where competing magnetic interactions enhance magnetic heat capacity. CuFe1-xAlxO2 demonstrates effective cooling capacity at the helium condensation temperature comparable with that of conventional heavy rare-earth-based materials and surpasses the performance specifications of commercial GM cryocoolers. These findings demonstrate the potential of non-rare-earth magnetic materials for sustainable cryogenic technology, reducing dependence on critical resources.

Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus oneancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous Quantum phase estimation (QPE) demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, utilizing a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique toward molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified linear polyene simulations up to 21 qubits. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.

AB In this study, a simplified transformer model is used to predict the beam waist of 1,092 nm light coupled out from SiN-based mixed pitch gratings at various heights. The beam waists data at various heights above the grating is first compiled. Then, we used a sequence of the current beam waist values, z-positions, and the computed mathematical indicators (features) to predict the next beam waist value (labels). Optimized transformer model yields average percentage error (APE) of 6.6% between the predicted and actual beam waists, which corresponds to 93.4% prediction accuracy. This study provides a pioneering approach to using natural language processing model to perform predictive modelling on photonics data, and possible extrapolation of photonics data using transformer model.

Our study contributes to this goal by presenting a novel method for directly generating vector vortex beams from photonic crystal surface emitting lasers while preserving C-6 rotation symmetry. Our approach achieves topological charges of both +1 and -2, and we demonstrate the ability to dynamically switch between these orders by adjusting the injection conditions.

SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We give an adequate, concrete, categorical-based model for Lambda-${\mathcal S}$, which is a typed version of a linear-algebraic lambda calculus, extended with measurements. Lambda-${\mathcal S}$ is an extension to first-order lambda calculus unifying two approaches of non-cloning in quantum lambda-calculi: to forbid duplication of variables and to consider all lambda-terms as algebraic linear functions. The type system of Lambda-${\mathcal S}$ has a superposition constructor S such that a type A is considered as the base of a vector space, while SA is its span. Our model considers S as the composition of two functors in an adjunction relation between the category of sets and the category of vector spaces over $\mathbb C$. The right adjoint is a forgetful functor U, which is hidden in the language, and plays a central role in the computational reasoning.

Classification results are compared with a baseline of random guesses and predictions obtained with the traditional RDKit generated molecular descriptors. Chosen classification metrics show that results obtained with fragments quantum descriptors fall between results from baseline and those provided by molecular descriptors widely applied in cheminformatics. According to the results, the implementation of principal component analysis, causes a drop in categorization metrics.

AB Since the energy sector is the dominant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the decarbonization of energy systems is crucial for climate change mitigation. Two major challenges of energy systems decarbonization are renewable transition planning and sustainable systems operations. To address the challenges, incorporating emerging information and communication technologies can facilitate both the design and operations of future smart energy systems with high penetrations of renewable energy and decentralized structures. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of the applicability of emerging information and communication technologies in renewable transition and smart energy systems, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, next-generation communication technologies, and the metaverse. Relevant research directions are introduced through reviewing existing literature. This review concludes with a discussion of the industrial use cases and demonstrations of smart energy technologies.

TI ER = EPR is an operational theorem
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We show that in the operational setting of a two-agent, local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocol, Alice and Bob cannot operationally distinguish monogamous entanglement from a topological identification of points in their respective local spacetimes, i.e. that ER = EPR can be recovered as an operational theorem. Our construction immediately implies that in this operational setting, the local topology of spacetime is observer- relative. It also provides a simple demonstration of the non-traversability of ER bridges. As our construction does not depend on an embedding geometry, it generalizes previous geometric approaches to ER = EPR.

TI Harnessing DNA Nanotechnology and Chemistry for Applications in
   Photonics and Electronics
SO BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
AB Many photonic and electronic devices rely on nanotechnology and nanofabrication, but DNA-based approaches have yet to make a significant commercial impact in these fields even though DNA molecules are now well-established as versatile building blocks for nanostructures. As we describe here, DNA molecules can be chemically modified with a wide variety of functional groups enabling nanocargoes to be attached at precisely determined locations. DNA nanostructures can also be used as templates for the growth of inorganic structures. Together, these factors enable the use of DNA nanotechnology for the construction of many novel devices and systems. In this topical review, we discuss four case studies of potential applications in photonics and electronics: carbon nanotube transistors, devices for quantum computing, artificial electromagnetic materials, and enzymatic fuel cells. We conclude by speculating about the barriers to the exploitation of these technologies in real-world settings.

TI Topological Shiba bands in artificial spin chains on superconductors
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A major challenge in developing topological superconductors for implementing topological quantum computing is their characterization and control. It has been proposed that a p-wave-gapped topological superconductor can be fabricated with single-atom precision by assembling chains of magnetic atoms on s-wave superconductors with spin-orbit coupling. Here we analyse Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference in Mn chains, constructed atom by atom on Nb(110), and reveal the formation of multi-orbital Shiba bands using momentum-resolved measurements. We find evidence that one band features a topologically non-trivial p-wave gap, as inferred from its shape and particle-hole asymmetric intensity. Our work is an important step towards a distinct experimental determination of topological phases in multi-orbital systems by bulk electron band structure properties only.
   Chains of magnetic atoms on the surface of a superconductor are shown to have topologically non-trivial bands that could host Majorana bound states.

TI An all-epitaxial nitride heterostructure with concurrent quantum Hall
   effect and superconductivity
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Creating seamless heterostructures that exhibit the quantum Hall effect and superconductivity is highly desirable for future electronics based on topological quantum computing. However, the two topologically robust electronic phases are typically incompatible owing to conflicting magnetic field requirements. Combined advances in the epitaxial growth of a nitride superconductor with a high critical temperature and a subsequent nitride semiconductor heterostructure of metal polarity enable the observation of clean integer quantum Hall effect in the polarization-induced two-dimensional (2D) electron gas of the high-electron mobility transistor. Through individual magnetotransport measurements of the spatially separated GaN 2D electron gas and superconducting NbN layers, we find a small window of magnetic fields and temperatures in which the epitaxial layers retain their respective quantum Hall and superconducting properties. Its analysis indicates that in epitaxial nitride superconductor/semiconductor heterostructures, this window can be significantly expanded, creating an industrially viable platform for robust quantum devices that exploit topologically protected transport.

TI Magneto-optical trapping using planar optics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Laser-cooled atoms are a key technology for many calibration-free measurement platforms-including clocks, gyroscopes, and gravimeters-and are a promising system for quantum networking and quantum computing. The optics and vacuum hardware required to prepare these gases are often bulky and not amenable to large-volume manufacturing, limiting the practical realization of devices benefiting from the properties of cold atoms. Planar, lithographically produced optics including photonic integrated circuits, optical metasurfaces (MSs), and gratings offer a pathway to develop chip-scale, manufacturable devices utilizing cold atoms. As a demonstration of this technology, we have realized laser cooling of atomic Rb in a grating-type magneto-optical trap (MOT) using planar optics for beam launching, beam shaping, and polarization control. Efficient use of available light is accomplished using MS-enabled beam shaping, and the performance of the planar optics MOT is competitive with Gaussian-beam illuminated grating MOTs.

TI Second-harmonic generation in NbOI2-integrated silicon
   nitride microdisk resonators
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) niobium oxide dihalides (e.g., NbOI2) have garnered significant research interest in nonlinear photonics due to their prominent second-order nonlinear optical properties. Integrating these materials with high-quality-factor optical microcavities represents a crucial approach for developing high-performance on-chip nonlinear optical devices. This work demonstrates NbOI2-integrated silicon nitride (Si3N4) microdisk resonators that achieve second-harmonic generation under low-power (sub-milliwatt) continuous-wave laser pumping, leveraging the superior second-order nonlinearity of NbOI2 and the strong optical field confinement capability of Si3N4 microdisks. The conversion efficiency of the device is calculated to be about 0.024 %/W. The intrinsic lack of inversion symmetry in NbOI2 crystals avoids the laborious layer-number-dependent symmetry screening typically required for other 2D materials, while the developed van der Waals transfer technique provides a universal strategy for integrating niobium oxide dihalides with photonic microcavities. This study not only establishes a material-photon co-design strategy for on-chip nonlinear light sources but also lays a critical foundation for advancing quantum photonic chips and on-chip metrology systems.

TI Waveguiding and Lasing in 2D Organic Semiconductor Znq2
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Organic semiconductors have been proven as emerging platforms for exploring strong light-matter interactions and quantum optics so as to develop coherent and quantum photonic devices. Though there has been abundant research on organic semiconductors, lasing action is rarely reported in individual 2D organic semiconductor waveguides or nanocavities. Herein, a strong optical waveguiding phenomenon is observed not only in the individual 2D organic semiconductor Znq(2) nanosheet with micrometer size area, but also in the interconnecting or neighboring Znq(2) nanosheets. The optical propagation loss coefficient of the interconnecting Znq(2) sheets is approximate to 800dBcm(-1). More importantly, the phenomenon of optically pumped lasing in 2D Znq(2) nanosheets is demonstrated, as evidenced by a sudden increase in emission intensity at a threshold pump pulse fluence of 49.9Wcm(-2) at 480nm. As verified by numerical FDTD simulations, the Znq(2) nanosheet constitutes a microcavity that supports whisper gallery mode, providing suffcient feedback for laser oscillations. Herein, the coexistence of low-loss waveguiding and excellent lasing in 2D organic semiconductor nanosheets are revealed, which open up a new pathway for photonics and quantum optics based on 2D organic semiconductors.

TI Sub-0.1 degree phase locking of a single-photon interferometer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a single-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer stabilized to a phase precision of 0.05 degrees over 15 hours. To lock the phase, we employ an auxiliary reference light at a different wavelength than the quantum signal. The developed phase locking operates continuously, with negligible crosstalk, and for an arbitrary phase of the quantum signal. Moreover, its performance is independent of intensity fluctuations of the reference. Since the presented method can be used in a vast majority of quantum interferometric networks it can significantly improve phase-sensitive applications in quantum communication and quantum metrology.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Design and Optimization of a Hybrid Design for Quantum Transduction
SO SENSORS
AB This study presents the mechanical design and analysis of a quantum electro-optical transducer engineered to operate at millikelvin temperatures within a dilution refrigerator. The transducer enables bidirectional microwave-optical frequency conversion through a hybrid architecture that integrates a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity with an electro-optic optical cavity. Among several design options investigated, the configuration offering the best thermal and mechanical performance was selected, yielding a robust solution with reduced sensitivity to fabrication tolerances, improved heat dissipation, as well as alignment precision. The design ensures uniform temperature distribution, enabling higher laser pump powers and, thus, increased conversion efficiency, while maintaining mechanical stresses safely below the material yield strength. Electromagnetic simulations further validate the design, demonstrating enhanced coupling between the optical and microwave modes, as well as a broader tuning range achieved with smaller tuner displacements.

TI Multi-parameter control in fs-laser written waveguides: enhancing loss
   and coupling characteristics via exposure tuning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Recently, femtosecond laser direct-written (FLDW) waveguides have garnered significant attention due to their true 3D structuring, rapid fabrication, and flexibility in material selection. However, controlling the evanescent field ratio (EFR) of waveguide and its loss characteristics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a loss estimation method based on the evanescent field intensity distribution, enabling rapid evaluation of coupling and propagation losses by analyzing the evanescent field size and leaking mode excitation. We demonstrate continuous tuning of the waveguide mode-field size from 5.04 mu m to 18.42 mu m, and EFR range from 25% to 96%. This method offers potential improvements in FLDW waveguide performance and could benefit applications in nonlinear optics, biosensing, photonic integrated circuits, quantum computing, and micro-optical imaging.

TI Practical techniques for high-precision measurements on near-term
   quantum hardware and applications in molecular energy estimation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Achieving high-precision measurements on near-term quantum devices is critical for advancing quantum computing applications. Quantum computers suffer from high readout errors, making quantum simulations with high accuracy requirements particularly challenging. This paper implements practical techniques to reach accuracies essential for quantum chemistry by addressing key overheads and noise sources. Specifically, we leverage locally biased random measurements for reducing shot overhead, repeated settings with parallel quantum detector tomography for reducing circuit overhead and mitigating readout errors, and blended scheduling for mitigating time-dependent noise. We demonstrate these techniques via molecular energy estimation of the BODIPY molecule on a Hartree-Fock state on an IBM Eagle r3, obtaining a reduction in measurement errors by an order of magnitude from 1-5% to 0.16%. These strategies pave the way for more reliable quantum computations, particularly for applications requiring precise molecular energy calculations.

TI SPIN ALGEBRA AND NAIMARK'S EXTENSION: A TUTORIAL APPROACH WITH EXAMPLES
SO EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In analyzing two-electron systems, the interactions of interest often include the spin-spin operator S-1(->) <middle dot> S-1(->) and the spin-orbit operator L--> <middle dot> S-->. When these operators act on entangled or indistinguishable particles, their measurement and physical interpretation may extend beyond the standard projective framework. This tutorial introduces the algebraic structure of spin interactions in two electron quantum systems and establishes its conceptual and mathematical connection with Naimark's Extension Theorem. Through explicit examples for two-electron systems, we demonstrate how spin operators arise in reduced Hilbert spaces, and how Naimark's theorem provides a formal framework for extending them to projective measurements in enlarged spaces. The application of Naimark's Extension Theorem in deriving their matrix elements opens up a window into the structure of quantum measurements in such composite systems.

TI A new type of cyclotron resonance from charge-impurity scattering in the
   bulk-insulating Bi2Se3 thin films
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This work focuses on the low frequency Drude response of bulk-insulating topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 films. The frequency and field dependence of the mobility and carrier density are measured simultaneously via time-domain terahertz spectroscopy. These films are grown on buffer layers, capped by Se, and have been exposed in air for months. Under a magnetic field up to 7 Tesla, we observe prominent cyclotron resonances (CRs). We attribute the sharp CR to two different topological surface states from both surfaces of the films. The CR sharpens at high fields due to an electron-impurity scattering. By using magneto-terahertz spectroscopy, we confirm that these films are bulk-insulating, which paves the way to use intrinsic TIs without bulk carriers for applications including topological spintronics and quantum computing.

By coupling a 45 degrees linearly polarized pump laser into the waveguide, both SPDC processes are concurrently excited: type-0 SPDC process is facilitated via third-order quasi-phase matching (QPM) utilizing the nonlinear coefficient d33, while type-II SPDC process employs first-order QPM with the nonlinear coefficient d24. This dual-SPDC scheme holds potential for applications in quantum communication protocols targeting the telecommunication wavelength.

TI Complete analysis of hyperentangled Bell state in three degrees of
   freedom using Kerr effect and self-assisted mechanism
SO LASER PHYSICS
AB We present an efficient scheme for the complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis (HBSA) of photon system with polarization and two longitudinal momentum degrees of freedom (DOFs), resorting to weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity, linear optical elements and single photon detectors. In the process of distinguishing the 64 hyperentangled Bell states in three DOFs, the self-assisted mechanism is embedded, which makes our scheme simple and realizable. Moreover, we have discussed the applications of this complete HBSA scheme for high-capacity quantum communication protocols that are based on photonic hyperentanglement in three DOFs.

TI Silicon photonics integrated dynamic polarization controller
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB We designed and demonstrated experimentally a silicon photonics integrated dynamic polarization controller. The overall size of the dynamic polarization controller on chip is 2.830 mm x 0.210 mm x 1 mm. The modulation bandwidth is 30 kHz. By using a variable step simulated annealing approach, we achieve a dynamic polarization extinction ratio greater than 25 dB. A numerical simulation method was used to optimize the relevant parameters of the dynamic polarization controller. It is expected that the dynamic polarization controller can be utilized in fiber communication systems or silicon photonics integrated quantum communication systems to minimize the size and decrease the cost further.

TI Visualizing designer quantum states in stable macrocycle quantum corrals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Creating atomically-precise quantum architectures with high digital fidelity and desired quantum states is an important goal for quantum technology applications. Here the authors devise an on-surface synthetic protocol to construct atomically-precise covalently linked organic quantum corrals with the formation of a series of new quantum resonance states.
   Creating atomically precise quantum architectures with high digital fidelity and desired quantum states is an important goal in a new era of quantum technology. The strategy of creating these quantum nanostructures mainly relies on atom-by-atom, molecule-by-molecule manipulation or molecular assembly through non-covalent interactions, which thus lack sufficient chemical robustness required for on-chip quantum device operation at elevated temperature. Here, we report a bottom-up synthesis of covalently linked organic quantum corrals (OQCs) with atomic precision to induce the formation of topology-controlled quantum resonance states, arising from a collective interference of scattered electron waves inside the quantum nanocavities. Individual OQCs host a series of atomic orbital-like resonance states whose orbital hybridization into artificial homo-diatomic and hetero-diatomic molecular-like resonance states can be constructed in Cassini oval-shaped OQCs with desired topologies corroborated by joint ab initio and analytic calculations. Our studies open up a new avenue to fabricate covalently linked large-sized OQCs with atomic precision to engineer desired quantum states with high chemical robustness and digital fidelity for future practical applications.

TI Supercell-based metasurfaces for arbitrary polarization beam splitting:
   physics-informed U-Net design with high extinction ratio
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Due to the growing demand for advanced polarization control in photonic systems, a physical information-inspired deep learning approach for arbitrary polarization-multiplexed metasurface-based beam splitter designs is presented. By decomposing target far-field patterns into orthogonal right-handed circular polarization/left-handed circular polarization components, our modified U-Net architecture embeds wave propagation physics to efficiently recover phase distributions (MSE = 4.3 x 10(-3)). The proposed silicon nanopillar supercell design achieves completed Jones matrix decoupling, enabling independent control of orthogonal polarization states through geometric parameters and PB phase modulation. FDTD simulations illustrated performances with 34.11 dB polarization extinction ratio and 63.91% transmission efficiency. This method offers a compact, efficient design framework for advanced polarization-control devices applications of integrated photonics, optical communications, and quantum computing.

TI Superconducting penetration depth of aluminum thin films
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a study of the superconducting penetration depth lambda in aluminum thin films of varying thickness. The range of thicknesses chosen spans from the thin-film regime to the regime approaching bulk behavior. The penetration depths observed range from lambda=163 +/- 1nm for the thinnest 28 nm samples down to lambda=58 +/- 1nm for the 207 nm-thick ones, allowing us to provide an estimate of the thickness at which aluminum becomes a type-I superconductor. In order to accurately determine lambda, we performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting LC resonators obtained through novel and efficient methods of fitting and simulation, as well as the normal-state resistance of meandered structures. Both methods yield comparable results, providing a well-characterized set of values of lambda in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such as quantum computing and microwave radiation detector technologies.

TI Krylov complexity and Trotter transitions in unitary circuit dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of "Krylov complexity," a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.

TI Decoding algorithms for Goppa codes with errors and erasures
SO IZVESTIYA OF SARATOV UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS MECHANICS INFORMATICS
AB In 1978, McEliece built the first public key cryptosystem based on error-correcting codes. This cryptosystem based on Goppa codes is considered promising and cryptographically stable, taking into account quantum computing. At the same time, effective attacks on the secret keys of this cryptosystem have not yet been found. In the paper, algorithms for decoding Goppa codes in the case of errors and erasures are investigated. Four decoding algorithms based on the algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes proposed by Gao, Berlekamp and Massey, Sugiyama, and others are given. The first two algorithms are based on Gao algorithm and related to syndrome-free decoding algorithms, the rest are related to syndrome decoding algorithms. Moreover, any of these algorithms is also applicable for the case of a communication channel with errors only. Examples of decoding separable Goppa codes using these algorithms are also given.

TI Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator-a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin-orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH-based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana-based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

These systems have become essential for addressing modern computational demands, offering enhanced processing power, scalability, and resource efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of parallel and distributed systems, exploring their interrelationships, their key distinctions, and the emerging trends shaping their evolution. We analyse four parallel computing paradigms-heterogeneous computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and optical computing-and examine emerging distributed systems such as blockchain, serverless computing, and cloud-native architectures. The associated challenges are highlighted, and potential future directions are outlined. This work serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to stay informed about trends in parallel and distributed computing while understanding the challenges and future developments in the field.

TI Gate-tunable phase transition in a resonator-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
   chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Metamaterials engineered to host topological states of matter in controllable quantum systems hold promise for the advancement of quantum simulations and quantum computing technologies. In this context, the SuSchrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has gained prominence due to its simplicity and practical applications. Here we present the implementation of a gate-tunable, five-unit-cell resonator-based SSH chain on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting resonators. We achieve electrostatic control over the inductive intracell coupling using semiconductor nanowire junctions, which enables the spectroscopic observation of a transition from a trivial to a topological phase in the engineered metamaterial. In contrast to prior work, our approach offers precise and independent in situ tuning of the coupling parameters, which is critical to directly approximate ideal tightbinding Hamiltonians via the control over local variables. Our results supplement efforts towards gate-controlled superconducting electronics and large controllable resonator-based lattices to enable quantum simulations.

TI Magnetic field optimization for long-lived entanglement in quantum spin
   systems
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This work proposes a method for stabilizing entanglement in Heisenberg spin dimers by optimizing time-varying magnetic fields. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on static configurations, the method adapts the magnetic field in real-time using simulated annealing, addressing oscillatory degradation of entanglement. This dynamic control approach aims to extend coherence times and improve the stability of high-concurrence states, offering a potentially more robust solution for quantum communication and computation. The approach complements existing findings by focusing on the longevity and coherence of entanglement, rather than its generation or distribution, providing an alternative to conventional fixed-field methods and contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance entanglement stability in quantum systems.

We show some new results on the dilation property for g-frame generator sets for unitary groups and projective unitary representations. In particular, by using complete wandering operators, several properties of g-frame generators for projective unitary representations have been obtained. Moreover, we explore some characterizations of the g-frame generator dual pairs.

TI The van der Waals antiferromagnetic proximity effect at the
   FePS3/Pt uncompensated interface
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulators are emerging as promising candidates for spintronics and quantum computing due to their unique magnetic properties. However, detecting antiferromagnetism at the atomic scale remains challenging due to compensated spin order. In this study, we present a novel approach to observe the antiferromagnetic proximity effect in FePS3/Pt heterostructures. This effect arises from interfacial magnetic moments, which induce significant spin polarization in the Pt layer via strong interlayer exchange interactions. As a result, a pronounced anomalous Hall effect is observed in the Pt layer. Fe atom vacancies at the FePS3/Pt interface play a critical role in creating localized surface magnetic moments and enhancing exchange interactions. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between two-dimensional antiferromagnetic insulators and heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling, providing a promising strategy to exploit interfacial effects for creating magnetization in antiferromagnetic materials.

At a high level, we achieve these results by combining classical algorithmic frameworks with quantum subroutines. Additionally, we characterize the constants and logarithmic factors involved in our algorithms as well as related classical algorithms, otherwise obscured by (O) over tilde notation, revealing that advances are needed to render both the quantum and classical algorithms practical.

TI Recent progresses in two-dimensional Ising superconductivity
SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS
AB Ever since its first discovery in 1911, superconductivity, which is an ordered phase of electronic state, has been regarded as one of the most fascinating topics in modern physics. Recently, remarkable advances in sample fabrication have greatly promoted the research of superconductivity, especially in the field of two-dimensional (2D) materials, where 2D Ising superconductors have sparked immense interests for their unique properties, holding promise in engineering topological superconductivity. In this review, we summarize recent works on both experimental and theoretical studies of 2D Ising superconductivity, with particular attention to the origin of Ising superconductivity as well as their novel properties. We conclude with a discussion of how these unconventional 2D Ising superconductors can play a role in the investigation of topological superconductivity, which is of potential in quantum computing.

TI Sub- and supersonic elastic waves in an annular hole phononic
   metamaterial
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are used in a wide range of applications including sensing and microfluidics, and are now being developed for applications such as quantum computing. As with photonics, and other electromagnetic radiation, metamaterials offer an exciting route to control and manipulate SAW propagation, which could lead to new device concepts and paradigms. In this work we demonstrate that a phononic metamaterial comprising an array of annular hole resonators can be used to realise frequency control of SAW velocity. We show, using simulations and experiment, that metamaterial patterning on a lithium niobate substrate allows control of SAW phase velocities to values slower and faster than the velocity in an unpatterned substrate; namely, to similar to 85% and similar to 130% of the unpatterned SAW velocity, respectively. This approach could lead to novel designs for SAW devices, such as delay lines and chirp filters, but could also be applied to other elastic waves.

TI Continuous-Variable Designs and Design-Based Shadow Tomography from
   Random Lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of latticelike quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design for an n-mode system. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.

TI Recent progress on cryogenic magnetocaloric materials
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Cryogenic magnetocaloric materials (MCMs) attract growing attention for solid-state refrigeration technologies, especially in sub-Kelvin applications such as quantum computing and space exploration. Among various candidates, rare-earth-based compounds containing Gd3+ and Eu2+ ions exhibit remarkable magnetocaloric effects due to their large spin (J = S = 7/2 and L = 0), weak magnetic anisotropy, and tunable magnetic interactions. This review summarizes recent progress on the structure-property-performance of representative Gd3+/Eu2+-based compounds, including fluorides, phosphates, hydroxides, halides, and metal-organic frameworks. Key design principles are proposed for optimizing cryogenic MCMs, including high magnetic ion concentration, weak or single-ion magnetic coupling, and suppressed magnetic ordering. Finally, we also discuss spin supersolid materials Na2BaCo(PO4)2, which exhibits excellent adiabatic demagnetization cooling temperature below 100 mK, and look into the future of cryogenic magnetocaloric materials and the emerging quantum magnetic phenomena.

TI Signatures of quantum spin liquid state and unconventional transport in
   thin film TbInO3
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum spin liquids, where the frustrated magnetic ground state hosts highly entangled spins resisting long-range order to 0 K, are exotic quantum magnets proximate to unconventional superconductivity and candidate platforms for topological quantum computing. Although several quantum spin liquid material candidates have been identified, thin films crucial for device fabrication and further tuning of properties remain elusive. Recently, hexagonal TbInO3 has emerged as a quantum spin liquid candidate which also hosts improper ferroelectricity and exotic high-temperature carrier transport. Here, we synthesize thin films of TbInO3 and characterize their magnetic and electronic properties. Our films present a highly frustrated magnetic ground state without long-range order to 0.4 K, consistent with bulk crystals. We further reveal a rich ferroelectric domain structure and unconventional non-local transport near room temperature, suggesting hexagonal TbInO3 as a promising candidate for realizing exotic magnetic and transport phenomena in epitaxial heterostructures.

TI Four-Photon Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier
SO INSTRUMENTS AND EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES
AB Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers can have high gain and wide frequency range, high sensitivity, and low noise, which makes them promising for quantum computing, array receiver readout systems, spectroscopy, single-photon detectors, etc. In this paper, the authors investigate samples of traveling wave parametric amplifiers based on a three-layer Nb/AlOx/Nb superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) structure with a SNAIL (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive Elements) series array. Each SNAIL cell consists of the kinetic inductance of four SIS junctions and the nonlinear inductance of a smaller SIS junction. The cells are alternately connected in antiphase with respect to the magnetic flux, which ensures a change in the sign of the Kerr nonlinearity and a reduction in the phase mismatch for the pump frequency, signal frequency, and idler frequency. The transmission spectra of the samples were measured at temperatures of 4.2 and 2.8 K in the frequency range of 0.1-6 GHz.

TI Low-noise cryogenic microwave amplifier characterization with a
   calibrated noise source
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Parametric amplifiers have become a workhorse in superconducting quantum computing; however, research and development of these devices has been hampered by inconsistent and, sometimes, misleading noise performance characterization methodologies. The concepts behind noise characterization are deceptively simple, and there are many places where one can make mistakes, either in measurement or in interpretation and analysis. In this article, we cover the basics of noise performance characterization and the special problems it presents in parametric amplifiers with limited power handling capability. We illustrate the issues with three specific examples: a high-electron mobility transistor amplifier, a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier, and a Josephson parametric amplifier. We emphasize the use of a 50-Omega shot noise tunnel junction (SNTJ) as a broadband noise source, demonstrating its utility for cryogenic amplifier amplifications. These practical examples highlight the role of loss as well as the additional parametric amplifier "idler" input mode.

TI Modification of the Emission Spectrum of a Quantum Emitter in the
   Vicinity of Bismuth Chalcogenide Microparticles
SO PHOTONICS
AB We examine theoretically the effect of bismuth chalcogenide microparticles on the spontaneous emission of a double-V-type quantum emitter in free space. We have found, in particular, that the presence of a single microparticle causes a high degree of quantum interference in the way the quantum emitter releases energy in the process of spontaneous emission. This, in turn, leads to significant changes in the spectrum of the emitted energy. The quantum emitter's initial state is crucial to how the energy is released in the presence of the microparticle. This observation has potential implications for quantum computing, particularly for reading the state of atomic qubits. When two microparticles are present, the effect is more pronounced, particularly when the quantum emitter is located in the gap between the particles.

TI Designing exceptional-point-based graphs yielding topologically
   guaranteed quantum search
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum walks underlie an important class of quantum computing algorithms, and represent promising ap-proaches in various simulations and practical applications. Here we design stroboscopically monitored quantum walks and their subsequent graphs that can naturally boost target searches. We show how to construct walks with the property that all the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian survival operator, describing the mixed effects of unitary dynamics and the back-action of measurement, coalesce to zero, corresponding to an exceptional point whose degree is the size of the system. Generally, the resulting search is guaranteed to succeed in a bounded time for any initial condition, which is faster than classical random walks or quantum walks on typical graphs. We then show how this efficient quantum search is related to a quantized topological winding number and further discuss the connection of the problem to an effective massless Dirac particle.

TI Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, tunneling magnetoresistance and
   spin-transfer torque effect in magnetic tunnel junctions with Nb layers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nb and its compounds are widely used in quantum computing due to their high superconducting transition temperatures and high critical fields. Devices that combine superconducting performance and spintronic non-volatility could deliver unique functionality. Here we report the study of magnetic tunnel junctions with Nb as the heavy metal layers. An interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density of 1.85 mJ/m(2) was obtained in Nb/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures. The tunneling magnetoresistance was evaluated in junctions with different thickness combinations and different annealing conditions. An optimized magnetoresistance of 120% was obtained at room temperature, with a damping parameter of 0.011 determined by ferromagnetic resonance. In addition, spin-transfer torque switching has also been successfully observed in these junctions with a quasistatic switching current density of 7.3 x 10(5) A/cm(2).

TI Localized statistics decoding for quantum low-density parity-check codes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing with considerably reduced overhead compared to the surface code. However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.

TI Enantioselective Se lattices for stable chiroptoelectronic processing
   media
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Chiroptoelectronic devices are crucial for applications in quantum computing, spin optical communications, and magnetic recording. However, the limited efficiency and low stability of conventional circularly polarized light (CPL)-sensing materials have restricted their broader use. Here, we introduce atomic chiral Se nanorod (NRs) films as broadband CPL detectors, leveraging the intrinsic chirality and stability of Se nanocrystals. We also perform incident circular polarization (ICP)-Raman optical activity (ROA) to explore the chiroptical activity of the large-area films. The Se NRs thin films detected CPL across a broad range from ultraviolet (UV) to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), with a responsivity dissymmetry factor of up to 0.4, maintaining high stability under ambient conditions for longer than 13 months. CPL-sensitive Se NRs with intrinsic chirality have potential applications in chiral photonic synapses, chiral spin devices, and CPL-sensitive photocatalysts. ICP-ROA mapping also advances the analysis of 2D chiral materials.

TI A Potential-Based Quantization Procedure of the Damped Oscillator
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Today, two of the most prosperous fields of physics are quantum computing and spintronics. In both, the loss of information and dissipation play a crucial role. In the present work, we formulate the quantization of the dissipative oscillator, which aids the understanding of the abovementioned issues, and creates a theoretical frame to overcome these issues in the future. Based on the Lagrangian framework of the damped spring system, the canonically conjugated pairs and the Hamiltonian of the system are obtained; then, the quantization procedure can be started and consistently applied. As a result, the damping quantum wave equation of the dissipative oscillator is deduced, and an exact damping wave solution of this equation is obtained. Consequently, we arrive at an irreversible quantum theory by which the quantum losses can be described.

TI Fully Integrated Silicon Photonic Erbium-Doped Nanodiode for Few Photon
   Emission at Telecom Wavelengths
SO MATERIALS
AB Recent advancements in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols opened the chance to exploit nonlaser sources for their implementation. A possible solution might consist in erbium-doped light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are able to produce photons in the third communication window, with a wavelength around 1550 nm. Here, we present silicon LEDs based on the electroluminescence of Er:O complexes in Si. Such sources are fabricated with a fully-compatible CMOS process on a 220 nm-thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, the common standard in silicon photonics. The implantation depth is tuned to match the center of the silicon layer. The erbium and oxygen co-doping ratio is tuned to optimize the electroluminescence signal. We fabricate a batch of Er:O diodes with surface areas ranging from 1 mu m x 1 mu m to 50 mu m x 50 mu m emitting 1550 nm photons at room temperature. We demonstrate emission rates around 5 x 10(6) photons/s for a 1 mu m x 1 mu m device at room temperature using superconducting nanowire detectors cooled at 0.8 K. The demonstration of Er:O diodes integrated in the 220 nm SOI platform paves the way towards the creation of integrated silicon photon sources suitable for arbitrary-statistic-tolerant QKD protocols.

TI Chiral Polarization Amplification Through Stimulated Emission in Halide
   Perovskite
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Circularly polarized light source has broad application prospects in 3D display, information storage, spintronics, quantum computing, and anti-counterfeiting. Currently, circularly polarized light is obtained by filtering at least half of photons using polarizer and quarter-wave plates, which isn't an efficient process. One approach to address this issue is to develop light sources that directly emit circularly polarized light; however, emission states with different polarizations are nearly degenerate in chiral luminous materials, and therefore the emission polarization is low. Here, it is proposed to amplify the marginal difference in spin polarization through stimulated emission. Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) are fabricated with Ma2Pb3Br10 having chiral organic ligands, and achieved certain circular polarization output modes, which depends on the ligand's chirality. Furthermore, it is founded there is a synergistic enhancement in lasing polarization between the chirality of ligands and excitation polarization of laser light.

TI Enhancing quantum coherence in multiqubit-interacting system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a quantum coherence protection scheme for a two-qubit system by considering the exact evolution of multi-interacting qubits in a common reservoir. We find that the l 1 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence can be noticeably enhanced by increasing the number of qubits in the weak/strong system-environment coupling regime, which contrasts sharply with the impact of coupling between qubits. Moreover, in the infinite-time limit, all the coherence measures reach their steady values which are determined only by the number of qubits.

TI Exploring Pulsar Glitches with Dipolar Supersolids
SO FEW-BODY SYSTEMS
AB Glitches are sudden spin-up events that interrupt the gradual spin-down of rotating neutron stars. They are believed to arise from the rapid unpinning of vortices in the neutron star inner crust. The analogy between the inner crust of neutron stars and dipolar supersolids allows to investigate glitches. Employing such analogy, we numerically analyze the vortex trapping mechanism and how the matter density distribution influences glitches. These results pave the way for the quantum simulation of celestial bodies in laboratories.

TI Solid-state reactions at niobium-germanium interfaces in hybrid quantum
   electronics
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials systems are promising candidates for quantum computing applications. Their integration into superconducting electronics has enabled on-demand voltage tunability at millikelvin temperatures. Ge quantum wells have been among the semiconducting platforms interfaced with superconducting Al to realize voltage tunable Josephson junctions. Here, we explore Nb as a superconducting material in direct contact with Ge channels by focusing on the solid-state reactions at the Nb/Ge interfaces. We employ Nb evaporation at cryogenic temperatures (similar to 100 K) to establish a baseline structure with atomically and chemically abrupt Nb/Ge interfaces. By conducting systematic photoelectron spectroscopy and transport measurements on Nb/Ge samples across varying annealing temperatures, we elucidated the influence of Ge out-diffusion on the ultimate performance of superconducting electronics. This study underlines the need for low-temperature growth to minimize chemical intermixing and band bending at the Nb/Ge interfaces.

TI Stochastic Adder Circuits with Improved Entropy Output
SO ENTROPY
AB Random pulse computing (RPC), the third paradigm along with digital and quantum computing, draws inspiration from biology, particularly the functioning of neurons. Here, we study information processing in random pulse computing circuits intended for the summation of numbers. Based on the information-theoretic merits of entropy budget and relative Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, we investigate the prior art and propose new circuits: three deterministic adders with significantly improved output entropy and one exact nondeterministic adder that requires much less additional entropy than the previous art. All circuits are realized and tested experimentally, using quantum entropy sources and reconfigurable logic devices. Not only the proposed circuits yield a precise mathematical result and have output entropy near maximum, which satisfies the need for building a programmable random pulse computer, but also they provide affordable hardware options for generating additional entropy.

TI Improvement of the Efficiency of Neural Cryptography-Based Secret Key
   Exchange Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Owing to new security threats and relevant changes in network computing environments, key exchange methods that replace conventional public key exchange algorithms are being researched. The neural cryptography-based key exchange algorithm proposed recently uses neural synchronization as an alternative to public-key methods. However, the learning-based synchronization method uses considerable communication resources to generate output values and share the results. The efficiency of this method depends on the type of algorithm and is affected by both the communication rounds for exchanging output values and the number of weight learning rounds. To improve its efficiency, this paper proposes 1-h random walk and batch scheme methods and verifies their efficiency and security.

AB In computer engineering, logic synthesis is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates. Historically, logic synthesis was tightly related to the physical implementation of the logic gates. Nowadays, pushed by the forecasted end of Moore's law, several emerging technologies (e.g., nanodevices, optical computing, quantum computing) are candidates to either replace or co-exist with the de facto standard CMOS technology. The main consequence of the rising of those emerging technologies is that the logic synthesis has to face new issues and, at the same time, exploits new opportunities. The goal of this paper is thus to present three emerging technologies (Vertical Nanowire Field Effect Transistors, Ferroelectric Transistors, and Memristors), how to use them to implement logic gates, and the main challenges and issues for the logic synthesis.

TI Feasibility of C-Band Converged Satellite-Fibre QKD Links Through
   Telescope-to-SMF Coupling
SO IET OPTOELECTRONICS
AB This study presents a comprehensive feasibility analysis of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground downlink communication for quantum key distribution (QKD), focusing on 1550 nm wavelength. This wavelength is selected for its compatibility with terrestrial fibre-optic networks, allowing the distribution of quantum keys over extended distances. The analysis models a discrete variable decoy state BB84 protocol, emphasising the system's design requirements for the optical ground station (OGS) receiver, including critical parameters that affect single-mode fibre (SMF) coupling efficiency. Through extended simulations, we assess atmospheric conditions, turbulence effects and adaptive optics (AO) correction to evaluate their impact on light coupling efficiency and achievable key rates. Results highlight the advantage of AO in sustaining secure key rates, particularly under high-elevation satellite passes, and quantify the key volumes attainable across varying levels of turbulence and additional fibre transmission losses. Our findings demonstrate that LEO satellite-based QKD downlinks can be feasibly integrated with terrestrial fibre systems, supporting secure key distribution over potentially large geographic areas without requiring OGSs to be trusted nodes. The results of this work provide practical insights into the technical requirements and configurations needed to realise robust satellite-to-ground QKD links, laying a foundation for future advancements in global quantum-secure communication infrastructure.

TI Designing molecular qubits: computational insights into first-row and
   group 6 transition metal complexes
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB In the realm of optically addressable qubits, a previously synthesized and characterized Cr(iv) pseudo-tetrahedral complex, featuring four strongly donating ligands surrounding the chromium center, has demonstrated potential as a qubit candidate. This study proposes analogs of this complex through a metal substitution strategy, extending the investigation to different complexes based on metal centers selected from first-row and Group 6 transition metals. Computational modeling based on multiconfigurational methods CASPT2 and MC-PDFT was utilized to calculate energy gaps between ground and excited electronic spin states, and zero-field splitting parameters. Simulations were applied to each equilibrium geometry and related deformations based on vibrational modes. All results align with previous experimental findings, but also show that qubits based on V and Ti centers could be more electronically stable than the Cr one, suggesting a lower electronic features dependency from their related geometry. In some cases geometrical deformations provide changes in relative energy gaps between triplet and singlet excited state, that could potentially swap, offering a different initialization process, and some inspiration for ligand design based on such deformations. Additionally, this study identifies an unsynthesized Ti(ii) compound as a promising candidate for molecular qubits. This finding highlights the role of computational multireference methods in the rational design of qubit systems.

TI Theoretical methods to design and test quantum simulators for the
   compact Abelian Higgs model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The lattice compact Abelian Higgs model is a nonperturbative regularized formulation of low-energy scalar quantum electrodynamics. In 1 + 1 dimensions, this model can be quantum simulated using a ladder-shaped optical lattice with Rydberg-dressed atoms [J. Zhanget al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 223201 (2018)]. In this setup, one spatial dimension is used to carry the angular momentum of the quantum rotors. One can use truncations corresponding to spin-2 and spin-1 to build local Hilbert spaces associated with the links of the lattice. We argue that ladder-shaped configurable arrays of Rydberg atoms can be used for the same purpose. We make concrete proposals involving two and three Rydberg atoms to build one local spin-1 space (a qutrit). We show that the building blocks of the Hamiltonian calculations are models with one and two spins. We compare target and simulators using perturbative and numerical methods. The two-atom setup provides an easily controllable simulator of the one-spin model while the three-atom setup involves solving nonlinear equations. We discuss approximate methods to couple two spin-1 spaces. The article provides analytical and numerical tools necessary to design and build the proposed simulators with current technology.

TI Multiprobe Time Reversal for High-Fidelity Vortex-Mode-Division
   Multiplexing Over a Turbulent Free-Space Link
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons presents a degree of freedom for enhancing the secure key rate of free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) through mode-division multiplexing (MDM). However, atmospheric turbulence can lead to substantial modal crosstalk, which is a long-standing challenge to MDM for free-space QKD. Here, we show that the digital generation of time-reversed wavefronts for multiple probe beams is an effective method for mitigating atmospheric turbulence. We experimentally characterize seven OAM modes after propagation through a 340-m outdoor free-space link and observe an average modal crosstalk as low as 13.2% by implementing real-time time reversal. The crosstalk can be further reduced to 3.4% when adopting a mode spacing Delta l of 2. We implement a classical MDM system as a proof-of-principle demonstration, and the bit error rate is reduced from 3.6 x 10(-3) to be less than 1.3 x 10(-7) through the use of time reversal. We also propose a practical and scalable scheme for high-speed, mode-multiplexed QKD through a turbulent link. The modal crosstalk can be further reduced by using faster equipment. Our method can be useful to various free-space applications that require crosstalk suppression.

TI Complexity for one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We compute the complexity for the mixed -state density operator derived from a one-dimensional discretetime quantum walk (DTQW). The complexity is computed using a two-qubit quantum circuit obtained from canonically purifying the mixed state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution oscillates around a mean circuit depth of k. Further, the complexity of the stepwise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps. From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of (near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.

In the regime of reentrant superconductivity associated with the destructive Little-Parks effect, numerous coherent transitions are observed in the first reentrant lobe, where the shell carries 2 pi winding of superconducting phase, and are absent in the zeroth lobe. As junction density was increased by gate voltage, qubit coherence was suppressed then lost in the first lobe. These observations and numerical simulations highlight the role of winding-induced Andreev states in the junction.

AB The creation and evolution of nonequilibrium phonons is central in applications ranging from cosmological particle searches to decoherence processes in qubits. However, the fundamental understanding of decoherence pathways for athermal phonon distributions in solid-state systems remains an open question. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the primary decay channels of athermal phonons in two technologically relevant semiconductors-Si and GaAs. We quantify the contributions of anharmonic, isotopic, and interfacial scattering in these materials. From this, we construct a model to estimate the thermal power in a readout scheme as a function of time. We discuss the implication of our results on noise limitations in current phonon sensor designs and strategies for improving coherence in next-generation phonon sensors.

TI Scissors modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a synthetic magnetic
   field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the scissors modes of a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of a synthetic magnetic field, which induces rigid rotational components in the velocity field. Our investigation reveals that the scissors mode, excited in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, becomes coupled to the quadrupole modes of the condensate, giving rise to typical beating effects. Moreover, the two scissors modes excited in the vertical planes are also coupled together by the synthetic magnetic field, resulting in intriguing gyroscope dynamics. Our analytical results, derived from a spinor hydrodynamic theory, are further validated through numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These predictions for the condensates subject to a synthetic magnetic field are experimentally accessible with current cold-atom setups and hold promise for potential applications in quantum sensing.

TI Conditional Entropy Production and Quantum Fluctuation Theorem of
   Dissipative Information: Theory and Experiments
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study quantum conditional entropy production, which quantifies the irreversibility of system -environment evolution from the perspective of a third system, called the reference. The reference is initially correlated with the system. We show that quantum unconditional entropy production with respect to the system is less than conditional entropy production with respect to the reference, where the latter includes reference-induced dissipative information. Dissipative information pinpoints the distributive cor-relation established between the environment and the reference, even though they do not interact directly. When reaching thermal equilibrium, the system-environment evolution has a zero unconditional entropy production. However, one can still have a nonzero conditional entropy production with respect to the ref-erence, which characterizes the informational nonequilibrium of the system-environment evolution from the viewpoint of the reference. The additional contribution to conditional entropy production, dissipative information, characterizes a minimal thermodynamic cost that the system pays to maintain correlation with the reference. Positive dissipative information also characterizes potential work waste. We prove that both types of entropy production and dissipative information follow quantum fluctuation theorems when a two-point measurement is applied. We verify the quantum fluctuation theorem for dissipative informa-tion experimentally on IBM quantum computers. We also present examples based on the qubit collisional model and demonstrate universal nonzero dissipative information in the qubit Maxwell's demon protocol.

TI AI polarization compensation algorithm using a asymmetry entangled
   photon source
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Satellite-based entanglement distribution is essential for global-scale practical quantum network and foundational tests of quantum physics. Owing to relative motion of the satellite and the ground station, however, using high intensity reference laser to compensate polarization rotation is necessary. Here we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to compensate polarization using entangled photon pairs instead of high intensity reference laser. Our AI polarization compensation algorithm opens a new avenue to quantum communications and fundamental quantum optics experiments.

TI Coherent three-photon excitation of the strontium clock transition

We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer, overcoming the typical limitations of this technique to odd-level numbers. We also measure the two-body loss coefficient of 84Sr clock-state atoms. Our work constitutes an essential step towards outcoupling a continuous atom laser beam and provides a fast excitation mechanism for quantum simulation using bosonic alkaline-earth- like atoms.

TI Enhancement of Single-Photon Purity and Coherence of III-Nitride Quantum
   Dot with Polarization-Controlled Quasi-Resonant Excitation
SO SMALL
AB III-Nitride semiconductor-based quantum dots (QDs) play an essential role in solid-state quantum light sources because of their potential for room-temperature operation. However, undesired background emission from the surroundings deteriorates single-photon purity. Moreover, spectral diffusion causes inhomogeneous broadening and limits the applications of QDs in quantum photonic technologies. To overcome these obstacles, it is demonstrated that directly pumping carriers to the excited state of the QD reduces the number of carriers generated in the vicinities. The polarization-controlled quasi-resonant excitation is applied to InGaN QDs embedded in GaN nanowire. To analyze the different excitation mechanisms, polarization-resolved absorptions are investigated under the above-barrier bandgap, below-barrier bandgap, and quasi-resonant excitation conditions. By employing polarization-controlled quasi-resonant excitation, the linewidth is reduced from 353 to 272 mu eV, and the second-order correlation value is improved from 0.470 to 0.231. Therefore, a greater single-photon purity can be obtained at higher temperatures due to decreased linewidth and background emission.

We report the quantum simulation of para-particle oscillators by tailoring the native couplings of two orthogonal motional modes of a trapped ion. Our system accurately reproduces the dynamics of para-bosons and para-fermions of even order, demonstrating the first experimental analogy of para-particle dynamics in any physical system and demonstrate full control of para-particle oscillators.

TI Topological multimode waveguide QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological insulators feature a number of topologically protected boundary modes linked to the value of their bulk invariant. While in one-dimensional systems the boundary modes are zero dimensional and localized, in two-dimensional topological insulators the boundary modes are chiral, one-dimensional propagating modes along the edges of the system. Thus, topological photonic insulators with large Chern numbers naturally display a topologically protected multimode waveguide at their edges. Here, we show how to take advantage of these topologically protected propagating modes by interfacing them with quantum emitters. In particular, using a Harper-Hofstadter lattice, we find situations in which the emitters feature quasiquantized decay rates due to the increasing number of edge modes, and where their spontaneous emission spatially separates in different modes. We also show how using a single pi pulse the combination of such spatial separation and the interacting character of the emitters leads to the formation of a single-photon time-bin entangled state with no classical analog, which we characterize computing its entanglement entropy. Finally, we also show how the emitters can selectively interact with the different channels using nonlocal light-matter couplings such as the ones that can be obtained with giant atoms. Such capabilities pave the way for generating quantum gates among topologically protected photons as well as generating more complex entangled states of light in topological channels.

TI Interferometry with few photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optical phase determination is an important and established tool in diverse fields such as astronomy, biology, or quantum optics. There is increasing interest in using a lower number of total photons. However, different noise sources, such as electronic readout noise in the detector, and shot noise, hamper the phase estimation in regimes of very low illumination. Here, we report a study on how the quality of phase determination is affected by these two sources of noise. To that end, we experimentally reconstruct different wave fronts by means of a point-diffraction interferometer for different mean intensities of illumination, up to 15 photons per pixel. Our interferometer features a skipper-CCD sensor, which allows us to reduce the readout noise arbitrarily, thus enabling us to separate the effect of these two sources of noise. For two cases of interest-a spatial qudit encoding phase, consisting of d = 6 uniform phase regions, and a more general continuous phase-we see that reducing the readout noise leads to a clear improvement in the quality of reconstruction. This can be explained by a simple noise model that allows us to predict the expected fidelity of reconstruction and shows excellent agreement with the measurements.

TI Quantum Dynamics with Stochastic Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian subject to stochastic perturbations in its anti-Hermitian part, describing fluctuating gains and losses. The dynamics averaged over the noise is described by an "antidephasing" master equation. We characterize the resulting state evolution and analyze its purity. The properties of such dynamics are illustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that adding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, stabilizing the lossy state and making state purification possible to a greater variety of steady states.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum network correlations have attracted strong interest because they may reveal new types of locality violations. Here we investigated network nonlocality sharing in the extended bilocal scenario via weak measurements, which adds one more observer to either end of the well-known entanglement-swapping scenario. Intriguingly, network nonlocality sharing can be revealed from the multiple violation of the Branciard-RossetGisin-Pironio inequality by considering two contrasting motivations of intermediate observers, which has no counterpart in standard Bell scenarios. In addition, the noise resistance of network nonlocality sharing was also discussed.

TI Capturing Symmetries of Quantum Optimization Algorithms Using Graph
   Neural Networks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum optimization algorithms are some of the most promising algorithms expected to show a quantum advantage. When solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, quantum optimization algorithms usually provide an approximate solution. The solution quality, however, is not guaranteed to be good enough to warrant selecting it over the classical optimizer solution, as it depends on the problem instance. Here, we present an algorithm based on a graph neural network that can choose between a quantum optimizer and classical optimizer using performance prediction. In addition, we present an approach that predicts the optimal parameters of a variational quantum optimizer. We tested our approach with a specific quantum optimizer, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, applied to the Max-Cut problem, which is an example of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. We observed qualitatively and quantitatively that graph neural networks are suited for a performance prediction of up to nine-vertex Max-Cut instances with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm with a depth of up to three. For the performance prediction task, the average difference between the actual quantum algorithm performance and the predicted performance is below 19.7% and, for the parameter prediction task, the solution using the predicted parameters is within 2.7% of the optimal parameter solution. Our method therefore has the capacity to find problems that are best suited for quantum solvers. The proposed method and the corresponding algorithm can be used for hybrid quantum algorithm selection.

TI Suppressed Crosstalk between Two-Junction Superconducting Qubits with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fixed-frequency qubits can suffer from always-on interactions that inhibit independent control. Here, we address this issue by experimentally demonstrating a superconducting architecture using qubits that comprise of two capacitively shunted Josephson junctions connected in series. Historically known as tunable coupling qubits (TCQs), such two-junction qubits support two modes with distinct frequencies and spatial symmetries. By selectively coupling only one type of mode and using the other as our computational basis, we greatly suppress crosstalk between the data modes while permitting all-microwave two-qubit gates.

TI Quantum calculation for two-stream instability and advection test of
   Vlasov-Maxwell equations: numerical evaluation of Hamiltonian simulation
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas, but numerically solving them on classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the computational resource constraints imposed by the time evolution in the six-dimensional phase space, which requires broad spatial and temporal scales. The novelty of this study is to implement a quantum-classical hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell solver and the rigorous numerical scheme evaluation by numerical simulations. Specifically, the Vlasov solver implements the Hamiltonian simulation based on quantum singular value transformation, coupled with a classical Maxwell solver. We perform numerical simulation of a one-dimensional advection test and a one-spatial-dimension, one-velocity-dimension two-stream instability test on the Qiskit-Aer-GPU quantum circuit emulator with an A100 GPU. The computational complexity of our quantum algorithm can potentially be reduced from the classical $\mathcal{O}(N<^>6T<^>2/\epsilon )$ to $\mathcal{O}\left (\text{poly}(\log {N})\left (NT+T\log \left (T/\epsilon \right )\right )\right )$ for the $N$ grid system, simulation time $T$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$ in the limit where the number of queries is large enough and the error is small enough. Furthermore, the numerical analysis reveals that our quantum algorithm is robust under larger time steps compared with classical algorithms with the constraint of Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition.

TI Helstrom Bound for Squeezed Coherent States in Binary Communication

AB In quantum information processing, using a receiver device to differentiate between two non-orthogonal states leads to a quantum error probability. The minimum possible error is known as the Helstrom bound. In this work, we study the conditions for state discrimination using an alphabet of squeezed coherent states and compare them with conditions using the Glauber-Sudarshan, i.e., standard, coherent states.

TI Rotation sensing at the ultimate limit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Conventional classical sensors are approaching their maximum sensitivity levels in many areas. Yet these levels are still far from the ultimate limits dictated by quantum mechanics. Quantum sensors promise a substantial step ahead by taking advantage of the salient sensitivity of quantum states to the environment. Here, we focus on sensing rotations, a topic of broad application. By resorting to the basic tools of estimation theory, we derive states that achieve the ultimate sensitivities in estimating both the orientation of an unknown rotation axis and the angle rotated about it. The critical enhancement obtained with these optimal states should make of them an indispensable ingredient in the next generation of rotation sensors that is now blossoming.

TI Probing itinerant carrier dynamics at the diamond surface using single
   nitrogen vacancy centers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Color centers in diamond are widely explored for applications in quantum sensing, computing, and networking. Their optical, spin, and charge properties have extensively been studied, while their interactions with itinerant carriers are relatively unexplored. Here, we show that NV centers situated 10 +/- 5 nm of the diamond surface can be converted to the neutral charge state via hole capture. By measuring the hole capture rate, we extract the capture cross section, which is suppressed by proximity to the diamond surface. The distance dependence is consistent with a carrier diffusion model, indicating that the itinerant carrier lifetime can be long, even at the diamond surface. Measuring dynamics of near-surface NV centers offers a tool for characterizing the diamond surface and investigating charge transport in diamond devices.

TI Quantitative study of the response of a single NV defect in diamond to
   magnetic noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond is an efficient quantum sensor of randomly fluctuating signals via relaxometry measurements. In particular, the longitudinal spin relaxation of the NV defect accelerates in the presence of magnetic noise with a spectral component at its electron spin resonance frequency. We look into this effect quantitatively by applying a calibrated and tunable magnetic noise on a single NV defect. We show that an increase of the longitudinal spin relaxation rate translates into a reduction of the photoluminescence (PL) signal emitted under continuous optical illumination, which can be explained using a simplified three-level model of the NV defect. This PL quenching mechanism offers a simple, all-optical method to detect magnetic noise sources at the nanoscale.

TI Brillouin super- cooling/heating in a non- Hermitian phononic dimer
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The ability to coherently manipulate phonons through light permits cooling and heating microscale quantum systems for various critical fields in metrology, information processing, and sensing. However, these physical systems often are hard to isolate and open for exchanging energy externally, making themselves non-Hermitian. Here, we experimentally observe a super-cooling/heating state in a non-Hermitian phononic dimer, where the two independent phonon modes of distinct cooling/heating rates become synchronous in cooling/heating. Such super cooling/heating is manifested in a Parity-Time symmetric state controlled by two counterpropagating optical pumps. These results reveal the non-Hermitian nature of the phonon dimer and illustrate a coherent technique for synchronous cooling/heating non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for practical applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

TI Detecting stereoscopic distribution of carbon dioxide using single
   photon spectroscopy
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB It is of great significance to develop a high-precision and high spatiotemporal resolution of stereoscopic detection technology to finely delineate the horizontal and vertical distributions of CO2. This study elaborates on the superiorities of single photon spectroscopy, key steps to develop a high-performance single photon LIDAR, and their potential applications. Single-photon CO2 LIDAR integrates quantum sensing techniques with classical spectral measurement techniques, and can overcome the detection limitations of traditional CO2 LIDAR in terms of detection distance, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution. We anticipate that the single-photon spectroscopic technology can be widely applied in the detection of regional distribution and emission fluxes of CO2, transboundary transport fluxes of CO2, and in supporting the establishment of a new carbon monitoring framework.

Since the development during the 1980s for atomic species, laser cooling has been the very beginning step to cool and trap atoms for frontier research on quantum simulations, quantum sensing and precision measurements. Despite the complex internal structures of molecules, laser cooling of molecules have been realized with the deepened understanding of molecular structures and interaction between light and molecules. The development of laser technology over the last decades has also been a great aid for the laser cooling of molecules because many lasers are necessary to successfully cool the molecules. A detailed principle and development of laser cooling of molecules as well as the current status of the field are reviewed to give an introduction to the growing field of ultracold molecular physics.

TI Quantum monitoring of cellular metabolic activities in single

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Free radicals play a vital role in all kinds of biological processes including immune responses. However, free radicals have short lifetimes and are highly reactive, making them difficult to measure using current methods. Here, we demonstrate that relaxometry measurement, or T1, inherited from the field of diamond magnetometry can be used to detect free radicals in living cells with subcellular resolution. This quantum sensing technique is based on defects in diamond, which convert a magnetic signal into an optical signal, allowing nanoscale magnetic resonance measurements. We functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) to target single mitochondria within macrophage cells to detect the metabolic activity. In addition, we performed measurements on single isolated mitochondria. We were able to detect free radicals generated by individual mitochondria in either living cells or isolated mitochondria after stimulation or inhibition.

This mass range presents a wide and relatively unexplored dark matter parameter space, with a rich space of possible models and cosmic histories. We em-phasize that both current detectors and new, targeted search techniques, via both direct and indirect detection, are poised to contribute to searches for ultraheavy particle dark matter in the coming decade. We highlight the need for new developments in this space, including new analyses of current and imminent direct and indirect experiments target-ing ultraheavy dark matter and development of new, ultra-sensitive detector technolo-gies like next-generation liquid noble detectors, neutrino experiments, and specialized quantum sensing techniques.

AB Spin defects in solid-state sensors are a highly promising platform for quantum sensing, a field with far-reaching applications in a variety of industries. Here, we investigate the magnetic sensitivity of a spin defect ensemble detected electrically in a silicon carbide pn-junction diode utilizing the hyperfine-induced spin-mixing effect observed in the vicinity of zero magnetic field. To enhance the baseline sensitivity, we employ above bandgap optical excitation to generate additional electron-hole pairs as well as a balanced detection scheme to reject common-mode noise, with an ultimate sensitivity of 30 nT/root Hz achieved. Both techniques are demonstrated to greatly enhance the magnetic sensitivity of the device by a total factor of similar to 24, paving the way toward sub-nanotesla magnetic field sensitivities with electrical detection.

TI Unveiling the Enhancement of Spontaneous Emission at Exceptional Points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Exceptional points (EPs), singularities of non-Hermitian physics where complex spectral resonances degenerate, are one of the most exotic features of nonequilibrium open systems with unique properties. For instance, the emission rate of quantum emitters placed near resonators with EPs is enhanced (compared to the free-space emission rate) by a factor that scales quadratically with the resonance quality factor. Here, we verify the theory of spontaneous emission at EPs by measuring photoluminescence from photonic-crystal slabs that are embedded with a high-quantum-yield active material. While our experimental results verify the theoretically predicted enhancement, they also highlight the practical limitations on the enhancement due to material loss. Our designed structures can be used in applications that require enhanced and controlled emission, such as quantum sensing and imaging.

TI Hidden symmetry in the biased Dicke model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The symmetry operators generating the hidden Z(2) symmetry of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) at bias epsilon is an element of 1/2Z et al (2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 12LT01). We start with this result to determine symmetry operators for the N-qubit generalisation of the AQRM, also known as the biased Dicke model, at special biases. We also prove for general N that the symmetry operators, which commute with the Hamiltonian of the biased Dicke model, generate a Z(2) symmetry.

TI ac Sensing Using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in a Diamond Anvil Cell up to
   6 GPa
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have attracted broad attention as quantum sensors for both static and dynamic magnetic, electrical, strain, and thermal fields and are particularly attractive for quantum sensing under pressure in diamond anvil cells. Optically based nuclear magnetic resonance may be possible at pressures greater than a few gigapascals and offers an attractive alternative to conventional Faraday-induction-based detection. Here, we present ac sensing results and demonstrate synchronized readout up to 6 GPa but find that the sensitivity is reduced due to inhomogeneities of the microwave field and pressure within the sample space. These experiments enable the possibility of all-optical high resolution magnetic resonance of nanoliter sample volumes at high pressures.

TI Experimental investigation of Bayesian bounds in multiparameter
   estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum parameter estimation offers solid conceptual grounds for the design of sensors enjoying quantum advantage. This is realised not only by means of hardware supporting and exploiting quantum properties, but data analysis has its impact and relevance, too. In this respect, Bayesian methods have emerged as an effective and elegant solution, with the perk of incorporating naturally the availability of a priori information. In this article we present an evaluation of Bayesian methods for multiple phase estimation, assessed based on bounds that work beyond the usual limit of large samples assumed in parameter estimation. Importantly, such methods are applied to experimental data generated from the output statistics of a three-arm interferometer seeded by single photons. Our studies provide a blueprint for a more comprehensive data analysis in quantum metrology.

TI Quantitative Analysis of Genomic DNA Degradation of E. coli Using
   Automated Gel Electrophoresis under Various Levels of Microwave Exposure
SO GELS
AB The problem that this study addresses is to understand how microwave radiation is able to degrade genomic DNA of E. coli. In addition, a comparative study was made to evaluate the suitability of a high-throughput automated electrophoresis platform for quantifying the DNA degradation under microwave radiation. Overall, this study investigated the genomic DNA degradation of E. coli under microwave radiation using automated gel electrophoresis. To examine the viable organisms and degradation of genomic DNA under microwave exposure, we used three methods: (1) post-microwave exposure, where E. coli was enumerated using modified mTEC agar method using membrane filtration technique; (2) extracted genomic DNA of microwaved sample was quantified using the Qubit method; and (3) automated gel electrophoresis, the TapeStation 4200, was used to examine the bands of extracted DNA of microwaved samples. In addition, to examine the impacts of microwaves, E. coli colonies were isolated from a fecal sample (dairy cow manure), these colonies were grown overnight to prepare fresh E. coli culture, and this culture was exposed to microwave radiation for three durations: (1) 2 min; (2) 5 min; and (3) 8 min. In general, Qubit values (ng/mu L) were proportional to the results of automated gel electrophoresis, TapeStation 4200, DNA integrity numbers (DINs). Samples from exposure studies (2 min, 5 min, and 8 min) showed no viable E. coli. Initial E. coli levels (at 0 min microwave exposure) were 5 x 108 CFU/mL, and the E. coli level was reduced to a non-detectable level within 2 min of microwave exposure. The relationships between Qubit and TapeStation measurements was linear, except for when the DNA level was lower than 2 ng/mu L. In 8 min of microwave exposure, E. coli DNA integrity was reduced by 61.7%, and DNA concentration was reduced by 81.6%. The overall conclusion of this study is that microwave radiation had a significant impact on the genomic DNA of E. coli, and prolonged exposure of E. coli to microwaves can thus lead to a loss of genomic DNA integrity and DNA concentrations.

TI Hermitian and Unitary Almost-Companion Matrices of Polynomials on Demand
SO ENTROPY
AB We introduce the concept of the almost-companion matrix (ACM) by relaxing the non-derogatory property of the standard companion matrix (CM). That is, we define an ACM as a matrix whose characteristic polynomial coincides with a given monic and generally complex polynomial. The greater flexibility inherent in the ACM concept, compared to CM, allows the construction of ACMs that have convenient matrix structures satisfying desired additional conditions, compatibly with specific properties of the polynomial coefficients. We demonstrate the construction of Hermitian and unitary ACMs starting from appropriate third-degree polynomials, with implications for their use in physical-mathematical problems, such as the parameterization of the Hamiltonian, density, or evolution matrix of a qutrit. We show that the ACM provides a means of identifying the properties of a given polynomial and finding its roots. For example, we describe the ACM-based solution of cubic complex algebraic equations without resorting to the use of the Cardano-Dal Ferro formulas. We also show the necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a polynomial for it to represent the characteristic polynomial of a unitary ACM. The presented approach can be generalized to complex polynomials of higher degrees.

TI Advances in Mid-Infrared Single-Photon Detection
SO PHOTONICS
AB The current state of the art of single-photon detectors operating in the mid-infrared wavelength range is reported in this review. These devices are essential for a wide range of applications, such as mid-infrared quantum communications, sensing, and metrology, which require detectors with high detection efficiency, low dark count rates, and low dead times. The technological challenge of moving from the well-performing and commercially available near-infrared single-photon detectors to mid-infrared detection is discussed. Different approaches are explored, spanning from the stoichiometric or geometric engineering of a large variety of materials for infrared applications to the exploitation of alternative novel materials and the implementation of proper detection schemes. The three most promising solutions are described in detail: superconductive nanowires, avalanche photodiodes, and photovoltaic detectors.

   room-temperature water solution
SO SCIENCE
AB The tunability and spatial precision of paramagnetic molecules makes them attractive for quantum sensing. However, usual microwave-based detection methods have poor temporal and spatial resolution, and optical methods compatible with room-temperature solutions have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized pump-probe polarization spectroscopy to initialize and track electron spin coherence in a molecule. Designed to efficiently couple spins to light, aqueous potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) enabled detection of few-picosecond free-induction decay at room temperature and micromolar concentrations. Viscosity was found to strongly vary decoherence lifetimes. This approach has improved the experimental time resolution by up to five orders of magnitude, making it possible to observe molecular electron spin coherence in a system that only exhibits coherence below 25 kelvin with traditional techniques.

TI Sub-nanotesla sensitivity at the nanoscale with a single spin
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB High-sensitivity detection of the microscopic magnetic field is essential in many fields. Good sensitivity and high spatial resolution are mutually contradictory in measurement, which is quantified by the energy resolution limit. Here we report that a sensitivity of 0.5 nT/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at the nanoscale is achieved experimentally by using nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond with depths of tens of nanometers. The achieved sensitivity is substantially enhanced by integrating with multiple quantum techniques, including real-time-feedback initialization, dynamical decoupling with shaped pulses and repetitive readout via quantum logic. Our magnetic sensors will shed new light on searching new physics beyond the standard model, investigating microscopic magnetic phenomena in condensed matters, and detection of life activities at the sub-cellular scale.

Through interfacial modification, the OLED devices exhibit significantly enhanced luminescence intensity, leading to improved NV center excitation efficiency. Experimental results show that the optimized GO/PEDOT:PSS (40%) hybrid anode device achieves a lower turn-on voltage, with the NV center fluorescence peak intensity reaching 3.7 times that of the ITO-anode device, confirming the enhanced excitation effect through interfacial engineering of the light source. By integrating NV centers with OLED technology, this work establishes a new approach for efficient excitation.

TI Hamiltonian engineering of spin-orbit-coupled fermions in a
   Wannier-Stark optical lattice clock
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Engineering a Hamiltonian system with tunable interactions provides opportunities to optimize performance for quantum sensing and explore emerging phenomena of many-body systems. An optical lattice clock based on partially delocalized Wannier-Stark states in a gravity-tilted shallow lattice supports superior quantum coherence and adjustable interactions via spin-orbit coupling, thus presenting a powerful spin model realization. The relative strength of the on-site and off-site interactions can be tuned to achieve a zero density shift at a "magic" lattice depth. This mechanism, together with a large number of atoms, enables the demonstration of the most stable atomic clock while minimizing a key systematic uncertainty related to atomic density. Interactions can also be maximized by driving off-site Wannier-Stark transitions, realizing a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic dynamical phase transition.

TI Enantiomer Superpositions from Matter-Wave Interference of Chiral

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Molecular matter-wave interferometry enables novel strategies for manipulating the internal mechanical motion of complex molecules. Here, we show how chiral molecules can be prepared in a quantum superposition of two enantiomers by far-field matter-wave diffraction and how the resulting tunneling dynamics can be observed. We determine the impact of rovibrational phase averaging and propose a setup for sensing enantiomer-dependent forces, parity-violating weak interactions, and environment-induced superselection of handedness, as suggested to resolve Hund's paradox. Using ab initio tunneling calculations, we identify [4]-helicene derivatives as promising candidates to implement the proposal with state-of-the-art techniques.

TI A robust fiber-based quantum thermometer coupled with nitrogen-vacancy
   centers
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond has been broadly applied in quantum sensing since it is sensitive to different physical quantities. Meanwhile, it is difficult to isolate disturbances from unwanted physical quantities in practical applications. Here, we present a fiber-based quantum thermometer by tracking the sharp-dip in the zero-field optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum in a high-density nitrogenvacancy ensemble. Such a scheme can not only significantly isolate the magnetic field and microwave power drift but also improve the temperature sensitivity. Thanks to its simplicity and compatibility in implementation and robustness, this quantum thermometer is then applied to the surface temperature imaging of an electronic chip with a sensitivity of 18 mK/v Hz. It thus paves the way to high sensitive temperature measurements in ambiguous environments.

TI Quantum sub-phase sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the
   superposition of Schrödinger's cat-like state with vacuum state as an
   input under product detection scheme
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB We study the phase sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with product detection (PD) scheme by using the superposition of Schrodinger's cat-like state with the vacuum state (SCVS) and the coherent state as the inputs. We compare the results derived from PD with the parity detection scheme's results. We found that PD performs better than parity detection and approaches the single parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound in some cases. Therefore, we expect that SCVS may play as an alternative quantum resource with PD for the improvement in the phase sensitivity of an MZI having potential application in quantum metrology and quantum sensing.

TI Dissipation-induced topological phase transition and
   periodic-driving-induced photonic topological state transfer in a small
   optomechanical lattice
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme to investigate the topological phase transition and the topological state transfer based on the small optomechanical lattice under the realistic parameters regime. We find that the optomechanical lattice can be equivalent to a topologically nontrivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model via designing the effective optomechanical coupling. Especially, the optomechanical lattice experiences the phase transition between topologically nontrivial SSH phase and topologically trivial SSH phase by controlling the decay of the cavity field and the optomechanical coupling. We stress that the topological phase transition is mainly induced by the decay of the cavity field, which is counter-intuitive since the dissipation is usually detrimental to the system. Also, we investigate the photonic state transfer between the two cavity fields via the topologically protected edge channel based on the small optomechanical lattice. We find that the quantum state transfer assisted by the topological zero energy mode can be achieved via implying the external lasers with the periodical driving amplitudes into the cavity fields. Our scheme provides the fundamental and the insightful explanations towards the mapping of the photonic topological insulator based on the micro-nano optomechanical quantum optical platform.

However, the full potential of atom interferometers that operate with ultracold atoms has not yet been exploited. This paper presents current developments in the field of generation and application of Bose-Einstein condensates for inertial navigation. It covers the advancements in the form of atom chip and compact vacuum technology, classical sensor hybridization, and a multi-axis atom interferometry technique. In addition, the synergies of combining quantum sensors with classical inertial measurement units and their implications for navigation trajectories are discussed.

TI Quantum-classical hybrid neural networks in the neural tangent kernel
   regime
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, quantum neural networks or quantum-classical neural networks (qcNN) have been actively studied, as a possible alternative to the conventional classical neural network (cNN), but their practical and theoretically-guaranteed performance is still to be investigated. In contrast, cNNs and especially deep cNNs, have acquired several solid theoretical basis; one of those basis is the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which can successfully explain the mechanism of various desirable properties of cNNs, particularly the global convergence in the training process. In this paper, we study a class of qcNN composed of a quantum data-encoder followed by a cNN. The quantum part is randomly initialized according to unitary 2-designs, which is an effective feature extraction process for quantum states, and the classical part is also randomly initialized according to Gaussian distributions; then, in the NTK regime where the number of nodes of the cNN becomes infinitely large, the output of the entire qcNN becomes a nonlinear function of the so-called projected quantum kernel. That is, the NTK theory is used to construct an effective quantum kernel, which is in general nontrivial to design. Moreover, NTK defined for the qcNN is identical to the covariance matrix of a Gaussian process, which allows us to analytically study the learning process. These properties are investigated in thorough numerical experiments; particularly, we demonstrate that the qcNN shows a clear advantage over fully classical NNs and qNNs for the problem of learning the quantum data-generating process.

TI Unified hybrid quantum classical neural network framework for detecting
   distributed denial of service and Android mobile malware attacks
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The rise of advanced networking and mobile technologies has improved flexibility in Software Defined Networking (SDN) management and mobile ecosystems but it has also introduced vulnerabilities like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and Android malware. In this research, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) framework that operates with a Dressed Quantum Circuit (DQC) to achieve efficient detection and classification of threats. The input pipeline of the HQCNN integrates Wavelet Transforms based feature pre-processing, Convolutional Neural Network based feature extraction, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and quantum layers for enhanced classification with less computational complexity. Experiments were conducted on the SDN DDoS Attack Dataset and the CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 Static Dataset. Two different model variants were devised for binary and multiclass classification problems addressing various cybersecurity issues. The binary HQCNN model for SDN-based DDoS detection was implemented on AWS Braket's real Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), achieving 99.86% accuracy, 99.85% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.88% F1-score, thereby outperforming the classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The multiclass HQCNN, on the other hand, attains accuracy of 93.56%, 94.38%, and 95.13% on the 15-class, 14-class, and 12-class versions of CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 Static, respectively, hence outperforms all existing methods. These results show that HQCNN is efficient, scalable, and very much applicable in cybersecurity, validating its real-world use effectiveness applicability in threat detection.

The triple-photon down-conversion process can be realized in an optical superlattice by quasi-phase-matching technology. Asymmetric quantum steering can be obtained in this triple-photon down-conversion process. The direction of asymmetric quantum steering can be controlled by adjusting the parameters of the nonlinear process. The generation of asymmetric quantum steering in the present scheme has potential applications in quantum secret sharing and quantum networks.

AB Fast quantum control helps reduce the influence of unavoided disturbances and hence plays a vital role in practical quantum technology and chemical reactions. Instead of optimizing the terminal cost like standard optimal quantum control methods, this paper formulates the problem as a trajectory optimization problem, and implements the sequential quadratic programming algorithm to search for short control fields. The core idea is to minimize the cumulative intermediate error to incentivize early achievement of the designed gate. The numerical result on the Toffoli gate demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright (C) 2024 The Authors.

This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols, which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.

AB With the emergence of the research field of Quantum Machine Learning, interest in finding advantageous real-world applications is growing as well. However, challenges concerning the number of available qubits on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and accuracy losses due to hardware imperfections still remain and limit the applicability of such approaches in real-world scenarios. Therefore, for simplification, most studies assume nearly noise-free conditions as they are expected with logical, i.e. error-corrected, qubits instead of real qubits provided by hardware. However, the number of logical qubits is expected to scale slowly as they require a high number of real qubits for error correction. This is our motivation to deal with noise as an unavoidable, non-negligible problem on NISQ devices. As an application, we use the example of particle decay tree reconstruction as a highly complex combinatoric problem in High Energy Physics. We investigate methods to reduce the noise impact of such devices and propose a hybrid architecture that extends a classical graph neural network by a parameterized quantum circuit. While we have shown that such a hybrid architecture enables a reduction of the amount of trainable parameters compared to the fully classical case, we are now specifically interested in the actual performance in more realistic, i.e. noise prone scenarios. Using simple synthetic Decay Trees, we train the network in classical simulations to allow for efficient optimization of the parameters. The trained parameters are validated in noisy simulations based on devices by "IBM Quantum" and are used in interpretability and significance studies, enabling improvements in the accuracy on real devices.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Coherent control of quantum transitions-indispensable in quantum technology-generally relies on the interaction of quantum systems with electromagnetic radiation. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the nonradiative electromagnetic near field of a temporally modulated free-space electron beam can be utilized for coherent control of quantum systems. We show that such manipulation can be performed with only classical control over the electron beam itself and is readily realizable with current technology. This approach may provide a pathway toward spectrally selective quantum control with nanoscale spatial resolution, harnessing the small de Broglie wavelength of electrons.

TI Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose several algorithms for learning unitary operators from quantum statistical queries with respect to their Choi-Jamiolkowski state. Quantum statistical queries capture the capabilities of a learner with limited quantum resources, which receives as input only noisy estimates of expected values of measurements. Our approach leverages quantum statistical queries to estimate the Fourier mass of a unitary on a subset of Pauli strings, generalizing previous techniques developed for uniform quantum examples. Specifically, we show that the celebrated quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be implemented with quantum statistical queries, whereas the prior version of the algorithm involves oracle access to the unitary and its inverse. As an application, we prove that quantum Boolean functions with constant total influence or with constant degree are efficiently learnable in our model. Moreover, we prove that O(log n)-juntas are efficiently learnable and constant-depth circuits are learnable query-efficiently with quantum statistical queries. On the other hand, all previous algorithms for these tasks demand significantly greater resources, such as oracle access to the unitary or direct access to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. We also demonstrate that, despite these positive results, quantum statistical queries lead to an exponentially larger query complexity for certain tasks, compared to separable measurements to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. In particular, we show an exponential lower bound for learning a class of phase-oracle unitaries and a double exponential lower bound for testing the unitarity of channels. Taken together, our results indicate that quantum statistical queries offer a unified framework for various unitary learning tasks, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, many-body physics and benchmarking of near-term devices.

TI On the expressivity of embedding quantum kernels
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One of the most natural connections between quantum and classical machine learning has been established in the context of kernel methods. Kernel methods rely on kernels, which are inner products of feature vectors living in large feature spaces. Quantum kernels are typically evaluated by explicitly constructing quantum feature states and then taking their inner product, here called embedding quantum kernels. Since classical kernels are usually evaluated without using the feature vectors explicitly, we wonder how expressive embedding quantum kernels are. In this work, we raise the fundamental question: can all quantum kernels be expressed as the inner product of quantum feature states? Our first result is positive: Invoking computational universality, we find that for any kernel function there always exists a corresponding quantum feature map and an embedding quantum kernel. The more operational reading of the question is concerned with efficient constructions, however. In a second part, we formalize the question of universality of efficient embedding quantum kernels. For shift-invariant kernels, we use the technique of random Fourier features to show that they are universal within the broad class of all kernels which allow a variant of efficient Fourier sampling. We then extend this result to a new class of so-called composition kernels, which we show also contains projected quantum kernels introduced in recent works. After proving the universality of embedding quantum kernels for both shift-invariant and composition kernels, we identify the directions towards new, more exotic, and unexplored quantum kernel families, for which it still remains open whether they correspond to efficient embedding quantum kernels.

TI Distribution of density matrices at fixed purity for arbitrary
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Uniformly sampling quantum density matrices has been demonstrated for a long time [Mezzadri, Notices AMS 54, 592 (2007), Zyczkowski, J. Math. Phys. 52, 062201 (2011)] and is a valuable tool in the analysis and testing of quantum relations (e.g., the tightness of an uncertainty relation); in ranking the performance of various tools to witness entanglement, nonlocality, discord, etc.; and in probing the geometry of fundamental quantum properties (e.g, the boundary between separable and entangled states). While uniformly sampling quantum states has been shown to be quite valuable, there is to our knowledge no such method to sample these states uniformly at a constant amount of mixedness. This challenge becomes increasingly acute as post-selecting a subensemble of states within a narrow range of, say, purities from this fully uniform sampling becomes overwhelmingly inefficient at high dimension. In this work, we demonstrate how to analytically construct the distribution of density matrices at constant purity (the trace of the square of a density matrix) as our mixedness measure. With this technique at our disposal: we provide analytic formulas for the cumulative radial distribution functions for the uniform distribution of density matrices at constant purity for arbitrary total dimension N, with closed form expressions up to N = 4, and perform numerical integration to analyze the statistics of these uniform-purity distributions at higher dimensions (up to N = 100). Moreover, we use our new capabilities to: compare different measures of entanglement and nonclassicality, including Wootter's concurrence, the logarithmic negativity and quantum discord, as a function of purity at dimension N = 4 (two qubits); to find the probability distribution of purities of marginal density matrices from a uniform distribution of joint pure states (and thus the entanglement statistics of this uniform ensemble); and to numerically test a conjectured uncertainty relation between quantum mutual information and the sum of classical mutual informations in complementary bases.

TI Coherent Control of Trapped-Ion Qubits with Localized Electric Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a new method for coherent control of trapped ion qubits in separate interaction regions of a multizone trap by simultaneously applying an electric field and a spin-dependent gradient. Both the phase and amplitude of the effective single-qubit rotation depend on the electric field, which can be localized to each zone. We demonstrate this interaction on a single ion using both laser-based and magnetic-field gradients in a surface-electrode ion trap, and measure the localization of the electric field.

TI Charge-Noise Resilience of Two-Electron Quantum Dots in Si=SiGe
   Heterostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The valley degree of freedom presents challenges and opportunities for silicon spin qubits. An important consideration for singlet-triplet states is the presence of two distinct triplets, composed of valley vs orbital excitations. Here, we show that both of these triplets are present in the typical operating regime, but that only the valley-excited triplet offers intrinsic protection against charge noise. We further show that this protection arises naturally in dots with stronger confinement. These results reveal an inherent advantage for silicon-based multielectron qubits.

TI Nonvariational ADAPT algorithm for quantum simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore a nonvariational quantum state preparation approach combined with the ADAPT operator selection strategy in the application of preparing the ground state of a desired target Hamiltonian. In this algorithm, energy gradient measurements determine both the operators and the gate parameters in the quantum circuit construction. We compare this nonvariational algorithm with ADAPT-VQE and with feedback-based quantum algorithms in terms of the rate of energy reduction, the circuit depth, and the measurement cost in molecular simulation. We find that, despite using deeper circuits, this new algorithm reaches chemical accuracy at a similar measurement cost to ADAPT-VQE. Since it does not rely on a classical optimization subroutine, it may provide robustness against circuit parameter errors due to imperfect control or gate synthesis.

TI Robust photon-mediated entangling gates between quantum dot spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Significant experimental advances in single-electron silicon spin qubits have opened the possibility of realizing long-range entangling gates mediated by microwave photons. Recently proposed imaginary SWAP (iSWAP) gates, however, require tuning qubit energies into resonance and have limited fidelity due to charge noise. We present a photon-mediated cross-resonance gate that is consistent with realistic experimental capabilities and requires no resonant tuning. Furthermore, we propose gate sequences capable of suppressing errors due to quasistatic noise for both the cross-resonance and iSWAP gates.

By leveraging quantum principles, QRAM can efficiently store and manipulate both quantum and classical data, leading to potential significant speedups in a variety of quantum algorithms. However, as demonstrated in this work, when used in remote cloud-based quantum computers QRAM is vulnerable to different security attacks. The work demonstrates side-channel attacks, e.g., the timing attacks, as well as fault-injection-like attacks, e.g., the higher-energy attacks. This work evaluates the attacks on QRAM and different circuits that use QRAM. The work also proposes a set of defenses.

TI Kernels for non interacting fermions via a Green's function approach
   with applications to step potentials
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The quantum correlations of N non interacting spinless fermions in their ground state can be expressed in terms of a two-point function called the kernel. Here we develop a general and compact method for computing the kernel in a general trapping potential in terms of the Green's function for the corresponding single particle Schrodinger equation. For smooth potentials in one dimension the method allows a simple alternative derivation of the local density approximation for the density and of the sine kernel in the bulk part of the trap in the large N limit. It also recovers the density and the kernel of the so-called Airy gas at the edge. This method allows the analysis of the quantum correlations in the ground state when the potential has a singular part with a fast variation in space. For the square step barrier of height V-0 in one dimension, we derive explicit expressions for the density and for the kernel. For large Fermi energy mu > V-0 it describes the interpolation between two regions of different densities in a Fermi gas, each described by a different sine kernel. Of particular interest is the critical point of the square well potential when mu = V-0. In this critical case, while there is a macroscopic number of fermions in the lower part of the step potential, there is only a finite O(1) number of fermions on the shoulder, and moreover this number is independent of mu. In particular, the density exhibits an algebraic decay similar to 1/x(2), where x is the distance from the jump. Furthermore, we show that the critical behavior around mu = V-0 exhibits universality with respect to the shape of the barrier. This is established (i) by an exact solution for a smooth barrier (the Woods-Saxon potential) and (ii) by establishing a general relation between the large distance behavior of the kernel and the scattering amplitudes of the single-particle wave-function.

TI A hybrid trans-modal liquid crystal optical vortex generator
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB This work experimentally validates a large-aperture optical vortex generator using a novel hybrid structure, combining transmission electrode and modal techniques, in what we term the trans-modal technique. The continuous transmission electrode is designed to generate a linear voltage distribution between the contact electrodes, while the electrode stubs distribute the voltage across the active area. A high-resistivity layer of the conducting polymer PEDOT fills the gap between the electrodes, resulting in a completely continuous voltage distribution. A 1-cm aperture device is experimentally demonstrated, but the structure is completely scalable. Theoretical results validate the design, and experimental results demonstrate precise control over the topological charge for both positive and negative values of orbital angular momentum. Remarkably, the conversion efficiency for the first topological charges is almost 100%. The reduction in efficiency of the higherorder modes has been explained theoretically, and it is not caused by design but by the PEDOT characteristics. The fabrication process is straightforward, as the high-resistivity layer may also be inhomogeneous. This work contributes significantly to the field by introducing a novel method for optical vortex generation. The simplicity of the fabrication process, high conversion efficiency, and ability to control the topological charge make this technique a promising avenue for future research and applications.

TI Fast black-box quantum state preparation based on linear combination of
   unitaries
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Black-box quantum state preparation is a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms. Starting from Grover, a series of techniques have been devised to reduce the complexity. In this work, we propose to perform black-box state preparation using the technique of linear combination of unitaries (LCU). We provide two algorithms based on a different structure of LCU. Our algorithms improve upon the existed best results by reducing the required additional qubits and Toffoli gates to 2log(n) and n, respectively, in the bit precision n. We demonstrate the algorithms using the IBM Quantum Experience cloud services. The further reduced complexity of the present algorithms brings the black-box quantum state preparation closer to reality.

TI Polarization-Entangled Two-Photon Absorption in Inhomogeneously
   Broadened Ensembles
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Entangled photons are promising candidates for a variety of novel spectroscopic applications. In this paper, we simulate two-photon absorption (TPA) of entangled photons in a molecular ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening. We compare our results with a homogeneously broadened case and comment on the consequences for the possible quantum enhancement of TPA cross sections. We find that, while there are differences in the TPA cross section, this difference always remains small and of the order unity. We further consider the impact of the polarization degrees of freedom and carry out the orientational average of a model system Hamiltonian. We find that certain molecular geometries can give rise to a substantial polarization dependence of the entangled TPA rate. This effect can increase the TPA cross section by up to a factor of five.

TI Quantum advantage through the magic pentagram problem

In this paper, we present another problem with the same property, the magic pentagram problem based on themagic pentagram game, which is a nonlocal game. In otherwords, we show that the problem can be solved with certainty by a QNC(0) circuit but not by any NC0 circuits.

TI Nitrogen vacancy defects in single-particle nanodiamonds sense
   paramagnetic transition metal spin noise from nanoparticles on a
   transmission electron microscopy grid
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Spin-active nanomaterials play a vital role in current and upcoming quantum technologies, such as spintronics, data storage and computing. To advance the design and application of these materials, methods to link size, shape, structure, and chemical composition with functional magnetic properties at the nanoscale level are needed. In this work, we combine the power of two local probes, namely, Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) spin-active defects in diamond and an electron beam, within experimental platforms used in electron microscopy. Negatively charged NVs within fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) particles are used to sense the local paramagnetic environment of Rb0.5Co1.3[Fe(CN)(6)]& BULL;3.7H(2)O nanoparticles (NPs), a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), as a function of FND-PBA distance (order of 10 nm) and local PBA concentration. We demonstrate perturbation of NV spins by proximal electron spins of transition metals within NPs, as detected by changes in the photoluminescence (PL) of NVs. Workflows are reported and demonstrated that employ a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) finder grid to spatially correlate functional and structural features of the same unique NP studied using NV sensing, based on a combination of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) and Magnetic Modulation (MM) of NV PL, within TEM imaging modalities. Significantly, spin-spin dipole interactions were detected between NVs in a single FND and paramagnetic metal centre spin fluctuations in NPs through a carbon film barrier of 13 nm thickness, evidenced by TEM tilt series imaging and Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), opening new avenues to sense magnetic materials encapsulated in or between thin-layered nanostructures. The measurement strategies reported herein provide a pathway towards solid-state quantitative NV sensing with atomic-scale theoretical spatial resolution, critical to the development of quantum technologies, such as memory storage and molecular switching nanodevices.

TI Quantum Physics Literacy Aimed at K12 and the General Public
SO UNIVERSE
AB Educating K12 students and general public in quantum physics represents an evitable must no longer since quantum technologies are going to revolutionize our lives. Quantum literacy is a formidable challenge and an extraordinary opportunity for a massive cultural uplift, where citizens learn how to engender creativity and practice a new way of thinking, essential for smart community building. Scientific thinking hinges on analyzing facts and creating understanding, and it is then formulated with the dense mathematical language for later fact checking. Within classical physics, learners' intuition may in principle be educated via classroom demonstrations of everyday-life phenomena. Their understanding can even be framed with the mathematics suited to their instruction degree. For quantum physics, on the contrary, we have no experience of quantum phenomena and the required mathematics is beyond non-expert reach. Therefore, educating intuition needs imagination. Without rooting to experiments and some degree of formal framing, educators face the risk to provide only evanescent tales, often misled, while resorting to familiar analogies. Here, we report on the realization of QPlayLearn, an online platform conceived to explicitly address challenges and opportunities of massive quantum literacy. QPlayLearn's mission is to provide multilevel education on quantum science and technologies to anyone, regardless of age and background. To this aim, innovative interactive tools enhance the learning process effectiveness, fun, and accessibility, while remaining grounded on scientific correctness. Examples are games for basic quantum physics teaching, on-purpose designed animations, and easy-to-understand explanations on terminology and concepts by global experts. As a strategy for massive cultural change, QPlayLearn offers diversified content for different target groups, from primary school all the way to university physics students. It is addressed also to companies wishing to understand the potential of the emergent quantum industry, journalists, and policymakers needing to seize what quantum technologies are about, as well as all quantum science enthusiasts.

TI Correspondence between the Hamiltonian cycle problem and the quantum Z2
   lattice gauge theory
SO EPL
AB - We propose the correspondence between the Hamiltonian cycle (HC) problem in graph theory and the quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory (QZ2LGT) defined on the lattice dual to that graph. For the QZ2LGT, when the coupling parameter g is less than the critical value gc, the ground state is a superposition of all configurations with closed strings of same spins, which can be obtained by using an adiabatic quantum algorithm. A subsequent search for a HC among those closed strings solves the original HC problem. The method is demonstrated for random samples of small graphs.

TI Brownian Particles and Matter Waves
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In view of the remarkable progress in microrheology to monitor the random motion of Brownian particles with a size as small as a few nanometers, and given that de Broglie matter waves have been experimentally observed for large molecules of comparable nanometer size, we examine whether Brownian particles can manifest a particle-wave duality without employing a priori arguments from quantum decoherence. First, we examine the case where Brownian particles are immersed in a memoryless viscous fluid with a time-independent diffusion coefficient, and the requirement for the Brownian particles to manifest a particle-wave duality leads to the untenable result that the diffusion coefficient has to be proportional to the inverse time, therefore, diverging at early times. This finding agrees with past conclusions published in the literature, that quantum mechanics is not equivalent to a Markovian diffusion process. Next, we examine the case where the Brownian particle is trapped in a harmonic potential well with and without dissipation. Both solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation for the case with dissipation, and of the Schr & ouml;dinger equation for the case without dissipation, lead to the same physically acceptable result-that for the Brownian particle to manifest a particle-wave duality, its mean kinetic energy kBT/2 needs to be 1/2 the ground-state energy, E0=12 & hbar;omega of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Our one-dimensional calculations show that for this to happen, the trapping needs to be very strong so that a Brownian particle with mass m and radius R needs to be embedded in an extremely stiff solid with shear modulus, G proportional to m/RkBT/& hbar;2.

TI A Pipelined Hardware Design of FNTT and INTT of CRYSTALS-Kyber PQC
   Algorithm
SO INFORMATION
AB Lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms demand number theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplications. NTT-based polynomials' multiplication relies on the computation of forward number theoretic transform (FNTT) and inverse number theoretic transform (INTT), respectively. Therefore, this work presents a unified NTT hardware accelerator architecture to facilitate the polynomial multiplications of the CRYSTALS-Kyber PQC algorithm. Moreover, a unified butterfly unit design of Cooley-Tukey and Gentleman-Sande configurations is proposed to implement the FNTT and INTT operations using one adder, one multiplier, and one subtractor, sharing four routing multiplexers and one Barrett-based modular reduction unit. The critical path of the proposed butterfly unit is minimized using pipelining. An efficient controller is implemented for control functionalities. The simulation results after the post-place and -route step are provided on Xilinx Virtex-6 and Virtex-7 field-programmable gate array devices. Also, the proposed design is physically implemented for validation on Virtex-7 FPGA. The number of slices utilized on Virtex-6 and Virtex-7 devices is 398 and 312, the required number of clock cycles for one set of FNTT and INTT computations is 1410 and 1540, and the maximum operating frequency is 256 and 290 MHz, respectively. The average figure of merit (FoM), where FoM is the ratio of throughput to slices, illustrates 62% better performance than the most relevant NTT design from the literature.

TI ISH: Isogeny-based Secret Handshakes with friendly communication costs
SO COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES
AB Secret handshake schemes allow members from the same organization to authenticate each other anonymously. After its proposal, various schemes have been introduced to achieve advanced privacy protection. Regrettably, all the schemes based on number theoretic assumptions are insecure under quantum computers, and the known post-quantum designs are impractical because of the overhead cost (> 10 MB). To fill the gap, we present the first isogeny-based secret handshake scheme (i.e., ISH) with a friendly communication cost (67 KB). In particular, we apply the CSI-FiSh signature scheme to generate group keys and credentials. For each zero-knowledge transcript in the credential, we generate a signature for handshake via the Fiat-Shamir paradigm, while it fails anonymous authentication. To fix the issue, we modify the Fiat-Shamir-type signature by embedding the CSIDH ephemeral private key into the challenge space. After verifying the modified signatures, two users recover the right ephemeral private key if they are in the same group, then they can negotiate a session key and authenticate each other. Our scheme is proved secure under the Group Action Inverse Problems (GAIP) in the random oracle model, and deniability, as an attractive property, also holds for ISH, enabling user's ability to deny their interactions in the finished handshakes. Via choosing appropriate parameters, the communication cost surpasses all the existing post-quantum secret handshakes.

TI Artificial Intelligence in the Scientific and Technological Paradigm of
   Global Economy
SO PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU
AB The article examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on global sustainable development. Artificial intelligence affects all three pillars of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. Based on the generalization of academic works and authoritative expert assessments, it is shown that this impact is ambiguous. By increasing technological capabilities and enhancing the efficiency of business, public administration, and the provision of administrative and social services, AI creates a number of socio-economic problems, primarily in the labor market, when hundreds of professions are discredited and may disappear. It has been confirmed that almost all sectors of the economy, including education and medicine, are subject to the large-scale impact of AI. AI is able to optimize the use of resources and increase energy efficiency, reducing waste, thus affecting the environmental pillar of sustainable development. The purpose of the article is a systematic study of the intellectual and technological landscape of the global economy with a cross-country analysis of its key indicators using the Kohonen algorithm. The author has positioned artificial intelligence in the technological paradigm of the twenty-first century. If scientific progress in materials science, energy, and mathematical computing led to the digital transformation with the emergence of Industry 4.0, then in synergy with bio- and quantum technologies, AI will form Industry 5.0, i.e., essentially a smart economy, through a technological explosion. To recreate the current global intellectual and technological landscape, the study used the Kohonen algorithm with the Deductor Studio package to analyze 128 countries by 5 indicators. The modeling allowed us to group them into 5 clusters, which makes a real comparative analysis possible. Similar modeling with the implementation of the AI indicator (number of robots per 10,000 population) for 18 countries allowed them to be grouped into 3 clusters according to the level of readiness of governments and society to interact with AI.

TI Wormholes and factorization in exact effective theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.

TI Validating fewest-switches surface hopping in the presence of laser
   fields
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The capability of fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) to describe non-adiabatic dynamics under explicit excitation with external fields is evaluated. Different FSSH parameters are benchmarked against multi-configurational time dependent Hartree (MCTDH) reference calculations using SO2 and 2-thiocytosine as model, yet realistic, molecular systems. Qualitatively, FSSH is able to reproduce the trends in the MCTDH dynamics with (also without) an explicit external field; however, no set of FSSH parameters is ideal. The adequate treatment of the overcoherence in FSSH is revealed as the driving factor to improve the description of the excitation process with respect to the MCTDH reference. Here, two corrections were tested: the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH) correction and the energy-based decoherence correction. A dependence on the employed basis is detected in AFSSH, performing better when spin-orbit and external laser field couplings are treated as off-diagonal elements instead of projecting them onto the diagonal of the Hamilton operator. In the presence of an electric field, the excited state dynamics was found to depend strongly on the vector used to rescale the kinetic energy along after a transition between surfaces. For SO2, recurrence of the excited wave packet throughout the duration of the applied laser pulse is observed for laser pulses (>100 fs), resulting in additional interferences missed by FSSH and only visible in variational multi-configurational Gaussian when utilizing a large number of Gaussian basis functions. This feature vanishes when going toward larger molecules, such as 2-thiocytosine, where this effect is barely visible in a laser pulse 200 fs long.

TI A Review of Ground State Hanle Effect on Paraffin Coated Alkali Atoms
   under EIT and EIA
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Introduction: This review is specifically aimed at providing deeper understanding of the ground state Hanle effect through novel methods of atomic vapor interaction with resonant light. Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) are the primary phenomena in this context. EIT is a process in which destructive interference at absorption frequencies within a medium is caused by a control laser and makes the medium clear to the probe laser light. It should be noted that this transparency is crucial for turning on/off the light pulses, slowing down or stopping in several cases, thus enhancing the effectiveness of atomic magnetometers. However, constructive interference that occurs in EIA raises the density of the medium, which is advantageous for achieveing precise measurements. Thus, studying Hanle effect contribute in development of commercially valuable applications and the improvement of atomic clocks. Objective: The objective of this study is to review the fundamental principles of the Hanle effect, EIT, EIA, and coating methods for alkali atoms. These principles and techniques are essential for improving the sensitivity and functionality of atomic magnetometers and other quantum devices. By understanding and applying these phenomena, significant progress has been made in the development of high-precision measurement tools and quantum technologies. Results: Advancements in atomic magnetometer sensitivity represent a rapidly growing area of interest that has made the significant progress in the development of quantum devices. This review consolidates the state of art research and development of fundamental principles and practical applications of the Hanle effect, EIT, EIA, and coating methods for alkali atoms. It highlights how advancements in EIT and EIA have contributed to the sensitivity improvements of atomic magnetometers, and show the importance of coating methods for maintaining system integrity and performance. These developments are essential in revolutioning of modern quantum technologies and precision measurement devices.

TI Private Weakly-Random Sequences from Human Heart Rate for Quantum
   Amplification
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate whether the heart rate can be treated as a semi-random source with the aim of amplification by quantum devices. We use a semi-random source model called epsilon-Santha-Vazirani source, which can be amplified via quantum protocols to obtain a fully private random sequence. We analyze time intervals between consecutive heartbeats obtained from Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of people of different sex and age. We propose several transformations of the original time series into binary sequences. We have performed different statistical randomness tests and estimated quality parameters. We find that the heart can be treated as a good enough, and private by its nature, source of randomness that every human possesses. As such, in principle, it can be used as input to quantum device-independent randomness amplification protocols. The properly interpreted epsilon parameter can potentially serve as a new characteristic of the human heart from the perspective of medicine.

TI Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state representation and pairing detection in
   the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving BardeenCooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. This offers a compelling new perspective on describing the ground-state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas, enabling a complete description in second quantization. The proposed wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix and is valid under any external potential. Specifically, we provide the exact coefficients that allow one to describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Furthermore, the proposed wave function's form in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Through this approach, we demonstrate and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits nontrivial quantum correlations but also is a paired state.

TI Entangled Photon Spectroscopy
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: The enhanced interest in quantum-related phenomena has provided new opportunities for chemists to push the limits of detection and analysis of chemical processes. As some have called this the second quantum revolution, a time has come to apply the rules learned from previous research in quantum phenomena toward new methods and technologies important to chemists. While there has been great interest recently in quantum information science (QIS), the quest to understand how nonclassical states of light interact with matter has been ongoing for more than two decades. Our entry into this field started around this time with the use of materials to produce nonclassical states of light. Here, the process of multiphoton absorption led to photonnumber squeezed states of light, where the photon statistics are sub-Poissonian. In addition to the great interest in generating squeezed states of light, there was also interest in the formation of entangled states of light. While much of the effort is still in foundational physics, there are numerous new avenues as to how quantum entanglement can be applied to spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing. These opportunities could have a large impact on the chemical community for a broad spectrum of applications.
   In this Account, we discuss the use of entangled (or quantum) light for spectroscopy as well as applications in microscopy and interferometry. The potential benefits of the use of quantum light are discussed in detail. From the first experiments in porphyrin dendrimer systems by Dr. Dong-Ik Lee in our group to the measurements of the entangled two photon absorption cross sections of biological systems such as flavoproteins, the usefulness of entangled light for spectroscopy has been illustrated. These early measurements led the way to more advanced measurements of the unique characteristics of both entangled light and the entangled photon absorption cross-section, which provides new control knobs for manipulating excited states in molecules. The first reports of fluorescence-induced entangled processes were in organic chromophores where the entangled photon cross-section was measured. These results would later have widespread impact in applications such as entangled two-photon microscopy. From our design, construction and implementation of a quantum entangled photon excited microscope, important imaging capabilities were achieved at an unprecedented low excitation intensity of 10(7) photons/s, which is 6 orders of magnitude lower than the excitation level for the classical two-photon image. New reports have also illustrated an advantage of nonclassical light in Raman imaging as well.
   From a standpoint of more precise measurements, the use of entangled photons in quantum interferometry may offer new opportunities for chemistry research. Experiments that combine molecular spectroscopy and quantum interferometry, by utilizing the correlations of entangled photons in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, have been carried out. The initial experiment showed that the HOM signal is sensitive to the presence of a resonant organic sample placed in one arm of the interferometer. In addition, parameters such as the dephasing time have been obtained with the opportunity for even more advanced phenomenology in the future.

TI Wafer-Scale Periodic Poling of Thin-Film Lithium Niobate
SO MATERIALS
AB Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) offers an admirably promising platform for the advancement of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this context, domain inversion engineering emerges as a key process to achieve efficient nonlinear conversion. However, periodic poling processing of thin-film lithium niobate has only been realized on the chip level, which significantly limits its applications in large-scale nonlinear photonic systems that necessitate the integration of multiple nonlinear components on a single chip with uniform performances. Here, we demonstrate a wafer-scale periodic poling technique on a 4-inch LNOI wafer with high fidelity. The reversal lengths span from 0.5 to 10.17 mm, encompassing an area of similar to 1 cm(2) with periods ranging from 4.38 to 5.51 mu m. Efficient poling was achieved with a single manipulation, benefiting from the targeted grouped electrode pads and adaptable comb line widths in our experiment. As a result, domain inversion is ultimately implemented across the entire wafer with a 100% success rate and 98% high-quality rate on average, showcasing high throughput and stability, which is fundamentally scalable and highly cost-effective in contrast to traditional size-restricted chiplet-level poling. Our study holds significant promise to dramatically promote ultra-high performance to a broad spectrum of applications, including optical communications, photonic neural networks, and quantum photonics.

TI Quantitative Nonclassicality of Mediated Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In a plethora of physical situations, one can distinguish a mediator-a system that couples other, noninteracting, systems. Often, the mediator itself is not directly accessible to experimentation, yet it is interesting and sometimes crucial to understand if it admits nonclassical properties. An example of this sort that has recently been enjoying considerable attention is that of two quantum masses coupled via a gravitational field. It has been argued that the gain of quantum entanglement between the masses indicates nonclassicality of the states of the whole tripartite system. Here, we focus on the nonclassical properties of the involved interactions rather than the states. We derive inequalities the violation of which indicates noncommutativity and nondecomposability (open-system generalization of noncommuting unitaries) of interactions through the mediators. The derivations are based on properties of general quantum formalism and make minimalistic assumptions about the studied systems; in particular, the interactions can remain uncharacterized throughout the assessment. Furthermore, we also present conditions that solely use correlations between the coupled systems, excluding the need to measure the mediator. Next, we show that the amount of violation places a lower bound on suitably defined degree of nondecomposability. This makes the methods quantitative and at the same time experiment ready. We give applications of these techniques in two different fields: for detecting the nonclassicality of gravitational interaction and in bounding the Trotter error in quantum simulations.

TI Many versus one: The disorder operator and entanglement entropy in
   fermionic quantum matter
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Motivated by recent development of the concept of the disorder operator and its relation with entanglement entropy in bosonic systems, here we show the disorder operator successfully probes many aspects of quantum entanglement in fermionic many-body systems. From both analytical and numerical computations in free and interacting fermion systems in 1D and 2D, we find the disorder operator and the entanglement entropy exhibit similar universal scaling behavior, as a function of the boundary length of the subsystem, but with subtle yet important differences. In 1D they both follow the log L scaling behavior with the coefficient determined by the Luttinger parameter for disorder operator, and the conformal central charge for entanglement entropy. In 2D they both show the universal L log L scaling behavior in free and interacting Fermi liquid states, with the coefficients depending on the geometry of the Fermi surfaces. However at a 2D quantum critical point with non-Fermi-liquid state, extra symmetry information is needed in the design of the disorder operator, so as to reveal the critical fluctuations as does the entanglement entropy. Our results demonstrate the fermion disorder operator can be used to probe quantum many-body entanglement related to global symmetry, and provide new tools to explore the still largely unknown territory of highly entangled fermion quantum matter in 2 or higher dimensions.

TI Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive
   trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a lowentanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable unraveling parameter- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators-the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.

TI Entanglement and Photon Anti-Bunching in Coupled Non-Degenerate
   Parametric Oscillators
SO ENTROPY
AB We analytically and numerically show that the Hillery-Zubairy's entanglement criterion is satisfied both below and above the threshold of coupled non-degenerate optical parametric oscillators (NOPOs) with strong nonlinear gain saturation and dissipative linear coupling. We investigated two cases: for large pump mode dissipation, below-threshold entanglement is possible only when the parametric interaction has an enough detuning among the signal, idler, and pump photon modes. On the other hand, for a large dissipative coupling, below-threshold entanglement is possible even when there is no detuning in the parametric interaction. In both cases, a non-Gaussian state entanglement criterion is satisfied even at the threshold. Recent progress in nano-photonic devices might make it possible to experimentally demonstrate this phase transition in a coherent XY machine with quantum correlations.

TI Observation of multiple time crystals in a driven-dissipative system
   with Rydberg gas
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals and high-harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the non-equilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.

TI Deriving Three-Outcome Permutationally Invariant Bell Inequalities
SO ENTROPY
AB We present strategies to derive Bell inequalities valid for systems composed of many three-level parties. This scenario is formalized by a Bell experiment with N observers, each of which performs one out of two possible three-outcome measurements on their share of the system. As the complexity of the set of classical correlations prohibits its full characterization in this multipartite scenario, we consider its projection to a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by permutationally invariant one- and two-body observables. This simplification allows us to formulate two complementary methods for detecting nonlocality in multipartite three-level systems, both having a complexity independent of N. Our work can have interesting applications in the detection of Bell correlations in paradigmatic spin-1 models, as well as in experiments with solid-state systems or atomic ensembles.

TI Enhancing the estimation precision of an unknown phase shift in
   multipartite Glauber coherent states via skew information correlations
   and local quantum Fisher information
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) are both tools used to capture purely quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems. In this paper, we study these quantifiers in the case of multipartite Glauber coherent states, which include the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Werner states. We performa comparative study between LQFI and LQUin an isolated system. By using the Kraus operator representation, we study the behavior of these quantifiers on the dephasing channel to investigate their performances under the decoherence effect. In addition, the robustness to the decoherence effect of these two quantifiers is studied. We further examine the situation involving the multipartite Glauber coherent state to decide the sensitivity of the probe state as a resource for quantum estimation protocols.

TI Ticking-clock performance enhanced by nonclassical temporal correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the role of nonclassical temporal correlations in enhancing the performance of ticking clocks in a discrete-time scenario. We show that the problem of optimal models for ticking clocks is related to the violation of Leggett-Garg-type temporal inequalities formulated in terms of, possibly invasive, sequential measurements, but on a system with a bounded memory capacity. Ticking clocks inspire the derivation of a family of temporal inequalities showing a gap between classical and quantum correlations, despite involving no input. We show that quantum ticking-clock models achieving accuracy beyond the classical bound are also those violating Leggett-Garg-type temporal inequalities for finite sequences and we investigate their continuous-time limit. Interestingly, we show that optimal classical clock models in the discrete-time scenario do not have a well-defined continuous-time limit, a feature that is absent in quantum models.

TI Bulk area law for boundary entanglement in spin network states: Entropy
   corrections and horizon-like regions from volume correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB For quantum gravity states associated with open spin network graphs, we study how the entanglement entropy of the boundary degrees of freedom (spins on open edges) is affected by the bulk data, specifically by its combinatorial structure and by the quantum correlations among intertwiner degrees of freedom. For a specific assignment of bulk edge spins and slightly entangled intertwiners, we recover the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (with a properly discrete geometric notion of area, thanks to the underlying quantum gravity formalism) and its corrections due to the entanglement entropy of the bulk state. We also show that the presence of a region with highly entangled intertwiners deforms the minimal-area surface, which is then prevented from entering that region when the entanglement entropy of the latter exceeds a certain bound. This entanglement-based mechanism leads thus to the formation of a black hole-like region in the bulk.

TI Solution to the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process: The
   Continuous Case
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (Q-SSEP) is a model for quantum stochastic dynamics of fermions hopping along the edges of a graph with Brownian noisy amplitudes and driven out-of-equilibrium by injection-extraction processes at a few vertices. We present a solution for the invariant probability measure of the one dimensional Q-SSEP in the infinite size limit by constructing the steady correlation functions of the system density matrix and quantum expectation values. These correlation functions code for a rich structure of fluctuating quantum correlations and coherences. Although our construction does not rely on the standard techniques from the theory of integrable systems, it is based on a remarkable interplay between the permutation groups and polynomials. We incidentally point out a possible combinatorial interpretation of the Q-SSEP correlation functions via a surprising connexion with geometric combinatorics and the associahedron polytopes.

TI Quantum metrology of Schwinger effect
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We propose a scheme for the quantum metrology of the Schwinger effect and the dynamics of Gaussian interference power (GIP). The ongoing reliability of the estimation strategy for the probe state prepared in particle-particle modes is demonstrated. Although the GIP sensitively depends on the strength of the external electric field and the transverse momentum, the advantage of quantum parameter estimation is still maintained even in the limit of an infinite electric field and zero transverse momentum. It is shown that the entanglement between the particle-particle modes provides a guarantee for obtaining higher precision for the black-box estimation. In contrast, for the probe state prepared in particle-antiparticle modes, the advantage of quantum parameter estimation can also be ensured even though there is no entanglement in the probe state. Put differently, some non-entanglement quantum correlations play the role of quantum resources in the estimation for particle-antiparticle modes.

TI Fabrication-tolerant modal phase matching for all-optical frequency
   conversion in layer-poled thin film lithium niobate waveguide
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) combines strong second-order nonlinearity with low propagation loss, making it an ideal platform for on-chip frequency conversion and quantum light generation. Frequency conversion is usually achieved by quasi-phase matching (QPM) via electric-field poling. However, this scheme shows very high sensitivity to the dimensions of the waveguide, poling period, and duty cycle, resulting in a lack of repeatability of the phase matched wavelength and efficiency, which in turn limits the spread of TFLN frequency converters in complex circuits and hinders wafer-scale production. Here, we propose a layer-poled modal phase matching (MPM) that shows a phase matched wavelength 5-10 times less sensitive to fabrication uncertainties. By selectively poling the bottom part of the waveguide, the second harmonic is efficiently generated on a higher order waveguide mode. We validate this approach by poling foundry-fabricated TFLN waveguides as a post-process, performing a comprehensive tolerance analysis, and comparing the second harmonic generation (SHG) performance achieved with MPM to that of conventional QPM in the same waveguides. Finally, we demonstrate how our MPM can be exploited to obtain efficient intraband frequency conversion processes at telecom wavelengths by leveraging simultaneous SHG and difference frequency generation in the same waveguide. Our layer-poled MPM strategy relaxes critical fabrication constraints and paves the way for robust, reproducible TFLN frequency converters in quantum photonics, sensing, and optical communications.

TI Quantum coherence and quantum Fisher information of Dirac particles in
   curved spacetime under decoherence
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Previous studies have shown that the decoherence of environments generally negatively influences the quantum correlations in the Schwarzschild black hole. In our paper, we find that the decoherence of the generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channel has both positive and negative effects on the quantum coherence of Dirac fields, which means that the decoherence of environments can not only reduce the quantum coherence but also increase the quantum coherence in Schwarzschild spacetime. This result banishes the widespread belief that the decoherence of the environment can only destroy the quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Furthermore, another novel phenomenon has been observed for the first time: with increasing Hawking temperature T, the QFI of physically inaccessible modes rapidly decays from infinity to 0, which may provide a way to detect whether the particles enter the physically inaccessible region or not. This result may provide a new perspective for exploring and analyzing black holes.

AB In this article, we study the dynamics of quantum correlation measures such as entanglement and measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN). Starting from an arbitrary Bell-diagonal mixed state under Markovian local noise such as bit-phase flip, depolarizing and generalized amplitude damping channel, we provide the decays of the entanglement measured by concurrence and quantum correlation captured by different forms of MIN (trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt norm and relative entropy) as a function of the decoherence parameters. The effect of local noises on the dynamical behaviors of quantum correlation is also observed. We show the existence of specific and important features of MIN such as revival, noise robustness and sudden change with respect to decoherence parameter. It is observed that all the noises cause sudden death of entanglement for partially entangled states. Further, we show the existence of separable quantum states with non-zero quantum correlations in terms of MIN.

AB In this Letter, we give an analytical quantum description of a nonequilibrium polariton Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) based on the solution of the master equation for the full polariton density matrix in the limit of fast thermalization. We find the density matrix of a nonequilibrium BEC, that takes into account quantum correlations between all polariton states. We show that the formation of BEC is accompanied by the build-up of cross-correlations between the ground state and the excited states reaching their highest values at the condensation threshold. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of polariton systems, we show the average population of polariton states exhibits the Bose-Einstein distribution with an almost zero effective chemical potential above the condensation threshold similar to an equilibrium BEC. We demonstrate that above threshold the effective temperature of polaritons drops below the reservoir temperature.

TI Entanglement in three-flavor collective neutrino oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Extreme conditions present in the interiors of the core-collapse supernovae make neutrino-neutrino interactions not only feasible but dominant in specific regions, leading to the nonlinear evolution of the neutrino flavor. Results obtained when such collective neutrino oscillations are treated in the mean-field approximation deviate from the results using the many-body picture because of the ignored quantum correlations. We present the first three-flavor many-body calculations of the collective neutrino oscillations. The entanglement is quantified in terms of the entanglement entropy and the components of the polarization vector. We propose a qualitative measure of entanglement in terms of flavor-lepton number conserved quantities. We find that in the cases considered in the present work, the entanglement can be underestimated in the two-flavor approximation. The dependence of the entanglement on mass ordering is also investigated. We also explore the mixing of mass eigenstates in different mass orderings.

TI Dynamical resistivity of a few interacting fermions to the

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the dynamical response of a harmonically trapped two-component few-fermion mixture to the external Gaussian potential barrier moving across the system. The simultaneous role played by inter-particle interactions, rapidity of the barrier, and the fermionic statistics is explored for systems containing up to four particles. The response is quantified in terms of the temporal fidelity of the time-evolved state and the amount of quantum correlations between components being dynamically generated. Results are also supported by analysis of the single-particle densities and temporal number of occupied many-body eigenstates. In this way, we show that the dynamical properties of the system crucially depend on non-trivial mutual relations between temporal many-body eigenstates, and in consequence, they lead to volatility of the dynamics. Counterintuitively, imbalanced systems manifest much higher resistivity and stability than their balanced counterparts.

TI Quasiclassical model of inhomogeneous cosmology
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Fluctuation terms and higher moments of a quantum state imply corrections to the classical equations of motion that may have implications in early-Universe cosmology, for instance in the state-dependent form of effective potentials. In addition, space-time properties are relevant in cosmology, in particular when combined with quantum corrections required to maintain general covariance in a consistent way. Here, an extension of previous investigations of static quasiclassical space-time models to dynamical ones is presented, describing the evolution of one-dimensional space as in the classical Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models. The corresponding spatial metric has two independent components, both of which are in general subject to quantum fluctuations. The main result is that individual moments from both components are indeed required for general covariance to be maintained at a semiclassical level, while quantum correlations between the components are less relevant.

TI A scalable post quantum secure blockchain framework with adaptive time
   consensus in cloud environments
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Blockchain deployments continue to face challenges related to scalability, energy consumption, and susceptibility of classical cryptographic primitives to emerging quantum attacks. Conventional systems employing RSA or DSA signatures and consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) incur substantial computational overhead and are not well suited for cloud-scale execution. This study presents PQ-PoETChain, a post-quantum-secure blockchain model integrating NTRU-based signatures, an adaptive Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) protocol executed within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and a Lightweight Hash Validation (LHV) mechanism. The framework was implemented in Python and evaluated in a controlled simulation environment using 50-1000 nodes, with repeated trials to measure variability across throughput, latency, and energy metrics. NTRU demonstrated sub-2 ms signature operations, while the adaptive PoET configuration reduced consensus delay under load-dependent conditions. Across multiple experimental runs, the system achieved an average throughput of similar to 195 TPS with a latency of 189 +/- 4 ms at 500 nodes. Energy consumption reduced by up to 91.8% (+/- 1.6%) when compared with PoW under identical conditions. LHV further lowered verification cost by replacing Merkle-tree traversal with constant-time hash-pointer validation. Results indicate that PQ-PoETChain offers a balanced combination of quantum-resilient security and improved performance characteristics suitable for cloud-native and large-scale deployments.

TI Single Trace Analysis of Visible vs. Invisible Leakage for
   Comparison-Operation-Based CDT Sampling
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The emergence of quantum computers poses a significant threat to the security of conventional public-key cryptosystems, driving the demand for quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a multi-year competition, ultimately selecting four ciphers. Among these, Falcon employs cumulative distribution table (CDT) sampling, which produces arrays of random values derived from a discrete Gaussian distribution during the signature generation phase. This array is then used with secret key information, forming the core of Falcon. Enhanced variants of Falcon, such as Mitaka, SOLMAE, and Antrag, implemented CDT sampling using comparison operations. Previous research by Choi et al. proposed a single trace analysis and countermeasure for CDT sampling, which exploited a non-constant-time vulnerability in 8-bit AVR microcontrollers. However, this vulnerability is specific to certain environments, and a potential vulnerability in comparison-operation-based constant-time CDT sampling remains unstudied. This paper is an extension of that study. This paper investigates the constant-time operation of comparison-operation-based CDT sampling on Arm Cortex-M4-based chips and proposes a deep learning-based side-channel analysis to recover the sampling values using a novel vulnerability. The proposed model achieves an F1 score of 1.0 and a recovery success rate of 99.97%.

TI Bismuth surfactant-enhanced III-As epitaxy on GaAs(111)A
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum dot (QD) growth on high (c(3v)) symmetry GaAs{111} surfaces holds promise for efficient entangled photon sources. Unfortunately, homoepitaxy on GaAs{111} surfaces suffers from surface roughness/defects and InAs deposition does not natively support Stranski-Krastanov QD growth. Surfactants have been identified as effective tools to alter the epitaxial growth process of III-V materials, however, their use remains unexplored on GaAs{111}. Here, we investigate Bi as a surfactant in III-As molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(111)A substrates, demonstrating that Bi can eliminate surface defects/hillocks in GaAs and (Al,Ga)As layers, yielding atomically-smooth hillock-free surfaces with RMS roughness values as low as 0.13 nm. Increasing Bi fluxes are found to result in smoother surfaces and Bi is observed to increase adatom diffusion. The Bi surfactant is also shown to trigger a morphological transition in InAs/GaAs(111)A films, directing the 2D InAs layer to rearrange into 3D nanostructures, which are promising candidates for high-symmetry QDs. The desorption activation energy (U-Des) of Bi on GaAs(111)A was measured by reflection high energy electron diffraction, yielding U-Des = 1.7 +/- 0.4 eV. These results illustrate the potential of Bi surfactants on GaAs(111)A and will help pave the way for GaAs(111)A as a platform for technological applications including quantum photonics.

TI Legal Issues in the Introduction of Compelled Decryption According to
   Device Unlock Limits br
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB With the emergence of advanced encryption technologies such as Quantum Cryptography and Full Disk Encryption, an era of strengthening information security has begun. Users respond positively to the advancement of privacy-enhancing technology, on the other hand, investigative agencies have difficulty unveiling the actual truth as they fail to decrypt devices.In particular, unlike past ciphers, encryption methods using biometric information such as fingerprints, iris, and faces have become common and have faced technical limitations in collecting digital evidence. Accordingly, normative solutions have emerged as a major issue. The United States enacted the CLOUD Act with the legal mechanism of 'Contempt of court' and in 2016, the United Kingdom substantiated the Compelled Decryption through the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA). However, it is difficult to enforce Compelled Decryption on individuals in Korea because Korean is highly sensitive to personal information. Therefore, in this paper, we sought a method of introducing a Compelled Decryption that does not contradict the people's legal sentiment through a perception survey of 95 people on the Compelled Decryption. We tried to compare and review the Budapest Convention with major overseas laws such as the United States and the United Kingdom, and to suggest a direction of legislation acceptable to the people in ways to minimize infringement of privacy. We hope that this study will be an effective legal response plan for law enforcement agencies that can normatively overcome the technical limitations of decoding.

TI Sequential Quantum Measurements and the Instrumental Group Algebra
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Many of the most fundamental observables-position, momentum, phase point, and spin direction-cannot be measured by an instrument that obeys the orthogonal projection postulate. Continuous-in-time measurements provide the missing theoretical framework to make physical sense of such observables. The elements of the time-dependent instrument define a group called the instrumental group (IG). Relative to the IG, all of the time dependence is contained in a certain function called the Kraus-operator density (KOD), which evolves according to a classical Kolmogorov equation. Unlike the Lindblad master equation, the KOD Kolmogorov equation is a direct expression of how the elements of the instrument (not just the total quantum channel) evolve. Shifting from continuous measurements to sequential measurements more generally, the structure of combining instruments in sequence is shown to correspond to the convolution of their KODs. This convolution promotes the IG to an involutive Banach algebra (a structure that goes all the way back to the origins of POVM and C*-algebra theory), which will be called the instrumental group algebra (IGA). The IGA is the true home of the KOD, similar to how the dual of a von Neumann algebra is the true home of the density operator. Operators on the IGA, which play the analogous role for KODs as superoperators play for density operators, are called ultraoperators and various important examples are discussed. Certain ultraoperator-superoperator intertwining relationships are also considered throughout, including the relationship between the KOD Kolmogorov equation and the Lindblad master equation. The IGA is also shown to have actually two distinct involutions: one respected by the convolution ultraoperators and the other by the quantum channel superoperators. Finally, the KOD Kolmogorov generators are derived for jump processes and more general diffusive processes.

TI Dissipative quasiparticle picture for quadratic Markovian open quantum
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Correlations between different regions of a quantum many-body system can be quantified through measures based on entropies of (reduced) subsystem states. For closed systems, several analytical and numerical tools, e.g., hydrodynamic theories or tensor networks, can accurately capture the time evolution of subsystem entropies, thus allowing for a profound understanding of the unitary dynamics of quantum correlations. However, these methods either cannot be applied to open quantum systems or do not permit an efficient computation of quantum entropies for mixed states. Here we make progress in solving this issue by developing a dissipative quasiparticle picture- describing quantum entropies and the mutual information in the limit of large space-time coordinates with their ratio being fixed-and showing its validity for quadratic open quantum systems. Our results demonstrate that the open quantum many-body dynamics of correlations can be understood in terms of propagating (dissipative) quasiparticles.

TI A scaling function for the particle entanglement entropy of fermions
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB Entanglement entropy under a particle bipartition generates complementary information to mode entanglement because it is sensitive to interactions and particle statistics at leading order and does not depend on any externally imposed length scale. In this paper, we investigate the particle entanglement entropy in a system of N interacting spinless lattice fermions in one spatial dimension by combining bosonization techniques with exact and approximate numerical methods. We introduce a general scaling form for the fermionic particle entanglement entropy captured by a shape function that enters as an extensive interaction-induced correction to a known free fermion result. A general asymptotic expansion in the total number of particles demonstrates that its form is robust for different values of the Renyi index and highlights how quantum correlations are encoded in the n-particle density matrix of a pure many-body quantum state.

TI Functional theory for Bose-Einstein condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One-particle reduced density matrix functional theory would potentially be the ideal approach for describing Bose-Einstein condensates. It namely replaces the macroscopically complex wave function by the simple one-particle reduced density matrix, and therefore provides direct access to the degree of condensation and still recovers quantum correlations in an exact manner. We initiate and establish this theory by deriving the respective universal functional F for homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates with arbitrary pair interaction. Most importantly, the successful derivation necessitates a particle-number conserving modification of Bogoliubov theory and a solution of the common phase dilemma of functional theories. We then illustrate this approach in several bosonic systems such as homogeneous Bose gases and the Bose-Hubbard model. Remarkably, the general form of F reveals the existence of a universal Bose-Einstein condensation force which provides an alternative and more fundamental explanation for quantum depletion.

TI Dealing With Tensions in Increasingly Digitalized and Intelligent
   Complex Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB In this article, we explore how organizations deal with the many entangled tensions involved in the engineering and management of increasingly digitalized and intelligent complex systems. By applying a quantum perspective on tensions, and an understanding of tensions based on their salience, a framework is developed for observing, acting, and reacting on a large set of entangled tensions, as a continuum of tensions. The well-documented case of Boeing 737 MAX is used to explore the extensive set of entangled tensions involved in the development of complex systems and the possibilities to act on these tensions. The analysis shows that an actionability perspective on the dialectic tensions potentially offers a deep insight into the challenges that organizations are facing when engineering complex systems. Two major aspects emerge as crucial for addressing complex systems: First, actionable salience as the ability of an organization to identify and select important tensions in several perspectives, and second, actionable resolution as the ability to address and resolve a set of salient, often complex, and entangled tensions that have been identified. Opportunities for further research are identified in relation to the management of increasingly digitalized complex systems and the emergence of complex intelligent systems.

TI Broadband Vortex Beam Modulating System Based on Electrically Controlled
   Liquid Crystal Devices
SO PHOTONICS
AB Vortex beams with helical phase wavefronts have recently emerged as a research hotspot because of their widespread applications such as ultra-high dimensional information encoding, quantum entanglement, and data transmission due to their unique properties. Research, as of yet, on the easy preparation of vector vortex beams is hindered by technical bottlenecks such as large mechanical modulation errors and limited bandwidths of meta-structured devices in spite of the massive experimental and theoretical breakthroughs in the generation of vortex beams that have been made. To make up for the deficiency in this area, we propose here a broadband vortex beam modulating system based on electrically controlled liquid crystal (LC) devices. An electrically controlled LC q-plate and an LC broadband polarization grating (PG) are integrated in the system as the crux devices. The system enables pure vortex-phase modulation within a wide spectral range in the visible spectrum and electrical control on the output beam intensity of the vortex and Gaussian components. Experiments at different voltages of 533 nm and 632.8 nm were conducted for validation. This system overcomes the complexity and stringent optical path requirements of traditional methods for generating vortex beams, offering an efficient, convenient, and rapidly tunable approach for generating vortex beams that is easily and highly integrable.

TI Entanglement fractalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the GioevKlich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an "entanglement fractal" in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.

TI An artificial spiking quantum neuron
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Artificial spiking neural networks have found applications in areas where the temporal nature of activation offers an advantage, such as time series prediction and signal processing. To improve their efficiency, spiking architectures often run on custom-designed neuromorphic hardware, but, despite their attractive properties, these implementations have been limited to digital systems. We describe an artificial quantum spiking neuron that relies on the dynamical evolution of two easy to implement Hamiltonians and subsequent local measurements. The architecture allows exploiting complex amplitudes and back-action from measurements to influence the input. This approach to learning protocols is advantageous in the case where the input and output of the system are both quantum states. We demonstrate this through the classification of Bell pairs which can be seen as a certification protocol. Stacking the introduced elementary building blocks into larger networks combines the spatiotemporal features of a spiking neural network with the non-local quantum correlations across the graph.

TI Memory Effects in High-Dimensional Systems Faithfully Identified by
   Hilbert-Schmidt Speed-Based Witness
SO ENTROPY
AB A witness of non-Markovianity based on the Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS), a special type of quantum statistical speed, has been recently introduced for low-dimensional quantum systems. Such a non-Markovianity witness is particularly useful, being easily computable since no diagonalization of the system density matrix is required. We investigate the sensitivity of this HSS-based witness to detect non-Markovianity in various high-dimensional and multipartite open quantum systems with finite Hilbert spaces. We find that the time behaviors of the HSS-based witness are always in agreement with those of quantum negativity or quantum correlation measure. These results show that the HSS-based witness is a faithful identifier of the memory effects appearing in the quantum evolution of a high-dimensional system with a finite Hilbert space.

TI DGMT: A Fully Dynamic Group Signature from Symmetric-Key Primitives
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB A group signature scheme allows a user to sign a message anonymously on behalf of a group and provides accountability by using an opening authority who can "open" a signature and reveal the signer's identity. Group signature schemes have been widely used in privacy-preserving applications, including anonymous attestation and anonymous authentication. Fully dynamic group signature schemes allow new members to join the group and existing members to be revoked if needed. Symmetric-key based group signature schemes are post-quantum group signatures whose security rely on the security of symmetric-key primitives, and cryptographic hash functions. In this paper, we design a symmetric-key based fully dynamic group signature scheme, called DGMT, that redesigns DGM (Buser et al. ESORICS 2019) and removes its two important shortcomings that limit its application in practice: (i) interaction with the group manager for signature verification, and (ii) the need for storing and managing an unacceptably large amount of data by the group manager. We prove security of DGMT (unforgeability, anonymity, and traceability) and give a full implementation of the system. Compared to all known post-quantum group signature schemes with the same security level, DGMT has the shortest signature size. We also analyze DGM signature revocation approach and show that despite its conceptual novelty, it has significant hidden costs that makes it much more costly than using the traditional revocation list approach.

TI Wideband, large mode field and single vector mode transmission in a
   37-cell hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Stable generation and propagation of ultrafast high-order mode beams has become an important research direction. A core diameter not more than 10 times the wavelength is regarded as the upper limit for single mode transmission. However, a high-power laser requires a core diameter 20 to 40 times the wavelength to achieve high-power and stable output, which exceeds the design limit of the traditional fiber. In this paper, a novel 37-cell hollow core photonic bandgap fiber (HC-PBF) that only supports pure TE01 mode over a bandwidth of 50 nm with the lowest loss of 0.127 dB/km is proposed. The HC-PBF has a core diameter of more than 40 mu m. Single mode guidance is achieved by adjusting the lattice size in a particular of the cladding. The best single mode performance with a loss ratio as high as 150,000 between TE01 mode and other modes with minimum loss is obtained. The fiber also has low bend-loss and thus can be coiled to a small bend radius of 1 cm having 1.6 dB/km bend loss. The tunability of the single-mode window and the manufacturing feasibility of the proposed fiber are also discussed.

TI Diameter measurement of nano/micro-optical fiber based on effective
   refractive index including uncertainty analysis with Monte Carlo
   simulation
SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR
   PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Optical fibers with diameters of a few micrometers or less are essential devices in next-generation optical circuits and quantum photonics, so an accurate measurement technique of the fiber diameter is indispensable for performing their functions. Because nano/micro-optical fibers form an evanescent light field around their surface, the effective refractive index depends on the cross-sectional area of the optical fiber and the surrounding air, which also determines the propagation constant of the propagating light in the fiber. Based on the optical relationship, we proposed a principle to measure the fiber diameter by measuring the propagation constant with the scanning near field optical (SNOM) probe, and evaluated its measurement performance by means of uncertainty analysis. The proposed method is measurable in the single mode region, so that, for example, using 1550 nm, a diameter range from 350 nm to 1.1 mu m can be measured. Detailed experimental evaluations of the measurement reliability were conducted, and then, the uncertainty of measurement was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the results of the uncertainty analysis, it was stated that the uncertainty of measurement can be minimized in diameter measurement by optimizing the working wavelength of the measurement system. It was experimentally shown that a relative uncertainty of about +/- 5.7 % (k = 2) was possible.

TI Cosmic inflation from entangled qubits: a white hole model for emergent
   spacetime
SO GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
AB This paper presents the Horizon Model (HM) of cosmology, designed to resolve the cosmological constant problem by equating the vacuum energy density with that of the observable universe. Grounded in quantum information theory, HM proposes the first element of reality emerging from the Big Bang singularity as a Planck-sized qubit. The model views the Big Bang as the opening of a white hole, with spacetime and matter/energy emerging from the event horizon. Using the Schwarzschild solution and the Holographic Principle, HM calculates the number of vacuum qubits needed to equalize densities, and compares this to published estimates of the observable universe's Shannon entropy (S). With this information, HM can calculate the state of the vacuum as a function of S.

TI A numerical method for designing topological superconductivity induced
   by s-wave pairing
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Topological superconductors have garnered significant attention due to their potential for realizing topological quantum computation. However, a universal computational tool based on first-principles calculations for predicting topological superconductivity has not yet been fully developed, posing substantial challenges in identifying topological superconducting materials. In this paper, we present a numerical method to characterize the superconducting spectrum and topological invariants of two-dimensional (2D) slab systems using first-principles band structure, implemented in the open-source software WannierTools. To more accurately model the superconducting proximity effect, we integrate a phenomenological theory of SC pairing decay module into the program. Our approach can be applied to classical superconductor-topological insulator (SC-TI) heterostructures, SC-semiconductor heterostructures, and intrinsic topological superconductors. The program's validity is demonstrated using the topological crystal insulator SnTe, the Rashba semiconductor InSb, and the superconductor NbSe2 as examples. We anticipate that this tool will accelerate the discovery of topological superconductor candidates.

TI Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ultracold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector, and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.

TI Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles:
   Emerging Challenges and Advanced Countermeasures
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, commercial, and surveillance operations has introduced significant security challenges, including cyber threats, adversarial AI attacks, and communication vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the key security threats and challenges faced by AI-powered UAVs, such as unauthorized access, GPS spoofing, adversarial manipulations, and UAV hijacking. We analyze advanced solutions including blockchain-secured UAV networks, post-quantum cryptography (PQC), adversarial AI training, self-healing AI models, and multi-factor authentication (MFA), which collectively strengthen UAV cybersecurity defenses. Our findings highlight the critical role of emerging technologies, including self-adaptive AI-driven UAVs capable of detecting and learning from novel cyber threats autonomously. We also discuss the integration of 6 G-powered communication networks for secure and ultra-fast encrypted transmissions, as well as Edge AI computing that enables real-time, onboard threat detection without cloud dependency. Furthermore, decentralized intelligence models and blockchain-based authentication are shown to enhance security in UAV swarms by preventing unauthorized infiltration. Overall, this review emphasizes the necessity of multilayered security frameworks that combine AI techniques, cryptographic measures, and decentralized swarm protection to ensure resilient, autonomous, and secure UAV operations in complex and high-risk environments.

TI Sabotaging the harvesting of correlations from quantum fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study the nonperturbative harvesting of classical and quantum correlations between two parties coupled to a quantum field. First, we consider a scenario with an arbitrary number of two-level systems that couple to a quantum field locally in time. Then, we study the impact of the presence of additional detectors (interlopers) on the ability for two target detectors (Alice and Bob) to acquire correlations through their interaction with the field. We analyze the harvesting of different correlation measures in this nonperturbative regime and we demonstrate that even a single interloper can completely sabotage all correlation harvesting between Alice and Bob by acting on the causal past of one of them. Specifically, we show that the interloper is able to interact with the field so that the field itself "floods" one of the parties with entropy. This prevents Alice and Bob from acquiring any correlations. Furthermore, we show that this kind of attack cannot be defended against.

TI Dynamics of an atomic system associated with a cavity-optomechanical
   system
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB This paper introduces the effective Hamiltonian of two two-level atoms inside a cavity with a movable mirror. The temporal evolution of the output density state that includes the interaction between movable mirror, atoms, and field is obtained. The dynamical properties of the quantum correlations of the system are studied via l(1)-norm of coherence, Entanglement of Formation (EoF) and Bell non-locality. The results shown that the phenomena of coherence, and non-locality are approached to the degree of entanglement as the initial atomic state is set in an excited state. However, different chaotic behavior is generated for the coherence at the initially mixed state. Overall, the temporal evolution of entanglement is an intermediate correlation that lies in between coherence and normalized Bell non-locality.

TI Hybrid Classical-Quantum Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Solving Integer
   Linear Problems
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum annealers are suited to solve several logistic optimization problems expressed in the QUBO formulation. However, the solutions proposed by the quantum annealers are generally not optimal, as thermal noise and other disturbing effects arise when the number of qubits involved in the calculation is too large. In order to deal with this issue, we propose the use of the classical branch-and-bound algorithm, that divides the problem into sub-problems which are described by a lower number of qubits. We analyze the performance of this method on two problems, the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem. Our results show the advantages of this method, that balances the number of steps that the algorithm has to make with the amount of error in the solution found by the quantum hardware that the user is willing to risk. The results are obtained using the commercially available quantum hardware D-Wave Advantage, and they outline the strategy for a practical application of the quantum annealers.

TI Genuine hidden nonlocality without entanglement: from the perspective of
   local discrimination
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum nonlocality without entanglement is a fantastic phenomenon in quantum theory. This kind of quantum nonlocality is based on the task of local discrimination of quantum states. Recently, Bandyopadhyay and Halder (2021 Phys. Rev. A 104 L050201) studied the problem: is there any set of orthogonal states which can be locally distinguishable, but under some orthogonality preserving local measurement, each outcome will lead to a locally indistinguishable set. The set with such property is called to have hidden nonlocality. Moreover, if such phenomenon can not arise from discarding subsystems which is termed as local irredundancy, we call it genuine hidden nonlocality. There, they presented several sets of entangled states with genuine hidden nonlocality. However, they doubted the existence of a set without entanglement but with genuine hidden nonlocality. In this paper, we eliminate this doubt by constructing a series of sets without entanglement but whose nonlocality can be genuinely activated. We derive a method to tackle with the local irredundancy problem which is a key tricky for the systems whose local dimensions are composite numbers. Unexpectedly, the constructions of genuine hidden nonlocal sets without entanglement seems to be easier than that with entanglement. Therefore, from this perspective, this kind of nonlocality is rather different from the Bell nonlocality.

TI A constant-size lattice-based partially-dynamic group signature scheme
   in quantum random oracle model
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB A group signature allows a group member who signs the message on behalf of the other group members. Any recipient also verifies the signature without knowing the signer. However, it is possible to reveal the signer's identity since the group signatures have the tracing mechanism. In general, the group signature size increases the number of group members. However, the schemes are also proposed with the constant signature size. On the other hand, the security of some schemes are based on the discrete logarithm and factorization problems while some schemes which are secure against quantum attacks are proposed. To the best of our knowledge, the signature scheme in the group concept has not been proposed on lattices in quantum oracles. In this paper, we propose a new constant-size and partially-dynamic group signature scheme on lattice assumptions. We combine the Dilithium signature scheme, a Stern-like zero-knowledge scheme and Regev's encryption scheme. We give a zero-knowledge argument system for our proposed scheme and security analysis in the quantum random oracle model. According to the comparison results, the proposed scheme has better size complexity in asymptotic concept. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

TI Efficient and Scalable FPGA Design of GF(2m) Inversion
   for Post-Quantum Cryptosystems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Post-quantum cryptosystems based on QC-MDPC codes are designed to mitigate the security threat posed by quantum computers to traditional public-key cryptography. The polynomial inversion is the core operation of key generation in such cryptosystems and the adoption of ephemeral keys imposes the execution of key generation for each session. To this end, there is a need for efficient and scalable hardware implementations of the binary polynomial inversion operation to support the key generation primitive across a wide range of computational platforms. This manuscript proposes an efficient and scalable architecture implementing the binary polynomial inversion at the hardware level. Our solution can deliver a performance-optimized implementation for the large polynomials used in post-quantum code-based cryptosystems and for each FPGA of the mid-range Xilinx Artix-7 family. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was validated by means of the BIKE and LEDAcrypt post-quantum QC-MDPC cryptosystems as representative use cases. Compared to the C11- and the optimized AVX2-based software implementations of LEDAcrypt, instances of the proposed architecture targeting the Artix-7 200 FPGA show an average performance improvement of 31.7 and 2.2 times, respectively. Moreover, the proposed architecture delivers a performance improvement up to 18.1 and 21.5 times for AES-128 and AES-192 security levels, respectively, compared to the BIKE hardware implementation.

TI Heterogeneous integration of silicon nitride and amorphous silicon
   carbide photonics
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for applications in integrated photonics, known for its high refractive index, high optical quality, high thermo-optic coefficient, and strong third-order nonlinearities. Furthermore, a-SiC can be easily deposited via CMOS-compatible chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, allowing for precise thickness control and adjustable material properties on arbitrary substrates. Silicon nitride (SiN) is an industrially well-established and well-matured platform, which exhibits ultra-low propagation loss, but it is suboptimal for high-density reconfigurable photonics due to the large minimum bending radius and constrained tunability. In this work, we monolithically combine the a-SiC with SiN photonics, leveraging the merits of both platforms, and achieve the a-SiC/SiN heterogeneous integration with an on-chip interconnection loss of ( 0.28(-0.28)(+0.44)) dB and integration density increment exceeding 4444-fold. By implementing active devices on the a-SiC, we achieve 27 times higher thermo-optic tuning efficiency, with respect to the SiN photonic platform. In addition, the a-SiC/SiN platform gives the flexibility to choose the optimal fiber-to-chip coupling strategy depending on the interfacing platform, with efficient side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on the a-SiC platform. The proposed a-SiC/SiN photonic platform can foster versatile applications in programmable and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.

TI Million-Q dual-polarization micro-Fabry-Perot resonators in silicon
   nitride photonic integrated circuits
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Miniaturized Fabry-Pe<acute accent>rot standing-wave resonators and whispering-gallery travelling wave resonators constitute foundational building blocks for photonic integrated circuits. While both architectures offer transformative potential through high quality factors and dual-polarization operation, integrated Fabry-Pe<acute accent>rot resonators face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving ultra-high Q-factors and broadband thermal tunability for fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes within a compact footprint-primarily due to polarization-dependent losses in conventional chip-scale reflectors. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating an integrated silicon nitride dual-polarization micro-Fabry-Pe<acute accent>rot resonator with polarization-insensitive Sagnac loop reflectors and multimode waveguides to effectively suppress losses and enable high-performances for both fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes. The device achieves record loaded quality factors of 2.38 x 106 (TM0) and 3.48 x 105 (TE0) respectively and intrinsic quality factors will be even higher. Moreover, both two modes are tuned over the whole free spectral range of around 0.111 nm (TM0) and 0.112 nm (TE0) with the thermal tuning efficiencies of approximately 1.04 pm/mW (TM0) and 1.24 pm/mW (TE0). These advances establish a new benchmark for compact, highperformance dual-polarization resonators in optical sensors, nonlinear and integrated quantum photonics.

AB We provide a generic construction to turn any classical Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocol into a composable (quantum) oblivious transfer (OT) protocol, mostly lifting the round-complexity properties and security guarantees (plain-model/statistical security/unstructured functions. . .) of the ZK protocol to the resulting OT protocol. Such a construction is unlikely to exist classically as Cryptomania is believed to be different from Minicrypt.
   In particular, by instantiating our construction using Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK), we provide the first round-optimal (2-message) quantum OT protocol secure in the random oracle model, and round-optimal extensions to string and k-out-of-n OT.
   At the heart of our construction lies a new method that allows us to prove properties on a received quantum state without revealing additional information on it, even in a non-interactive way and/or with statistical guarantees when using an appropriate classical ZK protocol. We can notably prove that a state has been partially measured (with arbitrary constraints on the set of measured qubits), without revealing any additional information on this set. This notion can be seen as an analog of ZK to quantum states, and we expect it to be of independent interest as it extends complexity theory to quantum languages, as illustrated by the two new complexity classes we introduce, ZKstatesQIP and ZKstatesQMA.

TI The Non-Anthropocentric Other in Film: Towards a Spectral Ethics of Film
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB This article aims to add a further perspective to the discussion of the relationship between film and ethics. This perspective is important in today's context, as the omnipresence of digital and mobile audiovisual images in everyday life increasingly determines our thinking and behaviour. However, there is a lack of appropriate critical reflection and ethical understanding of these images and their ontology. This article proposes a machine ethics of film from a film-philosophical perspective. Such an ethics draws on critical posthumanism, namely on Karen Barad's "ethics of mattering", which explicitly relates to Emmanuel Levinas' philosophy of the Other and their death. Thereby, special attention is given to the ontological nexus of film and death, as well as to the idea of film's spectrality (drawing on, e.g., Derrida, Barthes, and Leutrat), a context that is discussed along with Barad's diffractive view on quantum entanglement. Following from the author's earlier approaches to Barad's agential realism in the context of film-philosophy and certain Heidegger-based arguments set out in earlier writings about film and death, this article introduces the figure of what is called the "machinic spectre of film". From here, the outline of a possible spectral ethics of film is considered by giving reasons for the exploration of further questions.

TI Theoretical investigation of dynamics and concurrence of entangled
   PT and anti-PT symmetric polarized photons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Non-Hermitian systems with parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-parity-time (APT) symmetry have exceptional points (EPs) resulting from eigenvector co-coalescence with exceptional properties. In the quantum and classical domains, higher-order EPs for PT symmetry and APT-symmetry systems have been proposed and realized. Both two-qubits APT-APT and PT-PT symmetric systems have seen an increase in recent years, especially in the dynamics of quantum entanglement. However, to our knowledge, neither theoretical nor experimental investigations have been conducted for the dynamics of two-qubits entanglement in the PT-APT symmetric system. We investigate the PT-APT dynamics for the first time. Moreover, we examine the impact of different initial Bell-state conditions on entanglement dynamics in PT-PT, APT-APT and PT-APT symmetric systems. Additionally, we conduct a comparative study of entanglement dynamics in the PT-PT symmetrical system, APT-APT symmetrical system, and PT-APT symmetrical systems in order to learn more about non-Hermitian quantum systems and their environments. Entangled qubits evolve in a PT-APT symmetric unbroken regime, the entanglement oscillates with two different oscillation frequencies, and the entanglement is well preserved for a long period of time for the case when non-Hermitian parts of both qubits are taken quite away from the exceptional points.

TI High-Efficiency Metamaterial-Engineered Grating Couplers for Silicon
   Nitride Photonics
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is an ideal candidate for the development of low-loss photonic integrated circuits. However, efficient light coupling between standard optical fibers and Si3N4 chips remains a significant challenge. For vertical grating couplers, the lower index contrast yields a weak grating strength, which translates to long diffractive structures, limiting the coupling performance. In response to the rise of hybrid photonic platforms, the adoption of multi-layer grating arrangements has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of Si3N4 couplers. In this work, we present the design of high-efficiency surface grating couplers for the Si3N4 platform with an amorphous silicon (alpha-Si) overlay. The surface grating, fully formed in an alpha-Si waveguide layer, utilizes subwavelength grating (SWG)-engineered metamaterials, enabling simple realization through single-step patterning. This not only provides an extra degree of freedom for controlling the fiber-chip coupling but also facilitates portability to existing foundry fabrication processes. Using rigorous three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, a metamaterial-engineered grating coupler is designed with a coupling efficiency of -1.7 dB at an operating wavelength of 1.31 mu m, with a 1 dB bandwidth of 31 nm. Our proposed design presents a novel approach to developing high-efficiency fiber-chip interfaces for the silicon nitride integration platform for a wide range of applications, including datacom and quantum photonics.

TI DARTPHROG: A Superscalar Homomorphic Accelerator
SO SENSORS
AB Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a client to share their data with an external server without ever exposing their data. FHE serves as a potential solution for data breaches and the marketing of users' private data. Unfortunately, FHE is much slower than conventional asymmetric cryptography, where data are encrypted only between endpoints. Within this work, we propose the Dynamic AcceleRaTor for Parallel Homomorphic pROGrams, DARTPHROG, as a potential tool for accelerating FHE. DARTPHROG is a superscalar architecture, allowing multiple homomorphic operations to be executed in parallel. Furthermore, DARTPHROG is the first to utilize the new Hardware Optimized Modular-Reduction (HOM-R) system, showcasing the uniquely efficient method compared to Barrett and Montgomery reduction. Coming in at 40.5 W, DARTPHROG is one of the smaller architectures for FHE acceleration. Our architecture offers speedups of up to 1860 times for primitive FHE operations such as ciphertext/plaintext and ciphertext/ciphertext addition, subtraction, and multiplication when operations are performed in parallel using the superscalar feature in DARTPHROG. The DARTPHROG system implements an assembler, a unique instruction set based on THUMB, and a homomorphic processor implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). DARTPHROG is also the first superscalar evaluation of homomorphic operations when the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is excluded from the design. Our processor can therefore be used as a base case for evaluation when weighing the resource and execution impact of NTT implementations.

TI Hardness estimates of the code equivalence problem in the rank metric
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB In this paper, we analyze the hardness of the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) problem for matrix codes endowed with the rank metric, and provide the first algorithms for solving it. We do this by making a connection to another well-known equivalence problem from multivariate cryptography-the Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP). Under mild assumptions, we give tight reductions from MCE to the homogenous version of the Quadratic Maps Linear Equivalence (QMLE) problem, and vice versa. Furthermore, we present reductions to and from similar problems in the sum-rank metric, showing that MCE is at the core of code equivalence problems. On the practical side, using birthday techniques known for IP, we present two algorithms: a probabilistic algorithm for MCE running in time q23(n+m)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$q<^>{\frac{2}{3}(n+m)}$$\end{document} up to a polynomial factor, and a deterministic algorithm for MCE with roots, running in time qmin{m,n,k}\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$q<^>{\min \{m,n,k\}}$$\end{document} up to a polynomial factor. Lastly, to confirm these findings, we solve randomly-generated instances of MCE using these two algorithms.

TI Generic, efficient and isochronous Gaussian sampling over the integers
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB Gaussian sampling over the integers is one of the fundamental building blocks of lattice-based cryptography. Among the extensively used trapdoor sampling algorithms, it is ineluctable until now. Under the influence of numerous side-channel attacks, it is still challenging to construct a Gaussian sampler that is generic, efficient, and resistant to timing attacks. In this paper, our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a secure, efficient exponential Bernoulli sampling algorithm. It can be applied to Gaussian samplers based on rejection samplings. We apply it to FALCON, a candidate of round 3 of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization project, and reduce its signature generation time by 13-14%. Second, we develop an isochronous Gaussian sampler based on rejection sampling. Our Algorithm can securely sample from Gaussian distributions with different standard deviations and arbitrary centers. We apply it to PALISADE (S&P 2018), an open-source lattice-based cryptography library. During the online phase of trapdoor sampling, the running time of the G-lattice sampling algorithm is reduced by 44.12% while resisting timing attacks. Third, we improve the efficiency of the COSAC sampler (PQC 2020). The new COSAC sampler is 1.46x-1.63x faster than the original and has the lowest expected number of trials among all Gaussian samplers based on rejection samplings. But it needs a more efficient algorithm sampling from the normal distribution to improve its performance.

TI General Bound on the Performance of Counter-Diabatic Driving Acting on
   Dissipative Spin Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Counter-diabatic driving (CD) is a technique in quantum control theory designed to counteract nonadiabatic excitations and guide the system to follow its instantaneous energy eigenstates, and hence has applications in state preparation, quantum annealing, and quantum thermodynamics. However, in many practical situations, the effect of the environment cannot be neglected, and the performance of the CD is expected to degrade. To arrive at general bounds on the resulting error of CD in this situation we consider a driven spin-boson model as a prototypical setup. The inequalities we obtain, in terms of either the Bures angle or the fidelity, allow us to estimate the maximum error solely characterized by the parameters of the system and the bath. By utilizing the analytical form of the upper bound, we demonstrate that the error can be systematically reduced through optimization of the external driving protocol of the system. We also show that if we allow a time-dependent system-bath coupling angle, the obtained bound can be saturated and realizes unit fidelity.

We design distillation circuits from n raw Bell pairs to k purified pairs and study the use of these circuits in the teleportation of logical qubits. The resulting purification circuits are the best-known for finite-size noisy hardware and can be fine-tuned for specific error-models. Furthermore, we design purification circuits that shape the correlations of errors in the purified pairs such that the performance of potential error-correcting codes is greatly improved.

TI Imaging Quantum Interference in a Monolayer Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
   Candidate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement. Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer alpha-RuCl3, the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations unique to alpha-RuCl3. Numerical simulations suggest that the observed oscillation can be reproduced by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects like Friedel oscillations in metals.

TI Crossover behaviors of entanglement dynamics at the critical point in
   XXZ spin chain
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the crossover behaviors of entanglement and return probability at the critical point in one-dimensional XXZ model by quantum renormalization group method. Two types of quench protocols (A) adding the interaction term in z spin direction suddenly and (B) rotating all the even spins by ⠙ about the z spin direction suddenly are considered to drive the dynamics of the system, respectively. The dynamical behaviors are closely related to the initial state under two types of quench protocols, especially at N -> infinity. For the left of critical point, return probabilities eventually approach one under both types of quench protocols. For the right of critical point, return probability oscillates between the maximum value and zero for quench A and tends to one for quench B, respectively. In addition, we discuss the evolution period of entanglement (return probability), find that it is positively and negatively correlated with N in the spin -fluid and Neel phases, respectively. By further analyzing the behaviors of entanglement, return probability and evolution period under both types of quench protocols near the critical point, we observe that they exist the same scaling behaviors, in which the exponents are identical to entanglement exponent of the stationary system, which is related to the results of renormalization group.

TI Entanglement degradation in multi-event horizon spacetimes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime, by studying the mutual information and the logarithmic negativity for maximally entangled, bipartite states for massless minimal scalar fields. This spacetime is endowed with a black hole as well as a cosmological event horizon, giving rise to particle creation at two different temperatures. We consider two independent descriptions of thermodynamics and particle creation in this background. The first involves thermal equilibrium of an observer with either of the horizons. We show that as of the asymptotically flat/ anti-de Sitter black holes, in this case, the entanglement or correlation degrades with increasing Hawking temperatures. The second treats both the horizons combined in order to define a total entropy and an effective equilibrium temperature. We present a field theoretic derivation of this effective temperature and show that unlike the usual cases, the particle creation does not occur here in causally disconnected spacetime wedges but instead in a single region. Using the associated vacua, we show that in this scenario, the entanglement never degrades but increases with increasing black hole temperature and holds true no matter how hot the black hole becomes or how small the cosmological constant is. We argue that this phenomenon can have no analogue in the asymptotically flat/anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes.

AB Optical vortices, the spatial modes of an electromagnetic wave carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), have attracted increasing interest because of their potential for applications in optical communication with enhanced security and channel capacity. A unique optical vortex (OV) generation method has been recently proposed based on the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase induced by the winding topology of polarization around a vortex singularity at bound states in the continuum (BIC). Compared with the recently emergent metasurface-based OV generators, which rely on spatial variations, the BIC-based OV generators have yielded advances in terms of design feasibility, fabrication complexity, and robustness. However, their applications in practical photonic systems are currently limited because OV generations from BIC-related devices originate from the topological property of the photonic bands and cannot be dynamically altered. Here, by leveraging the vortex topology in momentum space together with the nonlinear dynamics of silicon, we demonstrate that a silicon photonic crystal slab can realize optically switchable OV generation. In particular, the spatial tunability and the switching effects in the picosecond scale are studied using nonlinear modeling at near-infrared wavelengths. The demonstrated nontrivial topological nature of the active generators can expand the application of BIC-based devices to include ultrafast vortex beam generation, high-capacity optical communication, and mode-division multiplexing.

TI Optical Probe of Magnetic Ordering Structure and Spin-Entangled Excitons
   in Mn-Substituted NiPS3
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB In van der Waals magnets, the interplay between magneto-excitonic coupling and optical phenomena opens avenues for directly probing magnetic ordering structures, manipulating excitonic properties through magnetic fields, and exploring quantum entanglement between electronic and magnetic states. Notably, NiPS3 stands out for its capacity to host spin-entangled excitons, where the excitonic states are intricately tied with the material's spin configuration. Herein, it is experimentally showcased that the spin-entangled excitons can be utilized for detecting the magnetic easy axis in Ni1-xMnxPS3 (x = 0-0.1). The end members of this series exhibit distinct magnetic ordering patterns and easy axes: zigzag ordering with magnetic moments aligned along the a-axis for NiPS3 versus N & eacute;el ordering with the out-of-plane easy axis for MnPS3. By combining angle-resolved exciton photoluminescence with magnetic susceptibility measurements, it is observed that the magnetic easy axis rotates away from the local spin chain direction with increasing Mn content. Moreover, through a comprehensive thermal and substitution study, it is demonstrated that the energy and lifetime of spin-entangled excitons are governed by two spin-flip processes and are drastically influenced by disparate electronic states. These findings not only provide optical means to map out magnetic ordering structures but also offer insights into decoherence processes in spin-exciton entangled states.

TI Improving the Performance of Cooling and Entanglement in a Double Cavity
   Optomechanical System Assisted by the Quantum Coherent Feedback
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A theoretical scheme is proposed for improving the performance of cooling and entanglement, where the physical model is based on a double cavity optomechanical system assisted by the field-mediated coherent feedback. The cooling performance is evaluated by calculating the final mean phonon number. The steady-state bipartite entanglement between the optical mode and mechanical mode is measured by the logarithmic negativity. The result manifests that with assistance of the quantum coherent feedback, the mechanical resonator (MR) can be cooled close to its quantum ground state and the steady-state optomechanical entanglement is simultaneously created, all of which are obtained under the condition beyond the resolved sideband. The presented feedback strategy is measurement-independent, which can effectively preserve the quantum coherence of system. The scheme is conducive to relaxing the current experimental condition and it may provide a new path for the optomechanical manipulation involving the low-frequency MR.

TI 60 nm Span Wavelength-Tunable Vortex Fiber Laser with Intracavity
   Plasmon Metasurfaces
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Wavelength-tunable vortex fiber lasers that could generate beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) hold great attention in large-capacity optical communications. The wavelength tunability of conventional vortex fiber lasers is, however, limited by a range of similar to 35 nm due to narrow bandwidth and/or insertion loss of mode conversion components. Optical metasurfaces apart from being compact planar components can flexibly manipulate light with high efficiency in a broad wavelength range. Here, we propose and demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metasurface-assisted vortex fiber laser that can directly generate OAM beams with customizable topological charges. Due to the designed broadband gap-surface plasmon metasur-face, combined with an intracavity tunable filter, the laser enables an OAM beam with a center wavelength continuously tunable from 1015 to 1075 nm, nearly twice of other vortex fiber lasers ever reported. The metasurface can be designed at will to satisfy requirements for either low pump threshold or high slope efficiency of the laser. Furthermore, the cavity-metasurface configuration can be extended to generate higher-order OAM beams or more complex structured beams in different wavelength regions, which greatly broadens the possibilities for developing low-cost and high-quality structured-beam laser sources.

TI Cavity-Heisenberg spin-j chain quantum battery and reinforcement
   learning optimization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the realm of quantum batteries (QBs), model construction and performance optimization are central tasks which can be addressed by exploiting machine learning algorithms. Here, we propose a cavity-Heisenberg spin chain QB model with spin- j (j=1/2,1,3/2) and investigate the charging performance under both closed and open quantum cases, considering spin-spin interactions, ambient temperature, and cavity dissipation. By employing a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to modulate the cavity-battery coupling, we further optimize the QB performance, enhancing the charging capability of the spin chain. It is shown that the charging energy and the power of the QB are significantly improved with the spin size. In particular, the use of a RL algorithm in case of large spin (j=3/2) in presence of cavity losses allows for more stability in the optimization of the cavity-spin coupling strength, which in perspective makes an experimental realization more feasible. We analyze the optimization mechanism and find an intrinsic relationship between cavity-spin entanglement and charging performance: while in the closed-system scenario the charging energy increases together with the cavity-spin entanglement, in the open-system scenario the increase of the charging energy can be accompanied by a decrease of entanglement. Our results provide a possible scheme for design and optimization of QBs.

TI Engineering and control of the entanglement for four Magnon modes inside
   two microwave cavities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a model for investigating the entanglement features of four magnon modes in four yttrium-iron-garnet spheres dispersed in two microwave cavities (each cavity containing two spheres), which are driven by a squeezed field under actual experimental conditions. Each two-magnon mode inside each cavity is coupled via a beam splitter. We solve the covariance matrix associated with the four magnons, taking into account the relevant physical parameters. To quantify the degree of entanglement, we use the logarithmic negativity measure. Our study focuses on two parts. First, we study the entanglement properties between magnon modes by modifying the system parameters, and comparing the results with those obtained when we use a single magnon in each cavity, i.e. when one of the two magnons is not coupled to the cavity. In the second part, we give a new method for enhancing and controlling entanglement between magnon modes. We analyze the case where one of the two magnons is not coupled to the cavity, which can result a significant entanglement. Indeed, this goal is met in our situation by including an effective magnon-magnon coupling into both cavities. However, at high temperatures, the entanglement is almost completely broken. It can withstand temperatures of up to hundreds of millikelvin when using an experimentally accessible two-mode squeezed source.

TI Quantum-enhanced sensing by echoing spin-nematic squeezing in atomic
   Bose-Einstein condensate
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entangled states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing. A protocol based on spin-nematic squeezed states of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates has now been used to achieve record metrological gains in nonlinear interferometry experiments.
   Quantum entanglement can provide enhanced measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the highest precision achievable with classical means. However, observations with a large enhancement remain challenging due to experimental limitations in the preparation, control and detection of entanglement. Here we report a nonlinear interferometry protocol with echoed spin-nematic squeezing in a spinor atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. We generate spin-nematic squeezed states through spin-mixing dynamics, an atomic analogue of optical four-wave mixing. The squeezed states are refocused back to the vicinity of the classical initial state by a state-flip operation that resembles spin-echo techniques, which leads to encoded phases preferentially amplified over noise. Using a large ensemble of 26,400 atoms, we observe a sensitivity of 15.6 & PLUSMN; 0.5 dB beyond the standard quantum limit for detecting small-angle Rabi rotation, as well as 16.6 & PLUSMN; 1.1 dB for phase sensing in a Ramsey-like interferometry application. Our results highlight the many-body coherence of spin-nematic squeezed states and point to their possible quantum metrological application in atomic magnetometers, atomic clocks and fundamental tests of Lorentz symmetry violations.

AB SPHINCS+ is a post-quantum signature scheme that, at the time of writing, is being standardized as SLH-DSA. It is the most conservative option for post-quantum signatures, but the original tight proofs of security were flawed- as reported by Kudinov, Kiktenko and Fedorov in 2020. In this work, we formally prove a tight security bound for SPHINCS+ using the EasyCrypt proof assistant, establishing greater confidence in the general security of the scheme and that of the parameter sets considered for standardization. To this end, we reconstruct the tight security proof presented by Hulsing and Kudinov (in 2022) in a modular way. A small but important part of this effort involves a complex argument relating four different games at once, of a form not yet formalized in EasyCrypt (to the best of our knowledge). We describe our approach to overcoming this major challenge, and develop a general formal verification technique aimed at this type of reasoning.
   Enhancing the set of reusable EasyCrypt artifacts previously produced in the formal verification of stateful hash-based cryptographic constructions, we (1) improve and extend the existing libraries for hash functions and (2) develop new libraries for fundamental concepts related to hash-based cryptographic constructions, including Merkle trees. These enhancements, along with the formal verification technique we develop, further ease future formal verification endeavors in EasyCrypt, especially those concerning hash-based cryptographic constructions.

TI A New Adaptive Attack on SIDH

CY MAR 01-02, 2022
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB The SIDH key exchange is the main building block of SIKE, the only isogeny based scheme involved in the NIST standardization process. In 2016, Galbraith et al. presented an adaptive attack on SIDH. In this attack, a malicious party manipulates the torsion points in his public key in order to recover an honest party's static secret key, when having access to a key exchange oracle. In 2017, Petit designed a passive attack (which was improved by de Quehen et al. in 2020) that exploits the torsion point information available in SIDH public key to recover the secret isogeny when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is known.
   In this paper, firstly, we generalize the torsion point attacks by de Quehen et al. Secondly, we introduce a new adaptive attack vector on SIDH-type schemes. Our attack uses the access to a key exchange oracle to recover the action of the secret isogeny on larger subgroups. This leads to an unbalanced SIDH instance for which the secret isogeny can be recovered in polynomial time using the generalized torsion point attacks. Our attack is different from the GPST adaptive attack and constitutes a new cryptanalytic tool for isogeny based cryptography. This result proves that the torsion point attacks are relevant to SIDH (Disclaimer: this result is applicable to SIDH-type schemes only, not to SIKE.) parameters in an adaptive attack setting. We suggest attack parameters for some SIDH primes and discuss some countermeasures.

TI Polarization-dependent optical engineering of ferroelectric domains
SO CHEMPHYSMATER
AB Ferroelectric domain engineering with infrared femtosecond laser pulses has been a powerful technique to achieve a spatially modulated second-order nonlinear coefficient in three dimensions. However, studies regarding the influence of laser writing conditions on the light-induced ferroelectric domain inversion remain limited. Herein, an experimental study to reveal the role of laser polarization in light-induced domain inversions is discussed. The dependence of the optical threshold and maximal writing depth of inverted domains on light polarization is experimentally investigated. The results are explained by considering the second-order nonlinear optical properties and birefringence-induced focus splitting in the crystal. These findings are useful in fabricating high-quality and large-scale ferroelectric domain structures for applications in optics, electronics, and quantum technologies.

TI An algebraic extension of intuitionistic linear logic: the

SO JOURNAL OF LOGIC AND COMPUTATION
AB We introduce the ${{\mathcal L}_!<^>{\mathcal S}}$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic. These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the ${{\mathcal L}_{!}<^>{\mathcal S}}$-calculus as an extension of the ${\mathcal L}<^>{\mathcal S}$-calculus with the ! modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties-subject reduction, confluence, strong normalization and an introduction property-as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original ${\mathcal L}<^>{\mathcal S}$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.

AB Quantum compilation is the problem of translating an input quantum circuit into the most efficient equivalent of itself, taking into account the characteristics of the device that will execute the computation. Compilation strategies are composed of sequential passes that perform placement, routing and optimization tasks. Noise-adaptive compilers do take the noise statistics of the device into account, for some or all passes. The noise statistics can be obtained from calibration data, and updated after each device calibration.
   In this paper, we propose a novel noise-adaptive compilation strategy that is computationally efficient. The proposed strategy assumes that the quantum device coupling map uses a heavy-hexagon lattice. Moreover, we present the application-motivated benchmarking of the proposed noise-adaptive compilation strategy, compared with some of the most advanced state-of-art approaches. The presented results seem to indicate that our compilation strategy is particularly effective for deep circuits and for square circuits.

TI Neural Field Continuum Limits and the Structure-Function Partitioning of
   Cognitive-Emotional Brain Networks
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary : Pessoa postulates that bran anatomy associated with the processing and expression of emotion-laden content, such as the amygdala and limbic cortices, is resource capacity-limited. Thus, brains require multichannel or parallel structure-function connectivity to effectively perceive, motivate, integrate, represent, recall, and execute cognitive-emotional relationships. Pessoa employs 2D graph network theory to support his views on distributed brain organization and operation, concluding that brains evolve through dual-process competition and cooperation to form highly embedded computational architectures with little structure-function compartmentalization. Low-dimensional graph theory has become a popular mathematical tool to model, simulate, and visualize evolving complex, sometimes intractable, brain networks. Graph theory offers advantages to study and understand various biological and technological network behaviors and, for Pessoa, it permits a framework that accounts for structure-function features thus far poorly explained by perhaps "traditional" perspectives, which advocate for the mapping of structure-function relationships onto well-localized brain areas. Pessoa nonetheless fails to fully appreciate the significance of weak-to-strong structure-function correlations for brain dynamics and why those correlations, caused by differential control parameters such as Hebbian and antiHebbian neuronal plasticity, are best assessed using neural field theories. Neural fields demonstrate that embedded brain networks optimally evolve between exotic computational phases and continuum limits with the accompaniment of some network partitioning, rather than unconstrained embeddedness, when rendering healthy cognitive-emotional functionality.In The cognitive-emotional brain, Pessoa overlooks continuum effects on nonlinear brain network connectivity by eschewing neural field theories and physiologically derived constructs representative of neuronal plasticity. The absence of this content, which is so very important for understanding the dynamic structure-function embedding and partitioning of brains, diminishes the rich competitive and cooperative nature of neural networks and trivializes Pessoa's arguments, and similar arguments by other authors, on the phylogenetic and operational significance of an optimally integrated brain filled with variable-strength neural connections. Riemannian neuromanifolds, containing limit-imposing metaplastic Hebbian- and antiHebbian-type control variables, simulate scalable network behavior that is difficult to capture from the simpler graph-theoretic analysis preferred by Pessoa and other neuroscientists. Field theories suggest the partitioning and performance benefits of embedded cognitive-emotional networks that optimally evolve between exotic classical and quantum computational phases, where matrix singularities and condensations produce degenerate structure-function homogeneities unrealistic of healthy brains. Some network partitioning, as opposed to unconstrained embeddedness, is thus required for effective execution of cognitive-emotional network functions and, in our new era of neuroscience, should be considered a critical aspect of proper brain organization and operation.

TI Practical Trainable Temporal Postprocessor for Multistate Quantum
   Measurement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal postprocessor (TPP) harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability for only specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such as high-power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources, we show that this advantage relies on the TPP's ability to learn optimal linear filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving quantum amplifier. Furthermore, we derive an exact analytic form for the optimal TPP weights: this positions the TPP as a linearly scaling generalization of matched filtering, valid for an arbitrary number of states under the most general readout noise conditions, all while preserving a training complexity that is essentially negligible in comparison with that of training neural networks for processing temporal quantum measurement data. The TPP can be autonomously and reliably trained on measurement data and requires only linear operations, making it ideal for field-programmable gate array implementations in circuit QED for real-time processing of measurement data from general quantum systems.

TI Optimal quantum control of charging quantum batteries
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum control allows us to address the problem of engineering quantum dynamics for special purposes. While recently the field of quantum batteries has attracted much attention, optimization of their charging has not benefited from the quantum control methods. Here we fill this gap by using an optimization method. We apply for the first time the convergent iterative method for the control of the population of a bipartite quantum system in two cases, starting with a qubit-qubit case. The quantum charger-battery system is considered here, where the energy is pumped into the charger by an external classical electromagnetic field. Secondly, we systematically extend our investigation to a second case involving two harmonic oscillators in the Gaussian regime, presenting an original formulation of the method. In both cases, the charger is considered to be an open dissipative system, as its interaction with the drive may require a more pronounced exposure to general interaction with environment. A key consideration in our optimization strategy is the practical concern of turning the charging external field on and off. We find that optimizing the pulse shape yields a substantial enhancement in both the power and efficiency of the charging process compared to a sinusoidal drive. The harmonic oscillator configuration of quantum batteries is particularly intriguing, as the optimal driving pulse remains effective regardless of the environmental temperature. This study introduces a novel approach to quantum battery charging optimization, opening avenues for enhanced performance in real-world applications.

TI Intensity Correlations in Quantum Cascade Laser Harmonic Frequency Combs
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB A novel study on harmonic frequency combs emitted by quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) is presented here, demonstrating the presence of intensity correlations between twin modes characterizing the emission spectra. These originate from a four-wave mixing process driven by the active medium's third-order nonlinearity. The study of such correlations is essential for the engineering of a new generation of semiconductor devices with the potential of becoming integrated emitters of light with quantum properties, such as squeezing and entanglement. Starting from experimental results, the limits of state-of-the-art technology are discussed as well as the possible methodologies that could lead to the detection of nonclassical phenomena, or alternatively improve the design of QCLs, in the compelling perspective of generating quantum correlations in mid-infrared light.

TI Machine learning universal bosonic functionals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The one-body reduced density matrix gamma plays a fundamental role in describing and predicting quantum features of bosonic systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensation. The recently proposed reduced density matrix functional theory for bosonic ground states establishes the existence of a universal functional F[gamma] that recovers quantum correlations exactly. Based on a decomposition of gamma, we have developed a method to design reliable approximations for such universal functionals: Our results suggest that for translational invariant systems the constrained search approach of functional theories can be transformed into an unconstrained problem through a parametrization of a Euclidian space. This simplification of the search approach allows us to use standard machine learning methods to perform a quite efficient computation of both F[gamma] and its functional derivative. For the Bose-Hubbard model, we present a comparison between our approach and the quantum Monte Carlo method.

TI Improved Air Mesh Refinement for Accurate Strand-Solid and
   Self-Collision Handling
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a novel method for efficiently handling strand-solid and self-collisions using air meshes. Traditional collision handling at the primitive level requires extensive computations, such as time-stepping and solving cubic equations, to ensure simulation stability. Moreover, depending on scene complexity, both discrete collision detection (DCD) and continuous collision detection (CCD) often need to be considered. In this study, we propose an improved approach to collision handling based on the previously introduced air mesh technique. The original air mesh approach does not rely on the simulation mesh itself but instead meshes the surrounding air, approximating its deformation as volumetric changes to detect and predict collisions. To ensure numerical convergence during air mesh refinement, a constraint was imposed to maintain equilateral triangles. However, this method often produced noisy results depending on the scene, and boundary issues became more pronounced in line-based simulations such as hair or fur simulation. To address these issues, we introduce a new constraint during the air mesh refinement process, leading to a more stable and noise-reduced collision handling approach. Our method demonstrates stable results not only for hair simulations but also across various scene types.

TI Twisted moire photonic crystal enabled optical vortex generation through
   bound states in the continuum
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The twisted stacking of two layered crystals has led to the emerging moire physics as well as intriguing chiral phenomena such as chiral phonon and photon generation. In this work, we identified and theoretically formulated a non-trivial twist-enabled coupling mechanism in twisted bilayer photonic crystal (TBPC), which connects the bound state in the continuum (BIC) mode to the free space through the twist-enabled channel. Moreover, the radiation from TBPC hosts an optical vortex in the far field with both odd and even topological orders. We quantitatively analyzed the twist-enabled coupling between the BIC mode and other non-local modes in the photonic crystals, giving rise to radiation carrying orbital angular momentum. The optical vortex generation is robust against geometric disturbance, making TBPC a promising platform for well-defined vortex generation. As a result, TBPCs not only provide a new approach to manipulating the angular momentum of photons, but may also enable novel applications in integrated optical information processing and optical tweezers. Our work broadens the field of moire photonics and paves the way toward the novel application of moire physics.
   The Authors in this work predict the radiation of twisted bilayer photonic crystals to host an optical vortex in the far field, which is enabled by connecting BIC modes in photonic crystals with the free space through a 'moire channel'.

TI Coherence of optically addressable spin centers created in hexagonal
   boron nitride by proton irradiation
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN SOLIDS
AB Spin-carrying defects possessing optically addressable ground states in semiconductors allow the development of solid-state quantum technologies. Recently such type of defect has been found in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and identified as a negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B(-)). Here we investigate the possibility to create V-B(-) centers in hBN by irradiation with high-energy protons (E-P = 15 MeV), and probe the spin-coherence of the defects. Electron paramagnetic resonance methods show that such irradiation generates the V-B(-) centers. Spin-relaxation times (T-1 and T-2) of V-B(-) spin ensembles created by proton irradiation are determined to be 20 mu s and 4 mu s, respectively.

TI Cryogenic Second-Harmonic Generation in Periodically Poled Lithium
   Niobate Waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate second-harmonic generation in a fiber-coupled periodically poled titanium in-diffused lithium niobate waveguide over the temperatures range from 292 to 4.4 K. We observe a reproducible shift in the phase-matched pump wavelength within the telecom band, which is at odds with the phase matching arising from existing models of the refractive indices in this temperature regime. We further investigate transient discontinuities while temperature cycling, which we attribute to the build-up and discharge of pyroelectric fields. Our results show that modifications of the Sellmeier coefficients for lithium niobate are required in the cryogenic temperature regime for our waveguides, but also establish titanium in-diffused waveguides in lithium niobate as a versatile nonlinear photonic integration platform compatible with cryogenic quantum technologies.

TI Disorder-Induced Strongly Correlated Photons in Waveguide QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Strongly correlated photons play a crucial role in modern quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the probability of generating strongly correlated photons in a chain of N qubits coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced nearly completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our Letter highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photons.

TI Entanglement witnesses mediated via axionlike particles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will study the constrained couplings in a few different models along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in nearfuture entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.

TI Engineering strong magnon-phonon coupling in single CoFe nanomagnets
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Hybrid magnonic systems are promising platforms for quantum technologies, leveraging coherent coupling between magnons and phonons. Here, we demonstrate strong magnon-phonon coupling in CoFe nanomagnets, a material with high magnetostriction. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy, we demonstrate strong coupling between magnonic and phononic modes in both polycrystalline and single-crystalline CoFe nanomagnets. Our findings reveal strong coupling with cooperativity values of C = 20.04 for a polycrystalline CoFe nanomagnet and C = 37.94 for a single-crystalline CoFe nanomagnet. The enhanced coupling strength in the single-crystalline CoFe nanomagnet is attributed to the higher magnetostriction in CoFe systems and lower intrinsic magnetic damping. This work highlights the critical role of material properties and crystalline structures in optimizing hybrid magnon-phonon systems for miniaturized quantum applications.

TI A review of silicon subwavelength gratings: building break-through
   devices with anisotropic metamaterials
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Silicon photonics is playing a key role in areas as diverse as high-speed optical communications, neural networks, supercomputing, quantum photonics, and sensing, which demand the development of highly efficient and compact light-processing devices. The lithographic segmentation of silicon waveguides at the subwavelength scale enables the synthesis of artificial materials that significantly expand the design space in silicon photonics. The optical properties of these metamaterials can be controlled by a judicious design of the subwavelength grating geometry, enhancing the performance of nanostructured devices without jeopardizing ease of fabrication and dense integration. Recently, the anisotropic nature of subwavelength gratings has begun to be exploited, yielding unprecedented capabilities and performance such as ultrabroadband behavior, engineered modal confinement, and sophisticated polarization management. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the field of subwavelength metamaterials and their applications in silicon photonics. We first provide an in-depth analysis of how the subwavelength geometry synthesizes the metamaterial and give insight into how properties like refractive index or anisotropy can be tailored. The latest applications are then reviewed in detail, with a clear focus on how subwavelength structures improve device performance. Finally, we illustrate the design of two ground-breaking devices in more detail and discuss the prospects of subwavelength gratings as a tool for the advancement of silicon photonics.

TI Tailoring photocurrent in Weyl semimetals via intense laser irradiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Generating and tailoring photocurrent in topological materials has immense importance in fundamental studies and technological front. Present work introduces a universal method to generate ultrafast photocurrent in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-broken Weyl semimetals with degenerate Weyl nodes at the Fermi level. Our approach harnesses the asymmetric electronic population in the conduction band induced by an intense single-color circularly polarized laser pulse. It has been found that the induced photocurrent can be tailored by manipulating helicity and ellipticity of the employed laser. Moreover, our approach generates photocurrent in realistic situations when the Weyl nodes are positioned at different energies and have finite tilt along a certain direction. Present work adds a new dimension on practical applications of Weyl semimetals for optoelectronics and photonics-based quantum technologies.

AB This work presents a detailed electrical characterization of planar InGaAs on Silicon MOSFETs from room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures (10 K). The main temperature-dependent electrical parameters of MOSFET operation (threshold voltage V-t, low-field mobility mu 0, and subthreshold swing SS) were extracted in both linear and saturation regions through the consolidated Y-function method, for gate lengths down to 10 nm. The extracted parameters are first analyzed versus temperature and length and then compared against a more mature technology such as Silicon FDSOI MOSFETs. The work provides insight into the cryogenic operation of III-V MOSFETs and indicates a competing advantage versus Si CMOS for low-power cryogenic quantum computer applications.

TI Quantum Monte Carlo Integration: The Full Advantage in Minimal Circuit
   Depth
SO QUANTUM
AB This paper proposes a method of quantum Monte Carlo integration that retains the full quadratic quantum advantage, with-out requiring any arithmetic or quantum phase estimation to be performed on the quantum computer. No previous proposal for quantum Monte Carlo integration has achieved all of these at once. The heart of the proposed method is a Fourier series de-composition of the sum that approximates the expectation in Monte Carlo integra-tion, with each component then estimated individually using quantum amplitude es-timation. The main result is presented as theoretical statement of asymptotic ad-vantage, and numerical results are also in-cluded to illustrate the practical benefits of the proposed method. The method pre-sented in this paper is the subject of a patent application

TI Combinatorial summation of Feynman diagrams
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the 2DSU(N) Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.

TI Evaluation of phase shifts for nonrelativistic elastic scattering using
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Simulations of scattering processes are essential in understanding the physics of our universe. Computing relevant scattering quantities from ab initio methods is extremely difficult on classical devices because of the substantial computational resources needed. This work reports the development of an algorithm that makes it possible to obtain phase shifts for generic nonrelativistic elastic scattering processes on a quantum computer. This algorithm is based on extracting phase shifts from the direct implementation of the real-time evolution. The algorithm is improved by a variational procedure making it more accurate and resistant to the quantum noise. The reliability of the algorithm is first demonstrated by means of classical numerical simulations for different potentials and later tested on existing quantum hardware, specifically on IBM quantum processors.

TI Prolegomena to Agapeology: Reflections on Love as Panexperiential
   Phenomenon
SO RELIGIONS
AB This paper is an attempt to reflect upon the hidden or mysterious logic of love as an ontological and panexperiential phenomenon. In our attempt, we are crossing the fields of philosophy, spirituality, and contemporary research in psi phenomena (also known as paranormal phenomena) and investigating some historical conditions of margins and disputes between the disciplines based on David Ray Griffin's work, Parapsychology, Philosophy, and Spirituality. In the main part of this paper, we present the aesthetic theory of force by Christoph Menke and follow his rich analyses on the hidden, obscure layers of the soul. Based on these analyses, we present our own thesis on agapeology as being related both to psi phenomena and aesthetic phenomena. Throughout the history of religion and Western science, magical and miraculous events were too often relegated to the domain of faith or superstition and dismissed almost entirely. In the final parts of this paper, we aim to show that using the approaches of synchronicity (C.G. Jung) and ontology of the ground (F.W.J., Schelling) and acknowledging the phenomena known as quantum entanglement (C. Keller), we can postulate an underlying nexus, providing us with an access to the agapeistic effects of what we idiosyncratically call the phenomenon of dark love.

TI Bremsstrahlung of Light through Spontaneous Emission of Gravitational
   Waves
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Zero-point fluctuations are a universal consequence of quantum theory. Vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field have provided crucial evidence and guidance for QED as a successful quantum field theory with a defining gauge symmetry through the Lamb shift, Casimir effect, and spontaneous emission. In an accelerated frame, the thermalisation of the zero-point electromagnetic field gives rise to the Unruh effect linked to the Hawking effect of a black hole via the equivalence principle. This principle is the basis of general covariance, the symmetry of general relativity as the classical theory of gravity. If quantum gravity exists, the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the gravitational field should also lead to the quantum decoherence and dissertation of general forms of energy and matter. Here we present a novel theoretical effect involving the spontaneous emission of soft gravitons by photons as they bend around a heavy mass and discuss its observational prospects. Our analytic and numerical investigations suggest that the gravitational bending of starlight predicted by classical general relativity should also be accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves. This in turn redshifts the light causing a loss of its energy somewhat analogous to the bremsstrahlung of electrons by a heavier charged particle. It is suggested that this new effect may be important for a combined astronomical source of intense gravity and high-frequency radiation such as X-ray binaries and that the proposed LISA mission may be potentially sensitive to the resulting sub-Hz stochastic gravitational waves.

TI Tip of the Quantum Entropy Cone
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Relations among von Neumann entropies of different parts of an N-partite quantum system have direct impact on our understanding of diverse situations ranging from spin systems to quantum coding theory and black holes. Best formulated in terms of the set Sigma(N)* of possible vectors comprising the entropies of the whole and its parts, the famous strong subaddivity inequality constrains its closure (Sigma) over bar (N)*, which is a convex cone. Further homogeneous constrained inequalities are also known. In this Letter we provide (nonhomogeneous) inequalities that constrain Sigma(N)* near the apex (the vector of zero entropies) of (Sigma) over bar (N)*, in particular showing that Sigma(N)* is not a cone for N >= 3. Our inequalities apply to vectors with certain entropy constraints saturated and, in particular, they show that while it is always possible to upscale an entropy vector to arbitrary integer multiples it is not always possible to downscale it to arbitrarily small size, thus answering a question posed by Winter.

TI PQC for DNSSEC: a format size analysis on Falcon signatures

CY JUL 22, 2025

AB Falcon is a post-quantum signature algorithm recently chosen for standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Its official implementation has two different signature formats that differ in size. In this paper, we measure the impact of the two different formats of Falcon signatures on DNSSEC-signed zones and on DNSSEC queries, based on real-world traffic for a large country-code Top Level Domain (ccTLD). We take into consideration Falcon's two signature formats, called padded and compressed, and evaluate their effects on DNSSEC signature sizes. We provide a signature size distribution for each format, using data obtained from a DNSSEC-signed ccTLD zone and queries for this zone. We use the results to study whether there are advantages to choosing one of the two signature formats. Our results show that the difference in DNS message size between padded and compressed signatures is small. Therefore, while in theory smaller signatures are favorable, the use of the compressed signature format does not have tangible real-world benefits. As our results show, the use of compressed signatures does not lead to a significant shift in message size such that more DNSSEC answers would fit within MTU limits. These results provide useful input for the discussion on Falcon signature standardization in DNSSEC, concluding that standardization of a fixed-size padded format may be preferable for its predictability and to avoid potential implementation errors.

TI An Efficient and Unified RTL Accelerator Design for HQC-128, HQC-192,

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB In the Post-Quantum Standardization (PQC) process held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the final round of evaluation of the asymmetric cryptographic schemes Classic McEliece, BIKE and HQC will elect the alternative Key Establishment Mechanism (KEM) to the FIPS $203$203 standard CRYSTALS-Kyber. In this work we present two configurations of a RTL hardware design of the HQC candidate, either optimized for devices exclusively working with client-server style protocols, or a unified accelerator compatible with all KEM operations, i.e. Key Generation, Encapsulation, and Decapsulation. Our designs are compatible with all the parameter sets defined by the HQC specification, providing security margins equivalent to the ones of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 based on a selection made at runtime. We are providing an extensive comparison with the current state-of-the-art RTL hardware designs for Artix-$7$7 FPGAs of the schemes in the PQC process, introducing a new metric to evaluate the area utilization, historically a challenging task for such devices made of heterogeneous resources, and determining that HQC has by far the best figures among the code-based candidates in terms of latency, area occupied and efficiency, and even comparable with the lattice-based CRYSTALS-Kyber when using the parameters with lowest security margin.

TI BAAIoV: A Blockchain-Based Authentication and Authorization Framework
   for Secure and Reliable Internet of Vehicles Communication
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging area within intelligent transportation systems, enabling real-time communication among vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians. While this connectivity enhances traffic management and safety, it also introduces significant security challenges-particularly in authentication, authorization, and data integrity. To address these concerns, blockchain technology is explored to eliminate centralized points of failure and support secure, decentralized communication in IoV environments. A solution titled Blockchain-based Authentication and Authorization in IoV (BAAIoV) is proposed, utilizing smart contracts and a distributed ledger to manage vehicle identities and securely control access to network resources. A simulation environment was established using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) for traffic modeling and Hyperledger Fabric for blockchain implementation. Python-based middleware facilitated real-time interaction between the simulation and the blockchain system. The results indicate that the BAAIoV model significantly reduces authentication delays, enhances emergency vehicle recognition, and mitigates threats like spoofing and replay attacks. These improvements demonstrate the potential of blockchain to enhance the security, efficiency, and reliability of vehicular networks. This research contributes to the development of secure communication frameworks for IoV. It highlights the potential for future blockchain integration with edge computing, artificial intelligence, and post-quantum cryptography technologies. Such integrations are expected to further strengthen smart transportation infrastructures and advance the capabilities of next-generation intelligent mobility systems.

TI Scalable exponentially complex representations of logical phi-bit states
   and experimental demonstration of an operable three phi-bit gate using
   an acoustic metastructure
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Logical phi-bits are nonlinear acoustic modes analogous to qubits and supported by an externally driven acoustic metastructure. A correspondence is established between the state of three correlated logical phi-bits represented in a low-dimensional linearly scaling physical space and their state representation as a complex vector in a high-dimensional exponentially scaling Hilbert space. We show the experimental implementation of a nontrivial three phi-bit unitary operation analogous to a quantum circuit. This three phi-bit gate operates in parallel on the components of the three phi-bit complex state vector. While this operation would be challenging to perform in one step on a quantum computer, by comparison, ours requires only a single physical action on the metastructure.

AB Thin films provide nanoscale confinement together with compatibility with photonic and microwave architectures, making them ideal candidates for chip-scale quantum devices. In this work, we propose a thin film fabrication approach yielding the epitaxial growth of Eu3+ doped Y2O3 on silicon. We combine two of the most prominent thin film deposition techniques: chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We report sub-megahertz optical homogeneous linewidths up to 8 K for the Eu3+ dopants in the film, and lowest value of 270 kHz. This result constitutes a ten-fold improvement with respect to previous reports on the same material, opening promising perspectives for the development of scalable and compact quantum devices containing rare-earth ions.

TI Improving robustness of quantum feedback control with reinforcement
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Obtaining reliable state preparation protocols is a key step toward practical implementation of many quantum technologies, and one of the main tasks in quantum control. In this work, different reinforcement learning approaches are used to derive a feedback law for state preparation of a desired state in a target system. In particular, we focus on the robustness of the obtained strategies with respect to different types and amount of noise. Comparing the results indicates that the learned controls are more robust to unmodeled perturbations with respect to simple feedback strategy based on optimized population transfer, and that training on a simulated nominal model retains the same advantages displayed by controllers trained on real data. The possibility of effective off-line training of robust controllers promises significant advantages toward practical implementation.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The generation and verification of large-scale entanglement are essential to the development of quantum technologies. In this paper, we present an efficient scheme to generate genuine multipartite entanglement of a large number of qubits by using the Heisenberg interaction. This method can be conveniently implemented in various physical platforms, including superconducting, trapped-ion, and cold-atom systems. In order to characterize the entanglement of the output quantum state, we generalize the stabilizer formalism and develop an entanglement witness method. In particular, we design a generic searching algorithm to optimize entanglement witness with a minimal number of measurement settings under a given noise level. From the perspective of practical applications, we numerically study the trade-off between the experiment efficiency and the detection robustness.

TI Meta-grating outcouplers for optimized beam shaping in the visible
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Accurate coupling between optical modes at the interface between photonic chips and free space is required for the development of many on-chip devices. This control is critical in quantum technologies where large-diameter beams with designed mode profiles are required. Yet, these designs are often difficult to achieve at shorter wavelengths where fabrication limits the resolution of designed devices. In this work we demonstrate optimized outcoupling of free-space beams at 461 nm using a meta-grating approach that achieves a 16 dB improvement in the apodized outcoupling strength. We design and fabricate devices, demonstrating accurate reproduction of beams with widths greater than 100 mu m.

TI Phase-sensitive quantum spectroscopy with high-frequency resolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Classical sensors for spectrum analysis are widely used but lack micro- or nanoscale spatial resolution. On the other hand, quantum sensors, capable of working with nanoscale precision, do not provide precise frequency resolution over a wide range of frequencies. Using a single spin in diamond, we present a measurement protocol for quantum probes which enables full signal reconstruction on a nanoscale spatial resolution up to potentially 100 GHz. We achieve 58 nT/root Hz amplitude and 0.095 rad/root Hz phase sensitivity and a relative frequency uncertainty of 10(-12) for a 1.51 GHz signal within 10 s of integration. This technique opens the way to quantum spectrum analysis methods with potential applications in electron spin detection and nanocircuitry in quantum technologies.

TI Investigation on the Formation of Laser Transverse Pattern Possessing
   Optical Lattices
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Optical lattices (OLs) with diverse transverse patterns and optical vortex lattices (OVLs) with special phase singularities have played important roles in the fields of atomic cooling, particle manipulation, quantum entanglement, and optical communication. As a matter of consensus until now, the OL patterns are generated by coherently superimposing multiple transverse modes with a fixed phase difference through the transverse mode locking (TML) effect. There are phase singularities in the dark area of this kind of OL pattern, so it is also called OVL pattern. However, in our research, it is found that some high-order complex symmetric OL patterns can hardly be analyzed by TML model. Instead, the analysis method of incoherent superposition of mode intensity could be applied. The OL pattern obtained by this method can be regarded as in non-TML state. Therefore, in this article, we mainly study the distinct characteristics and properties of OL patterns in TML and non-TML states. Through intensity comparison, interferometry, and beat frequency spectrum, we can effectively distinguish OL pattern in TML and non-TML states, which is of significance to explore the formation of laser transverse pattern possessing OL.

TI Quantifying Entanglement of Multipartite Quantum States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, it is investigated that how to quantify and characterize the quantum states of n-particles from the point of (k+1)-partite entanglement (1 <= k <= n-1), which plays an instrumental role in quantum nonlocality and quantum metrology. Two families of entanglement measures termed q-(k+1)-PE concurrence (q>1) and alpha-(k+1)-PE concurrence (0 <=alpha<1) are put forward, respectively. As far as the pure state is concerned, they are defined based on the minimum in entanglement. Meanwhile, rigorous proofs showing that both types of quantifications fulfill all the requirements of an entanglement measure are provided. In addition, two alternative kinds of entanglement measures are also proposed, named q-(k+1)-GPE concurrence (q > 1) and alpha-(k+1)-GPE concurrence (0 <= alpha < 1), respectively, where the quantifications of any pure state are given by taking the geometric mean of entanglement under all partitions satisfying preconditions. Besides, the lower bounds of these measures are presented by means of the entanglement of permutationally invariant (PI) part of quantum states, and the interrelations of these measures are elucidated. Moreover, these measures are compared and explained the similarities and differences among them. Furthermore, for computational convenience, enhanced versions of the quantifications mentioned above that can be utilized to distinguish whether a multipartite state is genuinely strong k-producible are considered.

TI Random Pure Gaussian States and Hawking Radiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on the assumptions that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than [k(B)T(H)(t)/h] are not populated at time t and drop out of the analysis. Among other relatively thinly populated modes (earlytime high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency), we find correlations and hence entanglement to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can, on the other hand, be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of modemode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.

AB Positronium (Ps), governed by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), provides a rich domain for exploring fundamental physics. Monte Carlo simulations of its decay provide insights into various aspects of particle physics. The development of J-PET, an innovative tomography system at the Jagiellonian University using high-resolution scintillator detectors, facilitates interdisciplinary studies encompassing fundamental physics tests, medical research, and quantum entanglement measurements but also enhances our capacity to investigate positronium decays in pursuit of potential dark matter (DM) candidates, a lingering enigma within the current Standard Model (SM) framework. In our research, we employ the J-PET detector to study ortho-positronium (o-Ps) decays as a part of our ongoing quest for the discovery of DM. Our primary goal is to explore mirror matter, which seeks to restore parity invariance and is proposed as a candidate for the Universe's DM. Our study aims to push the boundaries of precision measurement in the decay width of o-Ps to three gamma quanta, contributing to our understanding of the elusive nature of dark matter. The article presents the preliminary lifetime distribution of o-Ps as a search for mirror matter obtained from data collected during a portion of a long-term measurement conducted with the J-PET detector in 2020. The long-term aim of the study is to achieve 10-6 lifetime sensitivity.

TI 3D Printing of Glass Micro-Optics with Subwavelength Features on Optical
   Fiber Tips
SO ACS NANO
AB Integration of functional materials and structures on the tips of optical fibers has enabled various applications in micro-optics, such as sensing, imaging, and optical trapping. Direct laser writing is a 3D printing technology that holds promise for fabricating advanced micro-optical structures on fiber tips. To date, material selection has been limited to organic polymer-based photoresists because existing methods for 3D direct laser writing of inorganic materials involve high-temperature processing that is not compatible with optical fibers. However, organic polymers do not feature stability and transparency comparable to those of inorganic glasses. Herein, we demonstrate 3D direct laser writing of inorganic glass with a subwavelength resolution on optical fiber tips. We show two distinct printing modes that enable the printing of solid silica glass structures ("Uniform Mode") and self-organized subwavelength gratings ("Nanograting Mode"), respectively. We illustrate the utility of our approach by printing two functional devices: (1) a refractive index sensor that can measure the indices of binary mixtures of acetone and methanol at near-infrared wavelengths and (2) a compact polarization beam splitter for polarization control and beam steering in an all-in-fiber system. By combining the superior material properties of glass with the plug-and-play nature of optical fibers, this approach enables promising applications in fields such as fiber sensing, optical microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and quantum photonics.

TI Applying the Simple Partial Discard Method to Crystals-Kyber
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In certain cryptographic applications random numbers are required (e.g., when generating cryptographic keys and generating digital signatures). To obtain these random numbers, the typical approach involves obtaining random bits first and then converting them into random numbers. Several methods to convert a sequence of random bits into a sequence of random numbers are known and some of them are standardized. Recently, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 2 decided to add two more methods, the simple partial discard method and the complex partial discard method, to the existing four standard methods. Meanwhile, CRYSTALS-Kyber is the only public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithm selected for the post-quantum cryptography standardization project by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It uses an algorithm called Parse that takes a byte stream as input and outputs a polynomial of degree d with coefficients in Zq (for some positive integer d and prime q) using the simple discard method to generate key pairs. In this paper, we apply the simple partial discard method to Parse. We show that using the simple partial discard method instead of the simple discard method can reduce the number of bits required by up to 12%. Furthermore, we show that, in some cases, using the simple partial discard method instead of the simple discard method can experimentally generate a polynomial up to 8% faster.

TI A silicon source of heralded single photons at 2 μm
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Mid-infrared integrated quantum photonics is a promising platform for applications in sensing and metrology. However, there are only a few examples of on-chip single-photon sources at these wavelengths. These have limited performances with respect to their C-band counterparts. In this work, we demonstrate a new approach to generate heralded single photons in the mid-infrared on a silicon chip. By using a standard C-band pump, the inter-modal spontaneous four-wave mixing enables the generation of the herald idler at 1259.7 nm and the heralded signal at 2015 nm. The idler photon is easily detected with a common infrared single-photon detector while the signal photon is upconverted to visible before its detection. In this way, we are able to operate a mid-infrared source without the need for mid-infrared detectors and laser sources. By measuring a heralded g((2)) of 0.23 & PLUSMN; 0.08, we demonstrate the single-photon behavior of the source as well as the feasibility of multi-photon coincidence measurements beyond 2 mu m with our setup. The source exhibits a high-intrinsic heralding efficiency of (59 & PLUSMN; 5)%, a maximum coincidence to accidental ratio of 40.4 & PLUSMN; 0.9, and a generation probability of 0.70 & PLUSMN;0.10W-2.& nbsp;(C) 2021 Author(s).

TI Tunable thermoelectric superconducting heat pipe and diode
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for superconducting quantum technologies. This study demonstrates the controlled manipulation of the heat flow and heat rectification through an asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. The system exhibits a non-reciprocal behavior, developing a thermoelectric regime exclusively when the electrode with the larger gap is heated. This feature significantly boosts thermal rectification effectively classifying the device as a heat diode. At the same time when operating as a thermoelectric engine, the same device also functions as a heat pipe, expelling heat from the cryogenic environment, minimizing losses at the cold terminal. This dual functionality is inherently passive, and the performance of the heat pipe and the heat diode can be finely adjusted by modifying the external electrical load.

TI Broad Diversity of Near-Infrared Single-Photon Emitters in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report the detection of individual emitters in silicon belonging to seven different families of optically active point defects. These fluorescent centers are created by carbon implantation of a commercial silicon-on-insulator wafer usually employed for integrated photonics. Single photon emission is demonstrated over the 1.1-1.55 mu m range, spanning the O and C telecom bands. We analyze their photoluminescence spectra, dipolar emissions, and optical relaxation dynamics at 10 K. For a specific family, we show a constant emission intensity at saturation from 10 K to temperatures well above the 77 K liquid nitrogen temperature. Given the advanced control over nanofabrication and integration in silicon, these individual artificial atoms are promising systems to investigate for Si-based quantum technologies.

TI Security, Privacy, and Decentralized Trust Management in VANETs: A
   Review of Current Research and Future Directions
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are powerful platforms for vehicular data services and applications. The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, mak-ing it difficult to meet the 5G network's demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentica-tion and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation. We highlight the limitations of these schemes from PKI deploy-ment and recommend future research, particularly in the realm of quantum cryptography.

TI Holographic study of TT like deformed HV QFTs: holographic
   entanglement entropy
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the (d + 2)-dimensional Hyperscaling Violating (HV) geometries in the presence of both a finite temperature T and a UV cutoff r(c). This gravitational system is conjectured to be dual to TT & macr; like deformed HV QFTs. We consider the representative quantum entanglement quantity in holography, i.e. the entanglement entropy S(A), and perform a complete analysis in all possible parameter ranges of the hyperscaling violation exponent theta and the critical dynamical exponent z to study the effect of the temperature and the cutoff. We find that the temperature has a universal effect independent of the parameters: it enhances S(A) in the small cutoff limit, while it is irrelevant in the large cutoff limit. For the cutoff effect, we find that the cutoff monotonically suppresses S(A) where its behavior depends on the parameter range. As an application of the finite temperature analysis, we study the first law of entanglement entropy, S-T - S-T =0 similar to l(lambda), in the small subsystem size l limit. We find that lambda interpolates between lambda = 1 + z in the small cutoff and lambda = 3 in the large cutoff, independent of the parameter range. We also provide the analytic holographic result at z = d - theta and discuss its possibility of comparison with the field theoretic result.

TI Combinatorial entanglement
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We present new combinatorial objects, which we call grid-labelled graphs, and show how these can be used to represent the quantum states arising in a physical scenario which we refer to as the faulty emitter scenario: we have a machine designed to emit a particular quantum state on demand, but which can make an error and emit a different one. The device is able to produce a list of candidate states which can be used as a kind of debugging information for testing if the resulting state is entangled. By reformulating the Peres-Horodecki and matrix realignment entanglement criteria we are able to capture some characteristic features of entanglement: we construct new bound entangled states, and demonstrate the limitations of matrix realignment. We show how the notion of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is related to a generalisation of the graph isomorphism problem. We give a simple proof that asymptotically almost surely, grid-labelled graphs associated to very sparse density matrices are entangled. We develop tools for enumerating grid-labelled graphs that satisfy the Peres-Horodecki criterion up to a fixed number of vertices, and propose various computational problems for these objects, the computational complexity of which we leave as an open problem. The proposed mathematical framework also suggests new combinatorial and algebraic ways for describing the structure of graphs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The strong nonlinearity in the temperature dependence of our device leads to thermal self-modulation that produces impedance oscillations at frequencies around twice the angular cavity resonance frequency omega r. In particular, reactance modulation of the effective capacitance yields a gain of 18.6 dB over a frequency span of 125 kHz with a minimum noise temperature of TN = 1.4 K. Our theoretical modeling gives insight into the exact mixing processes, confirmation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and possible improvements of the studied system.

TI Active readout-error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Mitigating errors is a significant challenge for near-term quantum computers. One of the most important sources of errors is related to the readout of the quantum state into a classical bit stream. A variety of techniques have been proposed to mitigate these errors with post-hoc corrections. We propose a complementary scheme to actively reduce readout errors on a shot-by-shot basis by encoding single qubits, immediately prior to readout, into multiqubit states. The computational resources of our technique are independent of the circuit depth and are compatible with the error rates and connectivity of many current devices. We analyze the potential of our approach using two types of error-correcting codes, and, as a proof of principle, we demonstrate an 80% improvement in readout error on the IBMQ Mumbai quantum computer.

TI Efficient generation of single photons by quantum dots embedded in
   bullseye cavities with backside dielectric mirrors
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single photons are pivotal building blocks for photonic quantum technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates for optimal single photon sources in terms of purity, brightness and indistinguishability. Here we embed quantum dots into bullseye cavities with a backside dielectric mirror to enhance the collection efficiency up to near 90%. Experimentally, we achieve a collection efficiency of 30%. The auto-correlation measurements reveal a multiphoton probability below 0.05 & PLUSMN;0.005. A moderate Purcell factor of 3.1 is observed. Furthermore, we propose a scheme for laser integration as well as fiber coupling. Our results represent a step forward to the practical plug-and-play single photon sources. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Effects of high-power laser radiation on polymers for 3D printing

SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB 3D printing has become a widely used technique for manufacturing micro-optical components for sensing, measurements, biomedical and quantum technologies. Hence, knowing the maximum usable power or damage thresholds of 3D-printed micro-optics becomes crucial. Here we present a first study of the damage threshold values of the IP-S photoresist under high-power cw-, fs-, and ns-pulsed laser radiation with wavelengths in the NIR range. We also study the differences between visual evaluation using bright-field microscopy, DIC-microscopy, and beam-profile damage detection. Finally, we present several application-inspired use cases of 3D printed fiber micro-optics, reaching 10.5 W output power of cw-radiation at 915 nm and 4.5 W and 550 fs pulsed operation at 1040 nm.

TI Breaking a Combinatorial Symmetry Resolves the Paradox of
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We present a Monte Carlo model of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments that may be implemented on two independent computers and resembles the measurements of the Clauser-Aspect-Zeilinger-type which are performed in two distant stations SA and SB. Our computer model is local deterministic because we show that a theorist in station SB is able to conceive the products of the measurement outcomes of both stations, conditional to any possible equipment configuration in station SA. We show that the Monte Carlo model violates Bell-type inequalities and approaches the results of quantum theory for certain relationships between the number of measurements performed and the number of possible different physical properties of the entangled photon pairs. These relationships are clearly linked to Vorob'ev cyclicities, which always enforce Bell-type inequalities. The realization of this cyclicity depends, however, on combinatorial symmetry considerations that, in turn, depend on the mathematical properties of Einstein's elements of physical reality. Because these mathematical properties have never been investigated and, therefore, may be free to be chosen in the models for all published experiments, Einstein's physics does not contradict the experimental findings, instantaneous influences at a distance are put into question and the paradox of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell is, thus, resolved.

TI Entanglement in first excited states of some many-body quantum spin
   systems: indication of quantum phase transition in finite size systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We compute concurrence, a measure of bipartite entanglement, of the first excited state of the 1-D Heisenberg frustrated J(1)-J(2) spin-chain and observe a sudden change in the entanglement of the eigen state near the coupling strength alpha = J(2)/J(1) 0.241, where a quantum phase transition from spin-fluid phase to dimer phase has been previously reported. We numerically observe this phenomena for spin-chain with 8 sites to 16 sites, and the value of alpha at which the change in entanglement is observed, asymptotically tends to a value alpha(c) 0.24116. We have calculated the finite-size scaling exponents for spin chains with even and odd spins. It may be noted that bipartite as well as multipartite entanglement measures applied on the ground state of the system, fail to detect any quantum phase transition from the gapless to the gapped phase in the 1-D Heisenberg frustrated J(1)-J(2) spin-chain. Furthermore, we measure bipartite entanglement of first excited states for other spin models like 2-D Heisenberg J(1)-J(2) model and Shastry-Sutherland model and find similar indications of quantum phase transitions.

TI Data-Driven Malware Detection for 6G Networks: A Survey From the
   Perspective of Continuous Learning and Explainability via Visualisation
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB 5G is inherently prone to security vulnerabilities. We witness that many today's networks contain 5G security flaws due to their reliance on the existing 4G network core. A lack of security standards for 5G IoT devices means network breaches and malware threats might run uncontrolled. The future 6G network is predicted to be implemented with artificial intelligence-driven communication via machine learning, enhanced edge computing, post-quantum cryptography and so forth. With the activation of edge computing, the computing power available at supercomputing servers is to be integrated directly into the devices at the entry point of a network in a distributed manner (e.g., antennas, routers, IoT sensors, etc). This feature brings an equal quality of service everywhere including remote regions (a.k.a service everywhere) which will trigger an exponential growth of associated applications. In this intricate environment, malware attacks are becoming more challenging to detect. This paper thus reviews the theoretical and experimental data-driven malware detection literature, in the large-scale data-intensive field, relating to: (1) continuous learning, including new concepts in multi-domain to multi-target learning and the challenges associated with unseen/unknown data, imbalance data and data scarcity, and (2) new explainability via visualisation concepts with a multi-labelling approach which allows identifying malware by their recipes while improving the interpretability of its decision process.

TI Signature Algorithms with a Hidden Group, Based on Difficulty of Solving
   Systems of Quadratic Equations
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This research introduces two novel algebraic signature algorithms with a hidden group, which are based on the computational difficulty of finding a solution of a large system of quadratic multivariate equations. Like signature algorithms of multivariate cryptography, the developed ones represent interest as post-quantum cryptoschemes, the latter having a significant merit consisting of a 100 or more times smaller size of public key. The introduced algorithms represent interest as candidates for a practical post-quantum signature standard with small sizes for both the signature and the public key. Their security is estimated to be vulnerable to direct attacks using the known algorithms for solving the systems of many quadratic equations. The development of structural attacks exploiting properties of the used algebraic support is estimated as an independent research task composing the next stage of the analysis of the proposed signature algorithms on finite non-commutative associative algebras. Relatively the known algebraic signature algorithms with a hidden group, which are based on the computational difficulty of the so called hidden discrete logarithm problem, the developed signature algorithms differ in the use of the signature verification equations with multiple entry of signature. This feature defines a specific technique for the signature generation. The next peculiarity is the use of algebras of higher dimensions set over the finite fields of smaller orders.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Controlling many-body quantum systems is a highly challenging task required to advance quantum technologies. Here, we report progress in controlling gapless many-body quantum systems described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). To do so, we investigate the exact dynamics of the TLL induced by an arbitrary interaction quench, making use of the SU(1, 1) dynamical symmetry group and the Schr & ouml;dinger picture. First, we demonstrate that this approach is useful to perform a shortcut to adiabaticity, which cancels the final nonadiabatic residual energy of the driven TLL and is experimentally implementable in the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon model. Second, we apply this framework to analyze various driving schemes in finite time, including linear ramps and smooth protocols.

TI Highly Adiabatic Time-Optimal Quantum Driving at Low Energy Cost
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Time-efficient control schemes for manipulating quantum systems are of great importance in quantum technologies, where environmental forces rapidly degrade the quality of pure states over time. In this Letter, we formulate an approach to time-optimal control that circumvents the boundary-value problem that plagues the quantum brachistochrone equation at the expense of relaxing the form of the control Hamiltonian. In this setting, a coupled system of equations, one for the control Hamiltonian and another one for the duration of the protocol, realizes an ansatz-free approach to quantum control theory. We show how driven systems, in the form of a Landau-Zener type Hamiltonian, can be efficiently maneuvered to speed up a given state transformation in a highly adiabatic manner and with a low energy cost.

AB Scalability and miniaturization are hallmarks of solid-state platforms for photonic quantum technologies. Still a main challenge is two-photon interference from distinct emitters on chip. This requires local tuning, integration, and novel approaches to understand and tame noise processes. A promising platform is that of molecular single-photon sources. Thousands of molecules with optically tunable emission frequency can be easily isolated in solid matrices and triggered with pulsed excitation. We here discuss Hong-Ou-Mandel interference experiments using several couples of molecules within few tens of microns.

TI Bloch-type photonic skyrmions in optical chiral multilayers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles in magnetization. Recently, as one of their photonic counterparts, Neel-type photonic skyrmions were discovered in evanescent electromagnetic waves. The deep-subwavelength features of the photonic skyrmions suggest their potential in optical imaging quantum technologies and data storage. Here, by exploiting the photonic quantum spin Hall effect of a plasmonic vortex in a trilayered structure, we predict the existence of photonic twisted-Neel- and Bloch-type skyrmions in chiral materials. Their chirality-dependent features can be considered as additional degrees of freedom for future chiral sensing, information processing, and storage technologies. In particular, our findings enrich the formations of photonic skyrmions and reveal a remarkable resemblance of the feature of chiral materials in two seemingly distant fields: photonic skyrmions and magnetic skyrmions.

TI Limitation of maximally entangled probes for single-shot
   distinguishability of unitaries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There have been many instances where the maximally entangled state as a probe acts better than the product and the nonmaximally entangled states in the task of distinguishing quantum channels. We provide a proof that for the single-shot discrimination of two unitary channels, entangled and product states are operationally equivalent. However, we identify pairs of unitaries that are perfectly distinguishable using a nonmaximally entangled state, but not with a maximally entangled one. This contrast becomes more pronounced when the number of unitaries exceeds two. In every dimension >= 3, we show that there exists a class of unitaries that is indistinguishable under maximally entangled probes, yet perfectly distinguishable using product or nonmaximally entangled inputs. Another interesting set of unitaries in every dimension >= 3 has been presented where only a nonmaximally entangled state acts as a successful probe, while product states and maximally entangled states cannot.

TI Classical shadows with Pauli-invariant unitary ensembles
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Classical shadows provide a noise-resilient and sample-efficient method for learning quantum system properties, relying on a user-specified unitary ensemble. What is the weakest assumption on this ensemble that can still yield meaningful results? To address this, we focus on Pauli-invariant unitary ensembles-those invariant under multiplication by Pauli operators. For these ensembles, we present explicit formulas for the reconstruction map and sample complexity bounds and extend our results to the case when noise impacts the protocol implementation. Two applications are explored: one for locally scrambled unitary ensembles, where we present formulas for the reconstruction map and sample complexity bounds that circumvent the need to solve an exponential-sized linear system, and another for the classical shadows of quantum channels. Our results establish a unified framework for classical shadows with Pauli-invariant unitary ensembles, applicable to both noisy and noiseless scenarios for states and channels and primed for implementation on near-term quantum devices.

The technology translation from laboratory demonstrations to real-world applications requires the fabrication process of photonics chips to be fully CMOS-compatible, such that the manufacturing can take advantage of the ongoing evolution of semiconductor technology at reduced cost and with high volume. Silicon nitride has become the leading CMOS platform for integrated soliton devices, however, it is an insulator and lacks intrinsic second-order nonlinearity for electro-optic modulation. Other materials have emerged such as AlN, LiNbO3, AlGaAs and GaP that exhibit simultaneous second- and third-order nonlinearities. Here, we show that silicon carbide (SiC) -- already commercially deployed in nearly ubiquitous electrical power devices such as RF electronics, MOSFET, and MEMS due to its wide bandgap properties, excellent mechanical properties, piezoelectricity and chemical inertia -- is a new competitive CMOS-compatible platform for nonlinear photonics. High-quality-factor microresonators (Q = 4 x 10(6)) are fabricated on 4H-SiC-on-insulator thin films, where a single soliton microcomb is generated. In addition, we observe wide spectral translation of chaotic microcombs from near-infrared to visible due to the second-order nonlinearity of SiC. Our work highlights the prospects of SiC for future low-loss integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics that could harness electro-opto-mechanical interactions on a monolithic platform.

TI Properties of the frustrated spin 1/2 kagome material Cu3(HOTP)2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The metal-organic-framework compound Cu3(HOTP)2, also known as Cu3(HHTP)2, is a small-gap semiconductor containing a kagome lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 CuII spins with intralayer nearest-neighbor exchange coupling J similar to 2 K. The intralayer J value obtained from calculations using density functional theory is shown to match with the experimental value for reasonable values of the Hubbard U parameter. Muon spin relaxation confirms no magnetic ordering down to 50 mK and sees spin fluctuations diffusing on a two-dimensional lattice. These properties are consistent with the hypothesis of a quantum spin-liquid ground state being present within highly decoupled kagome layers. Reduction of the spin-diffusion rate on cooling from the paramagnetic region to the low-temperature region reflects quantum entanglement, one of the key properties of a quantum spin liquid. It is also found that the layers become more strongly decoupled in the low-temperature region. Comparison of results for the spin diffusion, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat in the low-temperature region suggests close proximity to a quantum critical point and a large density of low-energy spinless electronic excitations. A Z2-linear Dirac model for the low-energy spin excitations of the putative quantum spin-liquid ground state is found to provide the best match with experiment.

TI Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram of the spin-21 triangular
   lattice antiferromagnet KYbSe2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state of matter characterized by fractionalized quasiparticle excitations, quantum entanglement, and a lack of long-range magnetic order. However, QSLs have evaded definitive experimental observation. Several Yb3+-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets with effective S = 21 have been suggested to stabilize the QSL state as the ground state. Here, we build a comprehensive magnetic temperature phase diagram of a high-quality single crystalline KYbSe2 via heat capacity and magnetocaloric effect down to 30 mK with magnetic field applied along the a axis. At zero magnetic field, we observe the magnetic long-range order at TN = 0.29 K entering 120 degrees ordered state in heat capacity, consistent with neutron scattering studies. Analysis of the low-temperature (T ) specific heat (C) at zero magnetic field indicates linear T dependence of C/T and a broad hump of C/T in the proximate QSL region above TN. By applying magnetic field, we observe the up-up-down phase with 1/3 magnetization plateau and oblique phases, in addition to two new phases. These observations strongly indicate that while KYbSe2 closely exhibits characteristics resembling an ideal triangular lattice, deviations may exist, such as the effect of the next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, calling for careful consideration for spin Hamiltonian modeling. Further investigations into tuning parameters, such as chemical pressure, could potentially induce an intriguing QSL phase in the material.

AB The conventional theory of non-relativistic neutron beam scattering from many-body systems treats the beam essentially as a classical system, because the neutron dynamical variables are captured in the main theoretical formulas (e.g. time-correlation functions) not as quantum mechanical operators but as c-numbers only. This simplification results in the full decoupling of the probe particles' dynamics from the quantum dynamics of the scatterer. Further, neutrons' wavefunctions are represented with plane waves, and thus the concept of neutron's finite coherence length in momentum space becomes irrelevant. Making contact with modern quantum theoretical approaches (e.g., quantum entanglement, Feynman paths, "which-path information" versus interference, Weak Values theory) new observable effects of non-relativistic quantum beam scattering may be exposed and/or predicted, such as a surprising intensity deficit in neutron Compton scattering (NCS) of epithermal neutrons from protons of H-containing materials. Here, the NCS-intensity deficit observed in scattering from liquid C6H6 is discussed and interpreted from first principles, in the general frame of Weak Values theory. Moreover, based on Feynman's didactical argument that there isn't any interference between distinguishable neutron paths, we show that this NCS-effect cannot be interpreted as being caused by destructive interference of neutron paths scattered from entangled (two or a few) protons, as was earlier proposed by some authors.

TI Steady-state coherences under partial collective non-Markovian
   decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Steady-state coherence in open quantum systems is crucial for quantum technologies, yet its behavior is not fully understood due to the interplay between collective and individual decoherence. While collective decoherence is thought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe this because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic oscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing a tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically solving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence depends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under partial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex steady-state coherence behaviors. Our results clarify the role of non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and provide a benchmark for assessing approximate methods for modeling quantum processes.

TI High Kinetic Inductance in Platinum-Coated Aluminum Nanobridge
   Interferometers
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The transport properties of a nanobridge superconducting quantum interference device made of Al/Pt bilayer have been studied. Measurement and approximation of the voltage-field dependencies allow to estimate the inductance of the structure. It is found that this value significantly exceeds the expected geometric inductance and exhibits an atypical temperature dependence. To explain this effect, a microscopic model of electron transport in SN bilayers is developed, considering the proximity effect, and the available regimes of the current distribution are described. The measured properties may be indicative of the formation of high-resistance aluminum with high values of kinetic inductance during the fabrication of Al/Pt bilayers.

TI Dynamical Uncertainty Propagation with Noisy Quantum Parameters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many quantum technologies rely on high-precision dynamics, which raises the question of how these are influenced by the experimental uncertainties that are always present in real-life settings. A standard approach in the literature to assess this is Monte Carlo sampling, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is computationally expensive. Second, it does not reveal the effect that each individual uncertainty parameter has on the state of the system. In this Letter, we evade both these drawbacks by incorporating propagation of uncertainty directly into simulations of quantum dynamics, thereby obtaining a method that is orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo simulations and directly provides information on how each uncertainty parameter influences the system dynamics. Additionally, we compare our method to experimental results obtained using the IBM quantum computers.

TI On-chip hollow-core waveguides with integrated anti-resonant channels,
   enabled by 3D nanoprinting
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a novel on-chip hollow-core waveguide design featuring a three-channel architecture that operates via the anti-resonant effect. The design incorporates symmetrically arranged thin membranes that create an enhanced reflective environment, achieving superior waveguiding performance over conventional approaches. Through numerical simulations and experimental validation using 3D vertical nanoprinting, we demonstrate low optical losses, smooth spectral transmission, and suppression of structure-induced birefringence while additionally revealing an interchannel coupling mechanism arising from the multi-channel architecture. Our findings establish a promising platform for applications in bioanalytics, quantum technologies, and life sciences while offering new possibilities for exploring complex cladding structures in hollow-core fiber design.

TI Excitonic topological order in imbalanced electron-hole bilayers
SO NATURE
AB Correlation and frustration play essential roles in physics, giving rise to novel quantum phases(1-6). A typical frustrated system is correlated bosons on moat bands, which could host topological orders with long-range quantum entanglement(4). However, the realization of moat-band physics is still challenging. Here, we explore moat-band phenomena in shallowly inverted InAs/GaSb quantum wells, where we observe an unconventional time-reversal-symmetry breaking excitonic ground state under imbalanced electron and hole densities. We find that a large bulk gap exists, encompassing a broad range of density imbalances at zero magnetic field (B), accompanied by edge channels that resemble helical transport. Under an increasing perpendicular B, the bulk gap persists, and an anomalous plateau of Hall signals appears, which demonstrates an evolution from helical-like to chiral-like edge transport with a Hall conductance approximately equal to e(2)/h at 35 tesla, where e is the elementary charge and h is Planck's constant. Theoretically, we show that strong frustration from density imbalance leads to a moat band for excitons, resulting in a time-reversal-symmetry breaking excitonic topological order, which explains all our experimental observations. Our work opens up a new direction for research on topological and correlated bosonic systems in solid states beyond the framework of symmetry-protected topological phases, including but not limited to the bosonic fractional quantum Hall effect.

This scheme is inherently suitable for storage, on-demand generation, and dynamical manipulation of single x-ray photons, for instance, the manipulation of the temporal shape, temporal splitting, the interference between x-ray photons, and the control of the polarization. Our approach provides more opportunities in x-ray quantum information.

TI Agile Acceleration of Stateful Hash-based Signatures in Hardware
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB With the development of large-scale quantum computers, the current landscape of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms will change dramatically. Today's standards like RSA, DSA, and ElGamal will no longer provide sufficient security against quantum attackers and need to be replaced with novel algorithms. In the face of these developments, NIST has already started a standardization process for new Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and Digital Signatures (DSs). Moreover, NIST has recommended the two stateful Hash-Based Signatures (HBSs) schemes XMSS and LMS for use in devices with a long expected lifetime and limited capabilities for maintenance. Both schemes are also standardized by the IETF.
   In this work, we present the first agile hardware implementation that supports both LMS and XMSS. Our design can instantiate either LMS, XMSS, or both schemes using a simple configuration setting. Leveraging the vast similarities of the two schemes, the hardware utilization of the agile design increases by 20% in LUTs and only 3% in Flip Flops (FFs) over a standalone XMSS implementation. Furthermore, our approach can easily be configured with an arbitrary number of hash cores and accelerators for the one-time signatures for different application scenarios. We evaluate our implementation on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA platform, which is the recommended target for PQC implementations by NIST. We explore potential tradeoffs in the design space and compare our results to previous work in this field.

TI Thermodynamic Implementations of Quantum Processes
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Recent understanding of the thermodynamics of small-scale systems have enabled the characterization of the thermodynamic requirements of implementing quantum processes for fixed input states. Here, we extend these results to construct optimal universal implementations of a given process, that is, implementations that are accurate for any possible input state even after many independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) repetitions of the process. We find that the optimal work cost rate of such an implementation is given by the thermodynamic capacity of the process, which is a single-letter and additive quantity defined as the maximal difference in relative entropy to the thermal state between the input and the output of the channel. Beyond being a thermodynamic analogue of the reverse Shannon theorem for quantum channels, our results introduce a new notion of quantum typicality and present a thermodynamic application of convex-split methods.

TI Integrated all-optical nonreciprocity based on a moving index grating
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical nonreciprocal devices are critical components in integrated photonic systems and scalable quantum technologies. We propose an all-optical approach to achieve integrated optical nonreciprocity utilizing a moving index grating. The grating is generated in a nonlinear optical waveguide through the Kerr effect by driving the waveguide with two counter-propagating pump fields of slightly different frequencies. Based on this moving index grating, our system exhibits exceptional versatility by achieving both nonreciprocal transmission and reflection of signal fields. We obtain an all-optical isolator that achieves near-unity isolation contrast and negligible insertion loss while effectively addressing the dynamic reciprocity challenge. Our protocol establishes a novel approach for achieving integrated all-optical nonreciprocal devices, paving the way for advanced integrated photonic circuits.

TI Creation of color centers in diamond by recoil implantation through
   dielectric films
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The need of near-surface color centers in diamond for quantum technologies motivates the controlled doping of specific extrinsic impurities into the crystal lattice. Recent experiments have shown that this can be achieved by momentum transfer from a surface precursor via ion implantation, an approach known as "recoil implantation." Here, we extend this technique to incorporate dielectric precursors for creating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond. Specifically, we demonstrate that gallium focused-ion-beam exposure to a thin layer of silicon nitride or silicon dioxide on the diamond surface results in the introduction of both extrinsic impurities and carbon vacancies. These defects subsequently give rise to near-surface NV and SiV centers with desirable properties after annealing.

TI Uncovering the mechanism of chiral three-nucleon force in driving
   spin-orbit splitting
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB The three-nucleon force (3NF) is crucial in shaping the shell structure of atomic nuclei, particularly impacting the enhancement of spin-orbit (SO) splitting, especially in nuclei with significant deviations from stability. Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms driving this enhancement remain unclear. In this study, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the rank of irreducible tensors forming the 3NF, derived from chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to-leading order, to elucidate their influence on SO splitting. Within the shell-model framework, our analysis reveals that the rank-1 component of the 3NF is the primary factor enlarging the energy gap between the 0p(3/2) and 0p(1/2) single-particle levels in p-shell nuclei, while the rank-2 component makes a subdominant contribution. Since the rank-1 component originates exclusively from the 2 pi-exchange 3NF, our finding will not depend on the choice of the low-energy constants of contact terms. We also remark on the antisymmetry of the rank-1 3NF, which can affect the quantum entanglement of spin states. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration into this field toward a microscopic understanding of the 3NF impact on the nuclear shell structure.

TI Information recovery from evaporating black holes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
AB We show that the apparent horizon and the region near r = 0 of an evaporating charged, rotating black hole are timelike. It then follows that black holes in nature, which invariably have some rotation, have a channel, via which classical or quantum information can escape to the outside, while the black hole shrinks in size. We discuss implications for the information loss problem.

TI Categories with Complements
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB Verbs and nouns gear theta-dependencies, Case, agreement, or construal relations. Building on Chomsky's 1974 decomposition of such categories into +/- N, +/- V features, by translating said features into +/- 1, +/- i scalars that allow for the construction of a vector space, this paper studies the possibility of organizing said features into 2 x 2 square matrices. In the system proposed to explore "head-complement" relations, operating on nouns yields a measurable/observable (Hermitian matrix), which in turn limits other potential combinations with abstract lexical categories. Functional/grammatical categories in the system deploy the same features, albeit organized differently in the matrix diagonal and off-diagonal. The algebraic result is a group with well-defined mathematical properties, which properly includes the Pauli group of standard use in quantum computation. In the system, the presumed difference between categories and interactions-here, in a context of the head-complement sort-reduces to whether the magnitude of the matrix eigenvalue is 1 or not, in the latter instance inducing asymmetric interactions.

TI Toward reliability in the NISQ era: Robust interval guarantee for
   quantum measurements on approximate states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Near-term quantum computation holds potential across multiple application domains. However, imperfect preparation and evolution of states due to algorithmic and experimental shortcomings, characteristic in the near -term implementation, would typically result in measurement outcomes deviating from the ideal setting. It is thus crucial for any near-term application to quantify and bound these output errors. We address this need by deriving robustness intervals which are guaranteed to contain the output in the ideal setting. The first type of interval is based on formulating robustness bounds as semidefinite programs, and uses only the first moment and the fidelity to the ideal state. Furthermore, we consider higher statistical moments of the observable and generalize bounds for pure states based on the non-negativity of Gram matrices to mixed states, thus enabling their applicability in the NISQ era where noisy scenarios are prevalent. Finally, we demonstrate our results in the context of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on noisy and noiseless simulations.

TI Distant emitters in ultrastrong waveguide QED: Ground-state properties
   and non-Markovian dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Starting from the paradigmatic spin-boson model (SBM), we investigate the static and dynamical properties of a system of two distant two-level emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Ohmic waveguide beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing static and dynamical polaron Ansatze we study the effects of finite separa-tion distance on the behavior of the photon-mediated Ising-like interaction, qubit frequency renormalization, ground-state magnetization, and entanglement entropy of the two-qubit system. Based on previous works we derive an effective approximate Hamiltonian for the two-impurity SBM that preserves the excitation-number and thus facilitates the analytical treatment. In particular, it allows us to introduce non-Markovianity arising from delay-feedback effects in two distant emitters in the so-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime. We test our results with numerical simulations performed over a discretized circuit-QED model, finding perfect agreement with previous results, and showing interesting dynamical effects arising in ultrastrong waveguide QED with distant emitters. In particular, we revisit the Fermi two-atom problem showing that, in the USC regime, initial correlations yield two different evolutions for symmetric and antisymmetric states even before the emitters become causally connected. Finally, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics, e.g., superradiance or subradiance, are affected not only by the distance between emitters, but also by the coupling, due to significant frequency renormalization. This constitutes another dynamical consequence of the USC regime.

TI Information Scrambling over Bipartitions: Equilibration, Entropy
   Production, and Typicality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In recent years, the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a diagnostic tool for information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. Here, we present exact analytical results for the OTOC for a typical pair of random local operators supported over two regions of a bipartition. Quite remarkably, we show that this "bipartite OTOC" is equal to the operator entanglement of the evolution, and we determine its interplay with entangling power. Furthermore, we compute long-time averages of the OTOC and reveal their connection with eigenstate entanglement. For Hamiltonian systems, we uncover a hierarchy of constraints over the structure of the spectrum and elucidate how this affects the equilibration value of the OTOC. Finally, we provide operational significance to this bipartite OTOC by unraveling intimate connections with average entropy production and scrambling of information at the level of quantum channels.

TI Universal Constraint for Relaxation Rates for Quantum Dynamical
   Semigroup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A general property of relaxation rates in open quantum systems is discussed. We find an interesting constraint for relaxation rates that universally holds in fairly large classes of quantum dynamics, e.g., weak coupling regimes, as well as for entropy nondecreasing evolutions. We conjecture that this constraint is universal, i.e., it is valid for all quantum dynamical semigroups. The conjecture is supported by numerical analysis. Moreover, we show that the conjectured constraint is tight by providing a concrete model that saturates the bound. This universality marks an essential step toward the physical characterization of complete positivity as the constraint is directly verifiable in experiments. It provides, therefore, a physical manifestation of complete positivity. Our conjecture also has two important implications: it provides (i) a universal constraint for the spectra of quantum channels and (ii) a necessary condition to decide whether a given channel is consistent with Markovian evolution.

TI High-performance multiqubit system with double-transmon couplers: Toward
   scalable superconducting quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 99% in various architectures and gate-implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multiqubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next-nearestneighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC cannot only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated twoqubit systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and individual and simultaneous 10-ns pi /2 pulses with fidelities over 99.99%. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.

TI Restricted Boltzmann machine representation for the groundstate and
   excited states of Kitaev Honeycomb model
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, the capability of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to find solutions for the Kitaev honeycomb model with periodic boundary conditions is investigated. The measured groundstate energy of the system is compared and, for small lattice sizes (e.g. 3 x 3 with 18 spinors), shown to agree with the analytically derived value of the energy up to a deviation of 0.09%. Moreover, the wave-functions we find have 99.89% overlap with the exact ground state wave-functions. Furthermore, the possibility of realizing anyons in the RBM is discussed and an algorithm is given to build these anyonic excitations and braid them for possible future applications in quantum computation. Using the correspondence between topological field theories in (2 + 1)d and 2d conformal field theories, we propose an identification between our RBM states with the Moore-Read state and conformal blocks of the 2d Ising model.

TI Inelastic coupled-channel eikonal scattering
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Emitted radiation and absorption effects in black hole dynamics lead to inelastic scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study how these effects introduce an inelasticity function to the 2 -> 2 eikonalised S-matrix and how they can be described using unequal mass and spin on-shell amplitudes. To achieve this, we formulate the inelastic coupled-channel eikonal (ICCE) using the KMOC formalism and the language of quantum channels, where off-diagonal channels involve mass and spin changes. This formulation allows us to re-use usual eikonal results but also suggests a different resummation of inelastic effects. We then apply this formulation to calculate classical inelastic processes, such as the mass change in binary dynamics due to the presence of an event horizon. Additionally, we provide a complementary analysis for the case of wave scattering on a black hole, considering absorption effects. In both scenarios, we derive unitarity relations accounting for inelastic effects.

TI Facilitation of controllable excitation in Rydberg atomic ensembles
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Strongly-interacting Rydberg atomic ensembles have shown intense collective excitation effects due to the inclusion of single Rydberg excitation shared by multiple atoms in the ensemble. In this paper we investigate a counter-intuitive Rydberg excitation facilitation with a strongly-interacting atomic ensemble in the strong probe-field regime, which is enabled by the role of a control atom nearby. Differing from the case of a single ensemble, we show that, the control atom's excitation adds to a second two-photon transition onto the doubly-excited Rydberg state, arising an excitation facilitation for the ensemble atoms. Our numerical studies depending on the method of quantum Monte Carlo wave function, exhibit the observation constraints of this excitation facilitation effect under practical experimental conditions. The results obtained can provide a flexible control for the excitation of Rydberg atomic ensembles and participate further uses in developing mesoscopic Rydberg gates for multiqubit quantum computation.

TI Error measurements for a quantum annealer using the one-dimensional
   Ising model with twisted boundaries
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A finite length ferromagnetic chain with opposite spin polarization imposed at its two ends is one of the simplest frustrated spin models. In the clean classical limit the domain wall inserted on account of the boundary conditions resides with equal probability on any one of the bonds, and the degeneracy is precisely equal to the number of bonds. If quantum mechanics is introduced via a transverse field, the domain wall will behave as a particle in a box, and prefer to be nearer the middle of the chain rather than the ends. A simple characteristic of a real quantum annealer is therefore which of these limits obtains in practice. Here we have used the ferromagnetic chain with antiparallel boundary spins to test a real flux qubit quantum annealer and discover that contrary to both expectations, the domain walls found are non-uniformly distributed on account of effective random longitudinal fields present notwithstanding tuning carried out to zero out such fields when the couplings between qubits are nominally zero. We present a simple derivation of the form of the distribution function for the domain walls, and show also how the effect we have discovered can be used to determine the strength of the effective random fields (noise) characterizing the annealer. The noise measured in this fashion is smaller than what is seen during the single-qubit tuning process, but nonetheless qualitatively affects the outcome of the simulation performed by the annealer.

TI Individually tunable tunnelling coefficients in optical lattices using
   local periodic driving
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as powerful quantum simulators of translationally invariant systems with many applications in e.g. strongly-correlated and topological systems. However, the ability to locally tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this provides full individual control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various example configurations realising interesting topological models such as extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realise by other means. Extending to two dimensions, we demonstrate that local periodic driving in a Lieb lattice engineers a two-dimensional (2D) network with fully controllable tunnelling magnitudes. In a three-site plaquette, we show full simultaneous control over the relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone to building a fully programmable 2D tight-binding model. We also explicitly demonstrate how utilise our technique to generate a magnetic field gradient in 2D. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many different lattice geometries.

TI Classification and Taxonomy of Undeniable Signatures: From Early Designs
   to Post-Quantum Approaches
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Undeniable signatures are a special kind of digital signature that need the active cooperation of the signer in the verification process, granting properties such as completeness, soundness, unforgeability, and invisibility. Moreover, these schemes techniques allow controlled verification in contrast to traditional signatures, meaning that they are perfect in situations when secrecy and selective disclosure are important. Over the years, undeniable signatures have undergone substantial evolution from the transition from classical encryption such as discrete logarithms to modern algorithms that include lattice-based, hash-based, and code-based post-quantum. In this article, focused on classification and taxonomy of undeniable signature schemes through evolution from early concepts to solutions that are resistant to quantum alterations. Unlike previous surveys, our taxonomy highlights distinctions between classical, convertible, and designated confirmer variants, while also introducing a post-quantum perspective rooted in lattice-based and code-based constructions. We analytically classify key properties for undeniable signature schemes whence inspect their strengths and weaknesses, also offer a methodical framework for comprehending the differences between them. Our contributions comprise a comprehensive taxonomy of undeniable signatures, considering various aspects such as security, efficiency, and practical applicability, as well as insights into potential areas future research paths, especially in terms of post-quantum systems. By displaying our views in this regard, our goal is to provide a more profound comprehension and guide ongoing and effective research in undeniable signature schemes.

TI Crystals-Dilithium on ARMv8
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Crystals-Dilithium is one of the digital-signature algorithms in NIST's ongoing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization final round. Security and computational efficiency concerning software and hardware implementations are the primary criteria for PQC standardization. Many studies were conducted to efficiently apply Dilithium in various environments; however, they are focused on traditionally used PC and 32-bit Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processors (Cortex-M4). ARMv8-based processors are more advanced embedded microcontrollers (MCUs) and have been widely used for various IoT devices, edge computing devices, and On-Board Units in autonomous driving cars. In this study, we present an efficient Crystals-Dilithium implementation on ARMv8-based MCU. To enhance Dilithium's performance, we optimize number theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplication, the core operation of Dilithium, by leveraging ARMv8's architectural properties such as large register sets and NEON engine. We apply task parallelism to NTT-based polynomial multiplication using the NEON engine. In addition, we reduced the number of memory accesses during NTT-based polynomial multiplication with the proposed merging and register-holding techniques. Finally, we present an interleaved NTT-based multiplication simultaneously executed with ARM processor and NEON engine. This implementation can further optimize performance by eliminating the ARM processor latency with NEON overheads. Through the proposed optimization methods, for Dilithium 3, we achieved a performance improvement of about 43.83% in key pair generation, 113.25% in signing, and 41.92% in verification compared to the reference implementation submitted to the final round of the NIST PQC competition.

TI Multifold behavior of the information transmission by the quantum
   3-switch
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We uncover new behaviors of the transmission of information by three quantum channels in superposition of causal orders subject to some level of noise. We find that the transmission can exhibit three different behaviors as the level of noise is varied. This multifold behavior can be explained by the different equivalence classes of quantum switch matrices related to specific combinations of causal orders. We classify these matrices using their characteristic polynomials and matrix invariants, and we calculate analytical expressions for the Holevo information in three representative cases. Our results are a step forward to understand and harness quantum control of causal orders with different levels of noise. We also study the Holevo information as function of a continuous order parameter and analyze transitions at integer values.

One part of the nanoribbon is covered with superconducting niobium, while the other part is connected to a gold lead via two-dimensional QAHI regions. Andreev reflection spectroscopy reveals multiple in -gap conductance peaks in different devices. In the presence of an increasing magnetic field perpendicular to the film, the multiple -peak structure evolves into a single zero -bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Theoretical simulations suggest that the measurements are consistent with the scenario that the increasing field drives the nanoribbons from a multi -channel occupied regime to a single -channel regime, which is the necessary condition for the observation of zero -energy Majorana modes.

TI Topological superconductor candidates PdBi2Te4 and
   PdBi2Te5 from a generic ab initio strategy
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Superconducting topological metals (SCTMs) have recently emerged as a promising platform of topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana zero modes for quantum computation. Despite their importance in both fundamental research and applications, SCTMs are very rare in nature. Here, we propose a strategy to design SCTMs by intercalating the superconducting units into the topological insulators. A program that characterizes the superconducting BdG Chern number of 2D BdG Hamiltonian from ab initio calculations is also developed. Following this strategy, PdBi2Te5 and PdBi2Te4 are found to be experimentally synthesizable and ideal SCTMs. Chiral TSC could be realized in such SCTMs by incorporating topological surface states with Zeeman effect, which can be realized by an external magnetic field or in proximity to ferromagnetic insulator. Our strategy provides a new method for identifying the SCTMs and TSC candidates, and the program makes it possible to design and modulate the TSC candidates from ab initio calculations.

AB In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), computation proceeds via measurements on some standard resource state. So-called flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, with Pauli flow being the most general of these. Existing work on rewriting MBQC patterns while preserving the existence of flow has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits.In this work, we show that introducing new Z-measured qubits, connected to any subset of the existing qubits, preserves the existence of Pauli flow. Furthermore, we give a unique canonical form for stabilizer ZX-diagrams inspired by recent work of Hu & Khesin [17]. We prove that any MBQClike stabilizer ZX-diagram with Pauli flow can be rewritten into this canonical form using only rules which preserve the existence of Pauli flow, and that each of these rules can be reversed while also preserving the existence of Pauli flow. Hence we have complete graphical rewriting for MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagrams with Pauli flow.

TI Quantum Implementation of the SAND Algorithm and Its Quantum Resource
   Estimation for Brute-Force Attack
SO ENTROPY
AB The SAND algorithm is a family of lightweight AND-RX block ciphers released by DCC in 2022. Our research focuses on assessing the security of SAND with a quantum computation model. This paper presents the first quantum implementation of SAND (including two versions of SAND, SAND-64 and SAND-128). Considering the depth-times-width metric, the quantum circuit implementation of the SAND algorithm demonstrates a relatively lower consumption of quantum resources than that of the quantum implementations of existing lightweight algorithms. A generalized Grover-based brute-force attack framework was implemented and employed to perform attacks on two versions of the SAND algorithm. This framework utilized the g-database algorithm, which considered different plaintext-ciphertext pairs in a unified manner, reducing quantum resource consumption. Our findings indicate that the SAND-128 algorithm achieved the NIST security level I, while the SAND-64 algorithm fell short of meeting the requirements of security level I.

TI Topological Superconductors from a Materials Perspective
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Topological superconductors (TSCs) have garnered significant research and industry attention in the past two decades. By hosting Majorana bound states which can be used as qubits that are robust against local perturbations, TSCs offer a promising platform toward (nonuniversal) topological quantum computation. However, there has been a scarcity of TSC candidates, and the experimental signatures that identify a TSC are often elusive. In this Perspective, after a short review of the TSC basics and theories, we provide an overview of the TSC materials candidates, including natural compounds and synthetic material systems. We further introduce various experimental techniques to probe TSCs, focusing on how a system is identified as a TSC candidate and why a conclusive answer is often challenging to draw. We conclude by calling for new experimental signatures and stronger computational support to accelerate the search for new TSC candidates.

TI Gate-Defined Josephson Weak-Links in Monolayer WTe2
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate-defined Josephson weak-link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all-in-one topological Josephson weak-links using monolayer WTe2.

TI Geometry controlled superconducting diode and anomalous Josephson effect
   triggered by the topological phase transition in curved proximitized
   nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the key features of the Josephson transport through a curved semiconducting nanowire. Based on numerical simulations and analytical estimates within the framework of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations we find the ground-state phase difference phi(0), between the superconducting leads tuned by the spin splitting field h driving the system from the topologically trivial to the nontrivial superconducting state. The phase phi(0) vanishes for rather small h, grows in a certain field range around the topological transition, and then saturates at large h in the Kitaev regime. Both the subgap and the continuum quasiparticle levels are responsible for the above behavior of the anomalous Josephson phase. It is demonstrated that the crossover region on phi(0)(h) dependencies reveals itself in the superconducting diode effect. The resulting tunable phase battery can be used as a probe of topological transitions in Majorana networks and can become a useful element of various quantum computation devices.

AB Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is twofold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice-gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.

TI Organometallic lanthanide bismuth cluster single-molecule magnets
SO CHEM
AB Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecules that can retain magnetic polarization in the absence of an external magnetic field and embody the ultimate size limit for spin-based information storage and processing. Multimetallic lanthanide complexes lacking magnetic exchange coupling enable fast relaxation pathways that attenuate the full potential of these species. Employment of diamagnetic heavy main group elements with diffuse orbitals may lead to unprecedented strong coupling. Herein, two bismuth-cluster-bridged lanthanide complexes, [K(THF)(4)](2)[Cp*(2)Ln(2)Bi(6)] (Cp* = pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl; 1-Ln, Ln = Tb, Dy), were synthesized via a solution organometallic approach. The neutral [Ln(2)Bi(6)] heterometal-locubane core features lanthanide centers that are bridged by a rare Bi-6(6-) Zintl ion, which supports strong ferromagnetic interactions between lanthanides. This affords the rare observation of magnetic blocking and open hysteresis loops for superexchange-coupled SMMs comprising solely lanthanide ions. Both compounds constitute the first SMMs containing bismuth donors paving the way for promising synthetic targets for quantum computation.

TI Stroboscopic Hamiltonian engineering in the low-frequency regime with a
   one-dimensional quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a scheme to perform stroboscopic Hamiltonian engineering in the low frequency regime using a quantum system with one-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling that are commonly available in the NISQ era. Computational problems are encoded in the effective Hamiltonian of the quantum systems under the effect of external driving. Our approach is nonperturbative and it does not rely on high-frequency expansions, which are a common tool in Floquet engineering. In our paper, the effective Hamiltonian that we want to engineer is fully tailored through designing the periodic driving. We illustrate how this quantum computation proceeds with two examples, an instance from the 3-SAT problem and the LiH molecule quantum chemistry simulation. In the case of the 3-SAT Hamiltonian, we show that by starting from the ground state of the trivial Hamiltonian, the quantum systems go through an adiabatic process in the stroboscopic picture towards the target Hamiltonian of the problem.

TI A light-induced phononic symmetry switch and giant dissipationless
   topological photocurrent in ZrTe5
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Dissipationless currents from topologically protected states are promising for disorder-tolerant electronics and quantum computation. Here, we photogenerate giant anisotropic terahertz nonlinear currents with vanishing scattering, driven by laser-induced coherent phonons of broken inversion symmetry in a centrosymmetric Dirac material ZrTe5. Our work suggests that this phononic terahertz symmetry switching leads to formation of Weyl points, whose chirality manifests in a transverse, helicity-dependent current, orthogonal to the dynamical inversion symmetry breaking axis, via circular photogalvanic effect. The temperature-dependent topological photocurrent exhibits several distinct features: Berry curvature dominance, particle-hole reversal near conical points and chirality protection that is responsible for an exceptional ballistic transport length of similar to 10 mu m. These results, together with first-principles modelling, indicate two pairs of Weyl points dynamically created by B-1u phonons of broken inversion symmetry. Such phononic terahertz control breaks ground for coherent manipulation of Weyl nodes and robust quantum transport without application of static electric or magnetic fields.

TI Controlling many-body quantum chaos: Bose-Hubbard systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This work develops a quantum control application of many-body quantum chaos for ultracold bosonic gases trapped in optical lattices. It is long known how to harness exponential sensitivity to changes in initial conditions for control purposes in classically chaotic systems. In the technique known as targeting, instead of a hindrance to control, the instability becomes a resource. Recently, this classical targeting has been generalized to quantum systems either by periodically countering the inevitable quantum state spreading or by introducing a control Hamiltonian, where both enable localized states to be guided along special chaotic trajectories toward any of a broad variety of desired target states. Only strictly unitary dynamics are involved; i.e. it gives a coherent quantum targeting. In this paper, the introduction of a control Hamiltonian is applied to Bose-Hubbard systems in chaotic dynamical regimes. Properly selected unstable mean field solutions can be followed particularly rapidly to states possessing precise phase relationships and occupancies. In essence, the method generates a quantum simulation technique that can access rather special states. The protocol reduces to a time-dependent control of the chemical potentials, opening up the possibility for application in optical lattice experiments. Explicit applications to custom state preparation and stabilization of quantum many-body scars are presented in one- and two-dimensional lattices (three-dimensional applications are similarly possible).

TI Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.

TI Can the displacemon device test objective collapse models?
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Testing the limits of the applicability of quantum mechanics will deepen our understanding of the universe and may shed light on the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. At present there is a wide range of approaches for such macroscopic tests spanning from matter-wave interferometry of large molecules to precision measurements of heating rates in the motion of micro-scale cantilevers. The "displacemon" is a proposed electromechanical device consisting of a mechanical resonator flux-coupled to a superconducting qubit enabling generation and readout of mechanical quantum states. In the original proposal, the mechanical resonator was a carbon nanotube, containing 10(6) nucleons. Here, in order to probe quantum mechanics at a more macroscopic scale, we propose using an aluminum mechanical resonator on two larger mass scales, one inspired by the Marshall-Simon-Penrose-Bouwmeester moving-mirror proposal, and one set by the Planck mass. For such a device, we examine the experimental requirements needed to perform a more macroscopic quantum test and thus feasibly detect the decoherence effects predicted by two objective collapse models: Diosi-Penrose and continuous spontaneous localization. Our protocol for testing these two theories takes advantage of the displacemon architecture to create non-Gaussian mechanical states out of equilibrium with their environment and then analyzes the measurement statistics of a superconducting qubit. We find that with improvements to the fabrication and vibration sensitivities of these electromechanical devices, the displacemon device provides a new route to feasibly test decoherence mechanisms beyond standard quantum theory.

TI Wigner function analysis of the decoherence of discrete-time quantum
   walk in the bit-phase noise channel
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The one-dimensional discrete-time Hadamard quantum walk in the bit-phase noise channel is studied using the Wigner function. Decoherence is characterized using the l1-norm of coherence, Wigner function, and complex Wigner entropy. The l1-norm of coherence is used to quantify the persistence of coin coherence, and the non-classicality is verified through negativity of the Wigner function. Analysis of the complex Wigner entropy revealed a non-monotonic behavior in the non-classicality of the quantum walk, with an optimal noise level where the non-classicality is maximized. The Wigner function analysis is able to provide information related to non-classicality that is not possible using the standard Hilbert-space operator formalism.

TI Translationally Invariant Universal Quantum Hamiltonians in 1D
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB Recent work has characterized rigorously what it means for one quantum system to simulate another and demonstrated the existence of universal Hamiltonians-simple spin lattice Hamiltonians that can replicate the entire physics of any other quantum many-body system. Previous universality results have required proofs involving complicated 'chains' of perturbative 'gadgets.' In this paper, we derive a significantly simpler and more powerful method of proving universality of Hamiltonians, directly leveraging the ability to encode quantum computation into ground states. This provides new insight into the origins of universal models and suggests a deep connection between universality and complexity. We apply this new approach to show that there are universal models even in translationally invariant spin chains in 1D. This gives as a corollary a new Hamiltonian complexity result that the local Hamiltonian problem for translationally invariant spin chains in one dimension with an exponentially small promise gap is PSPACE-complete. Finally, we use these new universal models to construct the first known toy model of 2D-1D holographic duality between local Hamiltonians.

TI Immanants of blocks from random matrices in some unitary ensembles
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The permanent of unitary matrices and their blocks has attracted increasing attention in quantum physics and quantum computation because of connections with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and the boson sampling problem. In that context, it would be useful to know the distribution of the permanent and other immanants for random matrices, but that seems a difficult problem. We advance this program by calculating the average of the squared modulus of a generic immanant for blocks from random matrices in the unitary group, in the orthogonal group and in the circular orthogonal ensemble. In the case of the permanent in the unitary group, we also compute the variance. Our approach is based on Weingarten functions and factorizations of permutations. In the course of our calculations we are led to two curious conjectures relating dimensions of irreducible representations of the orthogonal and symplectic groups to the value of zonal and symplectic zonal polynomials at the identity.

TI Distinguishing Majorana and quasi-Majorana bound states in a hybrid
   superconductor-semiconductor nanowire with inhomogeneous potential
   barriers
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanowire with a spatially inhomogeneous potential can host partially separated quasi-Majorana bound states (quasi-MBSs). In this work, we consider a two-lead (three-terminal) setup of transport with two different potential barriers and find that for a Majorana nanowire with smooth potential barriers at both ends, the quasi-MBSs can be well-separated at the nanowire's endpoints just like true MBSs, and the nonlocal conductance process displays parity-related interference behavior in both the quasi-MBS regime and topological regime. By contrast, for a Majorana nanowire with a smooth potential barrier only at one end, the quasi-MBSs are partially separated, and no parity-related interference pattern occurs in the quasi-MBS regime. Our findings provide a simple way to distinguish MBSs from quasi-MBSs and give some insight into quasi-MBSbased quantum computation.

TI Preparation and verification of tensor network states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a family of tensor network states defined on regular lattices that come with a natural definition of an adiabatic path to prepare them. This family comprises relevant classes of states, such as injective matrix product and projected entangled-pair states, and some corresponding to classical spin models. We show how uniform lower bounds to the gap of the parent Hamiltonian along the adiabatic trajectory can be efficiently computed using semidefinite programming. This allows one to check whether the adiabatic preparation can be performed efficiently with a scalable effort. We also derive a set of observables whose expectation values can be easily determined and that form a complete set, in the sense that they uniquely characterize the state. We identify a subset of those observables which can be efficiently computed if one has access to the quantum state and local measurements, and analyze how they can be used in verification procedures.

TI Identification and mitigation of conducting package losses for quantum
   superconducting devices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Low-loss superconducting rf devices are required when used for quantum computation. Here, we present a series of measurements and simulations showing that conducting losses in the packaging of our superconducting resonator devices affect the maximum achievable internal quality factors (Q(i)) for a series of thin-film Al quarter-wave resonators with fundamental resonant frequencies varying between 4.9 and 5.8 GHz. By utilizing resonators with different widths and gaps, different volumes of the stored electromagnetic energy were sampled, thus affecting Q(i). When the backside of the sapphire substrate of the resonator device is adhered to a Cu package with a conducting silver glue, a monotonic decrease in the maximum achievable Q(i) is found as the electromagnetic sampling volume is increased. This is a result of induced currents in large surface resistance regions and dissipation underneath the substrate. By placing a hole underneath the substrate and using superconducting material for the package, we decrease the Ohmic losses and increase the maximum Q(i) for the larger size resonators.

AB Data streaming, in which a large dataset is received as a "stream" of updates, is an important model in the study of space-bounded computation. Starting with the work of Le Gall [SPAA '06], it has been known that quantum streaming algorithms can use asymptotically less space than their classical counterparts for certain problems. However, so far, all known examples of quantum advantages in streaming are for problems that are either specially constructed for that purpose, or require many streaming passes over the input.
   We give a one-pass quantum streaming algorithm for one of the best-studied problems in classical graph streaming-the triangle counting problem. Almost-tight parametrized upper and lower bounds are known for this problem in the classical setting; our algorithm uses polynomially less space in certain regions of the parameter space, resolving a question posed by Jain and Nayak in 2014 on achieving quantum advantages for natural streaming problems.

TI Majorana edge and corner states in square and kagome quantum spin-32
   liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum spin liquids hosting Majorana excitations have recently experienced renewed interest for potential applications to topological quantum computation. Performing logical operations with reduced poisoning requires to localize such quasiparticles at specific point of a device, with energies that are well defined and inside the bulk energy gap. These are two defining features of second-order topological insulators (SOTIs). Here, we show two spin-3/2 models that support quantum spin liquid phases characterized by Majorana excitations. One of them, defined on a square lattice, is analytically solvable thanks to a theorem by Lieb and behaves as a known SOTI. We show that, depending on the values of spin couplings, it is possible to localize either fermions or Majorana particles at its corners. The second model, defined on a kagome lattice, exhibits coexisting topologies, which reflect in a complex pattern of edge states. For certain choices of spin couplings, edge states can localize at one of the corners of a finite kagome lattice with flat edges.

TI Lumped element granular aluminum resonators with high kinetic
   inductances
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Recently, a new kind of distributed element superconducting resonators with granular aluminum (grAl) has been developed for circuit quantum electrodynamics. Given that lumped element resonators possess certain advantages over the distributed element ones, in this paper, we use a relatively simple micro-nanotechnology, without the etching process, to fabricate the designed lumped element superconducting grAl resonators. They are deposited on silicon substrates by DC magnetron sputtering of pure Al in an atmosphere of Ar and O-2. By cryogenic microwave transmission measurements, at a temperature of 50 mK, we find that, compared with a usual Al resonator of the same size, such a device shows significantly strong nonlinearity and thus higher kinetic inductance. The noise features, quality factors, and temperature-dependence of the resonant frequencies have been investigated experimentally. It is believed that the lumped element superconducting resonators with high kinetic inductance demonstrated here could also be applied to superconducting quantum computation and photon counting in the future.

TI Error-Mitigated Quantum Metrology via Virtual Purification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum metrology with entangled resources aims to achieve sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit by harnessing quantum effects even in the presence of environmental noise. So far, sensitivity has been mainly discussed from the viewpoint of reducing statistical errors under the assumption of perfect knowledge of a noise model. However, we cannot always obtain complete information about a noise model due to coherence time fluctuations, which are frequently observed in experiments. Such unknown fluctuating noise leads to systematic errors and nullifies the quantum advantages. Here, we propose an error-mitigated quantum metrology that can filter out unknown fluctuating noise with the aid of purification-based quantum error mitigation. We demonstrate that our protocol mitigates systematic errors and recovers superclassical scaling in a practical situation with time-inhomogeneous bias-inducing noise. Our result is the first demonstration to reveal the usefulness of purification-based error mitigation for unknown fluctuating noise, thus paving the way not only for practical quantum metrology but also for quantum computation affected by such noise.

TI Micromachined Mechanical Resonant Sensors: From Materials, Structural
   Designs to Applications
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Driving a micro and nanomechanical structure to resonance and observing its resonant motion in the physical world have led to numerous fundamental discoveries in physics, sciences, chemistry, biology, and engineering, as well as device commercialization. Scaling down mechanical structures from micrometric to nanometric size has enabled the utilization of resonant motions to probe material properties and various dynamical phenomena in quantum coherence and squeezing. Recent advances in material sciences and nanofabrication resulted in successful demonstration of ultra-high frequency operation (GHz range) and ultra-high quality factor (10 billion) micromachined mechanical resonators (MMRs). The resonant motion of these structures has been utilized as an indispensable tool to weigh biological and chemical species at resolution of atomic mass unit, sense a force as small as zepto-newton, and to detect numerous other physical parameters. Here, a systematic view on the resonant sensing transduction is provided, underlying physics, and sensing structures realized with micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) technologies. It is also describe the roles of nanomaterials and structures, nano-fabrication and rational designs on the resonance frequency and quality factor of MMRs toward high-performance sensing. This paper discusses the most recent advances in the development of MMRs for material characterization as well as biological, chemical, and physical sensing. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and perspectives on design, fabrication, and developments of resonant sensors with high quality factor toward quantum sensing, and ultra-high sensitivity and resolution for classical sensing applications.

TI A New Protocol for Semi-quantum Private Set of Intersection and Union
   Mixed Cardinality for Any Tripartite Based on Bell States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The cardinality of the private set allows multiple parties to jointly compute the cardinality of the intersection and union without revealing their respective private sets. It plays an important role in data mining and data analysis to protect privacy. However, existing studies only focus on computing the cardinality of the intersection or union of private sets. To extend its application in various scenes, a private-set intersection and union mixed cardinality protocol are proposed for any tripartite based on Bell states for the first time. During the protocol, participants are supposed to be semi-quantum to reduce the consumption of quantum resources and improve the realizability of the protocol. Furthermore, correctness and security analysis show that the protocol can withstand internal and external attacks. Additionally, the IBM Quantum Simulator (IBMQS) is also applied to illustrate the fundamentals of the protocol and verify the availability of the protocol. The results are expected have positive effects on the further development of secure multiparty computation.
   A private-set intersection and union mixed cardinality protocol are proposed for any tripartite based on Bell states. As only the third party needs the full quantum capability and the rest of the participants do not. Even with the help of a third party, it does not compromise the privacy of the participants. image

TI Coherence as a Resource for Shor?s Algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Shor's factoring algorithm provides a superpolynomial speedup over all known classical factoring algorithms. Here, we address the question of which quantum properties fuel this advantage. We investigate a sequential variant of Shor's algorithm with a fixed overall structure and identify the role of coherence for this algorithm quantitatively. We analyze this protocol in the framework of dynamical resource theories, which capture the resource character of operations that can create and detect coherence. This allows us to derive a lower and an upper bound on the success probability of the protocol, which depend on rigorously defined measures of coherence as a dynamical resource. We compare these bounds with the classical limit of the protocol and conclude that within the fixed structure that we consider, coherence is the quantum resource that determines its performance by bounding the success probability from below and above. Therefore, we shine new light on the fundamental role of coherence in quantum computation.

TI Stability of Logarithmic Sobolev Inequalities Under a Noncommutative

SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB We generalize Holley-Stroock's perturbation argument from commutative to finite dimensional quantum Markov semigroups. As a consequence, results on (complete) modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for self-adjoint quantum Markov processes can be used to prove estimates on the exponential convergence in relative entropy of quantum Markov systems which preserve a fixed state. This leads to estimates for the decay to equilibrium for coupled systems and to estimates for mixed state preparation times using Lindblad operators. Our techniques also apply to discrete time settings, where we show that the strong data processing inequality constant of a quantum channel can be controlled by that of a corresponding unital channel.

TI Hardware Design of an Advanced-Feature Cryptographic Tile Within the
   European Processor Initiative
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB This work describes the hardware implementation of a cryptographic accelerators suite, named Crypto-Tile, in the framework of the European Processor Initiative (EPI) project. The EPI project traced the roadmap to develop the first family of low-power processors with the design fully made in Europe, for Big Data, supercomputers and automotive. Each of the coprocessors of Crypto-Tile is dedicated to a specific family of cryptographic algorithms, offering functions for symmetric and public-key cryptography, computation of digests, generation of random numbers, and Post-Quantum cryptography. The performances of each coprocessor outperform other available solutions, offering innovative hardware-native services, such as key management, clock randomisation and access privilege mechanisms. The system has been synthesised on a 7 nm standard-cell technology, being the first Cryptoprocessor to be characterised in such an advanced silicon technology. The post-synthesis netlist has been employed to assess the resistance of Crypto-Tile to power analysis side-channel attacks. Finally, a demoboard has been implemented, integrating a RISC-V softcore processor and the Crypto-Tile module, and drivers for hardware abstraction layer, bare-metal applications and drivers for Linux kernel in C language have been developed. Finally, we exploited them to compare in terms of execution speed the hardware-accelerated algorithms against software-only solutions.

TI Single-photon-based quantum secure protocol for the socialist
   millionaires' problem
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The socialist millionaires' problem, emanating from the millionaires' problem, allows two millionaires to determine whether they happen to be equally rich while remaining their riches undisclosed to each other. Most of the current quantum solutions to the socialist millionaires' problem have lower efficiency and are theoretically feasible. In this paper, we introduce a practical quantum secure protocol for the socialist millionaires' problem based on single photons, which can be easily implemented and manipulated with current technology. Our protocol necessitates the involvement of a semi-honest third party (TP) responsible for preparing the single-photon sequences and transmitting them to Alice who performs Identity or Hadamard operations on the received quantum sequences via her private inputs and the secret keys, producing new quantum sequences that are subsequently sent to Bob. Similarly, Bob encodes his private inputs into the received quantum sequences to produce new quantum sequences, which are then sent to TP. By conducting single-particle measurements on the quantum sequences received from Bob, TP can ascertain the equality of private inputs between Alice and Bob, and subsequently communicate the comparison result to them. To assess the feasibility, the proposed protocol is simulated on IBM Quantum Cloud Platform. Furthermore, security analysis demonstrates that our protocol can withstand attacks from outsiders, such as eavesdroppers, and from insider participants attempting to grab the private input of another participant.

TI Security Threats to 5G Networks for Social Robots in Public Spaces: A
   Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper surveys security threats to 5G-enabled wireless access networks for social robots in public spaces (SRPS). The use of social robots (SR) in public areas requires specific Quality of Service (QoS) planning to meet its unique requirements. Its 5G threat landscape entails more than cybersecurity threats that most previous studies focus on. This study examines the 5G wireless RAN for SRPS from three perspectives: SR and wireless access points, the ad hoc network link between SR and user devices, and threats to SR and users' communication equipment. The paper analyses the security threats to confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorisation, and privacy from the SRPS security objectives perspective. We begin with an overview of SRPS use cases and access network requirements, followed by 5G security standards, requirements, and the need for a more representative threat landscape for SRPS. The findings confirm that the RAN of SRPS is most vulnerable to physical, side-channel, intrusion, injection, manipulation, and natural and malicious threats. The paper presents existing mitigation to the identified attacks and recommends including physical level security (PLS) and post-quantum cryptography in the early design of SRPS. The insights from this survey will provide valuable risk assessment and management input to researchers, industrial practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders of SRPS.

TI Assessment of the Bundle SNSPD Plus FPGA-Based TDC for High-Performance
   Time Measurements
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Counting single photons and measuring their arrival time is of crucial importance for imaging and quantum applications that use single photons to outperform classical techniques. The investigation of the coincidence, i.e. correlation, between photons can be used to enhance the resolution of optical imaging techniques or to transmit information using quantum cryptography. Time measurements at the state-of-the-art are performed using Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs), the lowest timing jitter single-photon detectors, connected to digital oscilloscopes or digitizers. This method is not well adapted to the ever-increasing and pressing requirement to perform measurements on a high number of channels at the same time. We focus the high-performance measure of the arrival time of photons and their correlation by means of SNSPDs and a 16-channel Time-to-Digital Converter fully implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In this approach, the photons' coincidence is analyzed in real-time directly in the FPGA, resulting in a Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) of 22.8 ps r.m.s.. For the practical benefit of the scientific community, an extended and comprehensive panorama also of comparison with the actual available strategies in this field of applications is offered through a huge number of references.

TI Impossibility of universal work extraction from coherence: reconciling
   axiomatic and resource-theory approaches
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We compare how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence arises from different approaches to quantum thermodynamics: an explicit protocol accounting for all relevant quantum resources, and axiomatic, information-theoretic constraints imposed by constructor theory. We first explain how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence is directly implied by a recently proposed constructor-theoretic theorem based on distinguishability, which is scale- and dynamics- independent. Then we give an explicit demonstration of this result within quantum theory, by proving the impossibility of generalising a proposed quantum protocol for deterministically extracting work from coherence. We demonstrate a new connection between the impossibility of universal work extractors and constructor-based irreversibility, which was recently shown using the quantum homogenizer. Finally we discuss additional avenues for applying the constructor-theoretic formulation of work extraction to quantum thermodynamics, including the irreversibility of quantum computation and thermodynamics of multiple conserved quantities.

TI A planar tracking strategy based on multiple-interpretable improved PPO
   algorithm with few-shot technique
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Facing to a planar tracking problem, a multiple-interpretable improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with few-shot technique is proposed, namely F-GBQ-PPO. Compared with the normal PPO, the main improvements of F-GBQ-PPO are to increase the interpretability, and reduce the consumption for real interaction samples. Considering to increase incomprehensibility of a tracking policy, three levels of interpretabilities has been studied, including the perceptual, logical and mathematical interpretabilities. Detailly speaking, it is realized through introducing a guided policy based on Apollonius circle, a hybrid exploration policy based on biological motions, and the update of external parameters based on quantum genetic algorithm. Besides, to deal with the potential lack of real interaction samples in real applications, a few-shot technique is contained in the algorithm, which mainly generate fake samples through a multi-dimension Gaussian process. By mixing fake samples with real ones in a certain proportion, the demand for real samples can be reduced.

TI Deterministic and efficient source of frequency-polarization
   hyper-encoded photonic qubits
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The frequency or color of photons is an attractive degree of freedom to encode and distribute quantum information over long distances. However, the generation of frequency-encoded photonic qubits has so far relied on probabilistic nonlinear single-photon sources and inefficient gates. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of photonic qubits hyper-encoded in frequency and polarization based on a semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity. We exploit the double dipole structure of a neutral exciton and demonstrate the generation of any quantum superposition in amplitude and phase, controlled by the polarization of the pump laser pulse. The source generates frequency-polarization single-photon qubits at a rate of 4 MHz corresponding to a generation probability at the first lens of 28 +/- 2%, with a photon number purity >98%. The photons show an indistinguishability >91% for each dipole and 88% for a balanced quantum superposition of both. The density matrix of the hyper-encoded photonic state is measured by time-resolved polarization tomography, evidencing a fidelity to the target state of 94 +/- 8% and concurrence of 77 +/- 2%, here limited by frequency overlap in our device. Our approach brings the advantages of quantum dot sources to the field of quantum information processing based on frequency encoding.

TI Rainbow Trapping with Engineered Topological Corner States and Cavities
   in Photonic Crystals
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This work presents a pioneering photonic crystal (PC) heterostructure design exploiting tailored topological corner states and cavities to unleash a fascinating topological rainbow effect. This effect arises from the strategic integration of a nontrivial topological PC with sharp corners within a trivial PC matrix, resulting in a heterostructure rich in corner states and cavities. The critical innovation lies in manipulating the sector angle of circular columns, granting dynamic control over the rainbow effect and light localization. This manipulation induces distinct group velocities for different light frequencies, leading to their separation and localization at specific corner states. This remarkable "rainbow trapping" phenomenon manifests as highly confined light exhibiting exceptional resilience against disorder. These findings illuminate a pathway toward crafting next-generation photonic devices boasting unparalleled functionalities. The reconfigurable rainbow trapping holds immense potential for applications in wavelength division multiplexing, optical sensing, and even venturing into quantum information processing.

TI Positive Maps and Entanglement in Real Hilbert Spaces
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB The theory of positive maps plays a central role in operator algebras and functional analysis and has countless applications in quantum information science. The theory was originally developed for operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces and less is known about its variant on real Hilbert spaces. In this article, we study positive maps acting on a full matrix algebra over the reals, pointing out a number of fundamental differences with the complex case and discussing their implications in quantum information. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a real map to admit a positive complexification and connect the existence of positive maps with non-positive complexification with the existence of mixed states that are entangled in real Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but separable in the complex version, providing explicit examples both for the maps and for the states. Finally, we discuss entanglement breaking and PPT maps, and we show that a straightforward real version of the PPT-squared conjecture is false even in dimension 2. Nevertheless, we show that the original PPT-squared conjecture implies a different conjecture for real maps, in which the PPT property is replaced by a stronger property of invariance under partial transposition (IPT). When the IPT property is assumed, we prove an asymptotic version of the conjecture.

TI Cryptographic approach to quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a cryptographically motivated framework for quantum metrology in the presence of a malicious adversary. We begin by devising an estimation strategy for a (potentially) altered resource (due to a malicious adversary) and quantify the amount of bias and the loss in precision as a function of the introduced uncertainty in the resource. By incorporating an appropriate cryptographic protocol, the uncertainty in the resource can be bounded with respect to the soundness of the cryptographic protocol. Thus the effectiveness of the quantum metrology problem can be directly related to the effectiveness of the cryptography protocol. As an example, we consider a quantum metrology problem in which resources are exchanged through an unsecured quantum channel. We then construct two protocols for this task which offer a trade-off between difficulty of implementation and efficiency.

TI Gate-Controlled Anyon Generation and Detection in Kitaev Spin Liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Reliable manipulation of non-Abelian Ising anyons supported by Kitaev spin liquids may enable intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we introduce a standalone scheme for both generating and detecting individual Ising anyons using tunable gate voltages in a heterostructure containing a non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid and a monolayer semiconductor. The key ingredients of our setup are a Kondo coupling to stabilize an Ising anyon in the spin liquid around each electron in the semiconductor, and a large charging energy to allow control over the electron numbers in distinct gate-defined regions of the semiconductor. In particular, a single Ising anyon can be generated at a disk-shaped region by gate tuning its electron number to one, while it can be interferometrically detected by measuring the electrical conductance of a ring-shaped region around it whose electron number is allowed to fluctuate between zero and one. We provide concrete experimental guidelines for implementing our proposal in promising candidate materials like alpha-RuCl3.

TI A New Lagrangian Problem Crossover-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
   of Crossover Standards
SO SYSTEMS
AB The performance of most evolutionary metaheuristic algorithms relies on various operators. The crossover operator is a standard based on population-based algorithms, which is divided into two types: application-dependent and application-independent crossover operators. In the process of optimization, these standards always help to select the best-fit point. The high efficiency of crossover operators allows engineers to minimize errors in engineering application optimization while saving time and avoiding overpricing. There are two crucial objectives behind this paper; first, we provide an overview of the crossover standards classification that has been used by researchers for solving engineering operations and problem representation. This paper proposes a novel standard crossover based on the Lagrangian Dual Function (LDF) to enhance the formulation of the Lagrangian Problem Crossover (LPX). The LPX for 100 generations of different pairs parent chromosomes is compared to Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) standards and Blended Crossover (BX) for real-coded crossovers. Three unimodal test functions with various random values show that LPX has better performance in most cases and comparative results in other cases. Moreover, the LPB algorithm is used to compare LPX with SBX, BX, and Qubit Crossover (Qubit-X) operators to demonstrate accuracy and performance during exploitation evaluations. Finally, the proposed crossover stand operator results are demonstrated, proved, and analyzed statistically by the Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test.

TI Topological superconductivity in monolayer
   Td-MoTe2
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Topological superconductivity has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in quantum computation, but its experimental realization remains challenging. Recently, monolayer Td-MoTe2 was observed to exhibit gate tunable superconductivity, and its in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli limit. Here, we show that an in-plane magnetic field beyond the Pauli limit can drive the superconducting monolayer Td-MoTe2 into a topological superconductor. The topological superconductivity arises from the interplay between the in-plane Zeeman coupling and the unique Ising plus in-plane spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the monolayer Td-MoTe2. The Ising plus in-plane SOC plays the essential role to enable the effective px + ipy pairing. As the essential Ising plus in-plane SOC in the monolayer Td-MoTe2 is generated by an in-plane polar field, our proposal demonstrates that applying an in-plane magnetic field to a gate tunable 2D superconductor with an in-plane polar axis is a feasible way to realize topological superconductivity.

TI Machine learning detection of Majorana zero modes from zero-bias peak
   measurements
SO MATTER
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) carry non-Abelian statistics and great promise for topological quantum computation. A key signature of MZMs is the zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) in tunneling differential conductance. However, identifying MZMs from ZBPs has been challenging due to topological trivial states generating spurious signals. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that can distinguish MZM from other signals using ZBP data. Quantum transport simulation from tight-binding models is used to generate training data, while persistent cohomology analysis confirms the feasibility of machinebased classification. Even with noisy data, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier reaches 85% accuracy for 1D data and 94% for 2D data with Zeeman splitting. Tests on prior experiments show that key observations from some of the prior experiments are more likely to originate from MZMs. Our model offers a quantitative approach to assess MZMs using solely ZBP data. Furthermore, our results highlight the use of machine learning on exotic quantum systems with experimental-computational integration.

TI Anomalous Spin Textures in a 2D Topological Superconductor Induced by
   Point Impurities
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Topological superconductors are foreseen as good candidates for the search of Majorana zero modes, where they appear as edge states and can be used for quantum computation. In this context, it becomes necessary to study the robustness and behavior of electron states in topological superconductors when a magnetic or non-magnetic impurity is present. The focus is on scattering resonances in the bands and on spin texture to know what the spin behavior of the electrons in the system will be. It is found that the scattering resonances appear outside the superconducting gap, thus providing evidence of topological robustness. Non-trivial and anisotropic spin textures related to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are also found. The spin textures show a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction governed by Friedel oscillations. It is believed that the results are useful for further studies which consider many-point-impurity scattering or a more structured impurity potential with a finite range.

TI Possible limits on superconducting quantum computers from spontaneous
   wave-function collapse models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model is an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics, which introduces a noise-coupled nonlinearly to the wave function to account for its collapse. We consider CSL effects on quantum computers made of superconducting transmon qubits. As a direct effect CSL reduces quantum superpositions of the computational basis states of the qubits: we show the reduction rate to be negligibly small. However, an indirect effect of CSL, dissipation induced by the noise, also leads transmon qubits to decohere, by generating additional quasiparticles. Since the decoherence rate of transmon qubits depends on the quasiparticle density, by computing their generation rate induced by CSL, we can estimate the corresponding quasiparticle density and thus the limit set by CSL on the performances of transmon quantum computers. We show that CSL could spoil the quantum computation of practical algorithms on large devices. We further explore the possibility of testing CSL effects on superconducting devices.

TI Noise-robust classification of single-shot electron spin readouts using
   a deep neural network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Single-shot readout of charge and spin states by charge sensors such as quantum point contacts and quantum dots are essential technologies for the operation of semiconductor spin qubits. The fidelity of the single-shot readout depends both on experimental conditions such as signal-to-noise ratio, system temperature, and numerical parameters such as threshold values. Accurate charge sensing schemes that are robust under noisy environments are indispensable for developing a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation architecture. In this study, we present a novel single-shot readout classification method that is robust to noises using a deep neural network (DNN). Importantly, the DNN classifier is automatically configured for spin-up and spin-down traces in any noise environment by tuning the trainable parameters using the datasets of charge transition signals experimentally obtained at a charging line. Moreover, we verify that our DNN classification is robust under noisy environment in comparison to the two conventional classification methods used for charge and spin state measurements in various quantum dot experiments.

TI Symmetric Finite-Time Preparation of Cluster States via Quantum Pumps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB It has recently been established that clusterlike states-states that are in the same symmetry-protected topological phase as the cluster state-provide a family of resource states that can be utilized for measurement-based quantum computation. In this Letter, we ask whether it is possible to prepare clusterlike states in finite time without breaking the symmetry protecting the resource state. Such a symmetry-preserving protocol would benefit from topological protection to errors in the preparation. We answer this question in the positive by providing a Hamiltonian in one higher dimension whose finite-time evolution is a unitary that acts trivially in the bulk, but pumps the desired cluster state to the boundary. Examples are given for both the 1D cluster state protected by a global symmetry, and various 2D cluster states protected by subsystem symmetries. We show that even if unwanted symmetric perturbations are present in the driving Hamiltonian, projective measurements in the bulk along with feed-forward correction is sufficient to recover a clusterlike state.

TI Atomic scale memristive photon source
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Memristive devices are an emerging new type of devices operating at the scale of a few or even single atoms. They are currently used as storage elements and are investigated for performing in-memory and neuromorphic computing. Amongst these devices, Ag/amorphous-SiOx/Pt memristors are among the most studied systems, with the electrically induced filament growth and dynamics being thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally. In this paper, we report the observation of a novel feature in these devices: The appearance of new photoluminescent centers in SiOx upon memristive switching, and photon emission correlated with the conductance changes. This observation might pave the way towards an intrinsically memristive atomic scale light source with applications in neural networks, optical interconnects, and quantum communication.

TI Gravitation from optimized computation: Einstein and beyond
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A new principle in quantum gravity, dubbed spacetime complexity, states that gravitational physics emerges from spacetime seeking to optimize the computational cost of its quantum dynamics. Thus far, this principle has been realized at the linearized level, in holographic theories with Einstein gravity duals, assuming the so-called 'Complexity-Volume' (CV) proposal. We expand on this proof in two significant directions. First, we derive higher-derivative gravitational equations by including appropriate corrections to the CV dictionary. Second, we show semi-classical equations arise by considering the leading bulk quantum corrections to CV. Our proof is valid for two-dimensional dilaton gravities, where the problem of semi-classical backreaction can be solved exactly. However, we argue the principle should hold more generally, leading us to a concrete proposal for bulk complexity of perturbative excited states in arbitrary dimensions. Our results demonstrate the robustness of spacetime complexity as a guiding principle to understand gravity in terms of quantum computation.

TI A THEORY OF QUANTUM SUBSPACE DIAGONALIZATION
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum subspace diagonalization methods are an exciting new class of algorithms for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems using quantum computers. Unfortunately, these methods require the solution of an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem, with a matrix pencil cor-rupted by a nonnegligible amount of noise that is far above the machine precision. Despite pessimistic predictions from classical worst-case perturbation theories, these methods can perform reliably well if the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using a standard truncation strategy. By leveraging and advancing classical results in matrix perturbation theory, we provide a theoretical analysis of this surprising phenomenon, proving that under certain natural conditions, a quantum subspace di-agonalization algorithm can accurately compute the smallest eigenvalue of a large Hermitian matrix. We give numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the theory and providing practical guidance for the choice of truncation level. Our new results can also be of independent interest to solving eigenvalue problems outside the context of quantum computation.

TI Effect of electron-irradiation on layered quantum materials
SO BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Technological advancement towards the quantum era requires secure communication, quantum computation and ultra-sensitive sensing capabilities. Layered quantum materials (LQMs) have remarkable optoelectronic and quantum properties that can usher us into the quantum era. Electron microscopy is the tool of choice for measuring these LQMs at an atomic and nanometre scale. On the other hand, electron-irradiation of LQMs can modify various material properties, including the creation of structural defects. We review different types of structural defects, as well as electron elastic- and inelastic-scattering induced processes. Controlled modification of optoelectronic and quantum properties of LQMs using electron-irradiation, including creation of single-photon emitters is discussed. Protection of electron-irradiation induced damage of LQMs via encapsulation by other layered materials is encouraged. We finally give insights into challenges and opportunities, including creating novel structures using an electron beam.

TI Symmetry-protected gates of Majorana qubits in a
   high-Tc higher-order topological superconductor
   platform
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We propose a platform for braiding Majorana non-Abelian anyons based on a heterostructure between a d-wave high-Tc superconductor and a quantum spin-Hall insulator. It has been recently shown that such a setup for a quantum spin-Hall insulator leads to a pair of Majorana zero modes at each corner of the sample, and thus can be regarded as a higher-order topological superconductor. We show that upon applying a Zeeman field in the region, these Majorana modes split in space and can be manipulated for braiding processes by tuning the field and pairing phase. We show that such a setup can achieve full braiding, exchanging, and arbitrary phase gates (including the pi/8 magic gates) of the Majorana zero modes, all of which are robust and protected by symmetries. As many of the ingredients of our proposed platform have been realized in recent experiments, our results provide a new route toward universal topological quantum computation.

TI Review of Certificateless Authentication Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc
   Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Vehicular networks play an integral role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) by facilitating real-time communication between vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and cloud-based services. But this inherent characteristics on mobility, decentralization, and open wireless broadcast nature makes security threats a big target to them with impersonation attacks, Sybil attacks, data breaches and unauthorized access. PKI-based authentication methods, on the other hand, do not fit our objective, given the high computational overhead, certificate management issues, and centralization risk involved in V2V authentication protocols. Certificateless authentication has been proposed to avoid the challenges and costs associated with certificate-based security infrastructures by providing a lightweight and efficient alternative solution. Based on authentication models, cryptographic techniques, privacy-preserving mechanisms, emerging technologies and security properties, this survey presents a systematic classification of certificateless authentication schemes. It encompasses an investigation of emerging cryptographic solutions like lattice-based encryption, blockchain-supported authentication/credential management, AI-empowered security, and considers their impact on VANET security, scalability, and real-time constraints. Moreover, this study considers the application of 5G networks, edge computing, and post-quantum cryptography in VANET authentication. To ensure privacy-preserving and secure vehicular communication systems that could be scaled for infrastructural networks, the results highlight the shortcomings of existing vehicular authentication methods, and the need for hybrid authentication models, standardization, and interoperability.

TI ProgramGalois: A Programmable Generator of Radix-4 Discrete Galois
   Transformation Architecture for Lattice-Based Cryptography
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) has been established as a prominent research field, with particular attention on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). As the implementing bottleneck of PQC and FHE, number theoretic transform (NTT) has been extensively studied. However, current works struggled with scalability, hindering their adaptation to various parameters, such as bit width and polynomial length. In this article, we proposed a novel Discrete Galois Transformation (DGT) algorithm utilizing the radix-4 variant to achieve a higher level of parallelism to the existing NTT. Furthermore, to implement the efficient radix-4 DGT adapting more LBCs, we proposed a set of scalable building blocks, including a modified Barrett modular multiplier accepting arbitrary modulus with only one integer multiplier, a radix-4 DGT butterfly unit, and a stream permutation network. The proposed modules are implemented on the Xilinx Virtex-7 and U250 FPGA to evaluate resource utilization and performance. Lastly, a design space exploration framework is proposed to generate optimized radix-4 DGT hardware constrained by polynomial and platform parameters. The sensitivity analysis showcases the generated hardware's performance and scalability. The implementation results on the Xilinx Virtex-7 and U250 FPGA show significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art works, which reached at least 35%, 192%, and 68% area-time product improvements in terms of LUTs, BRAMs, and DSPs, respectively.

AB Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH) is an isogeny-based key exchange protocol which is believed to be secure even when parties use long-lived secret keys. To secure CSIDH against side-channel attacks, constant-time implementations with additional dummy isogeny computations are employed. In this study, we demonstrate a fault injection attack on the constant-time real-then-dummy CSIDH to recover the full static secret key. We prototype the attack using voltage glitches on the victim STM32 microcontroller. The attack scheme, which is based on existing research which has yet to be practically implemented, involves getting the faulty output by injecting the fault in a binary search fashion. Our attack reveals many practical factors that were not considered in the previous theoretical fault injection attack analysis, e.g., the probability of a failed fault injection. We bring the practice to theory and developed new complexity analysis of the attack. Further, to mitigate the possible binary search attack on real-then-dummy CSIDH, dynamic random vector CSIDH was proposed previously to randomize the order of real and dummy isogeny operations. We explore fault injection attacks on dynamic random vector CSIDH and evaluate the security level of the mitigation. Our analysis and experimental results demonstrate that it is infeasible to attack dynamic random vector CSIDH in a reasonable amount of time when the success rate of fault injection is not consistent over time.

TI Cooper pair splitting controlled by a temperature gradient
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Electrons in two different normal metallic electrodes attached to a sufficiently thin superconducting island may become entangled due to the effect of Cooper pair splitting. This phenomenon is of fundamental importance and may also have serious implications for developing quantum communication technologies. One way to identify Cooper pair splitting is to analyze long-range cross correlations of fluctuating currents in three-terminal hybrid normal-superconducting-normal nanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate non-trivial behavior of cross-correlated non-local shot noise in the presence of a temperature gradient. We suggest that applying a temperature gradient may serve as an extra tool to control the phenomenon of Cooper pair splitting.

TI Universal quantum control over Majorana zero modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Majorana zero mode (MZM) exhibits inherent resilience to local parametric fluctuations, due to the topological protection mechanism in the non-Abelian braiding statistics of the anyonic quasiparticles. In this paper, we construct the braiding operations between an arbitrary pair in three MZMs under the theoretical framework of universal quantum control. Largely detuned driving fields on the mediator, a local defect of lattice, enable indirect and tunable exchange interaction between arbitrary two MZMs. The braiding operations can then emerge through the time evolution along the universal nonadiabatic passages, whose robustness against driving-field errors and quasiparticle poisoning can be substantially enhanced by the rapid modulation over the passagedependent global phase. Moreover, a chiral transfer for population on MZMs along the universal passage can be perfectly demonstrated in both clockwise and counterclockwise manners without eliminating the mediator defect. Our protocol is linear scalable and provides an avenue towards the universal quantum control over MZMs, which is fundamental and essential for topological quantum computation.

TI Edge Z3 parafermions in fermionic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Parafermion modes are non-Abelian anyons which were introduced as ZN generalizations of Z(2) Majorana states. In particular, Z(3) parafermions can be used to produce Fibonacci anyons, laying a path towards universal topological quantum computation. Due to their fractional nature, much of the theoretical work on Z(3) parafermions has relied on bosonization methods or parafermionic quasiparticles. In this paper, we introduce a representation of Z(3) parafermions in terms of purely fermionic models. We establish the equivalency of a family of lattice fermionic models written in the basis of the t - J model with a Kitaev-like chain supporting free Z3 parafermionic modes at its ends. By using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we are able to characterize the topological phase transition and study the effect of local operators (doping and magnetic fields) on the spatial localization of the parafermionic modes and their stability. Moreover, we discuss the necessary ingredients towards realizing Z(3) parafermions in strongly interacting electronic systems.

TI Combining multiplexed gate-based readout and isolated CMOS quantum dot
   arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor quantum dot arrays are a promising platform to perform spin-based error-corrected quantum computation with large numbers of qubits. However, due to the diverging number of possible charge configurations combined with the limited sensitivity of large-footprint charge sensors, achieving single-spin occupancy in each dot in a growing quantum dot array is exceedingly complex. Therefore, to scale-up a spin-based architecture we must change how individual charges are readout and controlled. Here, we demonstrate single-spin occupancy of each dot in a foundry-fabricated array by combining two methods. 1/ Loading a finite number of electrons into the quantum dot array; simplifying electrostatic tuning by isolating the array from the reservoirs. 2/ Deploying multiplex gate-based reflectometry to dispersively probe charge tunneling and spin states without charge sensors or reservoirs. Our isolated arrays probed by embedded multiplex readout can be readily electrostatically tuned. They are thus a viable, scalable approach for spin-based quantum architectures.

TI Chiral Lasing Emission from a Simple Two-Unit Supercell Metasurface
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) sources are critical for applications in communication, chiral sensing, displays, and quantum computation. However, achieving narrow-linewidth chiral lasing emission with high directionality and a significant degree of circular polarization (DCP) remains a significant challenge. Chiral metasurfaces leveraging optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer a promising solution by enhancing chirality and coherence. Nevertheless, the complexity of metasurface design and stringent fabrication requirements limit their practical application. This study presents a narrow-linewidth chiral lasing with two opposite chiral states in off-normal directions using a simple two-unit supercell chiral metasurface. By integrating two unit cells with differently oriented notches, the in-plane structural symmetry is broken, inducing spin splitting of the Gamma 0-BIC into Gamma +/- 1-modes. A high DCP of 0.95 is achieved at an emission angle of 36.0 degrees. This simplified design offers an efficient and practical approach to realizing chiral lasing emission systems.

TI Hyperfine structure of nP1/2 Rydberg states in 85Rb
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We measure the hyperfine structure of nP1/2 Rydberg states for n = 42, 43, 44, and 46 using mm-wave spectroscopy on an ensemble of laser-cooled 85Rb atoms. Systematic uncertainties in our measurement from the Zeeman splittings induced by stray magnetic fields and dipole-dipole interactions between two Rydberg atoms are factored in with the obtained statistical uncertainty. Our final measurement of the nP1/2 hyperfine coupling constant is AHFS = 1.443(31) GHz. This measurement is useful for studies of long-range Rydberg molecules, Rydberg electrometry, and quantum simulation with dipole-dipole interactions involving nP1/2 atoms.

TI Quantum field lens coding and classification algorithm to predict
   measurement outcomes
SO METHODSX
AB This study develops a method to implement a quantum field lens coding and classification algorithm for two quantum double-field (QDF) system models: 1-a QDF model, and 2-a QDF lens coding model by a DF computation (DFC). This method determines entanglement entropy (EE) by implementing QDF operators in a quantum circuit. The physical link between the two system models is a quantum field lens coding algorithm (QF-LCA), which is a QF lens distance-based, implemented on real N-qubit machines. This is with the possibility to train the algorithm for making strong predictions on phase transitions as the shared objective of both models. In both system models, QDF transformations are simulated by a DFC algorithm where QDF data are collected and analyzed to represent energy states and transitions, and determine entanglement based on EE. The method gives a list of steps to simulate and optimize any thermodynamic system on macro and micro-scale observations, as presented in this article:

TI Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a
   Magnetic Field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the ferromagnetic Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.

TI Properties and applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB There are several mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. The Schr & ouml;dinger picture expresses quantum states in terms of wavefunctions over, e.g. position or momentum. Alternatively, phase-space formulations represent states with quasi-probability distributions over, e.g. position and momentum. A quasi-probability distribution resembles a probability distribution but may have negative and non-real entries. The most famous quasi-probability distribution, the Wigner function, has played a pivotal role in the development of a continuous-variable quantum theory that has clear analogues of position and momentum. However, the Wigner function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity, coherence and observables' incompatibility.

TI Laser powered dissipative quantum batteries in atom-cavity QED
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The interaction of a three-level atom with the electromagnetic field of a quantum cavity in the presence of a laser field presents a rich behavior in the dispersive regime that we exploit to discuss two quantum batteries. In the first setup, we consider a single three-level atom interacting sequentially with many cavities, each in a thermal state. We show that under this process, the atom converges towards an equilibrium state that displays population inversion. In the second setup, a stream of atoms in a thermal state interacts sequentially with a single cavity initially in a thermal state at the same temperature as the atoms. We show that the cavity's energy increases continuously as the stream of atoms continues to cross, and the cavity does not reach an equilibrium state. After many atoms have traveled, the cavity's state becomes active, storing extractable energy that increases in proportion to the work done by the laser. However, the same dynamics may involve only two cavity levels in an interesting limit called the highly selective regime. In that regime, the cavity reaches an equilibrium state similar to the one of the atom in the first scenario. The charging process we propose is robust. We discuss its thermodynamics and evaluate the energy supplied by the laser, the energy stored in the battery, and, thus, the device's efficiency. We also analyze the role of damping.

TI Spinon excitations and spin correlations in the one-dimensional quantum
   magnet β-VOSO4 probed by Raman spectroscopy
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional S = 1/2 system beta-VOSO4 without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in beta-VOSO4. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.

TI Ultrathin Boron Growth onto Nanodiamond Surfaces via Electrophilic Boron
   Precursors
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Diamond as a templating substrate is largely unexplored, and the unique properties of diamond, including its large bandgap, thermal conductance, and lack of cytotoxicity, makes it versatile in emergent technologies in medicine and quantum sensing. Surface termination of an inert diamond substrate and its chemical reactivity are key in generating new bonds for nucleation and growth of an overlayer material. Oxidized high-pressure high temperature (HPHT) nanodiamonds (NDs) are largely terminated by alcohols that act as nucleophiles to initiate covalent bond formation when an electrophilic reactant is available. In this work, we demonstrate a templated synthesis of ultrathin boron on ND surfaces using trigonal boron compounds. Boron trichloride (BCl3), boron tribromide (BBr3), and borane (BH3) were found to react with ND substrates at room temperature in inert conditions. BBr3 and BCl3 were highly reactive with the diamond surface, and sheet-like structures were produced and verified with electron microscopy. Surface-sensitive spectroscopies were used to probe the molecular and atomic structure of the ND constructs' surface, and quantification showed the boron shell was less than 1 nm thick after 1-24 h reactions. Observation of the reaction supports a self-terminating mechanism, similar to atomic layer deposition growth, and is likely due to the quenching of alcohols on the diamond surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that boron-termination generated midgap electronic states that were originally predicted by density functional theory (DFT) several years ago. DFT also predicted a negative electron surface, which has yet to be confirmed experimentally here. The boron-diamond nanostructures were found to aggregate in dichloromethane and were dispersed in various solvents and characterized with dynamic light scattering for future cell imaging or cancer therapy applications using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The unique templating mechanism based on nucleophilic alcohols and electrophilic trigonal precursors allows for covalent bond formation and will be of interest to researchers using diamond for quantum sensing, additive manufacturing, BNCT, and potentially as an electron emitter.

Here we report direct imaging of magneticdomains of polycrystalline Mn3Sn films, a prototypicalnoncollinear antiferromagnet, using nitrogen-vacancy-based single-spinscanning microscopy. Nanoscale evolution of local stray field patternsof Mn3Sn samples are systematically investigated in responseto external driving forces, revealing the characteristic "heterogeneous"magnetic switching behaviors in polycrystalline textured Mn3Sn films. Our results contribute to a comprehensive understandingof inhomogeneous magnetic orders of noncollinear antiferromagnets,highlighting the potential of nitrogen-vacancy centers to study microscopicspin properties of a broad range of emergent condensed matter systems.

Combining the OT protocol with prior works, we obtain secure two-party and multi-party computation protocols also in MiniQCrypt. This is in contrast to the classical world, where it is widely believed that one-way functions alone do not give us OT.
   In the common random string model, we achieve a constant-round universally composable (UC) OT protocol.

AB Avalanche-photodiode-based near-infrared single-photon detectors have seen rapid development in the last two decades because of their enormous internal gain, high sensitivity, fast response, small volume, and ease of integration. The InGaAs/InP near-infrared singlephoton detector is the most widely used avalanche diode at present. Its device performance is still being continuously improved through the optimization of device structure and external quenching circuits. This paper analyzes the latest development and application of these InGaAs/InP photodiodes, then briefly re views other near-infrared single-photon detection technologies based on new materials and new mechanisms.

TI p Reservoir Computing Approach to Quantum State Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Efficient quantum state measurement is important for maximizing the extracted information from a quantum system. For multiqubit quantum processors, in particular, the development of a scalable architecture for rapid and high-fidelity readout remains a critical unresolved problem. Here we propose reservoir computing as a resource-efficient solution to quantum measurement of superconducting multiqubit systems. We consider a small network of Josephson parametric oscillators, which can be implemented with minimal device overhead and in the same platform as the measured quantum system. We theoretically analyze the operation of such a device as a reservoir computer to classify stochastic timedependent signals subject to quantum statistical features. We apply this reservoir computer to the task of multinomial classification of measurement trajectories from joint multiqubit readout. For a 2-qubit dispersive measurement under realistic conditions we demonstrate a classification fidelity reliably exceeding that of an optimal linear filter using only 2-5 reservoir nodes, while simultaneously requiring far less calibration data-as little as a few shots per state. We understand this remarkable performance through an analysis of the network dynamics and develop an intuitive picture of reservoir processing generally. Finally, we demonstrate how to operate this device to perform 2-qubit state tomography and continuous parity monitoring with equal effectiveness and ease of calibration. This reservoir processor avoids computationally intensive training common to other machine learning frameworks and can be implemented as an integrated cryogenic superconducting device for low-latency processing of quantum signals on the computational edge.

TI An efficient post-quantum KEM from CSIDH
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB The SIDH and CSIDH are now the two most well-known post-quantum key exchange protocols from the supersingular isogeny-based cryptography, which have attracted much attention in recent years and served as the building blocks of other supersingular isogeny-based cryptographic schemes. The famous SIKE is a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) constructed on the SIDH, motivated by which, this article presents a new post-quantum KEM-based on the CSIDH, which is thereby named as CSIKE. The presented CSIKE has much higher computation efficiency in the decapsulation part by involving an additional tag in the encapsulation results. The new CSIKE is formally proved to be IND-CCA secure under the standard isogeny-based quantum resistant security assumption. Moreover, by comparing the new CSIKE with the only two existing CSIDH-based KEM schemes, i.e., CSIDH-PSEC-KEM and CSIDH-ECIES-KEM, it can be easily found that the new CSIKE has a slightly longer encapsulation size than CSIDH-PSEC-KEM and CSIDH-ECIES-KEM, but (i) it beats the CSIDH-PSEC-KEM by the improvement of approximately 50% in decapsulation speed, and (ii) it has a certain advantage over the CSIDH-ECIES-KEM in security since in the random oracle model, the security proof for CSIDH-ECIES-KEM needs to rely on the stronger CSI-GDH assumption, while the new CSIKE just needs to rely on the basic CSI-CDH assumption.

AB The bosonic channel is addressed with modulation interference and side information at the transmitter. The model can be viewed as the quantum counterpart of the classical random-parameter Gaussian channel. Based on Costa's writing-on-dirty-paper result, the effect of the interference can be canceled. For both homodyne and heterodyne detection, we observe the same phenomenon, as the model reduces to a classical Gaussian channel. Then, we consider the bosonic channel with joint detection, for which the classical results do not apply, and derive a dirty-paper coding lower bound. We demonstrate that the optimal coefficient for dirty paper coding is not necessarily the MMSE estimator coefficient as in the classical setting.

TI Arbitrary relaxation rate under non-Hermitian matrix iterations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the exponential relaxation of observables propagated with a non-Hermitian transfer matrix, an example being out-of-time-ordered correlations (OTOC) in brick-wall (BW) random quantum circuits. Until a time that scales as the system size, the exponential decay of observables is not usually determined by the second largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix, as one can naively expect, but it is, in general, slower-this slower decay rate was dubbed "phantom eigenvalue." Generally, this slower decay is given by the largest value in the pseudospectrum of the transfer matrix; however, we show that the decay rate can be an arbitrary value between the second largest eigenvalue and the largest value in the pseudospectrum. This arbitrary decay can be observed, for example, in the propagation of OTOC in periodic boundary conditions BW circuits. To explore this phenomenon, we study a matrix iteration made from a simple tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. This setting can be used to propagate OTOC in random circuits with open boundary conditions and to describe a one-dimensional biased random walk with dissipation at the edges.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We present an efficient scheme for the complete analysis of hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state in polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom with two steps. Firstly, the polarization GHZ state is distinguished completely and nondestructively, resorting to the controlled phase flip (CPF) gate constructed by the cavity-assisted interaction. Subsequently, the time-bin GHZ state is analyzed by using the preserved polarization entanglement. With the help of CPF gate and self-assisted mechanism, our scheme can be directly generalized to the complete N-photon hyperentangled GHZ state analysis, and it may have potential applications in the hyperentanglement-based quantum communication.

TI A Fully Integrated, MEMS Based, Micro-Scale Printer for Cryogenic Thin
   Film Structures
SO JOURNAL OF MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS
AB Cryogenically produced thin film structures at the research scale facilitate many novels experiments. This paper discusses the construction of a fully integrated, MEMS based, printer, capable of printing micro and nano-scale features. In this millimeter-sized device, many features of a nanofab are incorporated to fabricate and characterize thin films in situ. The micro-scale printer comprises surface micromachined MEMS, digitally programmable source of atoms; a stencil lithograpghy tool that uses a MEMS nanopositioner for alignment; a sub-strate with on-chip leads for electrical characterization; a film thickness monitor; a substrate thermometer and heater. The device consists of three separate silicon die, flip-chip bonded to each other, forming a fully integrated, fabrication system of systems. This device creates micro and nano structures ranging from a few monolayers thick up to micron scale circuits. Applications range from searching for the Casimir Energy to the direct fabrication of quantum circuits, in situ, at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Rényi-Holevo inequality from α-z-Rényi relative entropies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We investigate bounds in the transmission of classical information through quantum systems. Our focus lies in the generalized Holevo theorem, which provides a single-letter Holevo-like inequality from arbitrary quantum distance measures. Through the introduction of the alpha-z-R & eacute;nyi relative entropies, which comprise known relevant quantities such as the R & eacute;nyi relative entropy and the sandwiched R & eacute;nyi relative entropy, we establish the Holevo-R & eacute;nyi inequality. This result leads to a quantum bound for the alpha-mutual information, suggesting new insights into communication channel performance and the fundamental limits for reliability functions in memoryless multi-letter communication channels.

TI Telecom-wavelength InAs QDs with low fine structure splitting grown by
   droplet epitaxy on GaAs(111)A vicinal substrates
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present self-assembly of InAs/InAlAs quantum dots by the droplet epitaxy technique on vicinal GaAs(111)A substrates. The small miscut angle, while maintaining the symmetries imposed on the quantum dot from the surface, allows a fast growth rate thanks to the presence of preferential nucleation sites at the step edges. A 100nm InAlAs metamorphic layer with In content
   >= 50% directly deposited on the GaAs substrate is already almost fully relaxed with a very flat surface. The quantum dots emit at the 1.3 mu m telecom O-band with fine structure splitting as low as 16 mu eV, thus making them suitable as photon sources in quantum communication networks using entangled photons.

TI Improvement of Three-Party Semi-Quantum Protocol for Deterministic
   Secure Quantum Dialogue Based on GHZ States
SO ENTROPY
AB Through the analysis of "Three-party semi-quantum protocol for deterministic secure quantum dialogue based on GHZ states", we demonstrate that the protocol is vulnerable to attacks from dishonest participants. Specifically, the fully quantum-capable participant may behave dishonestly, leading the two semi-quantum participants to receive incorrect secret information, with the dishonest behavior remaining undetected. Accordingly, we propose an improved protocol that demonstrates robustness against various internal and external attacks, including dishonest participant attacks, and we further prove that it does not suffer from information leakage. Moreover, compared to the original protocol, the improved version achieves a significant enhancement in quantum communication efficiency.

TI Ultra-Low Loss and Large Bandwidth Fiber-to-Chip Edge Coupler for
   Aluminum Oxide Photonic Platform at UV-Visible Wavelengths
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Achieving low-loss coupling between single-mode fibers and photonic integrated circuits plays a crucial role in emerging enabling technologies including quantum information, advanced imaging, and precision metrology. High coupling efficiency in the UV/visible spectrum remains challenging due to the small waveguide dimensions at shorter wavelengths. Here, we present an ultra-low loss edge coupler made of a SiOx/AlOx mode converter. The coupling loss between a standard single-mode fiber and an AlOx waveguide below 0.31 dB and 0.62 dB is experimentally demonstrated at a working wavelength of 375 nm and 405 nm, respectively. The design exhibits a large bandwidth of 110 nm below 2.6-dB loss over the entire operating wavelength range of the single mode fiber, as obtained from the simulation. This coupler not only facilitates low-loss fiber-to-chip coupling but also significantly reduces spurious light scattering, making it particularly valuable for applications in PIC-based far-field advanced microscopy and trapped-ion quantum information systems.

TI Demonstrating Efficient and Robust Bosonic State Reconstruction via
   Optimized Excitation Counting
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of nontrivial quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging. This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in continuousvariable (CV) systems, where a large number of grid-based measurements are often used to adequately sample relevant regions of phase space. In this work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique of optimized reconstruction with excitation-number sampling (ORENS) based on the idea of the generalized Q function. We use a standard bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally demonstrate effective state reconstruction using the theoretically minimum number of measurements. Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware, enabling it to outperform the conventional reconstruction techniques in cQED such as Wigner tomography. Finally, ORENS relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of a given CV state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing using bosonic modes.

TI All-silicon quantum light source by embedding an atomic emissive center

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon is the most scalable optoelectronic material but has suffered from its inability to generate directly and efficiently classical or quantum light on-chip. Scaling and integration are the most fundamental challenges facing quantum science and technology. We report an all-silicon quantum light source based on a single atomic emissive center embedded in a silicon-based nanophotonic cavity. We observe a more than 30-fold enhancement of luminescence, a near-unity atom-cavity coupling efficiency, and an 8-fold acceleration of the emission from the all-silicon quantum emissive center. Our work opens immediate avenues for large-scale integrated cavity quantum electrodynamics and quantum light-matter interfaces with applications in quantum communication and networking, sensing, imaging, and computing.

TI Large-inductance superconducting microstrip photon detector enabling 10
   photon-number resolution
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Efficient and precise photon-number-resolving detectors are essential for optical quantum information science. Despite this, very few detectors have been able to distinguish photon numbers with both high fidelity and a large dynamic range, all while maintaining high speed and high timing precision. Superconducting nanostrip-based detectors excel at counting single photons efficiently and rapidly, but face challenges in balancing dynamic range and fidelity. Here, we have pioneered the demonstration of 10 true photon-number resolution using a superconducting microstrip detector, with readout fidelity reaching an impressive 98% and 90% for 4-photon and 6-photon events, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed dual-channel timing setup drastically reduces the amount of data acquisition by 3 orders of magnitude, allowing for real-time photon-number readout. We then demonstrate the utility of our scheme by implementing a quantum random-number generator based on sampling the parity of a coherent state, which guarantees inherent unbiasedness, robustness against experimental imperfections and environmental noise, as well as invulnerability to eavesdropping. Our solution boasts high fidelity, a large dynamic range, and real-time characterization for photon-number resolution and simplicity with respect to device structure, fabrication, and readout, which may provide a promising avenue towards optical quantum information science.

TI Information scrambling and chaos induced by a Hermitian matrix
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Given an arbitrary V x V Hermitian matrix H, considered as a finite discrete quantum Hamiltonian, we use methods from graph and ergodic theories to construct a quantum Poincare map at energy E and a corresponding stochastic classical Poincare-Markov map at the same energy on an appropriate discrete phase space. This phase space D consists of the directed edges of a graph with V vertices that are in one-to-one correspondence with the non-vanishing off-diagonal elements of H. The correspondence between quantum Poincare map and classical Poincare-Markov map is an alternative to the standard quantum-classical correspondence based on a classical limit (h) over bar -> 0. Most importantly it can be constructed where no such limit exists. Using standard methods from ergodic theory we then proceed to derive an expression for the Lyapunov exponent Lambda(E) of the classical map. It measures the rate of loss of classical information in the dynamics and relates it to the separation of stochastic classical trajectories in the phase space. We suggest that loss of information in the underlying classical dynamics is an indicator for quantum information scrambling.

TI Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters is explored. This analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters can significantly enhance both maximum stored energy E-max  and peak charging power P-max  in the quench charging protocol. Furthermore, the peaks of extractable work and stored energy coincide. This is because the system's evolution under a weak perturbation remains close to the ground state, resulting in a passive state energy nearly identical to the ground state energy. The optimal charging time tau(*) exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter x(h0), while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter x(ht). This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling x(ht) > x(h0), demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.

TI Comparative Analysis of Robust Entanglement Generation in Engineered XX
   Spin Chains
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols in finite XX spin chains with varying spin magnitudes (s=1/2,1,3/2). Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. At the same time, Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. To further assess the resilience of both protocols in experimentally relevant settings, we employ the pseudomode formalism to characterize the impact of non-Markovian noise on the entanglement dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the dual-port mechanism (P2) remains effective even when memory effects are present, as it reduces the excitation of bulk modes that would otherwise enhance environment-induced backflow. Together, the scalability, efficiency, and noise resilience of the dual-port approach position it as a promising framework for entanglement distribution in solid-state quantum information platforms.

TI Energy-flow-reversing dynamics in vortex beams : OAM-independent
   propagation and enhanced resilience
SO OPTICA
AB Since their discovery in the 1990s, vortex beams, known for their ability to carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), have found substantial applications in optical manipulation and high-dimensional classical and quantum information communication. However, their inherent diffraction in free space, resulting in OAM-dependent beam expansion, has constrained their utility in spatial mode multiplexing communication, fiber optic transmission, and particle manipulation. These domains necessitate vortex beams with OAM-independent propagation characteristics. Addressing this, we report an approach that employs the energy redistribution mechanism to reverse the radial energy flows of traditional vortex beams, thereby presenting iso-propagation vortex beams (IPVBs) with OAM-independent propagation dynamics. These IPVBs, attributed to their reversed radial energy flows, maintain resilience in diverse environments, from free space to challenging media, including sustaining their form post-damage, retaining consistent intensity in lossy media, and experiencing reduced modal scattering in atmospheric turbulence. Their unique features position IPVBs as promising candidates for applications in imaging, microscopy, optical communication, metrology, quantum information processing, and light-matter interactions. Case studies within optical communication reveal that the IPVB basis potentially unlocks a broader spectrum of data channels, enhancing information capacity over traditional spatial multiplexing techniques.

TI Photonic circuits for laser stabilization with integrated ultra-high Q
   and Brillouin laser resonators
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The integration of stabilized lasers, sources that generate spectrally pure light, will provide compact, low-cost solutions for applications including quantum information sciences, precision navigation and timing, metrology, and high-capacity fiber communications. We report a significant advancement in this field, demonstrating stabilization of an integrated waveguide Brillouin laser to an integrated waveguide reference cavity, where both resonators are fabricated using the same CMOS-compatible integration platform. We demonstrate reduction of the free running Brillouin laser linewidth to a 292 Hz integral linewidth and carrier stabilization to a 4.9 x 10(-13) fractional frequency at 8 ms reaching the cavity-intrinsic thermorefractive noise limit for frequencies down to 80 Hz. We achieve this level of performance using a pair of 56.4 x 10(6) quality factor Si3N4 waveguide ring-resonators that reduce the high-frequency noise by the nonlinear Brillouin process and the low-frequency noise by Pound-Drever-Hall locking to the ultra-low loss resonator. These results represent an important step toward integrated stabilized lasers with reduced sensitivity to environmental disturbances for atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO), quantum information processing and sensing, and other precision scientific, sensing, and communications applications.

TI Iso-propagation vortices with OAM-independent size and divergence toward
   future faster optical communications
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Recognized in the 1990s, vortex beams' ability to carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) has significantly contributed to applications in optical manipulation and high-dimensional classical and quantum information communication. However, inherent diffraction in free space results in the inevitable expansion of beam size and divergence contingent upon the OAM, limiting vortex beams' applicability in areas such as spatial mode multiplexing communication, fiber-optic data transmission, and particle manipulation. These domains necessitate vortex beams with OAM-independent propagation characteristics. We introduce iso-propagation vortices (IPVs), vortex beams characterized by OAM-independent propagation behavior, achieved through precise radial index configuration of Laguerre-Gaussian beams. IPVs display notable transmission dynamics, including a reduced quality factor, resilience post-damage, and decreased and uniform modal scattering under atmospheric turbulence. Their distinctive attributes render IPVs valuable for potential applications in imaging, microscopy, optical communication, metrology, quantum information processing, and light-matter interactions. Notably, within optical communication, the case study suggests that the IPV basis, due to its OAM-independent propagation behavior, provides access to a more extensive spectrum of data channels compared with conventional spatial multiplexing techniques, consequently augmenting information capacity.

TI Strain effects in phosphorus bound exciton transitions in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Donor spin states in silicon are a promising candidate for quantum information processing. One possible donor spin readout mechanism is the bound exciton transition that can be excited optically and creates an electrical signal when it decays. This transition has been extensively studied in the bulk, but in order to scale towards localized spin readout, microfabricated structures are needed for detection. As these electrodes will inevitably cause strain in the silicon lattice, it will be crucial to understand how strain affects the exciton transitions. Here we study the phosphorus donor bound exciton transitions in silicon using hybrid electro-optical readout with microfabricated electrodes. We observe a significant zero-field splitting as well as mixing of the hole states due to strain. We can model these effects assuming the known asymmetry of the hole g factors and the Pikus-Bir Hamiltonian describing the strain. In addition, we describe the temperature, laser power, and light polarization dependence of the transitions. Importantly, the hole mixing should not prevent donor electron spin readout, and using our measured parameters and numerical simulations, we anticipate that hybrid spin readout on a silicon-on-insulator platform should be possible, allowing integration into silicon photonics platforms.

TI Superconducting-like Heat Current: Effective Cancellation of
   Current-Dissipation Trade-Off by Quantum Coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum coherence is a useful resource for increasing the speed and decreasing the irreversibility of quantum dynamics. Because of this feature, coherence is used to enhance the performance of various quantum information processing devices beyond the limitations set by classical mechanics. However, when we consider thermodynamic processes, such as energy conversion in nanoscale devices, it is still unclear whether coherence provides similar advantages. Here we establish a universal framework, clarifying how coherence affects the speed and irreversibility in thermodynamic processes described by the Lindblad master equation, and give general rules for when coherence enhances or reduces the performance of thermodynamic devices. Our results show that a proper use of coherence enhances the heat current without increasing dissipation; i.e., coherence can reduce friction. In particular, if the amount of coherence is large enough, this friction becomes virtually zero, realizing a superconducting-like "dissipation-less" heat current. Since our framework clarifies a general relation among coherence, energy flow, and dissipation, it can be applied to many branches of science from quantum information theory to biology. As an application to energy science, we construct a quantum heat engine cycle that exceeds the power-efficiency trade-off bound on classical engines and effectively attains the Carnot efficiency with finite power in fast cycles.

TI Ultra-low-noise phase gate and squeezed state rotation in a
   gain-and-loss-balanced coherently prepared atomic medium
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The realization of ultra-low-noise quantum phase gates and squeezed state rotations has long been a goal in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information. In this study, we present a theoretical proposal for an ultra-low-noise quantum phase gate and squeezed state rotation using a coherently prepared atomic medium. We demonstrate that, under a suitable set of parameters, the loss and gain mechanisms within this coherently prepared atomic system can balance each other over a broad range of probe field frequencies. As a result, the noise associated with the Raman gain process can be significantly suppressed within this frequency range. Additionally, we show that the system exhibits a strong optical Kerr nonlinearity, which can facilitate a it-phase gate operation for the probe field at the quantum level with high fidelity. Furthermore, when a squeezed probe field is injected, the squeezed state of the input nonclassical field can undergo a 90 degrees rotation. These findings provide valuable insights into the unique properties of gain-and-loss-balanced coherently prepared atomic media, paving the way for new applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

TI In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.

TI High-Efficiency On-Chip Quantum Photon Source in Modal Phase-Matched
   Lithium Niobate Nanowaveguide
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) emerges as a promising platform for integrated quantum photon source, enabling scalable on-chip quantum information processing. The most popular technique to overcome the phase mismatching between interacting waves in waveguide is periodic poling, which is intrinsically sensitive to poling uniformity. Here, an alternative strategy to offset the phase mismatching of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process, so-called modal phase matching, in a straight waveguide fabricated on a dual-layer LNOI is reported. The dual-layer LNOI consists of two 300 nm lithium niobates with opposite directions, which significantly enhances the spatial overlap between fundamental and high-order modes and thus enables efficient SPDC. This dual-layer waveguide generates photon pairs with pair generation rate of 41.77 GHz mW(-1), which exhibits excellent signal-to-noise performance with coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 58298 +/- 1297. Moreover, a heralded single-photon source with second-order autocorrelation g(H)((2))(0) and heralded rate exceeding 100 kHz is observed. The results provide an experiment-friendly approach for efficient generation of quantum photon sources and benefit the on-chip quantum information processing based on LNOI.

TI Open Systems, Quantum Probability, and Logic for Quantum-like Modeling
   in Biology, Cognition, and Decision-Making
SO ENTROPY
AB The aim of this review is to highlight the possibility of applying the mathematical formalism and methodology of quantum theory to model behavior of complex biosystems, from genomes and proteins to animals, humans, and ecological and social systems. Such models are known as quantum-like, and they should be distinguished from genuine quantum physical modeling of biological phenomena. One of the distinguishing features of quantum-like models is their applicability to macroscopic biosystems or, to be more precise, to information processing in them. Quantum-like modeling has its basis in quantum information theory, and it can be considered one of the fruits of the quantum information revolution. Since any isolated biosystem is dead, modeling of biological as well as mental processes should be based on the theory of open systems in its most general form-the theory of open quantum systems. In this review, we explain its applications to biology and cognition, especially theory of quantum instruments and the quantum master equation. We mention the possible interpretations of the basic entities of quantum-like models with special interest given to QBism, as it may be the most useful interpretation.

TI Optomechanically Induced Transparency and Slow-Fast Light Effect in
   Hybrid Cavity Optomechanical Systems
SO CRYSTALS
AB We theoretically investigate the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) phenomenon and the fast and slow light effects of a four-mode optomechanical system with the Kerr medium. The optomechanical system is composed of an array of three single-mode cavities and a mechanical oscillator. The three cavities are a passive cavity, a no-loss-gain cavity and a gain optical cavity, respectively. A Kerr medium is inserted in the passive cavity. We study the influence of the Kerr medium on the stability of the optomechanical system, and find that the stable regime of the optomechanical system can be adjusted by changing the Kerr coefficient. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of optomechanically induced transparency will appear when the Kerr medium exists in the optomechanical system and find that the frequency position of the absorption peak on the left increases linearly with the Kerr coefficient. In addition, we also investigate the fast and slow light effects in this system. The results show that we can control the fast and slow light by adjusting the Kerr coefficient, tunneling strength, and driving field strength. This study has potential application prospects in the fields of quantum optical devices and quantum information processing.

TI Generation of entangled photons with a second-order nonlinear photonic
   crystal and a beam splitter
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We discuss the generation of entangled photons using a nonlinear photonic crystal and beam splitter. In our method, the photonic crystal is assumed to be composed of a material with a large second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility chi((2)). Our proposal relies on two facts: (1) A nonlinear photonic crystal changes coherent incident light into squeezed light. (2) A beam splitter transforms the squeezed light into entangled light beams flying in two different directions. We estimate the yield efficiency of pairs of entangled photons per pulse of the very weak coherent light for our method at 0.0783 for a specific concrete example. Our method is more effective because the conversion efficiency (entangled biphotons per incident pump photons) in the spontaneous parametric downconversion is of the order of 4 x 10(-6). The only drawback is that it requires very fine tuning of the frequency of signal photons fed into the photonic crystal; for example, an adjustment is given by Delta v = 3.11 x 10(8) Hz for the signal light of v = 3.23 x 10(14) Hz. We investigate the application of entangled photons produced by our method to the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol, and we explore how to detect an eavesdropper. We suggest that our method is promising for decoy-state quantum key distribution using weak coherent light.

TI Acceptor-Induced Bulk Dielectric Loss in Superconducting Circuits on
   Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The performance of superconducting quantum circuits is primarily limited by dielectric loss due to interactions with two-level systems (TLSs). State-of-the-art circuits with engineered material interfaces are approaching a limit where dielectric loss from bulk substrates plays an important role. However, a microscopic understanding of dielectric loss in crystalline substrates is still lacking. In this work, we show that boron acceptors in silicon constitute a TLS bath that leads to an energy dissipation channel for superconducting circuits. We discuss how the electronic structure of boron acceptors leads to an effective TLS response in silicon. We sweep the boron concentration in silicon and demonstrate the bulk dielectric loss limit from boron acceptors. We show that boron-induced dielectric loss can be reduced in a magnetic field due to the spin-orbit structure of boron. This work provides the first detailed microscopic description of a TLS bath for superconducting circuits and demonstrates the need for ultrahigh-purity substrates for next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

TI Symmetry-protected sign problem and magic in quantum phases of matter
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce the concepts of a symmetry-protected sign problem and symmetry-protected magic to study the complexity of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter. In particular, we say a state has a symmetry-protected sign problem or symmetry-protected magic, if finite-depth quantum circuits composed of symmetric gates are unable to transform the state into a non-negative real wave function or stabilizer state, respectively. We prove that states belonging to certain SPT phases have these properties, as a result of their anomalous symmetry action at a boundary. For example, we find that one-dimensional Z(2) x Z(2) SPT states (e.g. cluster state) have a symmetry-protected sign problem, and two-dimensional Z(2) SPT states (e.g. Levin-Gu state) have symmetry-protected magic. Furthermore, we comment on the relation between a symmetry-protected sign problem and the computational wire property of one-dimensional SPT states. In an appendix, we also introduce explicit decorated domain wall models of SPT phases, which may be of independent interest.

AB As continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems move toward integration with dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) networks, distinguishing between external faults and malicious attacks becomes crucial for maintaining secure and high-availability key generation. While most existing studies focus on either attack mitigation or fault resilience independently, little attention has been paid to their joint classification. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to differentiate between system faults and quantum-level attacks in CV-QKD systems operating under DWDM coexistence. We emulate two practical filter-related faults shifted filter frequency (SFF) and narrow filter bandwidth (NFB) and a power-splitting channel tampering attack. Using Bob's quadrature data (pB, qB) collected from a CV-QKD simulation test setup, we evaluate five classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). We assess performance across various input sample sizes, measuring both classification accuracy and average prediction time. Our results show that while GNB offers the fastest predictions, it suffers from low accuracy. In contrast, DNN achieves near-perfect classification accuracy but at higher computational cost. RF presents a favorable trade-off, offering high accuracy with low latency. This work enables intelligent diagnosis of faults and attacks in telecom-integrated QKD systems, improving the uptime without compromising security.

TI Atomically precise control of rotational dynamics in charged rare-earth
   complexes on a metal surface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Rare-earth elements are vital to advanced technological applications ranging from spintronic devices to quantum information science. Here, the authors formed charged rare-earth complexes on a material surface and demonstrated atomically precise control on their rotational dynamics.
   Complexes containing rare-earth ions attract great attention for their technological applications ranging from spintronic devices to quantum information science. While charged rare-earth coordination complexes are ubiquitous in solution, they are challenging to form on materials surfaces that would allow investigations for potential solid-state applications. Here we report formation and atomically precise manipulation of rare-earth complexes on a gold surface. Although they are composed of multiple units held together by electrostatic interactions, the entire complex rotates as a single unit when electrical energy is supplied from a scanning tunneling microscope tip. Despite the hexagonal symmetry of the gold surface, a counterion at the side of the complex guides precise three-fold rotations and 100% control of their rotational directions is achieved using a negative electric field from the scanning probe tip. This work demonstrates that counterions can be used to control dynamics of rare-earth complexes on materials surfaces for quantum and nanomechanical applications.

TI Symmetric carbon tetramers forming spin qubits in hexagonal boron
   nitride
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Point defect quantum bits in semiconductors have the potential to revolutionize sensing at atomic scales. Currently, vacancy-related defects are at the forefront of high spatial resolution and low-dimensional sensing. On the other hand, it is expected that impurity-related defect structures may give rise to new features that could further advance quantum sensing in low dimensions. Here, we study the symmetric carbon tetramer clusters in hexagonal boron nitride and propose them as spin qubits for sensing. We utilize periodic-DFT and quantum chemistry approaches to reliably and accurately predict the electronic, optical, and spin properties of the studied defect. We show that the nitrogen-centered symmetric carbon tetramer gives rise to spin state-dependent optical signals with strain-sensitive intersystem crossing rates. Furthermore, the weak hyperfine coupling of the defect to their spin environments results in a reduced electron spin resonance linewidth that can enhance sensitivity.

TI Hypergraph Simplification: Linking the Path-sum Approach to the
   ZH-calculus
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
CY SEP 08-10, 2021
CL Hagenberg, AUSTRIA
AB The ZH-calculus is a complete graphical calculus for linear maps between qubits that admits a straightforward encoding of hypergraph states and circuits arising from the Toffoli+Hadamard gate set. In this paper, we establish a correspondence between the ZH-calculus and the path-sum formalism, a technique recently introduced by Amy to verify quantum circuits. In particular, we find a bijection between certain canonical forms of ZH-diagrams and path-sum expressions. We then introduce and prove several new simplification rules for the ZH-calculus, which are in direct correspondence to the simplification rules of the path-sum formalism. The relatively opaque path-sum rules are shown to arise naturally from two powerful families of rewrite rules in the ZH-calculus. The first is the extension of the familiar graph-theoretic simplifications based on local complementation and pivoting to their hypergraph-theoretic analogues: hyper-local complementation and hyper-pivoting. The second is the graphical Fourier transform introduced by Kuijpers et al., which enables effective simplification of ZH-diagrams encoding multi-linear phase polynomials with arbitrary real coefficients.

TI Superpositions of thermalisations in relativistic quantum field theory
SO QUANTUM
AB Recent results in relativistic quantum information and quantum thermodynamics have independently shown that in the quantum regime, a system may fail to thermalise when subject to quantum-controlled application of the same, single thermalisation channel. For example, an accelerating system with fixed proper acceleration is known to thermalise to an acceleration-dependent temperature, known as the Unruh temperature. However, the same system in a superposition of spatially translated trajectories that share the same proper acceleration fails to thermalise. Here, we provide an explanation of these results using the framework of quantum field theory in relativistic noninertial reference frames. We show how a probe that accelerates in a superposition of spatial translations interacts with incommensurate sets of field modes. In special cases where the modes are orthogonal (for example, when the Rindler wedges are translated in a direction orthogonal to the plane of motion), thermalisation does indeed result, corroborating the here provided explanation. We then discuss how this description relates to an information-theoretic approach aimed at studying quantum aspects of temperature through quantum-controlled thermalisations. The present work draws a connection between research in quantum information, relativistic physics, and quantum thermodynamics, in particular showing that relativistic quantum effects can provide a natural realisation of quantum thermodynamical scenarios.

TI Enhancing the the electrical readout of the spin-dependent recombination
   current in SiC JFETs for EDMR based magnetometry using a tandem
   (de-)modulation technique
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) is a promising method to readout spins in miniaturized devices utilized as quantum magnetometers. However, the sensitivity has remained challenging. In this study, we present a tandem (de-)modulation technique based on a combination of magnetic field and radio frequency modulation. By enabling higher demodulation frequencies to avoid 1/f-noise, enhancing self-calibration capabilities, and eliminating background signals by 3 orders of magnitude, this technique represents a significant advancement in the field of EDMR-based sensors. This novel approach paves the way for EDMR being the ideal candidate for ultra-sensitive magnetometry at ambient conditions without any optical components, which brings it one step closer to a chip-based quantum sensor for future applications.

TI Engineering the spectra of photon triplets generated from
   micro/nanofiber
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum light sources are the core resources for photonics-based quantum information processing. We investigate the spectral engineering of photon triplets generated by third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion in micro/nanofiber. The phase mismatching at one-third pump frequency gives rise to non-degenerate photon triplets, the joint spectral intensity of which has an elliptical locus with a fixed eccentricity of 6/3 . Therefore, we propose a frequency-division scheme to separate non-degenerate photon triplets into three channels with high heralding efficiency for the first time. Choosing an appropriate pump wavelength can compensate for the fabrication errors of micro/nanofiber and also generate narrowband, non-degenerate photon triplet sources with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the long-period micro/nanofiber grating introduces a new controllable degree of freedom to tailor phase matching, resulting from the periodic oscillation of dispersion. In this scheme, the wavelength of photon triplets can be flexibly tuned using quasi-phase matching. We study the generation of photon triplets from this novel perspective of spectrum engineering, and we believe that this work will accelerate the practical implementation of photon triplets in quantum information processing.

TI Remote Preparation of Optical Cat States Based on Gaussian Entanglement
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Remote state preparation enables one to prepare and manipulate quantum state non-locally. As an essential quantum resource, optical cat state is usually prepared locally by subtracting photons from a squeezed vacuum state. For remote quantum information processing, it is essential to prepare and manipulate optical cat states remotely based on Gaussian entanglement, which remains a challenge. Here, experimental preparation of optical cat states based on a remotely distributed two-mode Gaussian entangled state in a lossy channel is presented. By performing photon subtraction and homodyne projective measurement at Alice's station, an optical cat state is prepared remotely at Bob's station. Furthermore, the prepared cat state is rotated by changing Alice's measurement basis of homodyne detection, which demonstrates the remote manipulation of it. By distributing two modes of the two-mode Gaussian entangled state in lossy channels, it is demonstrated that the remotely prepared cat state can tolerate much more loss in Alice's channel than that in Bob's channel. It is also shown that cat states with amplitudes larger than 2 can be prepared by increasing the squeezing level and subtracting photon numbers. The results make a crucial step toward remote hybrid quantum information processing involving discrete- and continuous-variable techniques.

TI Network Digital Twin for 6G and Beyond: An End-to-End View Across
   Multi-Domain Network Ecosystems
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB With the rapid development of technology, the number of smart mobile users is increasing, accompanied by growing demands from applications such as virtual/augmented reality (VR/XR), remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, and real-time holographic communications, all of which require high transmission rates and ultra-low latency in 6G and beyond networks (6G+). This poses enormous challenges for the efficient deployment of large-scale networks, including network design, planning, troubleshooting, optimization, and maintenance, without affecting the user experience. Network Digital Twin (NDT) has emerged as a potential solution, enabling the creation of a virtual model that reflects the actual network and supports the simulation of various network designs, the application of diverse operating policies, and the reproduction complex fault scenarios under real-world conditions. This motivates us to conduct this study, where we provide a comprehensive survey of NDT in the context of 6G+, covering areas such as radio access networks (RAN), transport networks, 5G core networks and beyond (5GCORE+), cloud/edge computing, applications (blockchain, health system, manufacturing, security, and vehicular networks), non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), and quantum networks, from both academic and industrial perspectives. In particular, we are the first to provide an in-depth guide and usage of RAN and 5GCORE+ for NDT. Then, we provide an extensive review of foundation technologies such as transport networks, cloud/edge computing, applications, NTNs, and quantum networks in NDT. Finally, we discuss the key challenges, open issues, and future research directions for NDT in the context of 6G+.

TI Real-Time Operator Evolution in Two and Three Dimensions via Sparse
   Pauli Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study real-time operator evolution using sparse Pauli dynamics, a recently developed method for simulating expectation values of quantum circuits. On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in one-dimensional (1D) spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model that is highly challenging for tensor network methods. For the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.

TI Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous
   symmetries
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a Z2 symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.

TI Radial oscillations of an electron in a Coulomb attracting field
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB The radial motion of an electron in a Coulomb attracting field based on a new theory of the interaction of a particle with an electromagnetic field is studied. It is shown that the electron can perform radial oscillations due to a repulsive force that exists in the vicinity of the center and prevents the electron from approaching the center. This concept of a previously unknown repulsive force significantly shifts the paradigm of the interaction of a charge with an electromagnetic field. A laboratory experiment is proposed to test the new phenomenon.

TI Bounding the resources for thermalizing many-body localized systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding under which conditions physical systems thermalize is a long-standing question in many-body physics. While generic quantum systems thermalize, there are known instances where thermalization is hindered, for example in many-body localized (MBL) systems. Here we introduce a class of stochastic collision models coupling a many-body system out of thermal equilibrium to an external heat bath. We derive upper and lower bounds on the size of the bath required to thermalize the system via such models, under certain assumptions on the Hamiltonian. We use these bounds, expressed in terms of the max-relative entropy, to characterize the robustness of MBL systems against externally-induced thermalization. Our bounds are derived within the framework of resource theories using the convex split lemma, a recent tool developed in quantum information. We apply our results to the disordered Heisenberg chain, and numerically study the robustness of its MBL phase in terms of the required bath size. The thermalization of many-body localization phases poses a number of open questions related to our understanding of thermalization in quantum systems. Here, the authors aim to demonstrate that a quantum information approach can be used to investigate the mechanisms of thermalization in a quantum many-body system when coupled to an external system.

TI Optimizing Circuit Reusing and its Application in Randomized
   Benchmarking
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing times that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing times R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a nonlinear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this nonlinearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.

TI Variational quantum enhanced deep transfer learning for small underwater
   aqua species image classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Precise underwater classification of small aquaculture species is essential for sustainable fisheries management, biodiversity monitoring, and automated marine ecosystem analysis. But it is still a challenging task owing to underwater image distortions from poor visibility, lighting changes, occlusions, and the high computational complexity of traditional deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose a Lightweight Variational Quantum Enhanced Deep Transfer Learning framework. This hybrid deep transfer learning model integrates pretrained classical convolutional neural networks with variational quantum circuits to improve feature representation and classification efficiency. The framework is designed to reduce computational complexity while enhancing accuracy by leveraging quantum feature extraction techniques. Experimental evaluations on curated small aquafarming species dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy (up to 99.25%) with significantly fewer parameters and floating-point operations, indicating its potential for resource-constrained applications. Ablation studies further validate the impact of quantum layers on model performance. These results suggest that quantum deep transfer learning models can offer a promising direction for robust and efficient underwater species classification.

TI Cheaper and more noise-resilient quantum state preparation using
   eigenvector continuation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Subspace methods are powerful, noise-resilient methods that can effectively prepare ground states on quantum computers. The challenge is to get a subspace with a small condition number that spans the states of interest using minimal quantum resources. In this work, we will use eigenvector continuation to build a subspace from the low-lying states of a set of Hamiltonians. The basis vectors are prepared using truncated versions of standard state preparation methods such as imaginary-time evolution (ITE), adiabatic state preparation (ASP), and variational quantum eigensolver. By using these truncated methods combined with eigenvector continuation, we can directly improve upon them, obtaining more accurate ground-state energies at a reduced cost. We use several spin systems to demonstrate convergence even when methods like ITE and ASP fail, such as ASP in the presence of level crossings and ITE with vanishing energy gaps. We also showcase the noise resilience of this approach beyond the gains already made by having shallower quantum circuits. Our findings suggest that eigenvector continuation can be used to improve existing state preparation methods in the near term.

TI Classical simulability of constant-depth linear-optical circuits with
   noise
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Noise is one of the main obstacles to realizing quantum devices that achieve a quantum computational advantage. A possible approach to minimize the noise effect is to employ shallow-depth quantum circuits since noise typically accumulates as circuit depth grows. In this work, we investigate the complexity of shallow-depth linear-optical circuits under the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability. By establishing a correspondence between a linear-optical circuit and a bipartite graph, we show that the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability are equivalent to removing the corresponding vertices. Using this correspondence and percolation theory, we prove that for constant-depth linear-optical circuits with single photons, there is a threshold of loss (noise) rate above which the linear-optical systems can be decomposed into smaller systems with high probability, which enables us to simulate the systems efficiently. Consequently, our result implies that even in shallow-depth circuits where noise is not accumulated enough, its effect may be sufficiently significant to make them efficiently simulable using classical algorithms due to its entanglement structure constituted by shallow-depth circuits.

TI Hybrid synaptic structure for spiking neural network realization
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Neural networks and neuromorphic computing represent fundamental paradigms as alternative approaches to Von-Neumann-based implementations, advancing in the applications of deep learning and machine vision. Nonetheless, conventional semiconductor circuits encounter challenges in achieving ultra-fast processing speed and low power consumption due to their dissipative properties. Conversely, single flux quantum circuits exhibit inherent spiking behavior, showcasing their characteristics as a promising candidate for spiking neural networks (SNNs). In this work, we present a compact hybrid synapse circuit to mimic the biological interconnect functionality, enabling the weighting operations for excitatory and inhibitory impulses. Additionally, the proposed structure facilitates input accumulation, which is performed before the activation function. In the experiments, our synaptic structure interfaces with a soma circuit fabricated using a commercial Nb process, underscoring its compatibility and supporting its potential for integration into efficient neural network architectures. The weight value on the synapse is configurable by utilizing cryo-CMOS circuits, providing adaptability to the inference networks. We've successfully designed, fabricated, and partially tested the JJ-Synapse within our cryocooler system, enabling high-speed inference implementation for SNNs.

TI Epitaxial titanium nitride microwave resonators: Structural, chemical,
   electrical, and microwave properties
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Titanium nitride is an attractive material for a range of superconducting quantum-circuit applications owing to its low microwave losses, high surface inductance, and chemical stability. The physical properties and device performance, nevertheless, depend strongly on the quality of the materials. In this paper, we focus on the highly crystalline and epitaxial titanium nitride thin films deposited on sapphire substrates using magnetron sputtering at an intermediate temperature (300 degrees C). We performed a set of systematic and comprehensive material characterizations to thoroughly understand the structural, chemical, and transport properties. Microwave losses at low temperatures were studied using patterned microwave resonators, where the best internal quality factor in the single-photon regime is measured to be 3.3 x 10(6) and that in the high-power regime >1.0 x 10(7). Adjusted with the material filling factor of the resonators, the microwave loss-tangent here compares well with the previously reported best values for superconducting resonators. This work lays the foundation of using epitaxial titanium nitride for low-loss superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Gray code based gradient-free optimization algorithm for parameterized
   quantum circuit
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A Gray code based gradient-free optimization (GCO) algorithm is proposed to update the parameters of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in this work. Each parameter of PQCs is encoded as a binary string, named as a gene, and a genetic-based method is adopted to select the offsprings. The individuals in the offspring are decoded in Gray code way to keep Hamming distance, and then are evaluated to obtain the best one with the lowest cost value in each iteration. The algorithm is performed iteratively for all parameters one by one until the cost value satisfies the stop condition or the number of iterations is reached. The GCO algorithm is demonstrated for classification tasks in Iris and MNIST datasets, and their performance are compared by those with the Bayesian optimization algorithm and binary code based optimization algorithm. The simulation results show that the GCO algorithm can reach high accuracies steadily for quantum classification tasks. Importantly, the GCO algorithm has a robust performance in the noise environment.

TI Computational Discovery of a Novel Yttrium Silicide as an Ambient
   Pressure Superconductor
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Metal silicides have garnered significant attention due to their diverse crystalline structures, tunable electronic properties, and potential applications in superconducting devices. While numerous rare-earth metal silicides (REMSs) demonstrate superconductivity at ambient pressure, the known yttrium silicide phases exhibit extremely low superconducting critical temperatures (T-c < 1K) , limiting their practical applications. Through comprehensive crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, the discovery of a novel 14(1)/amd-YSi6, phase that exhibits superconductivity with a T-c of 8.4 K at ambient pressure is reported. This is significantly higher than any previously reported binary yttrium silicide. This electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that the unique dumbbell silicon network in this structure plays a crucial role in mediating strong electron-phonon interactions, with a coupling parameter lambda = 0.69 This finding expands the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in metal silicides and highlights the potential of yttrium silicides as promising candidates for next-generation superconducting electronics, including quantum circuits and superconducting qubits.

TI Impact of biased cooling on the operation of undoped silicon quantum
   well field-effect devices
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Gate-tunable semiconductor nanosystems are getting more and more important in the realization of quantum circuits. While such devices are typically cooled to operation temperature with zero bias applied to the gate, biased cooling corresponds to a non-zero gate voltage being applied before reaching the operation temperature. We systematically study the effect of biased cooling on different undoped SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum well field-effect stacks designed to accumulate and density-tune two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). In an empirical model, we show that biased cooling of the undoped FES induces a static electric field, which is constant at operation temperature and superimposes onto the field exerted by the top gate onto the 2DEG. We show that the voltage operation window of the field-effect-tuned 2DEG can be chosen in a wide range of voltages via the choice of the biased cooling voltage. Importantly, quality features of the 2DEG such as the mobility or the temporal stability of the 2DEG density remain unaltered under biased cooling.

TI Oscillatory and negative magnetoresistance in granular nanowires of
   superconducting NiBi3
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Local fluctuations in the superconducting order parameters in granular systems show interesting magnetotransport behavior, particularly relevant to superconducting nanowires. Kivelson and Spivak [Phys. Rev. B 45, 10490 (1992)] have shown that fluctuations in density and signs of supercurrent can lead to oscillating and negative magnetoresistance (MR). Here, we present magnetoresistance measurements of 100 nm wide NiBi3 superconducting nanowires, patterned by focused ion beam lithography, from granular NiBi3 films containing different concentrations of magnetic Ni impurities. The nanowire containing a higher concentration of Ni impurity showed oscillations in MR and simultaneously exhibited negative MR in certain temperature and field ranges. None of these effects were observed in the nanowire with nearly no Ni impurities. Unlike earlier experiments, we argue that excess magnetic Ni impurities in the nanowire realize a case of simultaneous magnitude and sign fluctuations in local order parameter, leading to MR oscillations and MR sign reversal in the same system, as discussed by Kivelson and Spivak. This result is important in the context of transport in superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Kirchhoff meets Johnson: In pursuit of unconditionally secure
   communication
SO ENGINEERING REPORTS
AB Noise: an enemy to be dealt with and a major factor limiting communication system performance. However, what if there is gold in that garbage? In conventional engineering, our focus is primarily on eliminating, suppressing, combating, or even ignoring noise and its detrimental impacts. Conversely, could we exploit it similarly to biology, which utilizes noise-alike carrier signals to convey information? In this context, the utilization of noise, or noise-alike signals in general, has been put forward as a means to realize unconditionally secure communication systems in the future. In this tutorial article, we begin by tracing the origins of thermal noise-based communication and highlighting one of its significant applications for ensuring unconditionally secure networks: the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange scheme. We then delve into the inherent challenges tied to secure communication and discuss the imperative need for physics-based key distribution schemes in pursuit of unconditional security. Concurrently, we provide a concise overview of quantum key distribution schemes and draw comparisons with their KLJN-based counterparts. Finally, extending beyond wired communication loops, we explore the transmission of noise signals over-the-air and evaluate their potential for stealth and secure wireless communication systems.

TI Quantum-like environment adaptive model for creation of phenotype
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB The textbook conceptualization of phenotype creation, "genotype (G) + environment (E) + genotype & environment interactions (GE) phenotype (Ph)", is modeled with open quantum systems theory (OQST) or more generally with adaptive dynamics theory (ADT). The model is quantum-like , i.e., it is not about quantum physical processes in biosystems. Generally such modeling is about applications of the quantum formalism and methodology outside of physics. Macroscopic biosystems, in our case genotypes and phenotypes, are treated as information processors which functioning matches the laws of quantum information theory. Phenotypes are the outputs of the E-adaptation processes described by the quantum master equation, Gorini- Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation (GKSL). Its stationary states correspond to phenotypes. We highlight the class of GKSL dynamics characterized by the camel-like graphs of (von Neumann) entropy: in the process of E-adaptation phenotype's state entropy (disorder) first increases and then falls down - a stable and wellordered phenotype is created. Traits, an organism's phenotypic characteristics, are modeled within the quantum measurement theory, as generally unsharp observables given by positive operator valued measures (POVMs. This paper is also a review on the methods and mathematical apparatus of quantum information biology.

TI On-chip photodetection of angular momentums of vortex structured light
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Structured vortex light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) shows great promise for high-bandwidth optical communications, quantum information and computing, optical tweezers, microscopy, astronomy, among others. Generating, controlling, and detecting of vortex light by all-electrical means is at the heart of next generation nanophotonic platforms. However, on-chip electrical photodetection of structured vortex light remains challenging. Here, we propose an on-chip photodetector based on 2D broadband thermoelectric material (PdSe2) with a well-designed spin-Hall couplers to directly characterize angular momentum modes of vortex structured light. Photothermoelectric responses in the PdSe2 nanoflake, excited by the focusing surface plasmons, show a magnitude proportional to the total angular momentum modes of the infrared vortex beams, thereby achieving direct detection of spin and orbital angular momentum, as well as the chirality and ellipticity of scalar vortex lights. Our works provide a promising strategy for developing on-chip angular momentum optoelectronic devices, which play a key role in the next-generation high-capacity optical communications, quantum information and computing, imaging, and other photonic systems.
   Structured vortex light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) holds promise for various optical applications, but its on-chip electrical detection remains challenging.

TI Identification of magnetic couplings in superconductor circuits
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper addresses the critical challenge of modelling inductive couplings in superconductor integrated circuits by introducing a novel method for identifying dominant magnetic couplings in large, complex circuits. The technique first identifies all potential magnetic couplings and then uses admittance parameters from a multi-port network to extract the dominant couplings. This approach significantly streamlines the previously intricate and imprecise manual process of determining these couplings, thereby enhancing design and optimisation of superconductor integrated circuits. We validate our method with a detailed case study of an AC-biased rapid single flux quantum shift register, illustrating each step from circuit-to-graph conversion to inductance extraction from the physical layout. Additionally, we apply the method to an adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron buffer cell to demonstrate its efficacy in circuits with strong inductive coupling. Our findings show that the approach efficiently reduces complexity while maintaining high modelling accuracy, thus improving the design of superconductor circuits. The method presented in this paper is equally applicable to non-superconductor circuits.

TI Resilient superconducting-element design with genetic algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present superconducting quantum circuits that exhibit atomic energy spectra and selection rules in ladder and lambda three-level configurations designed using genetic algorithms. These heuristic optimization techniques are employed to adapt the topology and parameters of a set of electrical circuits to find the suitable architecture matching the required energy levels and relevant transition matrix elements. We analyze the performance of the optimizer on one-dimensional single- and multiloop circuits to design ladder (E) and lambda (A) three-level systems with specific transition matrix elements. As expected, attaining both the required energy spectrum and the needed selection rules is challenging for single-loop circuits, but they can be accurately obtained even with just two loops. Additionally, we show that our multiloop circuits are robust against random fluctuations in their circuit parameters, i.e., under eventual fabrication flaws. Developing an optimization algorithm for automated circuit quantization opens an avenue to engineering superconducting circuits with specific symmetry to be used as modules within large-scale setups. This may allow us to mitigate the well-known current errors observed in the first generation of quantum processors.

TI Online quantum time series processing with random oscillator networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Reservoir computing is a powerful machine learning paradigm for online time series processing. It has reached state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as chaotic time series prediction and continuous speech recognition thanks to its unique combination of high computational power and low training cost which sets it aside from alternatives such as traditionally trained recurrent neural networks, and furthermore is amenable to implementations in dedicated hardware, potentially leading to extremely compact and efficient reservoir computers. Recently the use of random quantum systems has been proposed, leveraging the complexity of quantum dynamics for classical time series processing. Extracting the output from a quantum system without disturbing its state too much is problematic however, and can be expected to become a bottleneck in such approaches. Here we propose a reservoir computing inspired approach to online processing of time series consisting of quantum information, sidestepping the measurement problem. We illustrate its power by generalizing two paradigmatic benchmark tasks from classical reservoir computing to quantum information and introducing a task without a classical analogue where a random system is trained to both create and distribute entanglement between systems that never directly interact. Finally, we discuss partial generalizations where only the input or only the output time series is quantum.

TI Deep Thermalization in Gaussian Continuous-Variable Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We uncover emergent universality arising in the equilibration dynamics of multimode continuousvariable systems. Specifically, we study the ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem of a few modes, generated by Gaussian measurements on the remaining modes of a globally pure bosonic Gaussian state. We find that beginning from highly entangled, complex global states, such as random Gaussian states and product squeezed states coupled via a deep array of linear optical elements, the induced ensemble attains a universal form, independent of the choice of measurement basis: it is composed of unsqueezed coherent states whose displacements are distributed normally and isotropically, with variance depending on only the particle-number density of the system. We further show that the emergence of such a universal form is consistent with a generalized maximum entropy principle, which endows the limiting ensemble, which we call the "Gaussian Scrooge distribution," with a special quantum information-theoretic property of having minimal accessible information. Our results represent a conceptual generalization of the recently introduced notion of "deep thermalization" in discrete-variable quantum many-body systems-a novel form of equilibration going beyond thermalization of local observables-to the realm of continuousvariable quantum systems. Moreover, it demonstrates how quantum information-theoretic perspectives can unveil new physical phenomena and principles in quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics.

AB Electrostatically tunable Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) are one of the most desired building blocks of quantum electronics. Applications of JoFETs range from parametric amplifiers and superconducting qubits to a variety of integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we report on graphene JoFET devices fabricated with wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible processing based on chemical-vapor-deposited monolayer graphene encapsulated with atomic-layer-deposited Al2O3 gate oxide, lithographically defined top gate, and evaporated superconducting Ti/Al source, drain, and gate contacts. By optimizing the contact resistance down to similar to 170 Omega mu m, we observe proximity-induced superconductivity in the JoFET channels with different gate lengths of 150-350 nm. The Josephson junction devices show reproducible critical current I-c tunablity with the local top gate. Our JoFETs are in the short diffusive limit with the I-c reaching up to similar to 3 mu A for a 50 mu m channel width. Overall, our demonstration of CMOS-compatible two-dimensional (2D) material-based JoFET fabrication process is an important step toward graphene-based integrated quantum circuits.

AB This paper describes the first practical single-trace side-channel power analysis of SIKE. While SIKE is a post-quantum key exchange, the scheme still relies on a secret elliptic curve scalar multiplication which involves a loop of a double-and-add procedure, of which each iteration depends on a single bit of the private key. The attack therefore exploits the nature of elliptic curve point addition formulas which require the same function to be executed multiple times. We show how a single trace of a loop iteration can be segmented into several power traces on which 32-bit words can be hypothesised based on the value of a single private key bit. This segmentation enables a classical correlation power analysis in an extend-and-prune approach. Further error-correction techniques based on depth-search are suggested. The attack is explicitly geared towards and experimentally verified on an STM32F3 featuring a Cortex-M4 microcontroller which runs the SIKEp434 implementation adapted to 32-bit ARM that is part of the official implementations of SIKE. We obtained a resounding 100% success rate recovering the full private key in each experiment. We argue that our attack defeats many countermeasures which were suggested in a previous power analysis of SIKE, and finally show that the well-known countermeasure of projective coordinate randomisation stops the attack with a negligible overhead.

TI Chaos and Ergodicity in Extended Quantum Systems with Noisy Driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the time-evolution operator in a family of local quantum circuits with random fields in a fixed direction. We argue that the presence of quantum chaos implies that at large times the time-evolution operator becomes effectively a random matrix in the many-body Hilbert space. To quantify this phenomenon, we compute analytically the squared magnitude of the trace of the evolution operator-the generalized spectral form factor-and compare it with the prediction of random matrix theory. We show that for the systems under consideration, the generalized spectral form factor can be expressed in terms of dynamical correlation functions of local observables in the infinite temperature state, linking chaotic and ergodic properties of the systems. This also provides a connection between the many-body Thouless time tau(th)-the time at which the generalized spectral form factor starts following the random matrix theory prediction-and the conservation laws of the system. Moreover, we explain different scalings of tau(th) with the system size observed for systems with and without the conservation laws.

TI Tensor Networks for Noninvertible Symmetries in 3+1D and Beyond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Tensor networks provide a natural language for noninvertible symmetries in general Hamiltonian lattice models. We use ZX-diagrams, which are tensor network presentations of quantum circuits, to define a noninvertible operator implementing the Wegner duality in 3 + 1D lattice Z2 gauge theory. The noninvertible algebra, which mixes with lattice translations, can be efficiently computed using ZX-calculus. We further deform the Z2 gauge theory while preserving the duality and find a model with nine exactly degenerate ground states on a torus, consistent with the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraint imposed by the symmetry. Finally, we provide a ZX-diagram presentation of the noninvertible duality operators (including noninvertible parity and reflection symmetries) of generalized Ising models based on graphs, encompassing the 1 + 1D Ising model, the three-spin Ising model, the Ashkin-Teller model, and the 2 + 1D plaquette Ising model. The mixing (or lack thereof) with spatial symmetries is understood from a unifying perspective based on graph theory.

TI Lipid peroxidation in diamond supported bilayers
SO NANOSCALE
AB Lipid peroxidation is a process that occurs in cells when they are exposed to oxidative stress. During the process reactive oxygen species attack lipids within the lipid bilayers of cells. Since the products of lipid peroxidation are toxic and carcinogenic, it is important to understand where and how it occurs with nanoscale resolution. The radical intermediates of this process are particularly interesting since they are causing chain reactions damaging large parts of the lipid membranes in cells. However, they are also difficult to measure for the state of the art because they are short lived and reactive. Here, we study the lipid peroxidation of three artificial lipid bilayers on a diamonds substrate that can be used to study lipid peroxidation. In particular, we present a diamond quantum sensing method called T-1-relaxometry that allows for in situ measurements and imaging of radical intermediates of lipid peroxidation in these membranes.

TI Imaging of Submicroampere Currents in Bilayer Graphene Using a Scanning
   Diamond Magnetometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We report on nanometer magnetic imaging of two-dimensional current flow in bilayer graphene devices at room temperature. By combining dynamical modulation of the source-drain current with ac quantum sensing of a nitrogen-vacancy center in the diamond probe tip, we acquire magnetic field and current density maps with excellent sensitivities of 4.6 nT and 20 nA/mu m, respectively. The spatial resolution is 50-100 nm. We introduce a set of methods for increasing the technique's dynamic range and for mitigating undesired back-action of magnetometry operation (scanning tip, laser and microwave pulses) on the electronic transport. Finally, we show that our imaging technique is able to resolve small variations in the current flow pattern in response to changes in the background potential. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility for detecting and imaging subtle spatial features of nanoscale transport in two-dimensional materials and conductors.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear optical properties of poled and unpoled, lead zirconate-titanate (Pb0.52Zr0.48TiO3) nanorod arrays, grown on Pt-coated Si with similar to 200 nm diameter and similar to 600 nm height, were investigated. Clear signatures of second harmonic generations (SHG), from 490-525 nm (2.38-2.53 eV) at room temperature, were observed. Furthermore, time resolved differential reflectivity measurements were performed to study dynamical properties of photoexcited carriers in the range of 690-1000 nm where multiphoton processes were responsible for the photo-excitations. We compared this excitation scheme, which is sensitive mainly to the surface states, to when the photoexcited energy (similar to 3.1 eV) was close to the band gap of the nanorods. Our results offer promises for employing these nanostructures in nonlinear photonic applications.

TI Indefinite causal orders from superpositions in time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Treating the time of an event as a quantum variable, we derive a scheme in which superpositions in time are used to perform operations in an indefinite causal order. We use some aspects of a recently developed space-time-symmetric formalism of events. We propose a specific implementation of the scheme and recover the quantum switch, where quantum operations are performed in an order which is entangled with the state of a control qubit. Our scheme does not rely on any exotic quantum gravitational effect, but instead on phenomena which are naturally fuzzy in time, such as the decay of an excited atom.

TI Directional transport in Rydberg atom arrays via kinetic constraints and

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve directional transport of Rydberg excitations and entangled states in atomic arrays with unequal spacings. By leveraging distance-dependent Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and temporally modulated laser detunings, our method directs excitation flow without requiring local addressing. Numerical simulations demonstrate robust and coherent transport under experimentally realistic conditions. Additionally, we show that this scheme enables controlled transport of Bell pairs and preserves entanglement during propagation. The approach provides a versatile platform for programmable directional transport, with potential applications in quantum simulation, entanglement distribution, and the design of scalable quantum processors and networks.

For a given simulation task, it provides an upper bound on the variation distance between the probability distributions at the output of an erroneous and errorfree analogue quantum simulator. As its overheads are independent of the size and nature of the simulation, the protocol is ready for immediate usage and practical for the long term. It builds on the recent theoretical advances of strongly universal Hamiltonians and quantum accreditation as well as experimental progress toward the realization of programmable hybrid analogue-digital quantum simulators.

TI Phonon lasing with an atomic thin membrane resonator at room temperature
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Graphene has been considered as one of the best materials to implement mechanical resonators due to their excellent properties such as low mass, high quality factors and tunable resonant frequencies. Here we report the observation of phonon lasing induced by the photon-thermal pressure in a few-layer graphene resonator at room temperature, where the graphene resonator and the silicon substrate form an optical cavity. A marked threshold in the oscillation amplitude and a narrowing linewidth of the vibration mode are observed, which confirms a phonon lasing process in the graphene resonator. Our findings will stimulate the studies on phononic phenomena, help to establish new functional devices based on graphene mechanical resonators, and might find potential applications in classical and quantum sensing fields, as well as in information processing.

TI Magnetic Imaging with Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optically active spin defects hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising candidates for the development of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensing unit. Here, we demonstrate quantitative magnetic imaging with h-BN flakes doped with negatively charged boron-vacancy (V-B) centers through neutron irradiation. As a proof-of-concept, we image the magnetic field produced by CrTe2, a van der Waals ferromagnet with a Curie temperature slightly above 300 K. Compared to other quantum sensors embedded in 3D materials, the advantages of the h-BN-based magnetic sensor described in this work are its ease of use, high flexibility, and, more importantly, its ability to be placed in close proximity to a target sample. Such a sensing unit will likely find numerous applications in 2D materials research by offering a simple way to probe the physics of van der Waals heterostructures.

TI Spectroscopy and critical quantum thermometry in the ultrastrong
   coupling regime
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an exact analytical solution of the anisotropic Hopfield model, and we use it to investigate in detail the spectral and thermometric response of two ultrastrongly coupled quantum systems. Interestingly, we show that depending on the initial state of the coupled system, the vacuum Rabi splitting manifests significant asymmetries that may be considered spectral signatures of the counterintuitive decoupling effect. Using the coupled system as a thermometer for quantum thermodynamics applications, we obtain the ultimate bounds on the estimation of temperature that remain valid in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Remarkably, if the system performs a quantum phase transition, the quantum Fisher information exhibits periodic divergences, suggesting that one can have several points of arbitrarily high thermometric precision for such a critical quantum sensor.

TI Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying hightemperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to copropagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.

AB The time evolution of an Ising model with large driving fields over discrete time intervals is shown to be reproduced by an effective XXZ-Heisenberg model at leading order in the inverse field strength. For specific orientations of the drive field, the dynamics of the XXX-Heisenberg model is reproduced. These approximate equivalences, valid above a critical driving field strength set by dynamical phase transitions in the Ising model, are expected to enable quantum devices that natively evolve qubits according to the Ising model to simulate more complex systems.

TI Large array of low-frequency readout quantum capacitance detectors
SO JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS
AB Quantum capacitance detectors (QCDs) are photon shot noise-limited terahertz detectors based on a single Cooper-pair box superconducting qubit. The QCD has demonstrated photon shot noise-limited performance for 1.5 THz radiation under loading conditions between 10(-20) and 10(-18) W and single-photon detection and counting at that frequency. We report here fabrication and preliminary characterization of a 441 pixel array of QCDs with readout frequencies between 700 and 850 MHz. (C) The Authors.

TI Adiabatic sensing technique for optimal temperature estimation using
   trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an adiabatic method for optimal phonon temperature estimation using trapped ions which can be operated beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. The quantum sensing technique relies on a time-dependent red-sideband transition of phonon modes, described by the nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model in general. A unique feature of our sensing technique is that the relevant information of the phonon thermal distributions can be transferred to the collective spin-degree of freedom. We show that each of the thermal state probabilities is adiabatically mapped onto the respective collective spin-excitation configuration and thus the temperature estimation is carried out simply by performing a spin-dependent laser fluorescence measurement at the end of the adiabatic transition. We characterize the temperature uncertainty in terms of the Fisher information and show that the state projection measurement saturates the fundamental quantum Cramer-Rao bound for a quantum oscillator at thermal equilibrium.

TI Quantum spin representation for the Navier-Stokes equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop a quantum representation for Newtonian viscous fluid flows by establishing a mapping between the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and the Schr & ouml;dinger-Pauli equation (SPE). The proposed nonlinear SPE incorporates the two-component wave function and the imaginary diffusion. Consequently, classical fluid flow can be interpreted as a non-Hermitian quantum spin system. Using the SPE-based numerical simulation of viscous flows, we demonstrate the quantum/wavelike behavior in flow dynamics. Furthermore, the SPE equivalent to the NSE can facilitate the quantum simulation of fluid dynamics.

TI Dynamical control of the conductivity of an atomic Josephson junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose to dynamically control the conductivity of a Josephson junction composed of two weakly coupled one-dimensional condensates of ultracold atoms. A current is induced by a periodically modulated potential difference between the condensates, giving access to the conductivity of the junction. By using parametric driving of the tunneling energy, we demonstrate that the low-frequency conductivity of the junction can be enhanced or suppressed, depending on the choice of the driving frequency. The experimental realization of this proposal provides a quantum simulation of optically enhanced superconductivity in pump-probe experiments of hightemperature superconductors.

TI QIST: One-dimensional quantum integer wavelet S-transform
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB We present the first quantum version of the one-dimensional integer wavelet S-Transform (QIST). This version is based on a new Quantum Block Representation by Basis States (QBRBS) and the design of a quantum rounding operator. The QBRBS format facilitates stor-ing and manipulating pairs of signal elements, decreasing the use of additional qubits and gates. Also, the quantum rounding operator exploits the features of the S-Transform to avoid nonlinearities. Complete quantum circuits for addition, subtraction, and halving operations were developed. The complexity analysis showed a polynomial quantum com-plexity, O(n), and a time complexity of O(1). The experiments performed on MATLAB and Qiskit verify the theoretical results coinciding with the results of the classical version. Finally, the new quantum transform's feasibility and accuracy enable new quantum devel-opments in information hiding, compression, and IoT applications.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI Depth Optimization of CZ, CNOT, and Clifford Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We seek to develop better upper bound guarantees on the depth of quantum CZ gate, cnot gate, and Clifford circuits than those reported previously. We focus on the number of qubits n <= 1 345 000 (de Brugiere et al., 2021), which represents the most practical use case. Our upper bound on the depth of CZ circuits is (sic)n/2 + 0.4993 center dot log(2)(n) + 3.0191 center dot log(n) - 10.9139(sic), improving the best-known depth by a factor of roughly 2. We extend the constructions used to prove this upper bound to obtain depth upper bound of (sic)n + 1.9496 center dot log(2)(n) + 3.5075 center dot log(n) - 23.4269(sic) for cnot gate circuits, offering an improvement by a factor of roughly 4/3 over the state of the art, and depth upper bound of (sic)2n + 2.9487 center dot log2(n) + 8.4909 center dot log(n) - 44.4798(sic) for Clifford circuits, offering an improvement by a factor of roughly 5/3.

TI Criticality-enhanced electric field gradient sensor with single trapped
   ions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose and analyze a driven-dissipative quantum sensor that is continuously monitored close to a dissipative critical point. The sensor relies on the critical open Rabi model with the spin and phonon degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion to achieve criticality-enhanced sensitivity. Effective continuous monitoring of the sensor is realized via a co-trapped ancilla ion that switches between dark and bright internal states conditioned on a 'jump' of the phonon population which, remarkably, achieves nearly perfect phonon counting despite a low photon collection efficiency. By exploiting both dissipative criticality and efficient continuous readout, the sensor device achieves highly precise sensing of oscillating electric field gradients at a criticality-enhanced precision scaling beyond the standard quantum limit, which we demonstrate is robust to the experimental imperfections in real-world applications.

TI Excited-State Spectroscopy of Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride

However, the spin levelstructure of the VB-color center is still unclear, especially for the excitedstate. Here we measured and confirmed the excited-state spin transitions ofVB-using an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique.The zero-field splitting of the excited state is 2.06 GHz, the transversesplitting is 93.1 MHz, and thegfactor is 2.04. Moreover, negative peaks influorescence intensity and ODMR contrast at the level anticrossing pointwere observed, and they further confirmed that the spin transitions wemeasured came from the excited state. Our work deepens the under-standing of the excited-state structure of VB-and promotes VB--based quantum sensing applications

TI Phase transition observation of nanoscale water on diamond surface

AB Water is one of the most important substances in the world. It is a crucial issue to study the dynamics of water molecules at interfaces or in the confined systems. In recent years, the emerging magnetic resonance technique based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center has allowed us to observe the nanoscale nuclear magnetic signal and temperature simultaneously. Here we succeed in measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)signals of nanoscale solid and liquid water on diamond surface by NV center, and observing the solid-liquidphase transition of these nano-water by temperature control. This work demonstrates that the nano-NMR technique based on NV centers can probe the dynamics behavior of nanoscale materials effectively, providing anew way for studying the nanoscale confined systems

We map the 3+1-dimensional Dirac equation onto the first excited manifold of four qubits to simulate the internal four-component spinor dynamics. Additionally, we simulate two intriguing and challenging-to-implement physical phenomena: the Zitterbewegung effect and the Sauter-Schwinger effect. Compared to previous simulations, our system provides a larger parameter space, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of physical properties. This work enhances our understanding of spinor dynamics.

We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasiparticle and quasihole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice to measure changes in energy spectra for superfluid and Mott-insulator states at different densities and observe the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.

TI Dispersive readout of room-temperature ensemble spin sensors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We demonstrate dispersive readout of the spin of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in a high-quality dielectric microwave resonator at room temperature. The spin state is inferred from the reflection phase of a microwave signal probing the resonator. Time-dependent tracking of the spin state is demonstrated, and is employed to measure the T (1) relaxation time of the spin ensemble. Dispersive readout provides a microwave interface to solid state spins, translating a spin signal into a microwave phase shift. We estimate that its sensitivity can outperform optical readout schemes, owing to the high accuracy achievable in a measurement of phase. The scheme is moreover applicable to optically inactive spin defects and it is non-destructive, which renders it insensitive to several systematic errors of optical readout and enables the use of quantum feedback.

TI Visualizing strongly focused 3D light fields in an atomic vapor
SO OPTICA
AB Structured light, when strongly focused, generates highly confined vectorial electromagnetic field distributions, which may feature a polarization component along the optical axis. Manipulating and detecting such 3D light fields is challenging, as conventional optical elements and detectors do not interact with the axial polarization component. Vector light can, however, be mapped onto atomic polarizations, making electric dipole transitions an ideal candidate to sense such 3D light configurations. Working in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the electric dipole transitions are spectrally resolved, we demonstrate direct evidence of the axial polarization component of strongly focused radial light. We investigate the influence of various input polarization states, including radial, azimuthal, and higher-order optical vortices, on atomic absorption profiles. Our results confirm a clear mapping between the 3D vector light and the atomic transition strength. This work provides insights into vectorial light-matter interaction and opens avenues for quantum sensing applications.

We introduce a novel configuration of a single-beam atomic magnetometer based on space division multiplexing (SDM), offering a promising approach to this field of research. This design utilizes a custom-designed metasurface to manipulate two generated modes, enabling the implementation of a pump-probe configuration within a single-beam atomic magnetometer. This approach achieves higher spatial resolution and reduces the system's volume. The metasurface centrally generates circularly polarized light carrying spin angular momentum, while linearly polarized light is emitted from the outer areas. This design not only enhances the miniaturization of chip-scale atomic magnetometers but also opens new avenues for exploring interactions between hot atomic spin ensembles and vector beams.<br /> (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond under weak laser excitation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB As promising quantum sensors, nitrogen -vacancy (N - V ) centers in diamond have been widely used in frontier studies in condensed -matter physics, material science, and life sciences. In practical applications, weak laser excitation is favorable as it reduces the side effects of laser irradiation, such as phototoxicity and heating. Here we report a combined theoretical and experimental study of (near) zero -field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of N - V -center ensembles under weak 532-nm laser excitation. In this region, both the width and splitting of the ODMR spectra decrease with increasing laser power. This power dependence is reproduced with a model that accounts for the laser -induced charge neutralization of N- V - -N + pairs, which alters the local electric field environment. These results are useful for the understanding and development of N - V -based quantum sensing in light-sensitive applications.

TI Notes on pseudo entropy amplification
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We study pseudo entropy for a particular linear combination of entangled states in qubit systems, two-dimensional free conformal field theories (CFTs), and two-dimensional holographic CFT. We observe phenomena whereby the pseudo entropy can be parametrically large compared with the logarithm of the dimension of the Hilbert space. We call these phenomena pseudo entropy amplification; it is analogous to the amplification of the weak value. In particular, our result suggests the holographic CFT does not lead to amplification as long as the non-perturbative effects are negligible. We also give a heuristic argument for when such (non-)amplification can occur.

TI Asymmetric waveguide and compressively strained quantum well-enabled
   high-power, polarization-dependent 850 nm gain chip
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The development of high-power gain chips is crucial for advancing hybrid-integrated narrow-linewidth lasers, which face power limitations in emerging applications such as quantum sensing and atomic cooling. This study designed a high-power GaAs-based gain chip based on an asymmetric waveguide and compressively strained quantum wells for the 850 nm wavelength band. By applying the epitaxial structure and low-loss waveguide, a record continuous-wave output power of 114.08 mW and a broadband spectrum spanning 31.55 nm with low spectral modulation were achieved. Experiments have shown that the asymmetric waveguide significantly enhances power and reduces cavity loss by suppressing carrier leakage, while the compressive strain-induced valence band splitting enhances the polarization extinction ratio. This work provides a simple and direct option for developing high-power hybrid-integrated lasers in the 850 nm band.

TI SNR enhancement of magnetic fields measurement with the diamond NV
   center using a compound filter system
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are progressively favored for room-temperature magnetic field measurement. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) optimization for NV diamond magnetometry generally concentrates on signal amplitude enhancement rather than efficient noise processing. Here, we report a compound filter system combining a wavelet denoising method and an adaptive filter for the realization of an efficient weak magnetic measurement with a high SNR. It allows enhanced magnetic field measurement with an average SNR enhancement of 17.80 dB at 50 nT within 500 mHz to 100 Hz and 14.76 dB at 500 mHz within 50 nT to 1100 nT. The introduction of this system in NV diamond magnetometry is aimed to improve signal quality by effectively eliminating the noise and retaining ideal signals.

TI Temperature Selective Thermometry with Sub-Microsecond Time Resolution
   Using Dressed-Spin States in Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Versatile nanoscale sensors that are susceptible to changes in a variety of physical quantities often exhibit limited selectivity. This paper reports a novel scheme based on microwave-dressed spin states for optically probed nanoscale temperature detection using diamond quantum sensors, which provides selective sensitivity to temperature changes. By combining this scheme with a continuous pump-probe scheme using ensemble nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds, a sub-microsecond temporal resolution with thermal sensitivity of 3.7 K center dot Hz-1/2 that is insensitive to variations in external magnetic fields on the order of 2 G is demonstrated. The presented results are favorable for the practical application of time-resolved nanoscale quantum sensing, where temperature imaging is required under fluctuating magnetic fields.

TI Evaluating states in trapped ions with local correlation between
   internal and motional degrees of freedom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and demonstrate a scalable scheme for the simultaneous determination of internal and motional states in trapped ions with single-site resolution. The scheme is applied to the study of polaritonic excitations in the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model with trapped ions, in which the internal and motional states of the ions are strongly correlated. We observe quantum phase crossovers of polaritonic excitations in two ions by directly evaluating their variances per ion site. Our work establishes an essential technological method for large-scale quantum simulations of polaritonic systems.

TI Electron Spin Resonance at the Single-Molecule Scale
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a widely employed spectroscopic technique for studying systems with unpaired electron spins, such as molecular radicals. Typically, many billions of spins are required to get a detectable ESR signal, which is subject to extensive ensemble averaging. Downscaling ESR to a single molecule allows studying the signatures of each individual molecule separately, applicable to biomolecules in their native environment, for example. Single-molecule ESR offers several novel research avenues, such as in quantum sensing with a single molecule. Over the last decades, four different single-molecule ESR approaches have been developed, which rely on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning-probe microscopy. An introduction into these four approaches including their deployment in pioneering works will be provided.

TI Enhancement of quantum coherence in solid-state qubits via interface
   engineering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence, improved sensitivity, and device durability.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A nanodiamond with an embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the experimental systems that can be coherently manipulated within current technologies. Entanglement between NV center electron spin and mechanical rotation of the nanodiamond plays a fundamental role in building a quantum network connecting these microscopic and mesoscopic degrees of motions. Here we present a protocol to asymptotically prepare a highly entangled state of the total quantum angular momentum and electron spin by adiabatically boosting the external magnetic field.

TI Absence of localization in weakly interacting Floquet circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a family of Floquet circuits that can interpolate between noninteracting qubits, free propagation, generic interacting, and dual -unitary dynamics. We identify the operator entanglement entropy of the two-qubit gate as a good quantitative measure of the interaction strength. We test the persistence of localization in the vicinity of the noninteracting point by probing spectral statistics, decay of autocorrelators, and measuring entanglement growth. The finite -size analysis suggests that the many -body localized regime does not persist in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, our results are compatible with an integrability -breaking phenomenon.

TI How to Engineer a Quantum Wavefunction
SO PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB In a conventional experiment, scientists typically aim to learn about target systems by manipulating source systems of the same material type. In an analogue quantum simulation, by contrast, scientists typically aim to learn about target quantum systems of one material type via an experiment on a source quantum system of a different material type. In this article, we argue that such inferences can be justified by reference to source and target quantum systems being of the same empirical type. We illustrate this novel experimental practice of wavefunction engineering with reference to the example of Bose-Hubbard systems.

However, the optical access required for NV spin readoutremains an important hurdle for operation in challenging environmentssuch as millikelvin cryostats or biological systems. Here, we demonstratea scanning-NV sensor consisting of a diamond nanobeam that is opticallycoupled to a tapered optical fiber. This nanobeam sensor combinesa natural scanning-probe geometry with high-efficiency through-fiberoptical excitation and readout of the NV spins. We demonstrate through-fiberoptically interrogated electron spin resonance and proof-of-principlemagnetometry operation by imaging spin waves in an yttrium-iron-garnetthin film. Our scanning-nanobeam sensor can be combined with nanophotonicstructuring to control the light-matter interaction strengthand has potential for applications that benefit from all-fiber sensoraccess, such as millikelvin systems.

TI Threshold for a Discrete-Variable Sensor of Quantum Reservoirs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum sensing employs quantum resources of a sensor to attain a smaller estimation error of physical quantities than the limit constrained by classical physics. To measure a quantum reservoir, which is significant in decoherence control, a nonunitary-encoding sensing scheme becomes necessary. However, previous studies showed that the reservoir-induced degradation to quantum resources of the sensor makes the errors divergent with the increase of encoding time. We here propose a scheme to use N two-level systems as the sensor to measure a quantum reservoir. A threshold, above which the shot-noise-limited sensing error saturates or even persistently decreases with the encoding time, is uncovered. Our analysis reveals that it is due to the formation of a bound state of the total sensor-reservoir system. Solving the outstanding error-divergency problem in previous studies, our result supplies an insightful guideline in realizing a sensitive measurement of quantum reservoirs.

A variable-thickness Mo metal layer sputtered onto a Si3N4/Si substrate makes possible NPs with different lengths in a controllable manner. We demonstrate how our fabrication strategy leads to tunable cross-sections with different geometries, including hexagonal, cylindrical, square and triangular shapes, by using electron beam lithography on hydrogen silsesquioxane negative tone resist. To ensure well-defined facets and surfaces, we employ deep-reactive ion etching in a gas mixture of SF6 and O2 at cryogenic temperatures in an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system. These results represent an attractive route towards the realization of high-density Mo NP arrays for applications from nanoelectronics to quantum sensing and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis.

TI Strategies for Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) States in Quantum
   Metrologies with Noise
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum metrology overcomes standard precision limits and has the potential to play a key role in quantum sensing. Quantum mechanics, through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, imposes limits on the precision of measurements. Conventional bounds to the measurement precision such as the shot noise limit are not as fundamental as the Heisenberg limits, and can be beaten with quantum strategies that employ 'quantum tricks' such as squeezing and entanglement. Bipartite entangled quantum states with a positive partial transpose (PPT), i.e., PPT entangled states, are usually considered to be too weakly entangled for applications. Since no pure entanglement can be distilled from them, they are also called bound entangled states. We provide strategies, using which multipartite quantum states that have a positive partial transpose with respect to all bi-partitions of the particles can still outperform separable states in linear interferometers.

TI Matrix effects on the magnetic properties of a molecular spin triangle

AB Molecular triangles with competing Heisenberg interactions and significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) exhibit high environmental sensitivity, making them potential candidates for active elements for quantum sensing. Additionally, these triangles exhibit magnetoelectric coupling, allowing their properties to be controlled using electric fields. However, the manipulation and deposition of such complexes pose significant challenges. This work explores a solution by embedding iron-based molecular triangles in a polymer matrix, a strategy that offers various deposition methods. We investigate how the host matrix alters the magnetic properties of the molecular triangle, with specific focus on the magnetic anisotropy, aiming to advance its practical applications as quantum sensors.
   Complex [Fe3O(O2CPh)6(py)3]ClO4 center dot py embedded in a polymeric film retains its structure and magnetic properties, while probing its local environment through slight modifications of its magnetoanisotropy.

We provide a lower bound for the time required to transform an initial state to a final state in terms of thermodynamic quantities such as the energy fluctuation, entropy production rate, and dynamical activity. Such bound was already analyzed for Markovian evolution satisfying detailed balance condition. Here we generalize this approach to deal with arbitrary evolution governed by a time-local generator. Our analysis is illustrated by three paradigmatic examples of qubit evolution: amplitude damping, pure dephasing, and the eternally non-Markovian evolution.

We directly observe the emergence of the NV's room-temperature effective excited-state structure and provide a clear explanation for a previously poorly understood broad quenching of NV PL at intermediate temperatures around 50 K, as well as the subsequent revival of NV PL. We develop a model based on two-phonon orbital averaging that quantitatively explains all of our findings, including the strong impact that strain has on the temperature dependence of the NV's PL. These results complete our understanding of orbital averaging in the NV excited state and have significant implications for the fundamental understanding of the NV center and its applications in quantum sensing.

TI Tuneable Gaussian entanglement in levitated nanoparticle arrays
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Optically levitated nanoparticles emerged as an interesting platform for probing fundamental physics. Quantum control of their motion (including potential shaping) predisposes them for emulating various physical systems and studying quantum phenomena with massive objects. Extending these capabilities to quantum many-body systems requires feasible strategies to couple and entangle nanoparticles directly or via an optical bus. We propose a variable, deterministic scheme to generate Gaussian entanglement in the motional steady state of levitated nanoparticles using coherent scattering. Coupling multiple nanoparticles to a common cavity mode allows cooling of a collective Bogoliubov mode; cooling multiple Bogoliubov modes (by trapping each nanoparticle in multiple tweezers, each scattering into a separate cavity mode) removes most thermal noise, leading to strong entanglement. Numerical simulations for three nanoparticles show great tuneability of entanglement with realistic experimental parameters. Our proposal paves the way towards complex motional quantum states for advanced quantum sensing protocols and many-body quantum simulations.

AB The extreme sensitivity of quantum magnetometers enables new applications in material testing such as the identification of single defect events in the bulk of small volume specimen ( 0.1 mm(3)). Exposing ferromagnetic materials to strain alters their magnetic response. Due to uncompensated spins, defects arising from the fatigue process interact with magnetic domain walls. Optically pumped zero-field magnetometers (OPM) provide the sensitivity required to measure small variations in the magnetic response and potentially to quantify damage in the material. We provide first results of a novel micro fatigue setup with an integrated OPM to correlate variations of the magnetic response in a multimodal approach. The position of the Villari reversals within the magneto-mechanic hysteresis and the amplitude of magnetic field are potential candidates to estimate fatigue damage within the specimen.

TI Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation in Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The time-energy uncertainty relation in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics has been intensely debated with regard to its formal derivation, validity, and physical meaning. Here, we analyze two formal relations proposed by Mandelstam and Tamm and by Margolus and Levitin and evaluate their validity using a minimal quantum toy model composed of a single qubit inside an external magnetic field. We show that the l(1) norm of energy coherence C is invariant with respect to the unitary evolution of the quantum state. Thus, the l(1) norm of energy coherence C of an initial quantum state is useful for the classification of the ability of quantum observables to change in time or the ability of the quantum state to evolve into an orthogonal state. In the single-qubit toy model, for quantum states with the submaximal l(1) norm of energy coherence, C < 1, the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin relations generate instances of infinite "time uncertainty" that is devoid of physical meaning. Only for quantum states with the maximal l(1) norm of energy coherence, C = 1, the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin relations avoid infinite "time uncertainty", but they both reduce to a strict equality that expresses the Einstein-Planck relation between energy and frequency. The presented results elucidate the fact that the time in the Schrodinger equation is a scalar variable that commutes with the quantum Hamiltonian and is not subject to statistical variance.

TI Sequence processing with quantum-inspired tensor networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We introduce efficient tensor network models for sequence processing motivated by correspondence to probabilistic graphical models, interpretability and resource compression. Inductive bias is introduced via network architecture as motivated by correlation and compositional structure in the data. We create expressive networks utilising tensors that are both complex and unitary. As such they may be represented by parameterised quantum circuits and describe physical processes. The relevant inductive biases result in networks with logarithmic treewidth which is paramount for avoiding trainability issues in these spaces. For the same reason, they are also efficiently contractable or 'quantum-inspired'. We demonstrate experimental results for the task of binary classification of bioinformatics and natural language, characterised by long-range correlations and often equipped with syntactic information. This work provides a scalable route for experimentation on the role of tensor structure and syntactic priors in NLP. Since these models map operationally to the qubits of a quantum processor, unbiased sampling equates to taking measurements on the quantum state encoding the learnt probability distribution. We demonstrate implementation on Quantinuum's H2-1 trapped-ion quantum processor, showing the potential of near-term quantum devices.

TI Constraining modified gravity with quantum optomechanics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We derive the best possible bounds that can be placed on Yukawa- and chameleon-like modifications to the Newtonian gravitational potential with a cavity optomechanical quantum sensor. By modelling the effects on an oscillating source-sphere on the optomechanical system from first-principles, we derive the fundamental sensitivity with which these modifications can be detected in the absence of environmental noise. In particular, we take into account the large size of the optomechanical probe compared with the range of the fifth forces that we wish to probe and quantify the resulting screening effect when both the source and probe are spherical. Our results show that optomechanical systems in high vacuum could, in principle, further constrain the parameters of chameleon-like modifications to Newtonian gravity.

TI Evidence for the Meissner Effect in the Nickelate Superconductor
   La3Ni2O7-δ Single Crystal Using Diamond Quantum Sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enables the characterization of magnetic properties in the extreme situation of a tiny sample with defects. Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-s under pressure, with zero resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-s single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-s. This study also offers insights into its structural and magnetic properties under high pressure.

TI Quantum vibropolaritonic sensing
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Vibrational spectroscopies are pivotal in analytical methods and biomedical diagnostics owing to their singular ability to provide molecular specificity. However, they are intrinsically limited by weak light-matter interactions and vulnerability to intensity fluctuations and spectral interference. Here, we propose a quantum sensing strategy by leveraging hybrid light-matter states under vibrational strong coupling between molecular vibrations and an optical cavity mode. These quantum vibropolaritonic states exhibit characteristic vacuum Rabi splitting, which not only enables manipulation of molecular vibrations but also provides a unique optical transducer. The feasibility of this strategy is established by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Through fabrication of a microfluidic infrared flow cell, definitive experimental validation of vibropolaritonic sensing is achieved. We believe that this study represents a major advance in harnessing hybrid light-matter states for molecular sensing and offers exciting potential to affect applications in areas including chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and bioprocess monitoring.

TI Integrated NV Center-Based Temperature Sensor for Internal Thermal
   Monitoring in Optical Waveguides
SO SENSORS
AB Color centers in solids, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their exceptional properties for quantum sensing. In this work, we demonstrate an NV center-based temperature sensor integrated into an optical waveguide to enable internal temperature sensing. A surface-cladding optical waveguide was fabricated in a diamond wafer containing NV centers using femtosecond laser direct writing. By analyzing the resonant peaks of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra, we established a precise correlation between temperature changes induced by the pump laser and shifts in the ODMR peak positions. This approach enabled temperature monitoring with a sensitivity of 1.1 mK/Hz. These results highlight the significant potential of color centers in solids for non-contact, micro-scale temperature monitoring.

TI RydIQule: A graph-based paradigm for modeling Rydberg and atomic sensors
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We describe a numerical technique and accompanying open-source Python software package called RydIQule. RydIQule uses a directional graph, relying on adjacency matrices and path-finding to generate a Hamiltonian for multi-level atomic systems. RydIQule then constructs semi-classical equations of motion (Bloch equations) into a tensor which can store an entire simulation consisting of varied system parameters. Using this framework, RydIQule returns solutions significantly faster than typical for interpreted programming languages. RydIQule extends beyond the capabilities of currently-available tools, facilitating rapid development in atomic and Rydberg spectroscopy. To demonstrate its utility, we use RydIQule to simulate a Doppler-broadened Rydberg atomic sensor that simultaneously demodulates five rf tones spanning from 1.7 to 116 GHz. Using RydIQule, this simulation can be solved in several hours on a commercial off-the-shelf desktop computer.

TI A quantum eigenvalue solver based on tensor networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Electronic ground states are of central importance in chemical simulations, but have remained beyond the reach of efficient classical algorithms except in cases of weak electron correlation or one-dimensional spatial geometry. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of strongly correlated ground states with arbitrary spatial geometry. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into compact quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.

TI Consequences of preserving reversibility in quantum superchannels
SO QUANTUM
AB Similarly to quantum states, quantum operations can also be transformed by means of quantum superchannels, also known as process matrices. Quantum superchannels with multiple slots are deterministic transformations which take independent quantum operations as inputs. While they are enforced to respect the laws of quantum mechanics, the use of input operations may lack a definite causal order, and characterizations of general superchannels in terms of quantum objects with a physical implementation have been missing. In this paper, we provide a mathematical characterization for pure superchannels with two slots (also known as bipartite pure processes), which are superchannels preserving the reversibility of quantum operations. We show that the reversibility preserving condition restricts all pure superchannels with two slots to be either a quantum circuit only consisting of unitary operations or a coherent superposition of two unitary quantum circuits where the two input operations are differently ordered. The latter may be seen as a generalization of the quantum switch, allowing a physical interpretation for pure two-slot superchannels. An immediate corollary is that purifiable bipartite processes cannot violate device-independent causal inequalities.

TI Charge State Tuning of Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.

TI Deep polarization of the ensemble nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds
   induced by an Airy beam with a long focal depth
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Solid-state spin systems with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds constitute an increasingly popular platform for quantum sensing. However, most existing platforms designed with ensemble NV centers exhibit a sensitivity that is significantly less than the theoretical maximum. This low sensitivity limits the expansion of the experimental results and application areas. In this study, the sensitivity is improved by increasing the pumping depth of the excitation beam to increase the number of particles involved in spin polarization at a given laser intensity. Compared with the proposed Airy beam with a long focal depth (25.46 lambda) and the widely utilized Gauss beam pumping ensemble NV centers, the spin resonance factor fSR can be improved by 10.02%. This sensitivity-optimized approach enhances the functionality of sensors with NV centers.

TI Optimal probe states for single-mode quantum target detection in
   arbitrary object reflectivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum target detection (QTD) utilizes nonclassical resources to enable radar-like detection for identifying reflecting objects in lossy and noisy environments, surpassing the detection performance achieved by classical methods. To fully exploit the quantum advantage in QTD, determining the optimal probe states (OPSs) across various detection parameters and gaining a deeper understanding of their characteristics are crucial. In this study, we employ optimization algorithms to identify the single-mode continuous-variable OPSs for entire range of target reflectivity. Our findings suggest that OPSs are non-Gaussian states in most reflectivity scenarios, with exceptions under specific conditions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive physical interpretation of the observed phenomena. This study offers a tool for identifying OPSs along with a clear physical interpretation. It also contributes to further advancements towards optimal multi-mode QTD, which holds the potential for broad applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

AB We report a notch-shaped coplanar microwave waveguide antenna on a glass plate designed for on-chip detection of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs). A lithographically patterned thin wire at the center of the notch area in the coplanar waveguide realizes a millimeter-scale ODMR detection area (1.5 x 2.0 mm(2)) and gigahertz-broadband characteristics with low reflection (similar to 8%). The ODMR signal intensity in the detection area is quantitatively predictable by numerical simulation. Using this chip device, we demonstrate a uniform ODMR signal intensity over the detection area for cells, tissue, and worms. The present demonstration of a chip-based microwave architecture will enable scalable chip integration of ODMR-based quantum sensing technology into various bioassay platforms.

TI First Search for Ultralight Dark Matter Using a Magnetically Levitated
   Particle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We perform the first search for ultralight dark matter using a magnetically levitated particle. A submillimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of 0.2 fN/ p. We find no evidence of a signal and derive limits on dark matter coupled to the difference ffiffiffiffiffi Hz between baryon and lepton number, B-L, in the mass range (1.10360-1.10485) x 10-13 eV/c2. Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is gB-L less than or similar to 2.98 x 10-21. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry In Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, which features short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range, demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Fiber-coupled sensors are well suited for sensing and microscopy in hard-to-reach environments such as biological or cryogenic systems. We demonstrate fiber-based magnetic imaging based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) sensor spins at the tip of a fiber-coupled diamond nanobeam. We incorporated angled ion implantation into the nanobeam fabrication process to realize a small ensemble of NV spins at the nanobeam tip. By gluing the nanobeam to a tapered fiber, we created a robust and transportable probe with optimized optical coupling efficiency. We demonstrate the imaging capability of the fiber-coupled nanobeam by measuring the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire. With its robust coupling and efficient readout at the fiber-coupled interface, our probe could allow new studies of (quantum) materials and biological samples.

TI Strongly Interacting, Two-Dimensional, Dipolar Spin Ensembles in
   (111)-Oriented Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Systems of spins with strong dipolar interactions and controlled dimensionality enable new explorations in quantum sensing and simulation. In this work, we investigate the creation of strong dipolar interactions in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers generated via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on (111)-oriented diamond substrates. We find that diamond growth on the (111) plane yields high incorporation of spins, both nitrogen and NV centers, where the density of the latter is tunable via the miscut of the diamond substrate. Our process allows us to form dense, preferentially aligned, 2D NV ensembles with volume-normalized ac sensitivity down to eta ac 1/4 810 pT mu m3/2 Hz-1/2. Furthermore, we show that (111) affords maximally positive dipolar interactions among a 2D NV ensemble, which is crucial for leveraging dipolar-driven entanglement schemes and exploring new interacting spin physics.

TI Optimal multiple-phase estimation with multi-mode NOON states against
   photon loss
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Multi-mode NOON states can quantum-enhance multiple-phase estimation in the absence of photon loss. However, a multi-mode NOON state is known to be vulnerable to photon loss, and its quantum-enhancement can be dissipated by lossy environment. In this work, we demonstrate that a quantum advantage in estimate precision can still be achieved in the presence of photon loss. This is accomplished by optimizing the weights of the multi-mode NOON states according to photon loss rates in the multiple modes, including the reference mode which defines the other phases. For practical relevance, we also show that photon-number counting via a multi-mode beam-splitter achieves the useful, albeit sub-optimal, quantum advantage. We expect this work to provide valuable guidance for developing quantum-enhanced multiple-phase estimation techniques in lossy environments.

TI Plug-and-Play Measurement of Chromatic Dispersion by Means of Two-Photon
   Interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Since the first proof-of-principle experiments 25 years ago, quantum metrology has matured from fundamental concepts to versatile and powerful tools in a large variety of research branches, such as gravitational-wave detection, atomic clocks, plasmonic sensing, and magnetometry. At the same time, two-photon interferometry, which underpins the possibility of entanglement to probe optical materials with unprecedented levels of precision and accuracy, holds the promise to stand at the heart of innovative functional quantum sensing systems. We report a quantum based method for measuring the frequency dependence of the velocity in a transparent medium, i.e., chromatic dispersion (CD). This technique, using energy-time-entangled photons, allows straightforward access to CD value from the visibility of two-photon fringes recorded in a free-evolution regime. In addition, our quantum approach features all the advantages of classical measurement techniques, i.e., flexibility and accuracy, all in a plug-and-play system.

TI Fluorescence modulation of nanodiamond NV- centers for
   neurochemical detection
SO MRS ADVANCES
AB Nanodiamond (ND) with nitrogen vacancy (NV-) color centers has emerged as an important material for quantum sensing and imaging. Fluorescent, carboxylated ND (140 nm) is investigated for the detection of dopamine (DA), caffeine (CA), and ascorbic acid (AA). Over a 200 nM range, DA and CA quenched the ND fluorescence by 7.1 and 9.8%, respectively. For AA, fluorescence was quenched (2.9%) at nM concentrations and enhanced at mu M concentrations. The quenching fit well to Langmuir adsorption isotherms. For DA-CA mixtures, the CA at nM concentrations did not affect DA quenching but interfered when at mu M concentrations. The DA at nM or mu M concentrations lessened CA quenching. For DA-AA mixtures with DA at mM concentrations, AA quenched fluorescence throughout the nM and mu M range, with increased quenching in the nM range. These studies support ND fluorescence modulation as a possible sensor modality for bioanalyte detection.

TI Quantum networking with short-range entanglement assistance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an approach to distribute high-fidelity long-range entanglement in a quantum network assisted by the entanglement supplied by auxiliary short-range paths between the network nodes. Entanglement assistance in the form of shared catalyst states is utilized to maximize the efficiency of entanglement concentration transformations over the edges of the network. The catalyst states are recycled for use in adaptive operations at the network nodes and replenished periodically using the auxiliary short-range paths. The rate of long-range entanglement distribution using such entanglement assistance is found to be significantly higher than possible without using entanglement assistance.

TI Insight into a Fenton-like Reaction Using Nanodiamond Based Relaxometry
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Copper has several biological functions, but also some toxicity, as it can act as a catalyst for oxidative damage to tissues. This is especially relevant in the presence of H2O2, a by-product of oxygen metabolism. In this study, the reactions of copper with H2O2 have been investigated with spectroscopic techniques. These results were complemented by a new quantum sensing technique (relaxometry), which allows nanoscale magnetic resonance measurements at room temperature, and at nanomolar concentrations. For this purpose, we used fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing ensembles of specific defects called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. More specifically, we performed so-called T1 measurements. We use this method to provide real-time measurements of copper during a Fenton-like reaction. Unlike with other chemical fluorescent probes, we can determine both the increase and decrease in copper formed in real time.

TI Strong coupling of alkali-metal spins to noble-gas spins with an
   hour-long coherence time
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Nuclear spins of noble gases can maintain coherence for hours at ambient conditions because they are isolated by complete electron shells(1). This isolation, however, impedes the ability to manipulate and control them by optical means or by coupling to other spin gases(2-4). Here we achieve strong coherent coupling between noble-gas spins and the optically accessible spins of an alkali-metal vapour. The coupling emerges from the coherent accumulation of stochastic spin-exchange collisions. We obtain a coupling strength ten times higher than the decay rate, observe the coherent and periodic exchange of spin excitations between the two gases and demonstrate active control over the coupling by an external magnetic field. This approach could be developed into a fast and efficient interface for noble-gas spins, enabling applications in quantum sensing and information(5,6).

TI Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors are highly sensitive since they capitalise on fragile quantum properties such as coherence, while enabling ultra-high spatial resolution. For sensing, the crux is to minimise the measurement uncertainty in a chosen range within a given time. However, basic quantum sensing protocols cannot simultaneously achieve both a high sensitivity and a large range. Here, we demonstrate a non-adaptive algorithm for increasing this range, in principle without limit, for alternating-current field sensing, while being able to get arbitrarily close to the best possible sensitivity. Therefore, it outperforms the standard measurement concept in both sensitivity and range. Also, we explore this algorithm thoroughly by simulation, and discuss the T-2 scaling that this algorithm approaches in the coherent regime, as opposed to the T-1/2 of the standard measurement. The same algorithm can be applied to any modulo-limited sensor.

TI Phase dynamics of tunnel Al-based ferromagnetic Josephson junctions

AB By measuring the current-voltage characteristics and the switching current distributions as a function of temperature, we have investigated the phase dynamics of Al tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions (JJs), designed to fall in the typical range of parameters of state-of-the-art transmons, providing evidence of phase diffusion processes. The comparison with the experimental outcomes on non-magnetic JJs with nominally the same electrodynamical parameters demonstrates that the introduction of ferromagnetic barriers does not cause any sizeable detrimental effect and supports the notion of including tunnel ferromagnetic JJs in qubit architectures.

AB Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Heuristic to Solve Large-Scale Integer Linear
   Programs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present a method that integrates any quantum algorithm capable of finding solutions to integer linear programs into the branch-and-price algorithm, which is regularly used to solve large-scale integer linear programs with a specific structure. The role of the quantum algorithm is to find integer solutions to subproblems appearing in branch-and-price. Obtaining optimal or near-optimal integer solutions to these subproblems can increase the quality of solutions and reduce the depth and branching factor of the branch-and-price algorithm and hence reduce the overall running time. We investigate the viability of the approach by considering the tail assignment problem and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Here, the master problem is the optimization problem set partitioning or its decision version exact cover and can be expressed as finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass Hamiltonian. For exact cover, our numerical results indicate that the required algorithm depth decreases with the number of feasible solutions for a given success probability of finding a feasible solution. For set partitioning, on the other hand, we find that for a given success probability of finding the optimal solution, the required algorithm depth can increase with the number of feasible solutions if the Hamiltonian is balanced poorly, which in the worst case is exponential in the problem size. We therefore address the significance of properly balancing the objective and constraint parts of the Hamiltonian. We empirically find that the approach is viable with QAOA if polynomial algorithm depth can be realized on quantum devices.

TI Parity Quantum Optimization: Encoding Constraints
SO QUANTUM
AB Constraints make hard optimization prob-lems even more challenging to solve on quan-tum devices because they are typically imple-mented with large energy penalties and addi-tional qubit overhead. The parity mapping, which has been introduced as an alternative to the spin encoding, translates the problem to a representation using parity variables that encode products of spin variables into a single parity variable. By combining exchange inter-action and single spin flip terms in the parity representation, constraints on sums, products of arbitrary k-body terms and sums over such products can be implemented without penalty terms in two-dimensional quantum systems.

TI Optimal reset of Zeeman disk qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Qubits in planar quantum disks can be controlled using magnetic fields. This provides a practical mechanism for qubit reset during operation. Then, the question arises: What reset protocol is the optimal one in terms of least dissipated heat? To answer this question, we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation for the dissipation rate of Zeeman disks with both soft and hard confinement. Exploiting the conserved Hamilton function reduces the complexity from solving nonlinear differential equations to purely algebraic ones. We also discuss practical constraints imposed by the maximal achievable drive. Finally, an approximate analytical protocol is devised and shown to be highly accurate.

Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we probe this interplay by measuring the charging energy (E-C) and the pairing energy (Delta) of individual Pb nanoislands. Below a critical island size, where E-C > Delta, we observe a crossover between even and odd parity ground states. By applying controlled voltage pulses, we continuously tune the island's electrostatic potential and map the full charge-parity landscape. These results demonstrate tunable superconducting ground states, offering a potential platform for qubit design and control.

TI Genetic algorithm optimization for storing arbitrary multimode
   transverse images in thermal atomic vapor
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Storing multimode transverse images in atomic media is crucial in constructing large-scale quantum networks. A major obstacle of storing transverse images in the thermal atomic vapor is the distortion of the retrieved images caused by atomic diffusion. Here, we demonstrate the combination of genetic algorithm with the phase-shift lithography method to construct the optimal phase for an arbitrary transverse image that can diminish the effect of diffusion. Theoretical simulations and experimental results manifest that the retrieved images' resolution can be substantially improved when carrying the optimal phases. Our scheme is efficient and straightforward and can be extensively applied in storing complex transverse multimodes in diffusion media.

TI On-chip integrated quantum emitter with 'trap-enhance-guide': a

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB To address the challenges of developing a scalable system of an on-chip integrated quantum emitter, we propose to leverage the loss in our hybrid plasmonic-photonic structure to simultaneously achieve Purcell enhancement as well as on-chip maneuvering of nanoscale emitter via optical trapping with guided excitation-emission routes. In this report, we have analyzed the feasibility of the functional goals of our proposed system in the metric of trapping strength (-8KBT), Purcell factor (>1000-), and collection efficiency (-10%). Once realized, the scopes of the proposed device can be advanced to develop a scalable platform for integrated quantum technology.

TI Rational design of efficient defect-based quantum emitters
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Single-photon emitters are an essential component of quantum networks, and defects or impurities in semiconductors are a promising platform to realize such quantum emitters. Here, we present a model that encapsulates the essential physics of coupling to phonons, which governs the behavior of real single-photon emitters, and critically evaluate several approximations that are commonly utilized. Emission in the telecom wavelength range is highly desirable, but our model shows that nonradiative processes are greatly enhanced at these low photon energies, leading to a decrease in efficiency. Our results suggest that reducing the phonon frequency is a fruitful avenue to enhance the efficiency.

TI Multimode Interference Induced Optical Routing in an Optical Microcavity
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The photonic router is a key device in optical communication and quantum networks. Here, the results of a study of multi-channel optical routing using optomechanical multimode interference in an optical microcavity are reported. The optomechanical system used here exhibits multi-optical modes and a mechanical mode. Optomechanical induced transparency and absorption appear in the system due to the interference between different paths. It is shown that the system can be served as a three-port routing in the red-detuned region to rout photons from the input port to an arbitrarily selected output port with high routing efficiency by controlling the parameters corresponding to different interference paths.

TI Nuclear Spin Squeezing in Helium-3 by Continuous Quantum Nondemolition

AB We propose a technique to control the macroscopic collective nuclear spin of a helium-3 gas in the quantum regime using light. The scheme relies on metastability exchange collisions to mediate interactions between optically accessible metastable states and the ground-state nuclear spin, giving rise to an effective nuclear spin-light quantum nondemolition interaction of the Faraday form. Our technique enables measurement-based quantum control of nuclear spins, such as the preparation of spin-squeezed states. This, combined with the day-long coherence time of nuclear spin states in helium-3, opens the possibility for a number of applications in quantum technology.

AB Quantum controlled-logic gates, including controlled NOT gate and Toffoli gate, play critical roles in lots of quantum information processing schemes. We design and experimentally demonstrate deterministic Toffoli gate by utilizing orbital-angular-momentum and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon. In addition, we generate Bell states by using the controlled NOT gate. The effective conversion rate of the Toffoli gate in our experiment is (95.1 +/- 3.2)%. Furthermore, our experimental setup does not require any auxiliary photons and probabilistic postselections.

AB We combine electron beam lithography and masked anodization of epitaxial aluminum to define tunnel junctions via selective oxidation, alleviating the need for wet-etch processing or direct deposition of dielectric materials. Applying this technique to define Josephson junctions in proximity-induced superconducting Al-InAs heterostructures, we observe multiple Andreev reflections in transport experiments, indicative of a high quality junction. We further compare the mobility and density of Hall-bars defined via wet etching and anodization. These results may find utility in uncovering better fabrication approaches to junction-based qubit platforms.

TI Non-Markovian noise that cannot be dynamically decoupled by periodic

AB Dynamical decoupling is the leading technique to remove unwanted interactions in a vast range of quantum systems through fast rotations. But what determines the timescale of such rotations in order to achieve good decoupling? By providing an explicit counterexample of a qubit coupled to a charged particle and magnetic monopole, we show that such time-scales cannot be decided by the decay profile induced by the noise: even though the system shows a quadratic decay (a Zeno region revealing non-Markovian noise), it cannot be decoupled by periodic spin echo pulses, no matter how fast the rotations.

TI Nonunitary entanglement dynamics in continuous-variable systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We construct random unitary Gaussian circuits for continuous-variable (CV) systems subject to Gaussian measurements. We show that when the measurement rate is nonzero, the steady-state entanglement entropy saturates to an area-law scaling. This is different from a many-body qubit system, where a generic entanglement transition is widely expected. Due to the unbounded local Hilbert space, the time scale to destroy entanglement is always much shorter than the one to build it, while a balance could be achieved for a finite local Hilbert space. By the same reasoning, the absence of transition should also hold for other nonunitary Gaussian CV dynamics.

Our findings indicate that the anti-Unruh effect can result in stronger delocalization of quantum information, as measured by tripartite mutual information (TMI). Additionally, we show that the W state is more stable than the GHZ state under the influence of uniformly accelerated motion. Lastly, we extend our analysis to N-partite entangled states and product states.

TI Efficient single-photon directional transfer between waveguides via two
   giant atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the single-photon transport properties in a double-waveguide quantum electrodynamic system. We force the energy degeneracy of the collective states by adjusting the direct coupling strength between the two giant atoms. Our results indicate that resonant photons can be completely transferred between the two waveguides owing to the scattering interference of eigenstates, which also results in the directional propagation of resonant photons in the output waveguide. Perfect transfer occurs when the two scattering states degenerate in the energy and decay rates. We further propose a simple scheme to realize the efficient photon transfer with directional control. This study has potential applications in quantum networks and integrated photonic circuits.

TI Protocols for counterfactual and twin-field quantum digital signatures

AB Quantum digital signature (QDS) is the quantum version of its classical counterpart and can offer security against attacks of repudiation, signature forging, and external eavesdropping on the basis of quantum -mechanical no-go principles. Here we propose a QDS scheme based on quantum counterfactuality, which leverages the concept of interaction -free measurement. Employing the idea behind twin -field cryptography, we show how this two-way protocol can be turned into an equivalent noncounterfactual, one-way protocol that is both more practical and also theoretically helpful in assessing the experimental feasibility of the first protocol. The proposed QDS protocol can be experimentally implemented with current quantum technology.

TI Quantum Sampling Algorithms for Near-Term Devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Efficient sampling from a classical Gibbs distribution is an important computational problem with applications ranging from statistical physics over Monte Carlo and optimization algorithms to machine learning. We introduce a family of quantum algorithms that provide unbiased samples by preparing a state encoding the entire Gibbs distribution. We show that this approach leads to a speedup over a classical Markov chain algorithm for several examples, including the Ising model and sampling from weighted independent sets of two different graphs. Our approach connects computational complexity with phase transitions, providing a physical interpretation of quantum speedup. Moreover, it opens the door to exploring potentially useful sampling algorithms on near-term quantum devices, as the algorithm for sampling from independent sets on certain graphs can be naturally implemented using Rydberg atom arrays.

AB The quantum optical response of antireflection temporal coatings (ATCs), that is, matching temporal layers that suppress the generation of backward waves in temporal boundaries, is investigated. The results reveal that quantum ATCs are characterized for inducing a frequency shift of the quantum state, while preserving all photon statistics intact. Thus, they can find application for fast quantum frequency shifting in photonic quantum networks. The quantum theory also provides additional insight on their classical mode of operation, clarifying which quantities are preserved through the temporal boundary. Last, it is shown that quantum ATCs allow for fast temporal switching without amplification of thermal fields.

TI Effect of the next-nearest-neighbor's interaction on the population
   transfer in a four-particle Landau-Zener system
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB The study of transition probabilities in few-body systems and their long-range interactions using the Landau-Zener method could be helpful for solving a wide range of problems in fields of quantum simulations, Rydberg blockade, quantum gates, and dipole transition in Rydberg atoms. Here, the transition probabilities for a four-particle system in a square-shaped lattice are studied by solving the many-body Landau-Zener Hamiltonian in the next-nearest-neighbor approximation. It is observed that the complete transition occurs for the anti-ferromagnetic coupling while it is limited to a constant probability for the ferromagnetic coupling. These probabilities suppress when the magnetic field's energy rate is increased. We demonstrate that in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor's interactions, the final probabilities' behavior is different. Considering the next-nearest-neighbor's interactions, it is possible to achieve the complete transition in imperfect anti-ferromagnetic regions. At the same time, the complete transition does not occur in perfect anti-ferromagnetic regions for certain values of the sweeping rate. These results emphasize that it is necessary to consider the next-nearest-neighbors' interactions in a many-body system. Furthermore, the implementation of this Hamiltonian in the dipole-dipole and van der Waals interaction reveals that a steeper decrease for dipole-dipole interaction.

TI Experimental demonstrations of unconditional security in a purely

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB So far, unconditional security in key distribution processes has been confined to quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols based on the no-cloning theorem of nonorthogonal bases. Recently, a completely different approach, the unconditionally secured classical key distribution (USCKD), has been proposed for unconditional security in the purely classical regime. Unlike QKD, both classical channels and orthogonal bases are key ingredients in USCKD, where unconditional security is provided by deterministic randomness via path superposition-based reversible unitary transformations in a coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Here, the first experimental demonstration of the USCKD protocol is presented.

AB Understanding the entanglement of radiation in quantum field theory has been a long-standing challenge, with implications ranging from black hole thermodynamics to quantum information. We demonstrate how the case of the free fermion in 1 + 1 dimensions reveals the details of the density matrix of the radiation produced by a moving mirror. Using the resolvent method rather than standard conformal field theory techniques we derive the R ' enyi entropies, modular Hamiltonian, and flow of the radiation and determine when mirrors generate unitary transformations.

TI Dynamical beats of short pulses in waveguide QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study weak pulse propagation through near-resonant collective media. The timescales of the pulse and the lifetime of the media are comparable. The transmitted pulse develops temporal oscillations, known as dynamical beats. We use a collection of 133Cs atoms randomly captured by a nanofiber-based optical lattice. An effective macroscopic model derived from a microscopic many-atom input-output theory reproduces the observations. The results deepen our understanding of single-photon pulse propagation, crucial for many waveguide QED-based quantum information protocols.

TI Implementation of a Quantum Addressable Router Using Superconducting
   Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The implementation of a quantum router capable of performing both quantum signal routing and quantum addressing (a Q2-router) represents a key step toward building quantum networks and quantum random access memories. We realize a Q2-router that uses fixed-frequency transmon qubits to implement a routing protocol based on two native controlled-iSWAP gates. These gates leverage a large ZZ interaction to selectively route information according to a quantum address. We find an estimated average routing fidelity of 95.3%, with errors arising primarily from decoherence or state preparation and measurement. We present a comprehensive calibration and characterization of both the c-iSWAP gates and the overall routing protocol through randomized benchmarking techniques and state tomography.

Here we report on a direct connection between the mechanism driving spin relaxation and the intertwined dynamics between spin and sublattice degrees of freedom in disordered graphene. Beyond having a direct observable consequence, such intraparticle entanglement is shown to be resilient to disorder, pointing towards a unique resource for quantum information processing.

TI Simulating and Mitigating Crosstalk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We describe an efficient and scalable framework for modeling crosstalk effects on quantum information processors. By applying optimal control techniques, we show how to tune-up arbitrary high-fidelity parallel operations on systems with substantial local and nonlocal crosstalk. As an example, we simulate a 2D square array of 100 superconducting transmon qubits. These results suggest that rather than striving to engineer away undesirable interactions during fabrication, we can largely mitigate such effects with software through careful characterization and control optimization.

TI Complete complementarity relations: Connections with
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen realism and decoherence, and extension to mixed
   quantum states
SO EPL
AB Wave-particle duality is an essential character of quantum systems. In the last few years, much progress has been made towards formally quantifying these quantum features. The properties of the quantum density matrix were shown to lead to duality inequalities for single-quanton mixed states and to triality identities, also known as complete complementarity relations (CCRs), for two-quanton pure states. In this article, we establish connections between CCRs and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (ir)realism, as formalized by Bilobran and Angelo (see BILOBRAN A. L. O. and Angelo R. M., EPL, 112 (2015) 40005). Besides, we show that, for tripartite pure states vertical bar psi(ABE)>, CCRs can be applied to obtain the system-environment entanglement of formation, E-f (rho(AE)), through the local information of a system A and its classical correlation with an auxiliary system B. Moreover, we discuss CCRs in the context of the emergence of the pointer basis in the decoherence process identified via the constancy of system-apparatus classical correlations. We also obtain CCRs for purified mixed bipartite quantum-classical states. In addition, we derive CCRs for mixed-bipartite two-qudit quantum states and discuss its interpretations.

TI Heat transport through a superconducting artificial atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum heat transfer through a generic superconducting setup consisting of a tunable transmon qubit placed between resonators that are terminated by thermal reservoirs is explored. Two types of architectures are considered: a sequential setting and a beam-splitter setting. Applying the numerical exact hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) approach, steady-state properties are revealed, and experimentally relevant parameter sets are identified. Benchmark results are compared with predictions based on approximate treatments to demonstrate their failure in broad ranges of parameter space. These findings may allow improved future designs for heat control in superconducting devices.

TI Size Control and Single-Photon Emission of CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Doped
   with Ammonium Bromide
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective All-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are ideal materials for high-quality single-photon sources in quantum information applications, as the performance of single-photon sources is closely related to the size of perovskite QDs. However, the lack of effective methods to reduce the size of CsPbX3 QDs remains one of the major obstacles to achieving single-photon emission. In this study, we employ an efficient and low-cost doping synthesis strategy, directly introducing ammonium bromide (NH4Br) into the lead precursor via the hot-injection method, successfully preparing CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs. By utilizing NH4Br to regulate crystal growth kinetics and passivate surface defects, we effectively suppress the Ostwald ripening process, significantly reducing the average size from the original 10.07 nm to 6.87 nm while improving size uniformity. The size reduction enhances the quantum confinement effect, leading to a blue shift in the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak from 520 nm (undoped) to 505 nm. Additionally, autocorrelation tests reveal that the g2(0) value of the doped QDs decreases from 0.45 to 0.22, which indicates a significant improvement in single-photon purity. We present an innovative and straightforward synthesis strategy, successfully producing CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs with a narrow size distribution. The incorporation of NH4Br enhances the single-photon purity of the QDs, which provides an ideal material system for single-photon emission applications and lays an important foundation for their commercialization. Methods In our study, CsPbBr3 QDs, and NH4Br-doped CsPbBr(3 )QDs are synthesized using the hot-injection method to achieve size reduction and improved size uniformity. The synthesis process consists of two main steps. Firstly, the cesium precursor is prepared by heating a mixture of cesium carbonate, oleic acid, and 1-octadecene in an inert atmosphere at 120 degrees C for 2 h, followed by increasing the temperature to 160 degrees C. The resulting solution is then cooled to room temperature and stored under sealed conditions. Secondly, the synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs and NH4Br-doped CsPbBr3 QDs is carried out by heating a mixture of lead bromide, ammonium bromide, oleic acid, oleylamine, and 1-octadecene in an inert atmosphere for 2 h, with the temperature raised to 150 degrees C. Subsequently, 0.4 mL of cesium oleate precursor is rapidly injected. After 5 s of reaction, the mixture is immediately cooled using an ice-water bath. Well-dispersed QD solutions are obtained by high-speed centrifugation. Throughout the synthesis process, QDs with different doping concentrations are prepared by controlling the amount of ammonium bromide added. Results and Discussions The prepared NH4Br-CsPbBr3 QDs, with the Br/Pb molar ratio less than 7, exhibit a distinct decreasing trend in particle size as the Br/Pb molar ratio increases. The average particle size of CsPbBr3 QDs significantly decreases from 10.07 to 6.87 nm, which results in a blue shift of the PL emission peak from 520 nm (undoped) to 505 nm (Br/Pb molar ratio is 7). Statistical analysis of the same number of grains further shows that the particle size distribution narrows from 4-19 nm to 5.5-9 nm, which confirms that ammonium bromide doping effectively improves the morphological uniformity of the QDs. However, when the Br/Pb molar ratio exceeds 7, excess ammonium bromide disrupts the controllability of the QD morphology, which leads to distortion of the cubic structure.
   Therefore, the effective doping range of ammonium bromide is limited to a Br/Pb molar ratio of less than or equal to 7. Furthermore, the doping of ammonium bromide strengthens the covalent bonding of Pb-Br, which enhances the stability of the QD crystal structure and increases the quantum yield of the QDs from 31.22 % to 61.65 %, while the fluorescence lifetime extends from 1.15 ns to 2.80 ns. The reduction in QD size induced by NH4Br doping enhances the quantum confinement effect. This enhanced quantum confinement leads to a more discrete energy level structure in the QDs, which significantly reduces the probability of multiphoton emission, thereby improving the purity of single-photon emission. After doping, the second-order autocorrelation function g2(0) of the QDs decreases from the original value of 0.45 to 0.22, which indicates that ammonium bromide doping effectively improves the single-photon emission purity of the QDs. Conclusions Our study systematically reveals the effect of NH4Br doping on the size control of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs, its intrinsic mechanisms, and the effect on single-photon properties. Experimental results show that within the doping concentration range where the Br/Pb molar ratio is less than or equal to 7, the QD size decreases in a regular pattern as the doping concentration increases, with the average particle size significantly reducing from 10.07 nm (undoped) to 6.87 nm (at a Br/Pb molar ratio of 7). More importantly, the uniformity of the doped QDs' size is improved, with the particle size distribution narrowing from 4-19 nm to 5.5-9 nm. This improvement primarily stems from the bromine-rich environment provided by ammonium bromide, which not only effectively fills the bromine vacancies on the QD surface [as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) quantitative analysis, showing an increase in the Br/Pb molar ratio from 3.85 to 4.21] but also narrows the size distribution by suppressing Ostwald ripening and through the synergistic coordination of NH4+ ions with the [PbBr6](4-)octahedral structure. We find that after doping, the g2(0) value of the QDs decreases from 0.45 to 0.22, which indicates that NH4Br doping helps improve the single-photon purity of the QDs. The innovative findings of this study open new avenues for the application of perovskite crystal QDs in single-photon sources, which is of great significance for advancing the development of single-photon technology in cutting-edge fields, such as quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum information processing.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical optimization with cardinality constraints and
   applications to finance
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work we develop tools to address combinatorial optimization problems with a cardinality constraint, in which only a subset of variables end up having nonzero values. Firstly, we introduce a new heuristic pruning method that iteratively discards variables through a hybrid quantum-classical optimization step. Secondly, we analyse the use of soft constraints in the form of 'chemical potentials' to control the number of non-zero variables. We illustrate the power of both techniques using the problem of index tracking, which aims to mimicking the performance of a financial index with a balanced subset of assets. We also compare the performance of different state-of-the-art quantum variational optimization algorithms in our pruning method.

TI Switchable silica waveguide XOR/XNOR directed logic gate based on
   E21-E11 mode conversion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical directed logic gates are in high demand for artificial intelligence, and optical and quantum computing applications. A silica waveguide XOR/XNOR optical logic gate based on cascaded Mach-Zehnder thermo-optic switches and multimode interference E21-E11 mode converter is demonstrated. When monochromatic light is input into the device, a complementary XOR/XNOR functional output in the form of light can be obtained by controlling the electrical Boolean inputs. The proposed design is fabricated on the CMOS compatible silica planar lightwave circuit platform. The experimental results proved that the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 10 dB over the entire C band. The proposed device with simple structure, large bandwidth, and versatility would be a promising candidate for information processing in optical wavelength division multiplexing and mode division multiplexing networks. It has good potential in arithmetic operations, parity checks, encryption, and decryption. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI High-coherence fluxonium qubits manufactured with a
   wafer-scale-uniformity process
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fluxonium qubits are recognized for their high coherence times and high operation fidelities. These are attributed to their unique design incorporating a superinductor, which is typically implemented using an array of over 100 Josephson junctions; however, this complexity poses significant fabrication challenges, particularly in achieving high yield and junction uniformity with traditional methods. Here, we introduce an overlap process for Josephson-junction fabrication that achieves nearly 100% yield and maintains uniformity across a 2-inch (50.8-mm) wafer with less than 5% variation for the phase-slip junction and less than 2% for the entire junction array. We use a compact junction array design that achieves stateof-the-art dielectric loss tangents and flux noise levels, as confirmed by multiple devices. This enables fluxonium qubits to reach energy relaxation times exceeding 1 ms at the flux-frustration point. This work paves the way for scalable, high-coherence fluxonium processors using processes compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor manufacturing, marking a significant step toward practical quantum computing.

TI Extending the variational quantum eigensolver to finite temperatures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a variational quantum thermalizer (VQT), called quantum-VQT (qVQT), which extends the variational quantum eigensolver to finite temperatures. The qVQT makes use of an intermediate measurement between two variational circuits to encode a density matrix on a quantum device. A classical optimization provides the thermal state and, simultaneously, all associated excited states of a quantum mechanical system. We demonstrate the capabilities of the qVQT for two different spin systems. First, we analyze the performance of qVQT as a function of the circuit depth and the temperature for a one-dimensional Heisenberg chain. Second, we use the excited states to map the complete, temperature dependent phase diagram of a two-dimensional J1-J2 Heisenberg model. Numerical experiments on both quantum simulators and real quantum hardware demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, which can be readily applied to study various quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures on currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI A computational framework for guiding the MOCVD-growth of wafer-scale 2D
   materials
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Reproducible wafer-scale growth of two-dimensional (2D) materials using the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process with precise control over their properties is challenging due to a lack of understanding of the growth mechanisms spanning over several length scales and sensitivity of the synthesis to subtle changes in growth conditions. A multiscale computational framework coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Phase-Field (PF), and reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) was developed - called the CPM model - and experimentally verified. Correlation between theoretical predictions and thorough experimental measurements for a Metal-Organic CVD (MOCVD)-grown WSe2 model material revealed the full power of this computational approach. Large-area uniform 2D materials are synthesized via MOCVD, guided by computational analyses. The developed computational framework provides the foundation for guiding the synthesis of wafer-scale 2D materials with precise control over the coverage, morphology, and properties, a critical capability for fabricating electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum computing devices.

TI Role of critical thickness in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructure design for
   qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We study the critical thickness for the plastic relaxation of the Si quantum well layer embedded in a SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructure for qubits by plan-view transmission electron microscopy and electron channeling contrast imaging. Misfit dislocation segments form due to the glide of pre-existing threading dislocations at the interface of the Si quantum well layer beyond a critical thickness given by the Matthews-Blakeslee criterion. Misfit dislocations are mostly 60 & DEG; dislocations (b=a/2 ) that are split into Shockely partials (b=a/6 ) due to the tensile strain field of the Si quantum well layer. By reducing the quantum well thickness below critical thickness, misfit dislocations can be suppressed. A simple model is applied to simulate the misfit dislocation formation and the blocking process. We discuss consequences of our findings for the layer stack design of SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures for usage in quantum computing hardware. (C) The Author(s) 2022.

TI Randomized benchmarking in the presence of time-correlated dephasing
   noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) has emerged as a popular and easy-to-implement experimental technique for gauging the quality of gate operations in quantum computing devices. A typical randomized benchmarking procedure identifies the exponential decay in the fidelity as the benchmarking sequence of gates increases in length, and the decay rate is used to estimate the fidelity of the gate. Our current theory of RB, based on the assumption of time-independent or static noise in the gates, predicts an exponential decay in the fidelity. Observed deviations from the standard exponential decay are usually attributed to some amount of time correlations in the noise, though the precise mechanisms for deviation have yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we examine this question of randomized benchmarking for time-correlated noise-specifically for time-correlated dephasing noise for exact solvability-and elucidate the circumstances in which a deviation from exponential decay can be expected, as well as point out situations where exponential decay prevails despite the presence of time correlations.

Monolayers of endohedral fullerene functionalized with pyrene exhibit magnetic bistability up to a temperature of 28 K. The use of pyrene terminated linker molecules opens the way to devise integration of spin carrying units encapsulated by fullerene cages on graphitic substrates, be it single-molecule magnets or qubit candidates.

TI Entanglement quantification enhanced by dark count correction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we propose a method of dark count correction in quantum state tomography of entangled photon pairs. The framework is based on a linear model of dark counts, which is imposed on the measurement formalism. The method is tested on empirical data derived from an experiment on polarization-entangled photons. We demonstrate that the numerical approach to dark count correction guarantees more reliable state reconstruction compared with standard estimation. Most importantly, however, the conceptually simple theoretical approach proves to be more efficient at entanglement quantification than experimental techniques.

TI Single Photon Emitters in Thin GaAsN Nanowire Tubes Grown on Si
SO ACS NANO
AB III-V nanowire heterostructures can act as sources of single and entangled photons and are enabling technologies for on-chip applications in future quantum photonic devices. The peculiar geometry of nanowires allows to integrate lattice-mismatched components beyond the limits of planar epilayers and to create radially and axially confined quantum structures. Here, we report the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth of thin GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs core-multishell nanowires monolithically integrated on Si (111) substrates, overcoming the challenges caused by the low solubility of N and a high lattice mismatch. The nanowires have a GaAsN shell of 10 nm containing 2.7% N, which reduces the GaAs bandgap drastically by 400 meV. They have a symmetric core-shell structure with sharp boundaries and a defect-free zincblende phase. The high structural quality reflects in their excellent optical properties. Local N% fluctuations and radial confinement give rise to quantum dot-like states in the thin GaAsN shell, which display remarkable single photon emission with a second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay as low as 0.05 in continuous and in pulsed excitation.

TI Do photosynthetic complexes use quantum coherence to increase their
   efficiency? Probably not
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Answering the titular question has become a central motivation in the field of quantum biology, ever since the idea was raised following a series of experiments demonstrating wave-like behavior in photosynthetic complexes. Here, we report a direct evaluation of the effect of quantum coherence on the efficiency of three natural complexes. An open quantum systems approach allows us to simultaneously identify their level of "quantumness" and efficiency, under natural physiological conditions. We show that these systems reside in a mixed quantum-classical regime, characterized by dephasing-assisted transport. Yet, we find that the change in efficiency at this regime is minute at best, implying that the presence of quantum coherence does not play a substantial role in enhancing efficiency. However, in this regime, efficiency is independent of any structural parameters, suggesting that evolution may have driven natural complexes to their parameter regime to "design" their structure for other uses.

TI Spatial quantum-interference landscapes of multi-site-controlled quantum
   dots coupled to extended photonic cavity modes
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB A compact platform to integrate emitters in a cavity-like support is to embed quantum dots (QDs) in a photonic crystal (PhC) structure, making them promising candidates for integrated quantum photonic circuits. The emission properties of QDs can be modified by tailored photonic structures, relying on the Purcell effect or strong light-matter interactions. However, the effects of photonic states on spatial features of exciton emissions in these systems are rarely explored. Such effect is difficult to access due to random positions of self-assembled QDs in PhC structures, and the fact that quantum well excitons' wavefunctions resemble photonic states in a conventional distributed Bragg reflector cavity system. In this work, we instead observe a spatial signature of exciton emission using site-controlled QDs embedded in PhC cavities. In particular, we observe the detuning-dependent spatial repulsion of the QD exciton emissions by polarized imaging of the micro-photoluminescence, dependent on the controlled QD's position in a spatially extended photonic pattern. The observed effect arises due to the quantum interference between QD decay channel in a spatially-extended cavity mode. Our findings suggest that integration of site-controlled QDs in tailored photonic structures can enable spatially distributed single-photon sources and photon switches.

TI Enhanced valley polarization in MoS2via
   substrate-induced strain and transition dipole moment modulation
SO NANOSCALE
AB Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising materials for valleytronic and quantum photonic applications due to their valley-selective optical transitions. However, tailoring and enhancing valley polarization remains a challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive helicity-resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (HR-TAS) study of large-area monolayer MoS2, comparing the as-grown and substrate-transferred samples to uncover the impact of strain and defect engineering on valley depolarization dynamics. Our measurements reveal that the degree of polarization (DOP) and the valley lifetime are significantly enhanced in transferred MoS2, with a pronounced dependence on excitation fluence and temperature. We attribute this enhancement to a combination of strain-induced symmetry breaking, defect-induced carrier localization, and reduced intervalley scattering via the Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Supported by first-principles calculations, we identify a novel contribution from spin-dependent transition dipole moments (TDMs), which further boosts valley selectivity in strained MoS2 on quartz substrates. This study provides an experimental and theoretical correlation of TDM modulation with enhanced valley polarization in transferred MoS2. Our findings offer a pathway to enable new design principles for spin-valley-coupled optoelectronics applications through substrate and strain engineering.

TI Non-Volatile Reconfigurable Integrated Photonics Enabled by Broadband
   Low-Loss Phase Change Material
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Phase change materials (PCMs) have long been used as a storage medium in rewritable compact disk and later in random access memory. In recent years, integration of PCMs with nanophotonic structures has introduced a new paradigm for non-volatile reconfigurable optics. However, the high loss of the archetypal PCM Ge2Sb2Te5 in both visible and telecommunication wavelengths has fundamentally limited its applications. Sb2S3 has recently emerged as a wide-bandgap PCM with transparency windows ranging from 610 nm to near-IR. In this paper, the strong optical phase modulation and low optical loss of Sb2S3 are experimentally demonstrated for the first time in integrated photonic platforms at both 750 and 1550 nm. As opposed to silicon, the thermo-optic coefficient of Sb2S3 is shown to be negative, making the Sb2S3-Si hybrid platform less sensitive to thermal fluctuation. Finally, a Sb2S3 integrated non-volatile microring switch is demonstrated which can be tuned electrically between a high and low transmission state with a contrast over 30 dB. This work experimentally verifies prominent phase modification and low loss of Sb2S3 in wavelength ranges relevant for both solid-state quantum emitter and telecommunication, enabling potential applications such as optical field programmable gate array, post-fabrication trimming, and large-scale integrated quantum photonic network.

TI Topological materials for near-field radiative heat transfer
SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS
AB Topological materials provide a platform that utilizes the geometric characteristics of structured materials to control the flow of waves, enabling unidirectional and protected transmission that is immune to defects or impurities. The topologically designed photonic materials can carry quantum states and electromagnetic energy, benefiting nanolasers or quantum photonic systems. This article reviews recent advances in the topological applications of photonic materials for radiative heat transfer, especially in the near field. When the separation distance between media is considerably smaller than the thermal wavelength, the heat transfer exhibits superPlanckian behavior that surpasses Planck's blackbody predictions. Near-field thermal radiation in subwavelength systems supporting surface modes has various applications, including nanoscale thermal management and energy conversion. Photonic materials and structures that support topological surface states show immense potential for enhancing or suppressing near-field thermal radiation. We present various topological effects, such as periodic and quasi-periodic nanoparticle arrays, Dirac and Weyl semimetal-based materials, structures with broken global symmetries, and other topological insulators, on near-field heat transfer. Also, the possibility of realizing near-field thermal radiation in such topological materials for alternative thermal management and heat flux guiding in nano-scale systems is discussed based on the existing technology.

First, it reviews and generalizes different results on the data and model complexity of quantum learning, where the data and/or the algorithm can be quantum, focusing on information-theoretic techniques. Second, it introduces the notion of copy complexity, which quantifies the number of copies of a quantum state required to achieve a target accuracy level. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. As a result, empirical risk minimization is generally inapplicable. The paper presents novel results on the copy complexity for both training and testing. To make the paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, an extensive background material is provided on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, the differences between quantum and classical learning are highlighted by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and extensive pointers are provided to the literature.
   The statistical performance of quantum learning is investigated as a function of the number of training data N$N$, and of the number of copies available for each quantum state in the training and testing data sets, respectively S$S$ and V$V$. Indeed, the biggest difference in quantum learning comes from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which limits the amount of information that can be extracted with few copies. image

TI BAM-Net: Hardware Friendly Associative Memory Using Binary Dominant
   Weights and NAND Logic
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents BAM-Net, a hardware-efficient binarization algorithm designed for associative memory (AM) implementation. BAM-Net aims to reduce memory overhead, power consumption, and implementation complexity. Motivated by the observation that the largest positive weight in each row of a Hebbian-trained weight matrix dominates the recall process, the proposed approach retains only this maximum weight per row. This yields a highly sparse binary matrix containing only 0 and +1 values. The resulting simplification enables the exclusive use of standard NAND gates in hardware implementation, thereby eliminating the need for multi-level weight storage or complex arithmetic operations. Experimental results on synthetic $7\times 5$ pattern recall and the binarized MNIST dataset demonstrate that BAM-Net achieves superior recall accuracy, up to 96.2% and 92.7% respectively, while reducing memory usage by over 50% compared to state-of-the-art quantum, photonic, and quantized AM models. The proposed method converges in fewer recall attempts and exhibits excellent scalability, making it well suited for low-power, real-time, and resource-constrained hardware applications.

TI Quantum chaos and circuit parameter optimization
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB We consider quantum chaos diagnostics of the variational circuit states at random parameters and explore their connection to the circuit expressibility and optimizability. By measuring the operator spreading coefficient and the eigenvalue spectrum of the modular Hamiltonian of the reduced density matrix, we identify the emergence of universal random matrix ensembles in high-depth circuit states. The diagnostics that use the eigenvalue spectrum, e.g. operator spreading and entanglement entropy, turn out to be more accurate measures of the variational quantum algorithm optimization efficiency than those that use the level spacing distribution of the entanglement spectrum, such as r-statistics or spectral form factors.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for efficiently solving the eigenvalue problem of many-particle Hamiltonians on quantum computers with limited resources by splitting the workload between classical and quantum processors. This algorithm reduces the needed number of qubits at the expense of an increased number of quantum evaluations. We demonstrate the method for the Hubbard model and show how the conservation of the z component of the total spin allows the spin-up and spin-down configurations to be computed on classical and quantum hardware, respectively. Other symmetries can be exploited in a similar manner.

TI Programmable on-chip nonlinear photonics
SO NATURE
AB Nonlinear optics1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical2, 3, 4-5 and quantum6, 7-8. However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication9, restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of chi(2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced chi(2) (refs. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15-16), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device-one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable-such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources7,17, 18-19, all-optical signal processing20, optical computation21 and adaptive structured light for sensing22, 23-24.

TI Thin-film lithium niobate-based detector: recent advances and
   perspectives
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC SCIENCE
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a powerful platform for integrated photonics, offering outstanding electro-optic, nonlinear optical, and ferroelectric properties. These unique material characteristics have opened new opportunities for developing high-performance photodetectors with broad spectral response, high sensitivity, and compact integration. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in TFLN-based detectors, focusing on the underlying physical mechanisms and diverse device architectures. We first discuss the spontaneous polarization, bulk photovoltaic effect, and pyroelectric effect and frequency up-conversion in lithium niobate, which enable unconventional lightto-electricity conversion without external bias. Then, we introduce heterogeneously integrated photodetectors that combine TFLN with III-V semiconductors, silicon, and two-dimensional materials, under both free-space illumination and waveguide coupling configurations. We further highlight advances in integrating single-photon detectors on TFLN platforms, a key step toward scalable quantum photonic systems. In addition, we discuss the direct modification strategies such as ferroelectric domain engineering, doping, and ion implantation modification to enhance the photodetection performance of TFLN devices. Finally, we summarize the existing challenges and present perspectives on the future development of multifunctional, low-power, and quantum-compatible photodetectors based on the TFLN platform.

TI Solution of SAT problems with the adaptive-bias quantum approximate
   optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising method for solving certain classical combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices. When employing the QAOA to 3-SAT and Max-3-SAT problems, the quantum cost exhibits an easy-hard-easy or easy-hard pattern, respectively, as the clause density is changed. The quantum resources needed in the hard-region problems are out of reach for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show by numerical simulations with up to 14 variables and analytical arguments that the adaptive-bias QAOA (ab-QAOA) greatly improves performance in the hard region of the 3-SAT problems and hard region of the Max-3-SAT problems. For similar accuracy, on average, ab-QAOA needs 3 levels for 10-variable 3-SAT problems as compared to 22 for QAOA. For 10-variable Max-3-SAT problems, the numbers are 7 levels and 62 levels. The improvement comes from a more targeted and more limited generation of entanglement during the evolution. We demonstrate that classical optimization is not strictly necessary in the ab-QAOA since local fields are used to guide the evolution. This leads us to propose an optimization-free ab-QAOA that can solve the hard-region 3-SAT and Max-3-SAT problems effectively with significantly fewer quantum gates as compared to the original ab-QAOA. Our work paves the way for realizing quantum advantages for optimization problems on NISQ devices.

TI Agile meets quantum: a novel genetic algorithm model for predicting the
   success of quantum software development project
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Quantum software systems represent a new realm in software engineering, utilizing quantum bits (Qubits) and quantum gates (Qgates) to solve the complex problems more efficiently than classical counterparts. Agile software development approaches are considered to address many inherent challenges in quantum software development, but their effective integration remains unexplored. This study investigates key causes of challenges that could hinders the adoption of traditional agile approaches in quantum software projects and develop an Agile-Quantum Software Project Success Prediction Model (AQSSPM). Firstly, we identified 19 causes of challenging factors discussed in our previous study, which are potentially impacting agile-quantum project success. Secondly, a survey was conducted to collect expert opinions on these causes and applied Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop the AQSSPM. Utilizing GA with NBC, project success probability improved from 53.17 to 99.68%, with cost reductions from 0.463 to 0.403%. Similarly, GA with LR increased success rates from 55.52 to 98.99%, and costs decreased from 0.496 to 0.409% after 100 iterations. Both methods result showed a strong positive correlation (rs = 0.955) in causes ranking, with no significant difference between them (t = 1.195, p = 0.240 > 0.05). The AQSSPM highlights critical focus areas for efficiently and successfully implementing agile-quantum projects considering the cost factor of a particular project.

TI Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Absorption in Fused-Ring Aromatic
   Donor-Acceptor-Donor Core Units of Y6 Derivatives
SO MOLECULES
AB This fundamental understanding of molecular structure-NLO property relationships provides critical design principles for next-generation optical limiting materials, quantum photonic devices, and ultrafast nonlinear optical switches, addressing the growing demand for high-performance organic optoelectronic materials in laser protection and photonic computing applications. In this study, it was observed that selenophene-incorporated fused D-A-D architectures exhibit a remarkable enhancement in two-photon absorption characteristics. By strategically modifying the heteroatomic composition of the Y6-derived fused-ring core, replacing thiophene (BDS) with selenophene (BDSe), the optimized system achieves unprecedented NLO performance. BDSe displays a nonlinear absorption coefficient (beta) of 3.32 x 10-10 m/W and an effective two-photon absorption cross-section (sigma TPA) of 2428.2 GM under 532 nm with ns pulse excitation. Comprehensive characterization combining Z-scan measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveals that the heavy atom effect of selenium induces enhanced spin-orbit coupling, optimized intramolecular charge transfer dynamics and stabilized excited states, collectively contributing to the superior reverse saturable absorption behavior. It is believed that this molecular engineering strategy establishes critical structure-property relationships for the rational design of organic NLO materials.

TI Combining electron spin resonance spectroscopy with scanning tunneling
   microscopy at high magnetic fields
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB The continuous increase in storage densities and the desire for quantum memories and computers push the limits of magnetic characterization techniques. Ultimately, a tool that is capable of coherently manipulating and detecting individual quantum spins is needed. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is the only technique that unites the prerequisites of high spatial and energy resolution, low temperature, and high magnetic fields to achieve this goal. Limitations in the available frequency range for electron spin resonance STM (ESR-STM) mean that many instruments operate in the thermal noise regime. We resolve challenges in signal delivery to extend the operational frequency range of ESR-STM by more than a factor of two and up to 100 GHz, making the Zeeman energy the dominant energy scale at achievable cryogenic temperatures of a few hundred millikelvin. We present a general method for augmenting existing instruments into ESR-STM to investigate spin dynamics in the high-field limit. We demonstrate the performance of the instrument by analyzing inelastic tunneling in a junction driven by a microwave signal and provide proof of principle measurements for ESR-STM.

TI Influence of Rhenium Concentration on Charge Doping and Defect Formation
   in MoS2
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Substitutionally doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are essential for advancing TMD-based field effect transistors, sensors, and quantum photonic devices. However, the impact of local dopant concentrations and dopant-dopant interactions on charge doping and defect formation within TMDs remains underexplored. Here, a breakthrough understanding of the influence of rhenium (Re) concentration is presented on charge doping and defect formation in MoS2 monolayers grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). It is shown that Re-MoS2 films exhibit reduced sulfur-site defects, consistent with prior reports. However, as the Re concentration approaches (sic)2 atom%, significant clustering of Re in the MoS2 is observed. Ab Initio calculations indicate that the transition from isolated Re atoms to Re clusters increases the ionization energy of Re dopants, thereby reducing Re-doping efficacy. Using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, it is shown that Re dopant clustering creates defect states that trap photogenerated excitons within the MoS2 lattice, resulting in broad sub-gap emission. These results provide critical insights into how the local concentration of metal dopants influences carrier density, defect formation, and exciton recombination in TMDs, offering a novel framework for designing future TMD-based devices with improved electronic and photonic properties.

TI Activation of telecom emitters in silicon upon ion implantation and ns
   pulsed laser annealing
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Recent demonstrations of optically active telecom emitters show that silicon is a compelling candidate for solid-state quantum photonic platforms. In particular, the fabrication of a defect known as the G center has been shown in carbon-rich silicon upon conventional thermal annealing. However, the high-yield controlled fabrication of these emitters at the wafer scale still requires the identification of a suitable thermodynamic pathway enabling its activation following ion implantation. Here we demonstrate the activation of G centers in high-purity silicon substrates upon nanosecond pulsed laser annealing. The proposed method enables non-invasive, localized activation of G centers by the supply of short non-stationary pulses, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional rapid thermal annealing related to the structural metastability of the emitters. A finite-element analysis highlights the strong non-stationarity of the technique, offering radically different defect-engineering capabilities with respect to conventional longer thermal treatments, paving the way to the direct and controlled fabrication of emitters embedded in integrated photonic circuits and waveguides.
   Defected silicon has uses in optically active telecom emitters. Here, nanosecond pulsed laser annealing is demonstrated as a non-invasive, localized method to activate the defects in high-purity silicon substrates.

TI Identifying Chern numbers of superconductors from local measurements
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Fascination in topological materials originates from their remarkable response properties and exotic quasiparticles which can be utilized in quantum technologies. In particular, large-scale efforts are currently focused on realizing topological superconductors and their Majorana excitations. However, determining the topological nature of superconductors with current experimental probes is an outstanding challenge. This shortcoming has become increasingly pressing due to rapidly developing designer platforms which are theorized to display very rich topology and are better accessed by local probes rather than transport experiments. We introduce a robust machine learning protocol for classifying the topological states of two-dimensional (2D) chiral superconductors and insulators from local density of states (LDOS) data. Since the LDOS can be measured with standard experimental techniques, our protocol contributes to overcoming the almost three decades standing problem of identifying the topological phase of 2D superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry.

TI Design of a wideband metamaterial absorber for optical wavelength
   applications based on the quantum-inspired Hadamard matrix
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Attaining broadband absorption with a simple-designed photonic absorber is still considered a complex and daunting task. The Hadamard matrix has been a well-known concept for designing quantum gates in quantum mechanics and computing. Despite a series of noteworthy works being done with regard to the design of metamaterial absorbers, very few works exist in literature where a quantum-inspired design has been employed to design a metamaterial-based photonic absorber. In this work, we have demonstrated a polarization-insensitive ultrathin and wideband metamaterial (MM) absorber based on the pattern distribution of the Hadamard matrix. Within the optical domain, the demonstrated MM absorber showcases absorption of over 91% for both transverse electric (TE) mode and transverse magnetic (TM) mode. To explore the angular dependence on absorption features of our Hadamard matrix meta-absorber (HMMA), both TE and TM modes have been used at numerous incident-angles. Finite integration technique has been utilized to simulate the demonstrated MM absorber design and validated using the interference theory model to assure the simulated data. Moreover, electric and magnetic field characteristics, current distributions, and a plethora of parametric sweeps have also been investigated in order to better understand the suggested HMMA absorption mechanism. Because of its wideband absorption and polarization-insensitive characteristic, this MM absorber based on the Hadamard matrix arrangement permits a variety of applications such as light detectors, optical-sensors, magnetic resonance imaging, plasmonic-sensors, and thermal imaging applications.

TI Novel Photonic Applications of Silicon Carbide
SO MATERIALS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is emerging rapidly in novel photonic applications thanks to its unique photonic properties facilitated by the advances of nanotechnologies such as nanofabrication and nanofilm transfer. This review paper will start with the introduction of exceptional optical properties of silicon carbide. Then, a key structure, i.e., silicon carbide on insulator stack (SiCOI), is discussed which lays solid fundament for tight light confinement and strong light-SiC interaction in high quality factor and low volume optical cavities. As examples, microring resonator, microdisk and photonic crystal cavities are summarized in terms of quality (Q) factor, volume and polytypes. A main challenge for SiC photonic application is complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and low-loss material growth. The state-of-the-art SiC with different polytypes and growth methods are reviewed and a roadmap for the loss reduction is predicted for photonic applications. Combining the fact that SiC possesses many different color centers with the SiCOI platform, SiC is also deemed to be a very competitive platform for future quantum photonic integrated circuit applications. Its perspectives and potential impacts are included at the end of this review paper.

TI Algorithmic Ground-State Cooling of Weakly Coupled Oscillators Using
   Quantum Logic
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The majority of ions and other charged particles of spectroscopic interest lack the fast, cycling transitions that are necessary for direct laser cooling. In most cases, they can still be cooled sympathetically through their Coulomb interaction with a second, coolable ion species confined in the same potential. If the chargeto-mass ratios of the two ion types are too mismatched, the cooling of certain motional degrees of freedom becomes difficult. This limits both the achievable fidelity of quantum gates and the spectroscopic accuracy. Here, we introduce a novel algorithmic cooling protocol for transferring phonons from poorly to efficiently cooled modes. We demonstrate it experimentally by simultaneously bringing two motional modes of a Be thorn -Ar13 thorn mixed Coulomb crystal close to their zero-point energies, despite the weak coupling between the ions. We reach the lowest temperature reported for a highly charged ion, with a residual temperature of only T less than or similar to 200 mu K in each of the two modes, corresponding to a residual mean motional phonon number of hni less than or similar to 0.4. Combined with the lowest observed electric-field noise in a radio-frequency ion trap, these values enable an optical clock based on a highly charged ion with fractional systematic uncertainty below the 10-18 level. Our scheme is also applicable to (anti)protons, molecular ions, macroscopic charged particles, and other highly charged ion species, enabling reliable preparation of their motional quantum ground states in traps.

TI Coupling capacity in C*-algebras
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH SECTION A-MATHEMATICS
AB Given two unital C*-algebras equipped with states and a positive operator in the enveloping von Neumann algebra of their minimal tensor product, we define three parameters that measure the capacity of the operator to align with a coupling of the two given states. Further, we establish a duality formula that shows the equality of two of the parameters for operators in the minimal tensor product of the relevant C*-algebras. In the context of abelian C*-algebras, our parameters are related to quantitative versions of Arveson's null set theorem and to dualities considered in the theory of optimal transport. On the other hand, restricting to matrix algebras we recover and generalize quantum versions of Strassen's theorem. We show that in the latter case our parameters can detect maximal entanglement and separability.

TI Gaussian Boson Sampling with Pseudo-Photon-Number-Resolving Detectors
   and Quantum Computational Advantage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report new Gaussian boson sampling experiments with pseudo-photon-number-resolving detection, which register up to 255 photon-click events. We consider partial photon distinguishability and develop a more complete model for the characterization of the noisy Gaussian boson sampling. In the quantum computational advantage regime, we use Bayesian tests and correlation function analysis to validate the samples against all current classical spoofing mockups. Estimating with the best classical algorithms to date, generating a single ideal sample from the same distribution on the supercomputer Frontier would take similar to 600 yr using exact methods, whereas our quantum computer, Jiuzhang 3.0, takes only 1.27 mu s to produce a sample. Generating the hardest sample from the experiment using an exact algorithm would take Frontier similar to 3.1 x 10(10) yr.

TI Calculation of Gibbs partition function with imaginary time evolution on
   near-term quantum computers
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The Gibbs partition function is an important quantity in describing statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. There are several proposals to calculate the partition functions on near-term quantum computers. However, the existing schemes require many copies of the Gibbs states to perform an extrapolation for the calculation of the partition function, which could be costly performed on the near-term quantum computers. We propose a scheme to calculate the Gibbs function with the imaginary time evolution. After preparing Gibbs states with different temperatures by using the imaginary time evolution, we measure the overlap between them on a quantum circuit, which allows us to calculate the Gibbs partition function. Our scheme requires only 2N qubits to calculate the Gibbs function of N qubits.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical unsupervised data clustering based on the
   self-organizing feature map
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Unsupervised machine learning is one of the main techniques employed in artificial intelligence. We introduce an algorithm for quantum-assisted unsupervised data clustering using the self-organizing feature map, a type of artificial neural network. The complexity of our algorithm scales as O(LN), in comparison to the classical case which scales as O(LMN), where N is the number of samples, M is the number of randomly sampled cluster vectors, and L is the number of the shifts of cluster vectors. We perform a proof-of-concept demonstration of one of the central components on the IBM quantum computer and show that it allows us to reduce the number of calculations in the number of clusters. Our algorithm exhibits exponential decrease in the errors of the distance matrix with the number of runs of the algorithm.

TI A hybrid classical-quantum approach to speed-up Q-learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We introduce a classical-quantum hybrid approach to computation, allowing for a quadratic performance improvement in the decision process of a learning agent. Using the paradigm of quantum accelerators, we introduce a routine that runs on a quantum computer, which allows for the encoding of probability distributions. This quantum routine is then employed, in a reinforcement learning set-up, to encode the distributions that drive action choices. Our routine is well-suited in the case of a large, although finite, number of actions and can be employed in any scenario where a probability distribution with a large support is needed. We describe the routine and assess its performance in terms of computational complexity, needed quantum resource, and accuracy. Finally, we design an algorithm showing how to exploit it in the context of Q-learning.

TI NTRU-Based Fully Homomorphic Signature
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Although the fully homomorphic signature (FHS) has made great progress, the low efficiency of existing FHS schemes as one main drawback cannot reach the requirements in practical application. It is well known that Number-eory-Research-Unit (NTRU)-based cryptography is not only considered to be resistant to the quantum computer but also has high efficiency compared with the standard lattice-based cryptographic systems. In this paper, our goal is to construct a simple and highly efficient FHS scheme. To this end, we first devise an NTRU-based homomorphic trapdoor function (HTDF), which is more effective than the one proposed by Gorbunov et al. (STOC 2015). We then convert it into an efficient NTRU-based FHS scheme. Additionally, the HTDF we constructed is not only collision-resistant but is also claw-free, resulting in our FHS scheme is being strongly unforgeable.

TI Compact integrated design of a low-loss silicon nitride grating coupler
   based on apodized quasi-bound states in the continuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Grating couplers are key components for realizing optical interconnection between photonic integrated circuits and optical fibers. The coupling efficiency mainly depends on the spatial overlap between fiber modes and grating near-fields, which is fundamentally determined by apodized grating structures. However, existing apodized methods have limitations in directional enhancement and are still suboptimal in achieving peak efficiency. In this study, we propose a compact, low-loss silicon nitride grating coupler, which features an integrated design of apodized gratings and quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) gratings. It incorporates bottom distributed Bragg reflectors (Bottom-DBR) and side distributed Bragg reflectors (Side-DBR) to enhance coupling efficiency, maintaining high directionality and ideal mode matching while having a compact device area. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results show that this novel design achieves a high coupling efficiency of-0.33 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 25 nm while the footprint scale of the whole device is less than 10 micrometers. Our device is designed for a wavelength of 934 nm and is intended for use in hybrid quantum photonic integrated circuits with single-photon light sources.

TI Conditional quantum plasmonic sensing
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The possibility of using weak optical signals to perform sensing of delicate samples constitutes one of the main goals of quantum photonic sensing. Furthermore, the nanoscale confinement of electromagnetic near fields in photonic platforms through surface plasmon polaritons has motivated the development of highly sensitive quantum plasmonic sensors. Despite the enormous potential of plasmonic platforms for sensing, this class of sensors is ultimately limited by the quantum statistical fluctuations of surface plasmons. Indeed, the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field severely limit the performance of quantum plasmonic sensing platforms in which delicate samples are characterized using weak near-field signals. Furthermore, the inherent losses associated with plasmonic fields levy additional constraints that challenge the realization of sensitivities beyond the shot-noise limit. Here, we introduce a protocol for quantum plasmonic sensing based on the conditional detection of plasmons. We demonstrate that the conditional detection of plasmonic fields, via plasmon subtraction, provides a new degree of freedom to control quantum fluctuations of plasmonic fields. This mechanism enables improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of photonic sensors relying on plasmonic signals that are comparable to their associated field fluctuations. Consequently, the possibility of using weak plasmonic signals to sense delicate samples, while preserving the sample properties, has important implications for molecule sensing, and chemical detection.

TI A Quantum-Based Machine Learning Approach for Autism Detection Using
   Common Spatial Patterns of EEG Signals
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) significantly impacts social communication, interaction, and behavior. Early diagnosis and timely intervention can improve outcomes by enabling tailored therapeutic strategies. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a non-invasive tool to capture brain activity and facilitate the early detection of ASD using machine learning techniques. However, attaining high accuracy with minimal EEG channels remains a challenge. This study analyzed EEG data from 10 children with ASD and 10 Typically Developed (TD) children using three electrode combinations: C3-C4, C3-Cz, and C4-Cz. EEG signals were spatially filtered using a wavelet-based regularized filter bank common spatial pattern. Key features, including peak-to-peak amplitude, were extracted, and correlation-based feature selection identified the most informative features. Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) identified the C4-Cz pair as the most effective, achieving the highest accuracy. Further analysis applied Neural Networks (NN), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM), and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) to classify data from the C4-Cz pair. QSVM with amplitude embedding feature map outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 94.7%. Performance was further improved by incorporating an enhanced feature set comprising peak frequency, Stockwell transform coefficients, and peak-to-peak amplitude. The proposed system, leveraging these refined features and QSVM, achieved an exceptional accuracy of 98.9%. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing an enhanced feature set derived from reduced brain lobes and quantum machine learning for ASD classification, offering a novel and highly accurate diagnostic approach.

TI Research and Application Progresses of Lithium Niobate Based Optical
   Computing Chips (Invited)
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) has played an essential role in the fields of electro-optic modulation and frequency conversion. In its early stages, it was primarily used as laser frequency-doubling devices and electro-optic modulators in optical communication systems. With the advancement of Ti-diffusion and proton exchange techniques, LiNbO3 devices were no longer confined to bulk configurations, facilitating the development of a range of integrated optical waveguide components. However, challenges in nanofabrication and constraints on integration density still persist. In the 21st century, with the explosive growth of information and data, traditional electronic computing is gradually approaching its physical limits. Emerging applications, including big data, artificial intelligence, high-speed networks, and virtual reality, are placing increasingly demanding requirements on computing devices in terms of performance, size, and energy efficiency. Owing to its exceptional electro-optic and nonlinear optical characteristics, LiNbO(3 )remains pivotal in traditional communication technologies, while also demonstrating irreplaceable value in emerging fields such as optical computing, artificial intelligence acceleration, and quantum information processing. In particular, the rise of the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform marks a new era for LiNbO(3 )as a platform for optical computing chips, which may have a tremendous impact on the future of information technology. TFLN, when combined with advanced nanofabrication techniques, has facilitated the development of compact, low-loss, high-speed photonic devices. TFLN has become a critical material platform for the development of high-speed electro-optic modulators, nonlinear photonic chips, and quantum photonic circuits. TFLN has gained increasing attention in the field of optical computing primarily due to the following reasons: Firstly, its strong electro-optic effect fulfills the high-speed modulation requirements for optical computing. Moreover, the low optical loss and high bandwidth of TFLN enable optical signal transmission over a broad frequency range with minimal attenuation. Finally, TFLN supports ultra-high integration density, making it suitable for constructing compact and miniaturized photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In recent years, the demand for computing processing speed has been approaching the performance bottleneck of electronic computers. Optical computing, as a computing system that relies on photons to process data, has advantages such as low energy consumption, large bandwidth, and fast response, making it one of the most promising disruptive computing architectures. Optical computing is of strategic importance to safeguarding information security and computational sovereignty. Lithium niobate materials and photonics have long been a significant research focus in China, and a series of significant breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years. Therefore, a systematic review of the progress and prospects of LiNbO3-based optical computing is essential to guide future research and technological development. Progress Figure 1 shows the microscopy image of the fabricated chip, which consists of three Mach?Zehnder modulators (MZMs) with various microwave signal line widths and device lengths. Figure 2 presents the schematic of the cross-section of the hybrid waveguide, as well as the multifunctional photonic integrated chip and its characterization system.
   An integrated lithium niobate (LN) modulator with segmented electrodes (designed to reduce the modulation voltage) has significantly enhanced the modulation bandwidth (Fig. 3). Figure 4 depicts the schematic of an MZM with a periodic CLTW (capacitively loaded traveling-wave) electrode. Figure 5 illustrates the architecture of a typical hybrid photonic neural network (PNN). Figure 6 shows a schematic of the proposed integrated photonic tensor core (IPTC), which consists of four physical components: lasers, two TFLN MZMs, and charge-integration photoreceivers. Figure 7 presents the conceptual schematic of a fully integrated optical convolutional neural network (OCNN), which uses an integrated photonic convolution accelerator (IPCA) fabricated on the lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform and a micro-ring resonator (MRR) filter. Figure 8 shows an LN-based microwave photonics (MWP) processing engine, which consists of a high-speed electro-optic modulation block and a low-loss, multipurpose photonic processing section. The implementation of the photon ray-tracing core (PRTC) on the TFLN platform is shown in Fig. 9; the PRTC comprises four high-speed push-pull MZMs for parameter encoding, followed by coherent optical processing and detection components for binary result generation. A polarized TFLN waveguide was fabricated, and non-destructive high-resolution in-situ imaging technology was used for characterization (Fig. 10). Figure 11 provides the experimental setup for characterizing the photon pairs generated from the LNOI waveguide. Furthermore, a photonic chip with dimensions of 50 mmx5 mmx0.5 mm (capable of generating and manipulating entangled photon pairs) has been reported (Fig. 12). Finally, the experimental setup for measuring on-chip quantum interference is also showcased (Fig. 13); this setup can realize multiple photonic information processing functions, including on-chip quantum interference and photon demultiplexing. Conclusions and Prospects The emergence of TFLN has driven revolutionary advances in multiple fields, including optical modulation, nonlinear optical devices, optical computing, and quantum optics, thereby propelling the development of LiNbO3-based optical computing chips. Notably, critical performance metrics such as operational bandwidth, processing speed, and energy efficiency have undergone remarkable improvements. Importantly, some LiNbO3 optical computing chips fabricated in laboratories have already achieved performance levels suitable for market applications. However, the industrialization of LiNbO3 optical computing is still constrained by challenges in material fabrication, nanofabrication techniques, integration density, and system complexity. Bridging the gap from laboratory prototypes to commercial products will require coordinated efforts across materials science, optical engineering, and computing architecture.

TI On Quantum Hyperparameters Selection in Hybrid Classifiers for Earth
   Observation Data
SO IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging technology that only recently has begun to take root in the research fields of earth observation (EO) and remote sensing (RS), and whose state-of-the-art (SOTA) is roughly divided into one group oriented to fully quantum solutions, and in another oriented to hybrid solutions. Very few works applied QML to EO tasks, and none of them explored a methodology that can give guidelines on the hyperparameter tuning of the quantum part for land cover classification (LCC). As a first step in the direction of quantum advantage for RS data classification, this letter opens new research lines, allowing us to demonstrate that there are more convenient solutions to simply increasing the number of qubits in the quantum part. To pave the first steps for researchers interested in the above, the structure of a new hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) for EO data and LCC is proposed with a strategy to choose the number of qubits to find the most efficient combination in terms of both system complexity and results accuracy. We sampled and tried a number of configurations, and using the suggested method, we came up with the most efficient solution (in terms of the selected metrics). Better performance is achieved with less model complexity when tested and compared with SOTA and standard techniques for identifying volcanic eruptions chosen as a case study. Additionally, the method makes the model more resilient to dataset imbalance, a significant problem when training classical models. Lastly, the code is freely available so that interested researchers can reproduce and extend the results.

TI Composite particle construction of the Fibonacci fractional quantum Hall
   state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The Fibonacci topological order is the simplest platform for a universal topological quantum computer. While the nu = 12/5 fractional quantum Hall (QH) state has been proposed to support a Fibonacci sector, a dynamical picture of how a pure Fibonacci state may emerge in a QH system has been lacking. We use non-Abelian dualities to construct a Fibonacci state of bosons at filling nu = 2 starting from a trilayer of integer QH states. Our parent theory consists of bosonic composite vortices coupled to fluctuating U(2) gauge fields, which is dual to the theory of Laughlin quasiparticles. The Fibonacci state is obtained by interlayer clustering of the composite vortices, along with flux attachment. We use this framework to motivate a wave function for the Fibonacci state.

TI Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons Using Solid-State
   Spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.

TI Photon number dependent afterpulsing in superconducting nanostrip
   single-photon detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting nanostrip single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are widespread tools in photonic quantum technologies. Here, we study the afterpulsing phenomenon in commercial SNSPDs exhibiting significant levels of afterpulses even at low counting rates. We find different contributions, where the probability of an afterpulse is not a constant but depends on the mean number of photons per light pulse including mean numbers much less than 1. Our observations exclude the electrical circuit as the primary cause of the main contribution to the observed afterpulsing probability, which exhibits a strong dependence on mean photon number. We propose a phenomenological model that qualitatively explains our findings via the introduction of slowly relaxing "afterpulsing centers," storing the absorbed photons' energy for several tens of nanoseconds. We conjecture that two-level systems in amorphous materials are physical candidates for the role of such afterpulsing centers.

TI Generalising quantum imaginary time evolution to solve linear partial
   differential equations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) methodology was developed to overcome a critical issue as regards non-unitarity in the implementation of imaginary time evolution on a quantum computer. QITE has since been used to approximate ground states of various physical systems. In this paper, we demonstrate a practical application of QITE as a quantum numerical solver for linear partial differential equations. Our algorithm takes inspiration from QITE in that the quantum state follows the same normalised trajectory in both algorithms. However, it is our QITE methodology's ability to track the scale of the state vector over time that allows our algorithm to solve differential equations. We demonstrate our methodology with numerical simulations and use it to solve the heat equation in one and two dimensions using six and ten qubits, respectively.

TI Testing the speed of "spooky action at a distance" in a tabletop
   experiment
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nonlocality, probably the principal friction between Quantum Physics and Relativity, disturbed the physicists even more than realism since it looks to originate superluminal signalling, the Einsteinian "Spooky action at a distance". From 2000 on, several tests to set lower bounds of the Spooky action at a distance velocity (c beta(t,max)) have been performed. They are usually based on a Bell Test performed in km long and carefully balanced experimental setups to fix a more and more improved bound making some assumptions dictated by the experimental conditions. By exploiting advances in quantum technologies, we performed a Bell's test with an improved bound in a tabletop experiment of the order of few minutes, thus being able to control parameters otherwise uncontrollable in an extended setup or in long lasting experiments.

TI Quantum transport reservoir computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened possibilities for conventional RC and introduced other ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced backaction. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device-fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement backaction. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes another pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The supersymmetric connection that exists between the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes Cummings (AJC) models in quantum optics is unraveled entirely. A new method is proposed to obtain the temporal evolution of observables in the AJC model using supersymmetric techniques, providing an overview of its dynamics and extending the calculation to full photon counting statistics. The approach is general and can be applied to determine the high-order cumulants given an initial state. The analysis reveals that engineering the collapse-revival behavior and the quantum properties of the interacting field is possible by controlling the initial state of the atomic subsystem and the corresponding atomic frequency in the AJC model. The substantial potential for applications of supersymmetric techniques in the context of photonic quantum technologies is thus demonstrated.

TI SDN-enabled CV-QKD and classical channels coexistence: key insights for
   dense wavelength division multiplexing
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB In this paper, we explored various physical-layer parameters affecting the coexistence of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) and classical channels (CCs) within dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) in the C-band. These parameters include the number of transmitted quantum symbols, power levels of CCs, quantum channel (QC) allocation within the C-band, power distribution among CCs, channel spacing between CCs and the QC, and CC power ranges suitable for both CCs and the QC. These insights provide valuable guidance for a software-defined networking (SDN) control system to manage CV-QKD and CC coexistence effectively. We observed that, for short distances and lower key rates, the number of quantum symbols exchanged does not need to reach the asymptotic convergence limit. However, achieving the asymptotic regime on a 10 km link requires transmitting approximately ${1} \times {{10}<^>{13}}$ quantum symbols. CC power significantly impacts CV-QKD performance. For example, in a DWDM setup with 37 dummy CCs on a 100 GHz grid, CV-QKD can support up to 11 dBm total launch power over a 10 km link when the QC is positioned at 193.2 THz and a 200 GHz channel spacing between the QC and CCs is maintained. Strategic placement of the QC within the C-band also enhances performance. Placing the QC at higher frequency channels relative to CCs improves both the secret key fraction and the maximum supported power of CCs. For instance, placing the QC at 195.9 THz provides better performance than positioning it at 193.2 or 192.2 THz. However, when the QC is placed at 192.2 THz, the maximum supported CC power reduces to 9.8 dBm. Additionally, the relationship between power distribution and power concentration is complex and requires careful consideration. It depends on the number of active CCs, the power of CCs, and their spectral placement relative to the QC. We also analyzed the case of ${8} \times {200}{\rm G}$ modulated CCs and found that placing them 100 GHz from the QC introduces nonlinear noise but still allows a positive secret key fraction. Increasing the spacing to 200 GHz further improves CV-QKD performance. Joint performance analysis revealed that, at a 100 GHz spacing and a 30 dB optical signal-to-noise ratio for CCs, a launch power range of ${-}{16.96}$ to 9.03 dBm supports both error-free CC recovery and positive key rate generation over a 10 km link. This comprehensive analysis highlights the interplay between CV-QKD and CCs, offering practical strategies for optimizing their coexistence in DWDM systems through an SDN control system.

TI Advancing cybersecurity and privacy with artificial intelligence:
   current trends and future research directions
SO FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
AB Introduction The rapid escalation of cyber threats necessitates innovative strategies to enhance cybersecurity and privacy measures. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool poised to enhance the effectiveness of cybersecurity strategies by offering advanced capabilities for intrusion detection, malware classification, and privacy preservation. However, this work addresses the significant lack of a comprehensive synthesis of AI's use in cybersecurity and privacy across the vast literature, aiming to identify existing gaps and guide further progress. Methods This study employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework for a comprehensive literature review, analyzing over 9,350 publications from 2004 to 2023. Utilizing BERTopic modeling, 14 key themes in AI-driven cybersecurity were identified. Topics were clustered and validated through a combination of algorithmic and expert-driven evaluations, focusing on semantic relationships and coherence scores. Results AI applications in cybersecurity are concentrated around intrusion detection, malware classification, federated learning in privacy, IoT security, UAV systems and DDoS mitigation. Emerging fields such as adversarial machine learning, blockchain and deep learning are gaining traction. Analysis reveals that AI's adaptability and scalability are critical for addressing evolving threats. Global trends indicate significant contributions from the US, India, UK, and China, highlighting geographical diversity in research priorities. Discussion While AI enhances cybersecurity efficacy, challenges such as computational resource demands, adversarial vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns persist.

TI Composite fermions and parton wavefunctions in twisted graphene on
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB In a twisted graphene on hexagonal boron nitride, the presence of a gap and the breaking of the symmetry between carbon sublattices lead to multicomponent fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) due to the electrons' correlation. Here we report on the FQHE at filling factors nu = k/2 and nu = k/3 with nu > 1, and on the composite fermions at in the nu < 1 lowest Landau level nu = 4/5, 5/7 and 2/3. These fractional states can be described with a partons model, in which the electron is broken down into sub-particles each one residing in an integer quantum Hall effect state; partons are fictitious particles that, glued back together, recover the physical electrons. The parton states host exotic anyons that could potentially form building blocks of a fault-tolerant topological quantum computer.

TI Making quantum chemistry compressive and expressive: Toward practical
   ab-initio simulation
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE
AB Ab-initio quantum chemistry simulations are essential for understanding electronic structure of molecules and materials in almost all areas of chemistry. A broad variety of electronic structure theories and implementations has been developed in the past decades to hopefully solve the many-body Schrodinger equation in an approximate manner on modern computers. In this review, we present recent progress in advancing low-rank electronic structure methodologies that rely on the wavefunction sparsity and compressibility to select the important subset of electronic configurations for both weakly and strongly correlated molecules. Representative chemistry applications that require the many-body treatment beyond traditional density functional approximations are discussed. The low-rank electronic structure theories have further prompted us to highlight compressive and expressive principles that are useful to catalyze idea of quantum learning models. The intersection of the low-rank correlated feature design and the modern deep neural network learning provides new feasibilities to predict chemically accurate correlation energies of unknown molecules that are not represented in the training dataset. The results by others and us are discussed to reveal that the electronic feature sets from an extremely low-rank correlation representation, which is very poor for explicit energy computation, are however sufficiently expressive for capturing and transferring electron correlation patterns across distinct molecular compositions, bond types and geometries.

TI Direct state measurements under state-preparation-and-measurement errors
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Direct state measurement (DSM) is a tomography method that allows for retrieving quantum states' wave functions directly. However, a shortcoming of current studies on the DSM is that it does not provide access to noisy quantum systems. Here, we attempt to fill the gap by investigating the DSM measurement precision that undergoes the state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. We manipulate a quantum controlled measurement framework with various configurations and compare the efficiency between them. Under such SPAM errors, the state to be measured lightly deviates from the true state, and the measurement error in the postselection process results in less accurate in the tomography. Our study could provide a reliable tool for SPAM errors tomography and contribute to understanding and resolving an urgent demand for current quantum technologies.

TI Cavity-enhanced charge-driven feedback loop in single quantum dot
   photocurrent spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB This study investigates a charge-driven feedback loop on single quantum dots (QDs) embedded in micropillar cavities under electrical readout. The coupled quantum-dot-microcavity system demonstrates a significant reduction in hysteresis under temperature sweep when the QD is in resonance with the cavity mode. To describe the experimental results, we develop a feedback model for the photocurrent response which incorporates a quadratic Stark shift to accurately fit the observed asymmetries and hysteresis in the spectra. Supported by this model, we attribute the observed reduction in hysteresis to an interplay between cavity-enhanced effective excitation power and the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination by cavity quantum electrodynamics effects in the Purcell regime. This work provides important insights that can guide future optimization of QD-based devices for applications in quantum technologies.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The controlled deposition of organized molecular materials on technologically relevant substrates is crucial for the development of innovative magneto-optical devices. In this work, we report the growth of lanthanoid-based 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with formula unit [Ln(MeCOO)(PhCOO)2] (Ln = Dy, Tb) on Si(100) wafers functionalized by silanization. The thickness, morphology and composition of the grown material was assessed using a combination of ellipsometry, contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The on-surface grown terbium 2D MOFs exhibit green luminescence, like the bulk. Furthermore, chemisorbed Dy and Tb 2D MOFs retain a significant magnetic moment, as demonstrated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements conducted at the M4,5 edge of the two lanthanoids. Our work paves the way for the preparation of magneto-optical devices and organized arrays of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and qubits on surfaces for high-density information storage and quantum computing applications.

TI Ultrafast laser direct writing of material independent integrated
   nonlinear components based on NPE
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Material independent integrated nonlinear components (MIINC) based on nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) play an important role in the emerging quantum computing, integrated photonics and ultrafast science. However, to our knowledge, no one has yet employed ultrafast laser direct writing for NPE-based MIINC. Here, for the first time, we finish the MIINC direct writing based on NPE using an ultrafast laser, and we suggest a multi -slice (MS) approach to in -fiber waveplate direct writing that allows for flexible adjustment of the phase difference, the waveplate fast and slow axis, and the stress birefringence value. To complete the measurement of the nonlinear transmittance curve, a polarization-splitter prism is attached to the output light path's back end. The measurement results agree with the theoretical calculation. MIINC based on NPE with arbitrary nonlinear transmittance curves are fabricated via the direct writing method, which is expected to be used in optical chips in the future.

TI Universal Compiling and (No-)Free-Lunch Theorems for Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum compiling, where a parameterized quantum circuit is trained to learn a target unitary, is an important primitive for quantum computing that can be used as a subroutine to obtain optimal circuits or as a tomographic tool to study the dynamics of an experimental system. While much attention has been paid to quantum compiling on discrete-variable hardware, less has been paid to compiling in the continuous-variable paradigm. Here we motivate several, closely related, short-depth continuous-variable algorithms for quantum compilation. We analyze the trainability of our proposed cost functions and numerically demonstrate our algorithms by learning arbitrary Gaussian operations and Kerr nonlinearities. We further make connections between this framework and quantum learning theory in the continuous-variable setting by deriving no-free-lunch theorems. These generalization bounds demonstrate a linear resource reduction for learning Gaussian unitaries using entangled coherent-Fock states and an exponential resource reduction for learning arbitrary unitaries using two-mode-squeezed states.

TI Constrained Quantum Optimization for Resource Distribution Management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The cloud computing field suffers from the heavy processing caused by the exponentially increasing data traffic. Therefore, optimizing the network performance and achieving a better quality of service (QoS) became a central goal. In cloud computing, the problem of energy consumption of resource distribution management system (RDMS) is presented as an optimization problem. Most of the existing classical optimization approaches, such as heuristic and metaheuristic have high computational complexity. In this work, we proposed a quantum optimization strategy that executes the tasks exponentially faster and with high accuracy named constrained quantum optimization algorithm (CQOA). We exploit the CQOA in RDMS as a toy example for pointing out the efficiency of the proposed quantum strategy in reducing energy consumption and computational complexity. Following that, we investigate the CQOA's implementation, setup, and computational complexity. Finally, we create a simulation environment to evaluate the efficiency of the suggested implemented constrained quantum strategy.

TI Prediction of Phonon-Mediated Superconductivity with High Critical
   Temperature in the Two-Dimensional Topological Semimetal
   W2N3
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional superconductors attract great interest both for their fundamental physics and for their potential applications, especially in the rapidly growing field of quantum computing. Despite intense theoretical and experimental efforts, materials with a reasonably high transition temperature are still rare. Even more rare are those that combine superconductivity with a nontrivial band topology that could potentially give rise to exotic states of matter. Here, we predict a remarkably high superconducting critical temperature of 21 K in the easily exfoliable, topologically nontrivial 2D semimetal W2N3. By studying its electronic and superconducting properties as a function of doping and strain, we also find large changes in the electron-phonon interactions that make this material a unique platform to study different coupling regimes and test the limits of current theories of superconductivity. Last, we discuss the possibility of tuning the material to achieve coexistence of superconductivity and topologically nontrivial edge states.

Analyzing this object requires solving differential equations, often beyond the scope of analytical solutions. This article focuses on a model of the o0-Josephson junction, which describes the magnetic moment precession. A critical aspect of this investigation is addressing system stiffness, a common challenge in numerical simulations. Various numerical methods are rigorously compared to evaluate their efficiency. The study highlights the key contributions to identifying effective numerical methods for accurately solving stiff systems of the junction model and demonstrating their applicability to previously inaccessible parameter regimes. This paper presents the first use of certain methods for this model, achieving higher accuracy and effectively managing stiffness.

TI Variational quantum classifier-based early identification and
   classification of chronic kidney disease using sparse autoencoder and
   LASSO shrinkage
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The two leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are excessive blood pressure and diabetes. Researchers worldwide utilize the rate of globular filtration and kidney inflammation biomarkers to identify chronic kidney disease that gradually reduces renal function. The mortality rate for CKD is high, and thus, a person with this illness is more likely to pass away at a younger age. Healthcare professionals must diagnose the various illnesses connected to this deadly disease as promptly as possible to lighten the impact of CKD. A quantum machine learning (QML) based technique is presented in this research to help with the early diagnosis and prognosis of CKD. The proposed research comprises four phases: data pre-processing, data augmentation, feature selection, and classification. In the first phase, Kalman filter and data normalization techniques are applied to handle the missing and noisy data. In the second phase, data augmentation uses sparse autoencoders to balance the data for smaller classes. In the third phase, LASSO shrinkage is used to select the significant features in the dataset. Variational Quantum classifiers, a supervised QML technique, are employed in the classification phase to classify chronic kidney diseases. The proposed system has been evaluated on the UCI dataset, which comprises 400 CKD patients in the early stages with 25 attributes. The suggested system was assessed using F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy as evaluation metrics. With a 99.2% classification accuracy, it was found that this model performed better than the other traditional classifiers used for chronic kidney disease classification.

TI 3D finite-element modeling of topological photonics in germanium
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB We investigated the photonic properties of topological lattices specifically designed to open a terahertz photonic bandgap in a germanium matrix. An extensive analysis based on three-dimensional finite element method enabled the identification of the requirements in terms of vertical height and lateral dimensions of the Ge motifs to suitably vary the bulk gap between 41 and 65 THz. Furthermore, by interfacing topologically distinct domains, we were able to observe the emergence of non-trivial edge modes that remain stable at a constant frequency despite the varying geometry of the unit cells. These findings provide valuable insights for designing resilient and effective photonic devices based on topological photonic crystals, and open new avenues for the realization of advanced quantum technologies in the THz regime.

QuTree provides class structures for tensors, tensor trees, and related linear algebra functions that facilitate the fast development of tree tensor network approaches such as the multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree approach or the density matrix renormalization group approach and its various extensions. We investigate the efficiency of relevant tensor and tensor network operations and show that the overhead for managing the network structure is negligible, even in cases with a million leaves and small tensors. QuTree focuses on providing simple, high-level routines while retaining easy access to the backend to facilitate novel developments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by computing the eigenstates of coupled harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians and performing random circuit simulations on a virtual quantum computer.

TI Conformal field theories are magical
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB "Magic" is the degree to which a state cannot be approximated by Clifford gates. We study mana, a measure of magic, in the ground state of the Z(3) Potts model, and argue that it is a broadly useful diagnostic for many-body physics. In particular we find that the q = 3 ground state has large mana at the model's critical point, and that this mana resides in the system's correlations. We explain the form of the mana by a simple tensor-counting calculation based on a MERA representation of the state. Because mana is present at all length scales, we conclude that the conformal field theory describing the three-state Potts model critical point is magical. These results control the difficulty of preparing the Potts ground state on an error-corrected quantum computer and constrain tensor network models of AdS-CFT.

TI Efficient protocol for exploring the quantum interference and
   entanglement of Dirac particles
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a protocol to effectively study the interference of Dirac particles in phase space. The negativity of the quasiprobability distribution in phase space and the entanglement between the internal and external degrees of freedom constitute the non-classical manifestations of this interference. The protocol makes use of a synthetic quantum Rabi model, which is obtained by applying a parametric drive to the Jaynes-Cummings model. When the parametric drive is almost resonant with the cavity frequency, the effective system Hamiltonian takes the same form as the one-dimensional Dirac particle Hamiltonian. We explore the quantum interference using this equivalent model and find that the interference pattern can occur even in the absence of the Zitterbewegung effect. In addition, we simulate the quantum behavior of Dirac particles encountering potential barriers through the simulation of Klein tunneling. These non-classical effects offer potential application in fields such as quantum computing.

TI Multiparty private summation protocol based on two-state
   quantum-mechanical system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the rapid advancement of information technology, data sharing has become increasingly accessible, leading to a heightened need for robust personal data protection. One important application in privacy-preserving computing is the aggregation of information when collaboratively establishing AI models through public distributed networks. To counter the threat posed by quantum computing to encrypted data, various quantum private summation (QPS) protocols have been proposed thus far. However, some of these existing protocols operate solely under modulo 2, while other approaches for modulo d often rely on impractically high-dimensional qudits. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative multiparty QPS method that balances participant data sharing and privacy without requiring high-dimensional photons. The proposed QPS protocol enables participants to contribute aggregated information to third parties without disclosing individual data. A security analysis further demonstrates that the proposed QPS effectively counters common eavesdropping attacks, ensuring reliable protection of personal data.

TI The application of metaverse in healthcare
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB While metaverse is widely discussed, comprehension of its intricacies remains limited to a select few. Conceptually akin to a three-dimensional embodiment of the Internet, the metaverse facilitates simultaneous existence in both physical and virtual domains. Fundamentally, it embodies a visually immersive virtual environment, striving for authenticity, where individuals engage in real-world activities such as commerce, gaming, social interaction, and leisure pursuits. The global pandemic has accelerated digital innovations across diverse sectors. Beyond strides in telehealth, payment systems, remote monitoring, and secure data exchange, substantial advancements have been achieved in artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and blockchain technologies. Nevertheless, the metaverse, in its nascent stage, continues to evolve, harboring significant potential for revolutionizing healthcare. Through integration with the Internet of Medical Devices, quantum computing, and robotics, the metaverse stands poised to redefine healthcare systems, offering enhancements in surgical precision and therapeutic modalities, thus promising profound transformations within the industry.

TI Majorana-like Coulomb spectroscopy in the absence of zero-bias peaks
SO NATURE
AB Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices hold great promise for realizing topological quantum computing with Majorana zero modes(1-5). However, multiple claims of Majorana detection, based on either tunnelling(6-10) or Coulomb blockade (CB) spectroscopy(11,12), remain disputed. Here we devise an experimental protocol that allows us to perform both types of measurement on the same hybrid island by adjusting its charging energy via tunable junctions to the normal leads. This method reduces ambiguities of Majorana detections by checking the consistency between CB spectroscopy and zero-bias peaks in non-blockaded transport. Specifically, we observe junction-dependent, even-odd modulated, single-electron CB peaks in InAs/Al hybrid nanowires without concomitant low-bias peaks in tunnelling spectroscopy. We provide a theoretical interpretation of the experimental observations in terms of low-energy, longitudinally confined island states rather than overlapping Majorana modes. Our results highlight the importance of combined measurements on the same device for the identification of topological Majorana zero modes.

TI Exponential concentration in quantum kernel methods
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum advantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from quantum hardware. In this work we study the performance of quantum kernel models from the perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards some fixed value. Thus on training with a polynomial number of measurements, one ends up with a trivial model where the predictions on unseen inputs are independent of the input data. We identify four sources that can lead to concentration including expressivity of data embedding, global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation of quantum kernels and so the performance of quantum kernel methods.
   Quantum kernel methods are usually believed to enjoy better trainability than quantum neural networks which may suffer from a well-studied barren plateau. Here, building over previous evidence, the authors show that practical implications of exponential concentration result in a trivial data-insensitive model after training, and identify commonly used features that induce the concentration.

TI Optical spin initialization of spin-3/2 silicon vacancy centers in
   6H-SiC at room temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Silicon vacancies in silicon carbide have been proposed as an alternative to nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds for spintronics and quantum technologies. An important precondition for these applications is the initialization of the qubits into a specific quantum state. In this work, we study the optical alignment of the spin 3/2 negatively charged silicon vacancy in 6H-SiC. Using time-resolved optically detected magnetic resonance, we coherently control the silicon vacancy spin ensemble and measure Rabi frequencies, spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times of all three transitions. Then to study the optical initialization process of the silicon vacancy spin ensemble, the vacancy spin ensemble is prepared in different ground states and optically excited. We describe a simple rate equation model that can explain the observed behavior and determine the relevant rate constants.

TI Security Analysis of Reusing Vinegar Values in UOV Signature Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multivariate quadratic equation-based cryptographic algorithms are one of the promising post-quantum alternatives to current public-key cryptographic algorithms based on the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem. In this paper, we provide advanced security analysis of UOV, a well-known signature scheme based on the multivariate quadratic equations, when Vinegar values are reused in signing for efficiency. We determine the minimum number of signatures generated by the reused Vinegar values required for UOV secret key recovery. More precisely, it is enough inverted left perpendicular v/o inverted right perpendicular + 1 signatures to recover the secret key in polynomial-time. According to our experimental results, we can recover the secret key of UOV from only three signatures generated by the reused Vinegar values in 72 ms, 498 ms and 1,527 ms on a desktop at the 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit security levels, respectively.

TI On readout and initialisation fidelity by finite demolition single shot
   readout
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ideal projective quantum measurement makes the system state collapse in one of the observable operator eigenstates |phi alpha⟩ , making it a powerful tool for preparing the system in the desired pure state. Nevertheless, experimental realisations of projective measurement are not ideal. During the measurement time needed to overcome the classical noise of the apparatus, the system state is often (slightly) perturbed, which compromises the fidelity of initialisation. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to analyse the initialisation fidelity of the system performed by the single-shot readout. We derive a method to optimise parameters for the three most used cases of photon counting based readouts for NV colour centre in diamond, charge state, nuclear spin and low temperature electron spin readout. Our work is of relevance for the accurate description of initialisation fidelity of the quantum bit when the single-shot readout is used for initialisation via post-selection or real-time control.

TI Intermodulation Distortion in a Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric
   Amplifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) enable the amplification of weak microwave signals close to the quantum limit with large bandwidth, which has a broad range of applications in superconducting quantum computing and in the operation of single-photon detectors. While the large bandwidth allows for their use in frequency-multiplexed detection architectures, an increased number of readout tones per amplifier puts more stringent requirements on the dynamic range to avoid saturation. Here, we characterize the undesired mixing processes between the different frequency-multiplexed tones applied to a Josephson TWPA, a phenomenon also known as intermodulation distortion. The effect becomes particularly significant when the amplifier is operated close to its saturation power. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intermodulation distortion can lead to significant crosstalk and reduction of fidelity for multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. We suggest using large detunings between the pump and signal frequencies to mitigate crosstalk. Our work provides insights into the limitations of current Josephson TWPAs and highlights the importance of performing further research on these devices.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), a cornerstone of the study of chemical and materials systems, stands to benefit greatly from AI-driven automation. However, present barriers to low-level instrument control, as well as generalizable and interpretable feature detection, make truly automated microscopy impractical. Here, we discuss the design of a closed-loop instrument control platform guided by emerging sparse data analytics. We hypothesize that a centralized controller, informed by machine learning combining limited a priori knowledge and task-based discrimination, could drive on-the-fly experimental decision-making. This platform may unlock practical, automated analysis of a variety of material features, enabling new high-throughput and statistical studies.

AB Investigating Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) at the molecular level offers a novel perspective, in between Chemistry and Physics, on this still not fully understood phenomenon.

Here, we present an overview of experimental observations of CISS in electron transfer on isolated molecules in solution and the current status of theory to model the phenomenon. We discuss what is accomplished and which are the most important questions, and we propose experiments based on electron and nuclear magnetic resonance both to unravel open issues on the CISS effect in electron transfer and to apply it to quantum technologies.

AB On-chip Brillouin optomechanics has great potential for applications in communications, sensing, and quantum technologies. Tight confinement of near-infrared photons and gigahertz phonons in integrated waveguides remains a key challenge to achieving strong on-chip Brillouin gain. Here, we propose a new strategy to harness Brillouin gain in silicon waveguides, based on the combination of genetic algorithm optimization and periodic subwavelength structuration to engineer photonic and phononic modes simultaneously. The proposed geometry is composed of a waveguide core and a lattice of anchoring arms with a subwavelength period requiring a single etch step. The waveguide geometry is optimized to maximize the Brillouin gain using a multi-physics genetic algorithm. Our simulation results predict a remarkable Brillouin gain exceeding 3300 W-1m-1, for a mechanical frequency near 15 GHz.

TI Non-Markovian Quantum Thermometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The rapidly developing quantum technologies and thermodynamics have put forward a requirement to precisely control and measure the temperature of microscopic matter at the quantum level. Many quantum thermometry schemes have been proposed. However, precisely measuring low temperature is still challenging because the obtained sensing errors generally tend to diverge with decreasing temperature. Using a continuous-variable system as a thermometer, we propose non-Markovian quantum thermometry to measure the temperature of a quantum reservoir. A mechanism to make the sensing error delta T scale with the temperature T as the Landau bound delta T ' T in the full-temperature regime is discovered. Our analysis reveals that it is the quantum criticality of the total thermometer-reservoir system that causes this enhanced sensitivity. Efficiently avoiding the error-divergence problem, our result gives an efficient way to precisely measure the low temperature of quantum systems.

AB We report the fabrication and characterization of low-loss waveguides (WGs) based on evaporated amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) for integrated photonics in the near-ultraviolet (UV) spectral range. The fully etched WGs are fabricated on a 3 mu m-thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer on a 150 mm silicon wafer using a chromium (Cr) hard mask and electron beam lithography (EBL). A 130 nm thick WG core with a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of similar to 0.4 nm enables single-mode operation at 405 nm with propagation losses of 0.68 +/- 0.03 dB/cm. Our WGs support low-loss operation for bend radii down to approximately 200 mu m based on numerical simulations and offer potential for versatile applications in blue or UV photonics, including quantum computing with trapped ions, compact UV laser systems, and components for UV spectroscopy and microscopy.

TI Topological orders beyond topological quantum field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Systems displaying topological quantum order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interactions between anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing exact dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order, while preserving the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.

TI Probing surfaces and interfaces in complex oxide films via in situ X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Emergent behavior at oxide interfaces has driven research in complex oxide films for the past 20 years. Interfaces have been engineered for applications in spintronics, topological quantum computing, and high-speed electronics with properties not observed in bulk materials. Advances in synthesis have made the growth of these interfaces possible, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have often explained the observed interfacial phenomena. This review discusses leading recent research, focusing on key results and the XPS studies that enabled them. We describe how the in situ integration of synthesis and spectroscopy improves the growth process and accelerates scientific discovery. Specific techniques include determination of interfacial intermixing, valence band alignment, and interfacial charge transfer. A recurring theme is the role that atmospheric exposure plays on material properties, which we highlight in several material systems. We demonstrate how synchrotron studies have answered questions that are impossible in lab-based systems and how to improve such experiments in the future.

TI Non-Magnetic Non-Reciprocal Microwave Components-State of the Art and
   Future Directions
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF MICROWAVES
AB Non-reciprocal components such as circulators, isolators and gyrators find utility in numerous microwave wireless applications, including high-power transmitters, simultaneous transmit-and-receive communication and radar systems, and emerging cryogenic quantum computing implementations. Today, such components are implemented using ferrite materials, which lose their reciprocity under the application of an external magnetic field. However, ferrite materials are incompatible with semiconductor integrated-circuit fabrication processes, and therefore ferrite non-reciprocal components are difficult to miniaturize to chip scales, rendering them bulky and expensive. This has motivated significant research into non-magnetic non-reciprocal components over the past 50 years. In recent years, this research has been invigorated by breakthroughs in time-modulated non-reciprocal components, and their integration into silicon integrated circuits. This paper reviews the history of non-reciprocal electronics, surveys recent research results in the area, and describes outstanding directions for future research.

TI Photoassisted ionization spectroscopy of few implanted bismuth orbitals
   in a silicon-on-insulator device
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The electrically detected orbital spectrum of a mesoscopic silicon device containing a small number of donors has been investigated. The device was fabricated on silicon-on-insulator with an optically active channel containing 6 x 10(5) substitutional bismuth centers introduced by ion implantation. The 1 s ( A(1) ) & RARR; 2p & PLUSMN; orbital transition at the energy associated with isolated bismuth donors was detected via a change in photocurrent when illuminated by THz light from a free electron laser. The spectral dependence on bias, temperature, and laser intensity is explored to determine optimum conditions for detecting orbital transitions in smaller devices with fewer donors. These results suggest that photo-induced impact ionization can offer a route for the spectroscopic detection of few impurities providing a useful tool for the development of solid-state quantum technologies.

TI On-chip photon-pair generation in a silica microtoroidal cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Microcavities with high Q factor and small mode volume have the potential to be efficient and compact sources of photon pairs. Here, we demonstrate on-chip photonpair generation by spontaneous tour-wave mixing in a silica microtoroidal cavity and obtain a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 7.4 +/- 0.1 with a pump power of 46 mu W. The heralded photons also exhibit antibunching characterized by autocorrelation function values of g(c)(()(2)) (0) = 0.57 +/- 0.03<1. Comparing with a scaling model, the main noise source is found to be spontaneous Raman scattering in the cavity. This work opens a new possible means fur realizing integrated nonclassical photon sources based on silica photonic circuits toward scalable quantum technologies.

TI A quantum-enhanced heuristic algorithm for optimizing aircraft landing
   problems in low-altitude intelligent transportation systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As the low-altitude economy expands, optimizing the landing schedules of manned aerial vehicles has emerged as a critical challenge. The aircraft landing time window problem is a complex, high-dimensional optimization task frequently hindered by local optima. This study presents an Quantum-Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (QEWOA) that incorporates quantum computing to tackle these challenges. By utilizing a quantum random number generator, the algorithm improves the diversity of the initial population, preserving potential optimal solutions for a more effective global search. Additionally, the incorporation of an enhanced quantum tunneling mechanism enables the algorithm to escape local optima and perform more extensive searches. The combination of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm and Whale Optimization further strengthens both global search and local optimization capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that QEWOA significantly improves global search ability, optimization precision, and convergence speed, surpassing traditional methods in optimizing landing time windows for low-altitude manned aerial vehicles.

TI Control of ultrafast hot electron dynamics in epsilon-near-zero
   conductive oxide thin films
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The dynamics of nonlinear optical processes in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are primarily governed by hot electron relaxation with a sub-picosecond response. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive understanding of the ultrafast electron dynamics in nonlinear TCO ENZ materials. This study investigates the effects of laser peak power and ENZ mode excitation on hot electron relaxation in TCOs. Our experimental analysis theoretically supported by a hydrodynamic model reveals that increasing laser pulse intensity extends hot electron relaxation time by more than 200%, while ENZ mode excitation increases it by more than 40% in representative TCO ENZ materials. This research demonstrates the controllable modulation of ultrafast ENZ nonlinearity via pulse peak power and ENZ mode field enhancement. These findings provide substantial insights into the potential utilization of ENZ nonlinearity for the development of optical and quantum computing components, including ultrafast optical switches, dynamic pulse shapers, and modulators.

TI Spin detector for panchromatic circularly polarized light detection
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is crucial for optical communication, bioimaging and quantum computing. However, CPL detectors based on chiral low-dimensional perovskites face a trade-off between optoelectronic performance and CPL discrimination, and typically exhibit a CPL response within a narrow spectral range. Here, we overcome these limitations by integrating three-dimensional (3D) and chiral-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites. The 3D perovskite serving as the photoabsorption layer extends the detection range to 760 nm and enhances optoelectronic responses, while also generating spin-polarized carriers through large Rashba splitting. The chiral-2D perovskite achieves spin filtering efficiency up to 80%. The synergy between spin polarization and chiral-induced spin selectivity processes enables a panchromatic CPL response, with a photocurrent asymmetry factor exceeding 0.28 across the visible spectrum and peaking at 0.35. Furthermore, our detector achieves a detectivity of 3.7x1011 Jones. Our work introduces a spin manipulation strategy for panchromatic CPL detection, expanding the scope of spintronics applications.

TI Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a Z2 lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Because the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both the sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since the LGT encoding relies on qubits, it provides a framework for future efforts to capitalize on the development of quantum computing hardware. We discuss two illustrative applications of our formalism: first, we use it to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues. Next, we assess its efficiency to sample ensembles of compact structures, finding that the MC decorrelation time scales only linearly with the chain length.

TI Enhanced strength and ductility in an additively manufactured Al10SiMg
   alloy at cryogenic temperatures
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The increasing demand for lightweight materials that maintain mechanical integrity at ultralow temperatures has driven the development of advanced alloys for cryogenic applications. Additive manufacturing using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) offers a scalable approach to producing alloys with tailored properties. Here we show that LPBF-manufactured Al10SiMg alloy exhibits significant increase in ultimate tensile strength (395 MPa) and uniform elongation (25%) at an ultralow temperature of 15 K. The enhanced properties result from grain refinement, increased geometrically necessary dislocations, and stress partitioning between the Al matrix and the stiffer Si phase, which supports strain accommodation during deformation. The in-situ neutron diffraction revealed that the Si phase carries most of the load due to its higher yield strength, while the Al matrix experiences continuous strain hardening, enabling an extended deformation capacity. These findings highlight the potential of Al10SiMg for cryogenic applications such as hydrogen storage systems, aerospace components, and quantum computing hardware.

TI Quantum walk search based edge detection of images
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum walk has emerged as an essential tool for searching marked vertices on various graphs. Recent advances in the discrete-time quantum walk search algorithm have enabled it to effectively handle multiple marked vertices, expanding its range of applications further. In this article, we propose a novel application of this advanced quantum walk search algorithm for the edge detection of images-a critical task in digital image processing. Given the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, obtaining measurement result with a high success probability is essential alongside faster computation time. Our quantum walk search algorithm demonstrates a high success probability in detecting the image edges compared to the existing quantum edge detection methods and outperforms classical edge detection methods with a quadratically faster speed. A small Qiskit circuit implementation of our method using a one-dimensional quantum walk search has been executed in Qiskit's gasm_simula tor and ibm_sydney(fake) device.

TI Color code decoder with improved scaling for correcting circuit-level
   noise
SO QUANTUM
AB Two-dimensional color codes are a quantum computing, as they have high encoding rates, transversal implementation of logical Clifford gates, and resourceHowever, decoding color codes presents a significant challenge due to their structure, where elementary errors violate three checks instead of just two (a key feature in surface code decoding), and the complexity of extracting syndrome is greater. We introduce an efficient color-code decoder that tackles these issues by combining two matching decoders for each color, generalized to handle circuit-level noise by employing detector error models. We provide comprehensive analyses of the decoder, covering its threshold and sub-threshold scaling both for bit-flip noise with ideal measurements and for circuit-level noise. Our simulations reveal that this decoding strategy nearly reaches the best possible scaling of logical failure (pfail similar to pd/2) for both noise models, where p is the noise strength, in the regime of interest for its noise thresholds are comparable with coders.

AB A series of square planar metalloporphyrins (M(TPP), TPP is 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin and M(TPFPP), TPFPP is 5,10,15,20-tetrapentafluorophenylporphyrin; M is Zn2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, or Pt2+) with distinct meso-substituents were prepared, and their magneto-optical activity (MOA) was characterized by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magneto-optical rotary dispersion spectroscopy (MORD; also known as Faraday rotation spectroscopy). MOA is crucial in the development of next-generation magneto-optical devices and quantum computing. The data show that the presence of meso-pentafluorophenyl substituents results in significant increase in MOA in comparison to the homologous phenyl group. Differences in the MOA of these metalloporphyrins are rationalized using the Gouterman four-orbital model and pave the way for rational design of improved and tailorable magneto-optical materials.

   Antibodies Feature Selection and Adaptive Quantum Artificial Immune
   System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SEMANTIC WEB AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The intrusion detection system (IDS) has lower speed, less adaptability, and lower detection accuracy especially for small samples sets. This paper presents a detection model based on normalized mutual antibodies information feature selection and adaptive quantum artificial immune with cooperative evolution of multiple operators (NMAIFS MOP-AQAI). First, for a high intrusion speed, the NMAIFS is used to achieve an effective reduction for high-dimensional features. Then, the best feature vectors are sent to the MOP-AQAI classifier, in which vaccination strategy, the quantum computing, and cooperative evolution of multiple operators are adopted to generate excellent detectors. Lastly, the data is fed into NMAIFS MOP-AQAI which ultimately generates accurate detection results. The experimental results on real abnormal data demonstrate that the NMAIFS MOP-AQAI has higher detection accuracy, lower false negative rate, and a higher adaptive performance than the existing anomaly detection methods, especially for small samples sets.

TI On 2-variable q-Hermite polynomials

It has wide applications, particularly in quantum mechanics, analytic number theory, combinatorial analysis, operation theory etc. The q-calculus, which serves as a powerful tool to model quantum computing, has drawn attention of many researchers in the field of special functions and as a result the q-analogues of certain special functions, especially hypergeometric function, 1-variable Hermite polynomials, Appell polynomials etc., are introduced and studied. In this paper, we introduce the 2-variable q-Hermite polynomials by means of generating function. Also, its certain properties like series definition, recurrence relations, q-differential equation and summation formulas are established. The operational definition and some integral representations of these polynomials are obtained. Some examples are also considerd to show the efficacy of the proposed method. Some concluding remarks are given. At the end of this paper, the graphical representations of these polynomials of certain degrees with specified values of q are given.

In particular, optical sensors based on quantum states of light have proven to be optimal resources for high-precision interferometry. Nevertheless, their performance may be severely affected by the presence of noise or imperfections. In this work, we derive the quantum Fisher information matrix associated with the simultaneous estimation of an interferometric phase and the indistinguishability characterizing the probe state consisting of an even number of photons. We find the optimal measurement attaining the ultimate precision for both parameters in a single setup and perform an experiment based on a pair of photons with an unknown degree of indistinguishability entering a two-port interferometer.

TI Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing-an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillian exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.

TI Optimum surface-passivation schemes for near-surface spin defects in
   silicon carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Spin-active defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are promising quantum light sources for realizing scalable quantum technologies. In different applications, these photoluminescent defects are often placed in a nanostructured host or close to surfaces in order to enhance the signal from the defects. However, proximity to the surface not only modifies the frequencies of the quantum emission from the defect, but also adversely affects their photostability, resulting in blinking and/or photobleaching of the defect. These effects can be ameliorated by passivating surfaces with optimal adsorbates. In this work, we explore different passivation schemes using density-functional-theory-based calculations. We show that a uniform surface passivation with either hydrogen or with mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups completely removes surface states from the SiC band gap, restoring the optical properties of the defects.

TI Tunable Single-Photon Scattering of a Giant ?-type Atom in a SQUID-Chain
   Waveguide
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We study single-photon scattering of an artificial giant ?-type atom coupled to a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) chains waveguide at two points. In this circuit, the single-photon scattering rates are dependent on the atom-waveguide coupling strengths and the phase accumulated between two coupling points. By modulating the flux-dependent phase velocity in the SQUID-chain waveguide, the photon's traveling time is changed, and the accumulating phase is adjusted simultaneously. We investigate the relationship between the scattering effect and the flux bias, which allows us to explore novel phenomena with the tunable traveling time in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, and to design novel quantum technologies such as quantum storage.

TI Noise reduction of multimode Gaussian-boson-sampling circuits via
   unitary averaging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We improve Gaussian-boson-sampling circuits by integrating the unitary-averaging (UA) protocol, previously demonstrated to protect unknown Gaussian states from phase errors [Swain et al., Phys. Rev. A 110, 032622 (2024)]. Our work extends the applicability of UA to mitigate arbitrary interferometric noise, including beam-splitter and phase-shifter imperfections. Through comprehensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate that UA consistently achieves higher fidelity and success probability than unprotected circuits, establishing its robustness in noisy conditions. Remarkably, enhancement is maintained across varying numbers of modes with respect to the noise. We further derive a power-law formula predicting performance gains in large-scale systems, including 100-mode and 216-mode configurations. A detailed step-by-step algorithm for implementing the UA protocol is also provided, offering a practical road map for advancing near-term quantum technologies.

TI Nanoscale confinement of phonon flow and heat transport
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Efficient thermal management is critical to device performance and reliability for energy conversion, nanoelectronics, and the development of quantum technologies. The commonly-used diffusive model of heat transport breaks down for confined nanoscale geometries, and advanced theories beyond diffusion are based on disparate assumptions that lead to conflicting predictions. Here, we outline and contrast the two predominant formulations of the Boltzmann equation for heat transport in semiconductors, namely, the ballistic and hydrodynamic models. We examine these methods in light of experiments and atomistic calculations of heat fluxes and temperature profiles in phononic systems with nanometer-sized features. We argue that reconciling the hydrodynamic and ballistic formulations is an outstanding necessity to develop a unifying theory of confinement effects on phonon flow, which will ultimately lead to optimal strategies for thermal management in nanodevices.

TI Nonlinear stochastic and quantum motion from Coulomb forces
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Controllable nonlinear quantum interactions are a much sought after target for modern quantum technologies. They are typically difficult and costly to engineer for bespoke purposes. However controllable nonlinearities may have always been in reach via the natural and fundamental forces between quantum particles. The Coulomb interaction between charged particles is the simplest example. We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle. This essential evidence of nonlinear forces is present across large ranges of trap frequency and mass scales, as well as visible in both stochastic and quantum regimes.

TI Enhancing Gaussian quantum metrology with position-momentum correlations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum metrology offers significant improvements in several quantum technologies. In this work, we propose a Gaussian quantum metrology protocol assisted by initial position-momentum correlations (PM). We employ a correlated Gaussian wave packet as a probe to examine the dynamics of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and purity based on PM correlations to demonstrate how to estimate the PM correlations and, more importantly, to unlock its potential applications such as a resource to enhance quantum thermometry. In the low-temperature regime, we find an improvement in the thermometry of the surrounding environment when the original system exhibits a non-null initial correlation (correlated Gaussian state). In addition, we explore the connection between the loss of purity and the gain in QFI during the process of estimating the effective environment coupling and its effective temperature.

TI Deterministic generation of entanglement states between Silicon- Vacancy
   centers via acoustic modes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to entangle Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in a diamond acoustic waveguide. These SiV centers interact with acoustic modes of the waveguide via strain-induced coupling. Through Morris-Shore transformation, the Hilbert space of this hybrid quantum system can be factorized into a closed subspace in which we can deterministically realize the symmetrical Dicke states between distant SiV centers with high fidelity. In addition, the generation of entangled Dicke states can be controlled by manipulating the strength and frequency of the driving field applied on SiV centers. This protocol provides a promising way to prepare multipartite entanglement in spin-phonon hybrid systems and could have broad applications for future quantum technologies.

TI Graphene-Loaded LiNbO3 Directional Coupler: Characteristics
   and Potential Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB This study explores the impact of graphene integration on lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) ridge waveguides and directional couplers, focusing on coupling efficiency, polarization-dependent light absorption, and temperature sensitivity. Experimental and simulation results reveal that graphene loading significantly alters the effective mode refractive index and enhances waveguide coupling, enabling precise control over light transmission and power distribution. The temperature-dependent behavior of graphene-LN structures demonstrates strong thermal sensitivity, with notable changes in output power ratios between cross and through ports under varying temperatures. These findings highlight the potential of graphene-LN hybrid devices for compact, high-performance photonic circuits and temperature sensing applications. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced integrated photonic systems, paving the way for innovations in optical communication, sensing, and quantum technologies.

TI Fuzzy Identity-Based Ring Signature from Lattices
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB In this paper, a construction of a fuzzy identity-based ring signature scheme (LFIBRS) is proposed. Our LFIBRS combines the characteristics of both the fuzzy identity-based signature (FIBS) and the ring signature. On the one hand, a signature issued under an identity ID can be verified by any identity ID ' that is "close enough" to the identity ID. Since biometric identification is the well-known most popular and reliable identification method, our LFIBRS can be applied in such a situation whenever it is required for official audit or supervision that the signer's real identity is needed to be authenticated. On the other hand, LFIBRS provides anonymity under the random oracle model. In addition, LFIBRS provides unforgeability under the small integer solution (SIS) lattice hardness assumption which can resist large-scale quantum computer attacks in the future.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems face severe security and trust challenges, particularly under cross-domain data sharing and federated orchestration. We present QuantumTrust-FedChain, a cyber-resilient federated learning framework integrating quantum variational trust modeling, blockchain-backed provenance, and Byzantine-robust aggregation for secure IIoT collaboration in 6G networks. The architecture includes a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) for modeling device trust evolution using encrypted device logs. This consensus-aware federated optimizer penalizes adversarial gradients using stochastic contract enforcement, and a shard-based blockchain for real-time forensic traceability. Using datasets from SWaT and TON IoT, experiments show 98.3% accuracy in anomaly detection, 35% improvement in defense against model poisoning, and full ledger traceability with under 8.5% blockchain overhead. This framework offers a robust and explainable solution for secure AI deployment in safety-critical IIoT environments.

TI Enhanced quasiparticle relaxation in a superconductor via the proximity
   effect
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quasiparticle dynamics have been identified as an important factor in the operational performance of superconductors in quantum computing and sensing applications. In order to study such dynamics, we performed measurements of quasiparticle transport in a superconductor engineered to enhance quasiparticle relaxation. We found that a thin, highly disordered normal metal layer can be used to greatly reduce the relaxation time of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire, without significantly affecting the properties of the superconductor. The enhanced relaxation is likely due to an increased electron-electron scattering rate in the disordered normal metal. Our results provide a positive indication that quasiparticle relaxation can be substantially enhanced via a simple and technologically viable method, and demonstrate that direct measurement of quasiparticle imbalance can be a useful tool for the assessment and engineering of superconductors in various applications at mK temperatures.

TI Majorana-magnon interactions in topological Shiba chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A chain of magnetic impurities deposited on the surface of a superconductor can form a topological Shiba band that supports Majorana zero modes and holds a promise for topological quantum computing. Yet, most experiments scrutinizing these zero modes rely on transport measurements, which only capture local properties. Here we propose to leverage the intrinsic dynamics of the magnetic impurities to access their nonlocal character. We use linear response theory to determine the dynamics of the uniform magnonic mode in the presence of external ac magnetic fields and coupling to Shiba electrons. We demonstrate that this mode, which spreads over the entire chain of atoms, becomes imprinted with the parity of the ground state and, moreover, can discriminate between Majorana and trivial zero modes located at the ends of the chain. Our approach offers a noninvasive alternative to the scanning tunneling microscopy techniques used to probe Majorana zero modes. Conversely, the magnons could facilitate the manipulation of Majorana zero modes in topological Shiba chains.

TI Selective quantum ensemble learning inspired by improved AdaBoost based
   on local sample information
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB In ensemble learning, random subspace technology not only easily loses some important features but also easily produces some redundant subspaces, inevitably leading to the decline of ensemble learning performance. In order to overcome the shortcomings, we propose a new selective quantum ensemble learning model inspired by improved AdaBoost based on local sample information (SELA). Firstly, SELA combines information entropy and random subspace to ensure that the important features of the classification task in each subspace are preserved. Then, we select the base classifier that can balance accuracy and diversity among a group of base classifiers generated based on local AdaBoost in each iteration. Finally, we utilize the quantum genetic algorithm to search optimal weights for base learners in the label prediction process. We use UCI datasets to analyze the impact of important parameters in SELA on classification performance and verify that SELA is usually superior to other competitive algorithms.

TI Controllable Josephson junction for photon Bose-Einstein condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Josephson junctions are the basis for the most sensitive magnetic flux detectors, the definition of the unit volt by the Josephson voltage standard, and superconducting digital and quantum computing. They result from the coupling of two coherent quantum states, as they occur in superconductors, superfluids, atomic Bose Einstein Condensates (BECs), and exciton-polariton condensates. In their ground state, Josephson junctions are characterized by an intrinsic phase jump. Controlling this phase jump is fundamental for applications in computing. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable phase relations between photon BECs resulting from particle exchange in a thermo-optically tunable potential landscape. Our experiment realizes an optical analog of a controllable 0,pi-Josephson junction. By connecting several junctions, we can study a reconfigurable 4-condensate system demonstrating the potential of our approach for analog spin-glass simulation. More generally, the combination of static and dynamic nanostructuring techniques introduced in our work offers a powerful platform for the implementation of adaptive optical systems for paraxial light in and outside of thermal equilibrium.

In more detail, we consider two different graphs describing the connections of agents in the network: the line graph and the ring graph. Our main interest is to deduce the dynamics for such propagation, and to investigate the influence of compliance of the agents and graph structure on the decision time and the final decision. The methodology is based on the use of control-U gates in quantum computing. The original state of the network is used as controller and its mirrored state is used as target. The state of the quantum walk is the tensor product of the original state and the mirror state. In this way, the proposed quantum walk model is able to describe asymmetric influence between agents.

TI Generalized Boltzmann relations in semiconductors including band tails
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Boltzmann relations are widely used in semiconductor physics to express the charge-carrier densities as a function of the Fermi level and temperature. However, these simple exponential relations only apply to sharp band edges of the conduction and valence bands. In this article, we present a generalization of the Boltzmann relations accounting for exponential band tails. To this end, the required Fermi-Dirac integral is first recast as a Gauss hypergeometric function followed by a suitable transformation of that special function and a zeroth-order series expansion using the hypergeometric series. This results in simple relations for the electron and hole densities that each involve two exponentials. One exponential depends on the temperature and the other one on the band-tail parameter. The proposed relations tend to the Boltzmann relations if the band-tail parameters tend to zero. This work is timely for the modeling of semiconductor devices at cryogenic temperatures for large-scale quantum computing.

TI A Fourier neural operator approach for modelling exciton-polariton
   condensate systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB A plethora of next-generation all-optical devices based on exciton-polaritons have been proposed in latest years, including prototypes of transistors, switches, analogue quantum simulators and others. However, for such systems consisting of multiple polariton condensates, it is still challenging to predict their properties in a fast and accurate manner. The condensate physics is conventionally described by polariton Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs). While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering promising implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and various photonic applications.

TI Passive demultiplexed two-photon state generation from a quantum dot
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential, we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches to multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.

TI Nonstabilizerness via Matrix Product States in the Pauli Basis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Nonstabilizerness, also known as "magic," stands as a crucial resource for achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix product states (MPSs), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis. Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropies, stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the sizes already realized.

TI A Mathematical Framework for Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation and Duality
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB Analogue Hamiltonian simulation is a promising near-term application of quantum computing and has recently been put on a theoretical footing alongside experiencing wide-ranging experimental success. These ideas are closely related to the notion of duality in physics, whereby two superficially different theories are mathematically equivalent in some precise sense. However, existing characterisations of Hamiltonian simulations are not sufficiently general to extend to all dualities in physics. We give a generalised duality definition encompassing dualities transforming a strongly interacting system into a weak one and vice versa. We characterise the dual map on operators and states and prove equivalence ofduality formulated in terms of observables, partition functions and entropies. A building block is a strengthening of earlier results on entropy preserving maps-extensions of Wigner's celebrated theorem- -to maps that are entropy preserving up to an additive constant. We show such maps decompose as a direct sum of unitary and antiunitary components conjugated by a further unitary, a result that may be of independent mathematical interest.

TI Noise Modulation-Based Reversible Data Hiding with McEliece Encryption
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB McEliece cryptosystem is expected to be the next generation of the cryptographic algorithm due to its ability to resist quantum computing attacks. Few research studies have combined it with reversible data hiding in the encrypted domain (RDH-ED). In this article, we analysed and proved that there is a redundancy in the McEliece encryption process that is suitable for embedding. Then, a noise modulation-based scheme is proposed, called NM-RDHED, which is suitable for any signal and not only for images. The content owner scrambles the original image and then encrypts it with the receiver's public key. The data hider generates a load noise by modulating additional data. After that, the load noise is added to the encrypted image, which achieves the data embedding. The reconstructed image is without any distortion after the direct decryption of the marked image, and the extracted data are no errors. The experimental results demonstrate our scheme has a higher embedding rate and more security, which is superior to existing schemes.

TI Stellar Representation of Multipartite Antisymmetric States
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Pure quantum spin-s states can be represented by 2s points on the sphere, as shown by Majorana (Nuovo Cimento 9:43-50, 1932)-the description has proven particularly useful in the study of rotational symmetries of the states, and a host of other properties, as the points rotate rigidly on the sphere when the state undergoes an SU(2) transformation in Hilbert space. We present here an extension of this representation to multipartite, totally antisymmetric (under exchange of any two qudits) states, widely known in the form of Slater determinants, and linear combinations thereof. Such states generally involve a superposition of various spin values, giving rise to a family of Majorana-like constellations, that captures their rotational transformation properties. We also point out that our results apply equally well to the characterization of degenerate linear subspaces of the Hilbert space of a single spin, of the type that appear in the Wilczek-Zee effect, and comment on potential applications to holonomic quantum computing.

TI Approaches and challenges in machine learning for monitoring
   agricultural products and predicting plant physiological responses to
   biotic and abiotic stresses
SO CURRENT PLANT BIOLOGY
AB The world's population and the subsequent demand for food are increasing at an unprecedented rate, presenting significant challenges to sustainable food production. The impact of abiotic and biotic stresses on agricultural productivity is one of the major obstacles threatening food security. As a potential solution to these challenges, advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based systems analyzing have emerged as promising solutions for improving crop yields, as well as mitigating plant stresses with high accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the increasing availability of sensor technologies and communication networks in the agriculture sector has led to the widespread adoption of ML for yield prediction and plant phenotyping, particularly on a large scale. The application of ML in conjunction with high-throughput imaging and genomic data is examined for early detection of physiological stress indicators and acceleration of crop improvement programs. This review highlights the latest technologies and approaches that are currently employed in ML and DL to effectively detect biotic and abiotic plant stresses. Despite notable progress, limitations persist in areas such as data quality, model generalization across agro-ecological zones, and field-level deployment. Emerging directions-including automated ML (AutoML), quantum machine learning, and digital twin technologies-are discussed as promising solutions for advancing precision agriculture and enhancing crop resilience under changing climatic conditions. These cutting-edge technologies have the potential to significantly enhance the sustainable production of food by efficient crop management and address the challenges posed by the growing global population and climate change, while mitigating the impacts of environmental and biotic stressors on crop production.

TI Coherent modulation of chiral nonlinear optics with crystal symmetry
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Light modulation is of paramount importance for photonics and optoelectronics. Here we report all-optical coherent modulation of third-harmonic generation (THG) with chiral light via the symmetry enabled polarization selectivity. The concept is experimentally validated in monolayer materials (MoS2) with modulation depth approaching similar to 100%, ultra-fast modulation speed (<similar to 130 fs), and wavelength-independence features. Moreover, the power and polarization of the incident optical beams can be used to tune the output chirality and modulation performance. Major performance of our demonstration reaches the fundamental limits of optical modulation: near-unity modulation depth, instantaneous speed (ultra-fast coherent interaction), compact footprint (atomic thickness), and unlimited operation bandwidth, which hold an ideal optical modulation solution for emerging and future nonlinear optical applications (e.g., interconnection, imaging, computing, and quantum technologies).

TI From entanglement certification with quench dynamics to multipartite
   entanglement of interacting fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multipartite entanglement, such as witnessed through the quantum Fisher information (QFI), is a crucial resource for quantum technologies, but its experimental certification is highly challenging. Here, we propose an experimentally friendly protocol to measure the QFI. It relies on recording the short-time dynamics of simple observables after a quench from a thermal state, works for spins, bosons, and fermions, and can be implemented in standard cold-atom experiments and other platforms with temporal control over the system Hamiltonian. To showcase the protocol, we simulate it for the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Further, we establish a family of bounds connecting the QFI to multipartite mode entanglement for fermionic systems, which enable the detection of multipartite entanglement at sizable temperatures. Our work paves a way to experimentally accessing entanglement for quantum enhanced metrology.

TI Compact quantum dot models for analog microwave co-simulation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Scalable solid-state quantum computers will require integration with analog and digital electronics. Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance. Here, we present Verilog-A compact models with a focus on quantum-dot-based systems, relevant to semiconductor- and Majorana-based quantum computing.

In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre (R), showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.

TI Large deviation-based noise mitigation in coupled quantum robotic
   systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum robotic systems hold promise for applications in molecular manipulation and high-precision sensing, but their operation is highly vulnerable to environmental noise. This work introduces a large deviation principle (LDP)-based control framework for mitigating stochastic perturbations in coupled master-slave quantum robots. The system Hamiltonian, expressed in terms of position and momentum operators, incorporates control terms alongside Gaussian and Poisson noise, capturing both gradual fluctuations and sudden jumps. By computing the large deviation rate function, we quantify the probability of rare noise-induced deviations and derive an optimal control strategy that minimizes such events in key observables. Simulations across distinct dynamical regimes demonstrate that the controlled trajectories remain close to the desired wave function, with deviations consistent with the theoretical bounds. These results validate the robustness and generality of the approach, providing a practical framework for stabilizing quantum robotic systems in noisy environments with potential applications in precision sensing, molecular chemistry, and quantum computing.

TI Measurements as a roadblock to near-term practical quantum advantage in
   chemistry: Resource analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent advances in quantum computing devices have brought attention to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) as a potential route to practical quantum advantage in chemistry. However, it is not yet clear whether such algorithms, even in the absence of device error, could actually achieve quantum advantage for systems of practical interest. We have performed an exhaustive analysis to estimate the number of qubits and number of measurements required to compute the combustion energies of small organic molecules and related systems to within chemical accuracy of experimental values using the VQE. We consider several key modern improvements to the VQE, including low-rank factorizations of the Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that, although these techniques are useful, they will not be sufficient to achieve practical quantum computational advantage for our molecular set, or for similar molecules. This suggests that novel approaches to operator estimation leveraging quantum coherence, such as enhanced likelihood functions, may be required.

SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB The ability to determine the locations of phosphorous dopants in silicon is crucial for the design, modelling, and analysis of atom-based nanoscale devices for future quantum computing applications. Recently, several papers showed that a metrology of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging combined with atomistic tight-binding simulations could be used to determine coordinates of a dopant buried close to a Si surface. We identify effects which play a crucial role in the simulation of STM images and have to be precisely modelled for STM imaging of buried dopants and multi-dopant clusters to provide reliable position information. In contrast to previous work, we demonstrate that a metrology combining STM imaging with tight-binding simulations may lead to pronounced uncertainty due to tip orbital model, effects of dangling bonds and choice of local atomic basis for the tight-binding representation. Additional work is still needed to obtain a reliable STM metrology of buried dopant position.

TI Asymmetries of thermal processes in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An intriguing phenomenon in nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions. A general understanding is obtained based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.

Triplet superconductivity results in the formation of Josephson junctions, thus with potential of being used for spintronics applications in the critical area of quantum computing. In this paper, we are showing new experimental evidence for the formation of two-dimensional (2D) spin waves in oxygen-ion enriched and in hydrogenated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The temperature evolution of the remanent magnetization M-rem(T) data confirms the formation of spin waves that follow the 2D Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy. In addition, the step-like features also found in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity between insulating and metallic states suggest several outstanding possibilities, such as a structural transition, triplet superconductivity, and chiral properties.

TI Rydberg quantum wires for maximum independent set problems
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB One application of near-term quantum computing devices(1-4) is to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems(5-8). Here we present an experimental protocol with Rydberg atoms to determine the maximum independent set of graphs(9), defined as an independent set of vertices of maximal size. Our proposal is based on a Rydberg quantum wire scheme, which exploits auxiliary atoms to engineer long-ranged networks of qubits. We experimentally test the protocol on three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of two-dimensional arrays for tackling combinatorial problems and encode high-degree vertices. We find the maximum independent set solutions with our programmable quantum-wired Rydberg simulator for Kuratowski subgraphs(10) and a six-degree graph, which are paradigmatic examples of non-planar and high-degree graphs, respectively. Our protocol provides a way to engineer the complex connections of high-degree graphs through many-body entanglement, taking a step towards the demonstration of quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization.

TI Dynamic compensation of stray electric fields in an ion trap using
   machine learning and adaptive algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Surface ion traps are among the most promising technologies for scaling up quantum computing machines, but their complicated multi-electrode geometry can make some tasks, including compensation for stray electric fields, challenging both at the level of modeling and of practical implementation. Here we demonstrate the compensation of stray electric fields using a gradient descent algorithm and a machine learning technique, which trained a deep learning network. We show automated dynamical compensation tested against induced electric charging from UV laser light hitting the chip trap surface. The results show improvement in compensation using gradient descent and the machine learner over manual compensation. This improvement is inferred from an increase of the fluorescence rate of 78% and 96% respectively, for a trapped Yb-171(+) ion driven by a laser tuned to -7.8 MHz of the S-2(1/2) <-> P-2(1/2) Doppler cooling transition at 369.5 nm.

TI A Derivative-Free Method for Quantum Perceptron Training in
   Multi-layered Neural Networks
SO NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, ICONIP 2020, PT V
SE Communications in Computer and Information Science
CT 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing
CY NOV 18-27, 2020
CL Bangkok, THAILAND
AB In this paper, we present a gradient-free approach for training multi-layered neural networks based upon quantum perceptrons. Here, we depart from the classical perceptron and the elemental operations on quantum bits, i.e. qubits, so as to formulate the problem in terms of quantum perceptrons. We then make use of measurable operators to define the states of the network in a manner consistent with a Markov process. This yields a Dirac-Von Neumann formulation consistent with quantum mechanics. Moreover, the formulation presented here has the advantage of having a computational efficiency devoid of the number of layers in the network. This, paired with the natural efficiency of quantum computing, can imply a significant improvement in efficiency, particularly for deep networks. Finally, but not least, the developments here are quite general in nature since the approach presented here can also be used for quantum-inspired neural networks implemented on conventional computers.

TI Shortcuts to Thermodynamic quasistaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The operation of near-term quantum technologies requires the development of feasible, implementable, and robust strategies of controlling complex many body systems. To this end, a variety of techniques, so-called "shortcuts to adiabaticity," have been developed. Many of these shortcuts have already been demonstrated to be powerful and implementable in distinct scenarios. Yet, it is often also desirable to have additional, approximate strategies available that are applicable to a large class of systems. Hence, in this Letter, we take inspiration from thermodynamics and propose to focus on the macrostate, rather than the microstate. Adiabatic dynamics can then be identified as such processes that preserve the equation of state, and systematic corrections are obtained from adiabatic perturbation theory. We demonstrate this approach by improving upon fast quasiadiabatic driving, and by applying the method to the quantum Ising chain in the transverse field.

TI Machine Learning in Maritime Safety for Autonomous Shipping: A
   Bibliometric Review and Future Trends
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Autonomous vessels are becoming paramount to ocean transportation, while they also face complex risks in dynamic marine environments. Machine learning plays a crucial role in enhancing maritime safety by leveraging its data analysis and predictive capabilities. However, there has been no review grounded in bibliometric analysis in this field. To explore the research evolution and knowledge frontier in the field of maritime safety for autonomous shipping, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using 719 publications from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 2000 up to May 2024. This study utilized VOSviewer, alongside traditional literature analysis methods, to construct a knowledge network map and perform cluster analysis, thereby identifying research hotspots, evolution trends, and emerging knowledge frontiers. The findings reveal a robust cooperative network among journals, researchers, research institutions, and countries or regions, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of this research domain. Through the review, we found that maritime safety machine learning methods are evolving toward a systematic and comprehensive direction, and the integration with AI and human interaction may be the next bellwether. Future research will concentrate on three main areas: evolving safety objectives towards proactive management and autonomous coordination, developing advanced safety technologies, such as bio-inspired sensors, quantum machine learning, and self-healing systems, and enhancing decision-making with machine learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), and federated learning. By visualizing collaborative networks, analyzing evolutionary trends, and identifying research hotspots, this study lays a groundwork for pioneering advancements and sets a visionary angle for the future of safety in autonomous shipping. Moreover, it also facilitates partnerships between industry and academia, making for concerted efforts in the domain of USVs.

TI Strong magnetic exchange coupling of a dibenzo-fused rhomboidal
   nanographene and its homocoupling with tunable periodicities on a metal
   surface
SO NANOSCALE
AB Open-shell nanographenes (NGs), also known as molecular pi-magnets, have recently garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and quantum computing. Tailoring of such NGs at the atomic level allows the control of their magnetic interactions. We report here the on-surface synthesis of a dibenzo-fused rhomboidal NG with predominant zigzag edges featuring an open-shell (antiferromagnetic) character and a high value of magnetic exchange coupling (MEC) on Au(111) surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) confirm its chemical structure. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements, complemented by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, reveal the open-shell character of the NG, observed as singlet-triplet inelastic excitations. Furthermore, molecular chains consisting of these NGs were fabricated with tunable periodicities through the functionalization of the precursor, showing the absence of MEC between adjacent units, which provides deeper insights into the behavior of open-shell systems and preservation of individual magnetic entities within pi-conjugated structures.

TI REWRITING FOR SYMMETRIC MONOIDAL CATEGORIES WITH COMMUTATIVE (CO)MONOID
   STRUCTURE
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB . String diagrams are pictorial representations for morphisms of symmetric monoidal categories. They constitute an intuitive and expressive graphical syntax, which has found application in a very diverse range of fields including concurrency theory, quantum computing, control theory, machine learning, linguistics, and digital circuits. Rewriting theory for string diagrams relies on a combinatorial interpretation as doublepushout rewriting of certain hypergraphs. As previously studied, there is a 'tension' in this interpretation: in order to make it sound and complete, we either need to add structure on string diagrams (in particular, Frobenius algebra structure) or pose restrictions on doublepushout rewriting (resulting in 'convex' rewriting). From the string diagram viewpoint, imposing a full Frobenius structure may not always be natural or desirable in applications, which motivates our study of a weaker requirement: commutative monoid structure. In this work we characterise string diagram rewriting modulo commutative monoid equations, via a sound and complete interpretation in a suitable notion of double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs.

TI Strategies for Enhancing Spin-Shuttling Fidelities in Si/SiGe Quantum
   Wells with Random-Alloy Disorder
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Coherent coupling between distant qubits is needed for many scalable quantum computing schemes. In quantum dot systems, one proposal for long-distance coupling is to coherently transfer electron spins across a chip in a moving dot potential. Here, we use simulations to study challenges for spin shuttling in Si/SiGe heterostructures caused by the valley degree of freedom. We show that for devices with valley splitting dominated by alloy disorder, one can expect to encounter pockets of low valley splitting, given a long-enough shuttling path. At such locations, intervalley tunneling leads to dephasing of the spin wave function, substantially reducing the shuttling fidelity. We show how to mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude, putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.

TI Quantifying the quantum nature of high-spin YSR excitations in
   transverse magnetic field
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Excitations of individual and coupled spins on superconductors provide a platform to study quantum spin impurity models as well as a pathway toward realizing topological quantum computing. Here, we characterize, using ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states of individual manganese phthalocyanine molecules with high spin on an ultrathin lead film in variable transverse magnetic field. We observe two types of YSR excitations, depending on the adsorption geometry. Using a zero-bandwidth model, we detail the role of the magnetic anisotropy, spin-spin exchange, and Kondo exchange. We illustrate that one molecular type can be treated as an individual spin, whereas the other type is best described by a coupled spin system. Using the field dependence of the YSR excitations combined with modeling, we describe the quantum phase of each excitation type. These results provide an insight into the quantum nature of YSR excitations in magnetic field and a platform to study spin impurity models on superconductors in magnetic field.

TI QuantumBound - Interactive protein generation with one-shot learning and
   hybrid quantum neural networks
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHEMISTRY
AB This paper presents a new approach for protein generation based on one-shot learning and hybrid quantum neural networks. Given a single protein complex, the system learns how to predict the remaining unknown properties, without resorting to autoregression, from the physicochemical properties of the receptor and a prior on the physicochemical properties of the ligand. In contrast with other approaches, QuantumBound learns from a single instance, not from a large dataset, as is common in deep learning. By knowing half of the properties of the ligand, the system can predict the remaining half with an average relative error of 1.43% for a dataset consisting of one hundred and twenty Covid-19 spikes complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that one-shot learning and hybrid quantum computing have been applied to protein generation.

TI An implementation of a channelizer based on a Goertzel Filter Bank for

SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION

We demonstrate how implementing a bank of many of these filters, can be used to perform a channelization of the multi-tonal input signal to retrieve the data added by the sensors. We show how this approach can be implemented in a resource-efficient manner in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) within the state-of-the-art, which allows great scalability for reading thousands of sensors; as is required by Radio Telescopes in Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) surveys using cryogenic bolometers, particles detection like Neutrino mass estimation using cryogenic calorimeters or Quantum Computing.

TI A Hybrid Model of Primary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and
   Quantum Neural Network in Financial Time Series Prediction
SO FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS
AB Financial time series are nonlinear, volatile and chaotic. Inspired by quantum computing, this paper proposed a new model, called primary ensemble empirical mode decomposition combined with quantum neural network (PEEMD-QNN) in predicting the stock index. PEEMD-QNN takes the advantages of the PEEMD which retains the main component of modal component and QNN. To demonstrate that our PEEMD-QNN model is robust, we used the new model to predict six major stock index time series in China at a specific time. Detailed experiments are implemented for both of the proposed prediction models, in which empirical mode decomposition combined with QNN (EMD-QNN), QNN and BP neural network are compared. The results demonstrate that the proposed PEEMD-QNN model has higher accuracy than BP neural network, QNN model and EMD-QNN model in stock market prediction.

TI Observation of Coexisting Weak Localization and Superconducting
   Fluctuations in Strained Sn1-xInxTe
   Thin Films
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Topological superconductors have attracted tremendous excitement as they are predicted to host Majorana zero modes that can be utilized for topological quantum computing. Candidate topological superconductor Sn1-xInxTe thin films (0 < x < 0.3) grown by molecular beam epitaxy and strained in the (111) plane are shown to host quantum interference effects in the conductivity coexisting with superconducting fluctuations above the critical temperature T-c. An analysis of the normal state magnetoresistance reveals these effects. A crossover from weak antilocalization to localization is consistently observed in superconducting samples, indicating that superconductivity originates dominantly from charge carriers occupying trivial states that may be strongly spin-orbit split. A large enhancement of the conductivity is observed above T-c, indicating the presence of superconducting fluctuations. Our results motivate a re-examination of the debated pairing symmetry of this material when subjected to quantum confinement and lattice strain.

Here we describe an alternative platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points, with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by suggesting possible setups that can potentially lead to the realization of Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

TI Photon number resolving detection with a single-photon detector and
   adaptive storage loop
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Photon number resolving (PNR) measurements are beneficial or even necessary for many applications in quantum optics. Unfortunately, PNR detectors are usually large, slow, expensive, and difficult to operate. However, if the input signal is multiplexed, photon 'click' detectors, that lack an intrinsic PNR capability, can still be used to realize photon number resolution. Here, we investigate the operation of a single click detector, together with a storage line with tunable outcoupling. Using adaptive feedback to adjust the storage outcoupling rate, the dynamic range of the detector can in certain situations be extended by up to an order of magnitude relative to a purely passive setup. An adaptive approach can thus allow for photon number variance below the quantum shot noise limit under a wider range of conditions than using a passive multiplexing approach. This can enable applications in quantum enhanced metrology and quantum computing.

AB In recent years, there have been significant advancements in various aspects of quantum computing. However, despite this substantial progress, the availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers is still out of reach and may remain so for decades. Therefore, a key challenge is to leverage current NISQ devices to achieve a quantum advantage effectively. In this context, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was proposed to potentially demonstrate computational advantages in combinatorial optimization problems using NISQ computers. Meanwhile, quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques have been developed to address errors, with their effectiveness validated in practical problems involving more than 100 qubits. Therefore, in this paper, we optimize QAOA circuits and apply various error mitigation methods, such as dynamic decoupling and Paulitwirling, to scale problem sizes on IBM quantum processors. Additionally, we discuss optimal implementation strategies for scalable QAOA. We test our implementations on Max-Cut problems and compare our results with previous works.

TI IsoqurPEKS: An Isogeny-Based Quantum-Resistant Public-Key Encryption
   Scheme with Keyword Search
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Since the convenience and advancement of cloud applications, many users (e.g., companies or individuals) adopt remote cloud services to reduce the local storage overload and computing consumption. However, before transferring them to the cloud server, users always encrypt outsourced data for the privacy of important data, which deprives flexible usage of these data. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) undoubtedly offers a precise resolution to this issue. Unfortunately, most PEKS schemes cannot fight against quantum computing attackers, which is increasingly a research hotspot. To achieve postquantum security and privacy-preserving search function, we propose a quantum-resistant PEKS scheme named IsoqurPEKS. Our proposed instantiation satisfies basic semantic security indistinguishable against chosen keyword attack (IND-CKA), and IsoqurPEKS is proved to be secure under the security model. Furthermore, we compare IsoqurPEKS with the other eight current PEKS schemes with respect to security properties, communication, and computation costs. The comparison results indicate that the proposed scheme has the best security and performance among the nine PEKS schemes.

TI Graphene-mediated ferromagnetic coupling in the nickel
   nano-islands/graphene hybrid
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Nanoscale magnetic structures are fundamental to the design and fabrication of spintronic devices and have exhibited tremendous potential superior to the conventional semiconductor devices. However, most of the magnetic moments in nanostructures are unstable due to size effect, and the possible solution based on exchange coupling between nanomagnetism is still not clear. Here, graphene-mediated exchange coupling between nanomagnets is demonstrated by depositing discrete superparamagnetic Ni nano-islands on single-crystal graphene. The heterostructure exhibits ideal two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism with clear hysteresis loops and Curie temperature up to 80 K. The intrinsic ferromagnetism in graphene and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between graphene and Ni nano-islands are revealed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and density functional theory calculations. The artificial 2D ferromagnets constitute a platform to study the coupling mechanism between complex correlated electronic systems and magnetism on the nanoscale, and the results and concept provide insights into the realization of spin manipulation in quantum computing.

TI Impact of graphene encapsulation on thermodynamics of quantum emitters
   in hexagonal boron nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant interest as single-photon emitters and spin qubits for applications in a wide range of quantum technologies. As the integration of these solid-state quantum emitters into electronic devices necessitates electrical control, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms for charge control of these defect color centers in hBN/graphene heterostructures. In this article, we show that screening due to the encapsulation of hBN by graphene modifies the electrical levels of hBN, leading to charge transfer. Furthermore, we show that the charged defects have low-energy barriers for defect reorientation which can be overcome by moderate gate voltages. This study shows that accurate modeling of the charge state of the defect is necessary to be able to electrically control defects.

TI Fisher-information susceptibility for multiparameter quantum estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noise affects the performance of quantum technologies, hence the importance of elaborating operative figures of merit that can capture its impact in exact terms. In quantum metrology, the introduction of the Fisher-information measurement noise susceptibility now allows one to quantify the robustness of measurement for single-parameter estimation. Here we extend this notion to the multiparameter quantum estimation scenario. We provide its mathematical definition in the form of a semidefinite program. Although a closed formula could not be found, we further derive an upper and a lower bound to the susceptibility. We then apply these techniques to two paradigmatic examples of multiparameter estimation: the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion and the estimation of the different parameters describing the incoherent mixture of optical point sources. Our figure of merit provides clear indications on conditions allowing or hampering robustness of multiparameter measurements.

TI Near-Surface 125Te+ Spins with Millisecond
   Coherence Lifetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Impurity spins in crystal matrices are promising components in quantum technologies, particularly if they can maintain their spin properties when close to surfaces and material interfaces. Here, we investigate an attractive candidate for microwave-domain applications, the spins of group-VI 125Te(+) donors implanted into natural Si at depths as shallow as 20 nm. We show that surface band bending can be used to ionize such near-surface Te to spin-active Te+ state, and that optical illumination can be used further to control the Te donor charge state. We examine spin activation yield, spin linewidth, and relaxation (T-1) and coherence times (T-2) and show how a zero-field 3.5 GHz "clock transition" extends spin coherence times to over 1 ms, which is about an order of magnitude longer than other near-surface spin systems.

TI Multipartite spatial entanglement generated by concurrent nonlinear
   processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable multipartite entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies. This paper considers the multipartite entanglement generated in separated spatial modes of the same light beam by three different parametric sources: a standard chi (2) medium pumped by two pumps, a single-pump nonlinear photonic crystal, and a doubly pumped nonlinear photonic crystal. These sources have in common the coexistence of several concurrent nonlinear processes in the same medium, which allows the generation of nonstandard three- and four-mode couplings. We test the genuine nature of the multipartite entangled states thereby generated in a common framework, using criteria based both on proper bounds for the variances of nonlocal observables and on the positive partial transpose criterion. The relative simplicity of these states allows a (hopefully) useful comparison of the different inseparability tests.

TI Cryogenic optical beam steering for superconducting device calibration
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL MICROSYSTEMS
AB We have developed a calibration system based on a micro-electro-mechanical system mirror that is capable of delivering an optical beam over a wavelength range of 180 to 2000 nm (0.62 to 6.89 eV) in a sub-Kelvin environment. This portable, integrated system is designed to steer the beam over an similar to 3 cmx3 cm area on the surface of any sensor with a precision of similar to 100 mu m, enabling the characterization of device response as a function of position. This fills a critical need in the landscape of calibration tools for sub-Kelvin devices, including those used for dark matter detection and quantum computing. These communities have a shared goal of understanding the impact of ionizing radiation on device performance, which can be pursued with our system. We describe the design of the first-generation calibration system and the results from successfully testing its performance at room temperature and 20 mK.

TI Efficient coupling of light to an atomic tweezer array in a cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the coupling of light, via an optical cavity, to two-dimensional atomic arrays whose lattice spacing exceeds the wavelength of the light. Such "superwavelength" spacing is typical of optical tweezer arrays. While subwavelength arrays exhibit strong atom-photon coupling, characterized by high optical reflectivity in free space, the coupling efficiency of superwavelength arrays is reduced due to collective scattering losses to high diffraction orders. We show how a moderate-finesse cavity can overcome these losses. As the scattering losses peak at certain discrete values of the lattice spacing, the spacing can be optimized to achieve efficient atom-photon coupling in the cavity. Our cavity-QED theory properly accounts for collective dipolar interactions mediated by the lossy, non-cavity-confined photon modes and for finite-size effects of both the array and the light field. These findings pave the way to harnessing the versatility of tweezer arrays for efficient atom-photon interfaces in applications of quantum computing, networking, and nonlinear optics.

TI A Modified Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm Using Lengthening
   Chromosome Size and an Adaptive Look-Up Table to Avoid Local Optima
SO AXIOMS
AB The quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QGA), which combines quantum mechanics concepts and GA to enhance search capability, has been popular and provides an efficient search mechanism. This paper proposes a modified QGA, called dynamic QGA (DQGA). The proposed algorithm utilizes a lengthening chromosome strategy for a balanced and smooth transition between exploration and exploitation phases to avoid local optima and premature convergence. Apart from that, a novel adaptive look-up table for rotation gates is presented to boost the algorithm's optimization abilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of these ideas, DQGA is tested by various mathematical benchmark functions as well as real-world constrained engineering problems against several well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results indicate the merits of the proposed algorithm and its superiority for solving multimodal benchmark functions and real-world constrained engineering problems.

TI Small Charging Energies and g-Factor Anisotropy in PbTe Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB ABSTRACT: PbTe is a semiconductor with promising properties for topological quantum computing applications. Here, we characterize electron quantum dots in PbTe nanowires selectively grown on InP. Charge stability diagrams at zero magnetic field reveal large even???odd spacing between Coulomb blockade peaks, charging energies below 140 ??eV and Kondo peaks in odd Coulomb diamonds. We attribute the large even???odd spacing to the large dielectric constant and small effective electron mass of PbTe. By studying the Zeeman-induced level and Kondo splitting in finite magnetic fields, we extract the electron g-factor as a function of magnetic field direction. We find the g-factor tensor to be highly anisotropic with principal g-factors ranging from 0.9 to 22.4 and to depend on the electronic configuration of the devices. These results indicate strong Rashba spin???orbit interaction in our PbTe quantum dots.

TI Quantum software testing: State of the art
SO JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
AB Quantum computing is expected to exponentially outperform classic computing on a broad set of problems, including encryption, machine learning, and simulations. It has an impact yet to explore on all software lifecycle's processes and techniques. Testing quantum software raises a significant number of challenges due to the unique properties of quantum physics-such as superposition and entanglementand the stochastic behavior of quantum systems. It is, therefore, an open research issue. In this work, we offer a systematic mapping study of quantum software testing engineering, presenting a comprehensive view of the current state of the art. The main identified trends in testing techniques are (1) the statistic approaches based on repeated measurements and (2) the use of Hoare-like logics to reason about software correctness. Another relevant line of research is reversible circuit testing, which is partially applicable to quantum software unitary testing. Finally, we have observed a flourishing of secondary studies and frameworks supporting testing processes from 2018 onwards.

TI Vacancy Spectroscopy of Non-Abelian Kitaev Spin Liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spin vacancies in the non -Abelian Kitaev spin liquid are known to harbor Majorana zero modes, potentially enabling topological quantum computing at elevated temperatures. Here, we study the spectroscopic signatures of such Majorana zero modes in a scanning tunneling setup where a nonAbelian Kitaev spin liquid with a finite density of spin vacancies forms a tunneling barrier between a tip and a substrate. Our key result is a well-defined peak close to zero bias voltage in the derivative of the tunneling conductance whose voltage and intensity both increase with the density of vacancies. This "quasi -zerovoltage peak" is identified as the closest analog of the zero -voltage peak observed in topological superconductors that additionally reflects the fractionalized nature of spin -liquid -based Majorana zero modes. We further highlight a single-fermion Van Hove singularity at a higher voltage that reveals the energy scale of the emergent Majorana fermions in the Kitaev spin liquid. Our proposed signatures are within reach of current experiments on the candidate material alpha-RuCl3.

TI Inelastic electron scattering induced quantum coherence in molecular
   dynamics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum coherence is pivotal in various applications ranging from chemical control to quantum computing. An example of its manifestation in molecular dynamics is inversion symmetry breaking in the photodissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules. On the other hand, the dissociative attachment of an incoherent electron also induces such coherent dynamics. However, these processes are resonant and occur for projectiles with a specific energy. Here we present the most general scenario of non-resonant inelastic electron scattering inducing such a quantum coherence in molecular dynamics. The ion-pair formation (H+ + H-) that proceeds after the electron impact excitation of H-2 shows a forward-backward asymmetry about the incoming electron beam. Simultaneous transfer of multiple angular momentum quanta during the electron collision induces the underlying coherence in the system. The non-resonant nature of this processmakes this effect generic and points to its possible prevalent role in particle collision processes, including electron-induced chemistry.

TI Non-linear Boson Sampling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Boson Sampling is a task that is conjectured to be computationally hard for a classical computer, but which can be efficiently solved by linear-optical interferometers with Fock state inputs. Significant advances have been reported in the last few years, with demonstrations of small- and medium-scale devices, as well as implementations of variants such as Gaussian Boson Sampling. Besides the relevance of this class of computational models in the quest for unambiguous experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage, recent results have also proposed the first applications for hybrid quantum computing. Here, we introduce the adoption of non-linear photon-photon interactions in the Boson Sampling framework, and analyze the enhancement in complexity via an explicit linear-optical simulation scheme. By extending the computational expressivity of Boson Sampling, the introduction of non-linearities promises to disclose novel functionalities for this class of quantum devices. Hence, our results are expected to lead to new applications of near-term, restricted photonic quantum computers.

TI Tunable Planar Josephson Junctions Driven by Time-Dependent Spin-Orbit
   Coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The integration of conventional superconductors with common III-V semiconductors provides a versatile platform to implement tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) and their applications. We propose that with gate-controlled time-dependent spin-orbit coupling, it is possible to strongly modify the current-phase relations and Josephson energy and provide a mechanism to drive the JJ dynamics, even in the absence of any bias current. We show that the transition between stable phases is realized with a simple linear change in the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, while the transition rate can exceed the gate-induced electric field gigahertz changes by an order of magnitude. The resulting interplay between the constant effective magnetic field and changing spin-orbit coupling has direct implications for superconducting spintronics, the control of Majorana bound states, and emerging qubits. We argue that topological superconductivity, sought for fault-tolerant quantum computing, offers simpler applications in superconducting electronics and spintronics.

TI SPEEDY Quantum Circuit for Grover's Algorithm
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we propose a quantum circuit for the SPEEDY block cipher for the first time and estimate its security strength based on the post-quantum security strength presented by NIST. The strength of post-quantum security for symmetric key cryptography is estimated at the cost of the Grover key retrieval algorithm. Grover's algorithm in quantum computers reduces the n-bit security of block ciphers to n/2 bits. The implementation of a quantum circuit is required to estimate the Grover's algorithm cost for the target cipher. We estimate the quantum resource required for Grover's algorithm by implementing a quantum circuit for SPEEDY in an optimized way and show that SPEEDY provides either 128-bit security (i.e., NIST security level 1) or 192-bit security (i.e., NIST security level 3) depending on the number of rounds. Based on our estimated cost, increasing the number of rounds is insufficient to satisfy the security against quantum attacks on quantum computers.

TI A method to improve quantum state fidelity in circuits executed on IBM's
   quantum computers
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, various quantum computing and communication tasks have been implemented using IBM's superconductivitybased quantum computers. Here, we show that the circuits used in most of those works were not optimized and obtain the corresponding optimized circuits. Optimized circuits implementable in IBM quantum computers are also obtained for a set of reversible benchmark circuits. With a clear example, it is shown that the reduction in circuit cost enhances the fidelity of the output state (with respect to the theoretically expected state in the absence of noise) as fewer gates and less circuit depth introduce fewer errors during evolution of the state. Further, considering Mermin inequality as an example, it is shown that the violation of the classical limit is enhanced when we use optimized circuits. Thus, the present approach can be used to identify a relatively weaker signature of quantumness and to establish quantum supremacy in a stronger manner.

TI Two-Dimensional Beam Selection by Multiarmed Bandit Algorithm Based on a
   Quantum Walk
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article proposes a novel beam selection method using a multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithm based on a quantum walk (QW) principle, aimed at improving system performance. A massive multiple-input multiple-output system, employing multiple high-gain beams within a high-frequency band, is indispensable for achieving large capacity in future wireless communications. However, as the number of beams increases, selecting the most appropriate beam for each user becomes challenging due to the extensive search space and necessitating the development of a more efficient beam selection method. Therefore, we formulate a systematic process for beam selection employing the MAB algorithm rooted in QW principles. We derive the optimal parameters of this method to maximize achievable channel capacity. Through numerical analysis, we validate that the proposed method yields a greater channel capacity than that achieved not only by traditional MAB algorithms but also by an exhaustive search with overhead.

TI Modeling routing problems in QUBO with application to ride-hailing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Many emerging commercial services are based on the sharing or pooling of resources for common use with the aim of reducing costs. Businesses such as delivery-, mobility-, or transport-as-a-service have become standard in many parts of the world, fulfilling on-demand requests for customers in live settings. However, it is known that many of these problems are NP-hard, and therefore both modeling and solving them accurately is a challenge. Here we focus on one such routing problem, the Ride Pooling Problem (RPP), where multiple customers can request on-demand pickups and drop-offs from shared vehicles within a fleet. The combinatorial optimization task is to optimally pool customer requests using the limited set of vehicles, akin to a small-scale flexible bus route. In this work, we propose a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) program and introduce efficient formulation methods for the RPP to be solved using metaheuristics, and specifically emerging quantum optimization algorithms.

TI Chemical mechanical polishing for indium bond pad damascene processing
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We investigated chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of indium, with the goal of obtaining indium bond pads for later cryo-3D integration of quantum computing-related chips, through bonding between these bond pads and indium bumps. Higher removal rates were obtained with soft CMP pads than with hard pads. The latter led to deep scratching, while this effect was much more limited for soft pad CMP. On patterned wafers, indium is cleared well in structured areas using soft pad CMP, leading to relatively high-quality indium surfaces inside bond pads, although corrosion might be of some concern. Pattern density uniformity was an important factor for within-die deviation in indium clearing time. Dishing was much more limited than in earlier work on indium polishing, while surface roughness was also found to be relatively limited. The obtained indium damascene bond pads may be suitable for 3D die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer bonding through indium pad-to-bump bonding.

TI Vertical GeSn nanowire MOSFETs for CMOS beyond silicon
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB The continued downscaling of silicon CMOS technology presents challenges for achieving the required low power consumption. While high mobility channel materials hold promise for improved device performance at low power levels, a material system which enables both high mobility n-FETs and p-FETs, that is compatible with Si technology and can be readily integrated into existing fabrication lines is required. Here, we present high performance, vertical nanowire gate-all-around FETs based on the GeSn-material system grown on Si. While the p-FET transconductance is increased to 850 mu S/mu m by exploiting the small band gap of GeSn as source yielding high injection velocities, the mobility in n-FETs is increased 2.5-fold compared to a Ge reference device, by using GeSn as channel material. The potential of the material system for a future beyond Si CMOS logic and quantum computing applications is demonstrated via a GeSn inverter and steep switching at cryogenic temperatures, respectively.

TI A Theoretical Design of Chiral Molecules through Conformational Lock
   towards Circularly Polarized Luminescence
SO PHOTONICS
AB Circularly polarized (CP) light has shown great potential in quantum computing, optical communications, and three-dimensional displays. It is still a challenge to produce high-efficiency and high-purity CP light. Herein, we proposed a strategy to design chiral organic small molecules for CP light generation. These kinds of chiral molecules are formed by achiral light-emitting groups and achiral alkyl chains through conformational lock, which indicates that chirality can also be introduced into achiral light-emitting groups through rational molecular design. The chirality of these molecules can be further tuned by changing the length of the alkyl chains connecting the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit. The chiroptical properties of these molecules are confirmed by calculated electronic circular dichroism and chiral emission spectra, and further confirmed in experiments. The strategy developed in this work will greatly enlarge the candidate library of chiral luminescent materials.

TI Topological superconductivity in skyrmion lattices
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Atomic manipulation and interface engineering techniques have provided an intriguing approach to custom-designing topological superconductors and the ensuing Majorana zero modes, representing a paradigm for the realization of topological quantum computing and topology-based devices. Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have proven to be experimentally suitable to engineer topological superconductivity through the control of both the complex structure of its magnetic layer and the interface properties of the superconducting surface. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional MSH systems containing a magnetic skyrmion lattice provide an unprecedented ability to control the emergence of topological phases. By changing the skyrmion radius, which can be achieved experimentally through an external magnetic field, one can tune between different topological superconducting phases, allowing one to explore their unique properties and the transitions between them. In these MSH systems, Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy spatially visualizes one of the most crucial aspects underlying the emergence of topological superconductivity, the spatial structure of the induced spin-triplet correlations.

TI Edge supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on topological materials
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the Phi 0-periodic oscillation, and the 2 Phi 0-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field (Phi 0 = h/2e is the flux quantum, h the Planck constant, and e the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.

SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The Kitaev honeycomb model plays a pivotal role in the quest for quantum spin liquids, in which fractional quasiparticles would provide applications in decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The key ingredient is the bond-dependent Ising-type interactions, dubbed the Kitaev interactions, which require strong entanglement between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Here we investigate the identification and design of rare-earth materials displaying robust Kitaev interactions. We scrutinize all possible 4f electron configurations, which require up to 6+ million intermediate states in the perturbation processes, by developing a parallel computational program designed for massive-scale calculations. Our analysis reveals a predominant interplay between the isotropic Heisenberg J and anisotropic Kitaev K interactions across all realizations of the Kramers doublets. Remarkably, instances featuring 4f(3) and 4f(11) configurations showcase the prevalence of K over J, presenting unexpected prospects for exploring the Kitaev quantum spin liquids in compounds, including Nd3+ and Er3+, respectively.

TI Multi-ion Frequency Reference Using Dynamical Decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present the experimental realization of a continuous dynamical decoupling scheme which suppresses leading frequency shifts in a multi-ion frequency reference based on 40 Ca + . By near-resonant magnetic coupling of the 2S1/2 S 1/2 and 2D5/2 D 5/2 Zeeman sublevels using radio-frequency dressing fields, engineered transitions with reduced sensitivity to magnetic-field fluctuations are obtained. A second stage detuned dressing field reduces the influence of amplitude noise in the first stage driving fields and decreases 2nd-rank tensor shifts, such as the electric quadrupole shift. Suppression of the quadratic dependence of the quadrupole shift to 3(2) mHz/mu m2 / mu m 2 and coherence times of 290(20) ms on the optical transition are demonstrated even within a laboratory environment with significant magnetic field noise. Besides removing inhomogeneous line shifts in multi-ion clocks, the demonstrated dynamical decoupling technique may find applications in quantum computing and simulation with trapped ions by a tailored design of decoherence-free subspaces.

TI An efficient confidentiality scheme based on quadratic chaotic map and
   Fibonacci sequence
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, secure data transmission and exchange are crucial for protecting sensitive information across personal, financial, and global infrastructures. Traditional cryptographic algorithms like RSA and AES face increasing challenges due to the rise of quantum computing and enhanced computational power, necessitating innovative approaches for data security. We explored a novel encryption scheme leveraging the quadratic chaotic map (QCM) integrated with the Fibonacci sequence, addressing key sensitivity, periodicity, and computational efficiency. By employing chaotic systems' inherent unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions, the proposed method generates highly secure and unpredictable ciphers suitable for text and image encryption. We incorporated a combined sequence from the Fibonacci sequence and QCM, providing enhanced complexity and security. Comprehensive experimental analyses, including noise and occlusion attack simulations, demonstrate the scheme's robustness, resilience, and practicality. The results indicated that the proposed encryption framework offers a secure, efficient, and adaptable solution for digital data protection against modern computational threats.

TI Trimmed sampling algorithm for the noisy generalized eigenvalue problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Solving the generalized eigenvalue problem is a useful method for finding energy eigenstates of large quantum systems. It uses projection onto a set of basis states which are typically not orthogonal. One needs to invert a matrix whose entries are inner products of the basis states, and the process is unfortunately susceptible to even small errors. The problem is especially bad when matrix elements are evaluated using stochastic methods and have significant error bars. In this work, we introduce the trimmed sampling algorithm in order to solve this problem. Using the framework of Bayesian inference, we sample prior probability distributions determined by uncertainty estimates of the various matrix elements and likelihood functions composed of physics-informed constraints. The result is a probability distribution for the eigenvectors and observables which automatically comes with a reliable estimate of the error and performs far better than standard regularization methods. The method should have immediate use for a wide range of applications involving classical and quantum computing calculations of large quantum systems.

TI A self-similar sine-cosine fractal architecture for multiport
   interferometers
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Multiport interferometers based on integrated beamsplitter meshes have recently captured interest as a platform for many emerging technologies. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for multiport interferometers based on the sine-cosine fractal decomposition of a unitary matrix. Our architecture is unique in that it is self-similar, enabling the construction of modular multi-chiplet devices. Due to this modularity, our design enjoys improved resilience to hardware imperfections as compared to conventional multiport interferometers. Additionally, the structure of our circuit enables systematic truncation, which is key in reducing the hardware footprint of the chip as well as compute time in training optical neural networks, while maintaining full connectivity. Numerical simulations show that truncation of these meshes gives robust performance even under large fabrication errors. This design is a step forward in the construction of large-scale programmable photonics, removing a major hurdle in scaling up to practical machine learning and quantum computing applications.

TI Steering Room-Temperature Plexcitonic Strong Coupling: A Diexcitonic
   Perspective
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Plexcitonic strong coupling between a plasmonpolariton and a quantum emitter empowers ultrafast quantum manipulations in the nanoscale under ambient conditions. The main body of previous studies deals with homogeneous quantum emitters. To enable multiqubit states for future quantum computing and network, the strong coupling involving two excitons of the same material but different resonant energies has been investigated and observed primarily at very low temperature. Here, we report a room-temperature diexcitonic strong coupling (DiSC) nanosystem in which the excitons of a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer and dye molecules are both strongly coupled to a single Au nanocube. Coherent information exchange in this DiSC nanosystem could be observed even when exciton energy detuning is about five times larger than the respective line widths. The strong coupling behaviors in such a DiSC nanosystem can be manipulated by tuning the plasmon resonant energies and the coupling strengths, opening up a paradigm of controlling plasmon-assisted coherent energy transfer.

TI Superconductivity in type-II Weyl-semimetal WTe2 induced by a
   normal metal contact
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB WT
   e 2 is a material with rich topological properties: it is a 2D topological insulator as a monolayer and a Weyl-semimetal and higher-order topological insulator in a bulk form. Inducing superconductivity in topological materials is a way to obtain topological superconductivity, which lays at the foundation for many proposals of fault tolerant quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of superconductivity at the interface between
   WT
   e 2 and the normal metal palladium. The superconductivity has a critical temperature of about 1.2K. By studying the superconductivity in a perpendicular magnetic field, we obtain the coherence length and the London penetration depth. These parameters correspond to a low Fermi velocity and a high density of states at the Fermi level. This hints to a possible origin of superconductivity due to the formation of flatbands. Furthermore, the critical in-plane magnetic field exceeds the Pauli limit, suggesting a non-trivial nature of the superconducting state.

TI First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing
   Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.

TI High-performance chiral mirrors by twisted anisotropic photonic crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The capability of anisotropic media to exert an optical torque on electromagnetic fields is crucial for polarization control. Here we investigate twisted layered stacks of uniaxial anisotropic media to engineer chiral mirrors for the manipulation of circularly polarized light by adjusting the layer number, thicknesses, and orientation. To this aim, we undertake a comprehensive theoretical analysis devising a multilayered twisted anisotropic photonic crystal enabling highly efficient circular polarization manipulation functionalities, i.e., showing concurring close-to-unitary helicity-preserving reflectance of one circular polarization and transmittance of the opposite one. Owing to the angular-momentum manipulation concept enabled by our proposed devices, we envisage that such chiral mirrors are promising candidates for an alternative class of integrated circular polarizers, holding great potential for applications in quantum technologies, polarization-sensitive optical detectors, and electro-optical information processing.

TI Sparse Keyword Data Analysis Using Bayesian Pattern Mining
SO COMPUTERS
AB Keyword data analysis aims to extract and interpret meaningful relationships from large collections of text documents. A major challenge in this process arises from the extreme sparsity of document-keyword matrices, where the majority of elements are zeros due to zero inflation. To address this issue, this study proposes a probabilistic framework called Bayesian Pattern Mining (BPM), which integrates Bayesian inference into association rule mining (ARM). The proposed method estimates both the expected values and credible intervals of interestingness measures such as confidence and lift, providing a probabilistic evaluation of keyword associations. Experiments conducted on 9436 quantum computing patent documents, from which 175 representative keywords were extracted, demonstrate that BPM yields more stable and interpretable associations than conventional ARM. By incorporating credible intervals, BPM reduces the risk of biased decisions under sparsity and enhances the reliability of keyword-based technology analysis, offering a rigorous approach for knowledge discovery in zero-inflated text data.

TI Quantum Software Engineering: Roadmap and Challenges Ahead
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB As quantum computers advance, the complexity of the software they can execute increases as well. To ensure this software is efficient, maintainable, reusable, and cost-effective-key qualities of any industry-grade software-mature software engineering practices must be applied throughout its design, development, and operation. However, the significant differences between classical and quantum software make it challenging to directly apply classical software engineering methods to quantum systems. This challenge has led to the emergence of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) as a distinct field within the broader software engineering landscape. In this work, a group of active researchers analyze in depth the current state of QSE research. From this analysis, the key areas of QSE are identified and explored in order to determine the most relevant open challenges that should be addressed in the next years. These challenges help identify necessary breakthroughs and future research directions for advancing QSE.

AB Superconducting through silicon vias are emerging as a key interconnect technology to realise a scalable superconducting quantum computing platform. Integration of semiconductor technology into quantum devices is becoming more common whilst quantum devices are taking advantage of novel combinations of plasma processes and materials to realise more qubits and denser integration. In this letter, plasma processes for fabrication of superconducting niobium nitride TSVs have been developed by means of deep silicon etching, plasma polishing and atomic layer deposition. Key steps were experimentally investigated for their impact on etching and deposition results. The underlying mechanisms have been analysed to optimise the whole process flow. Sidewall topography significantly influenced conformality of niobium nitride deposition into deep features. As a result, high-quality vertical superconducting through silicon vias were obtained with a transition temperature of 10.7 K.

TI 40.1-GHz sub-freezing 850-nm VCSEL : microwave extraction of cavity
   lifetimes and small-signal equivalent circuit modeling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present an 850-nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) constructed for a wide operating temperature range from 25 degrees C to -50 degrees C sub-freezing temperature, demonstrating 40.1-GHz at -50 degrees C. The optical spectra, junction temperature, and microwave equivalent circuit modeling of a sub-freezing 850-nm VCSEL between -50 degrees C and 25 degrees C are also discussed. Reduced optical losses, higher efficiencies, and shorter cavity lifetimes at sub-freezing temperatures are the leading causes of the improved laser output powers and bandwidths. The e-h recombination lifetime and the cavity photon lifetime are shortened to 113 and 4.1 ps, respectively. Could potentially supercharge VCSEL-based sub-freezing optical links for applications in frigid weather, quantum computing, sensing, aerospace, etc.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Understanding mechanism of performance improvement in nitrogen-doped
   niobium superconducting radio frequency cavity
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS
AB IMPACT STATEMENT A comprehensive structural and chemical study of the Nb/air interface from the non-doped and nitrogen-doped niobium cavity helps to understand the performance improvement mechanisms of the nitrogen-doped cavity.
   Niobium superconducting radiofrequency cavities enable applications in modern accelerators and quantum computers. However, the surface resistance significantly deteriorates the cavities' performance. Nitrogen doping surface treatment can consistently increase cavity performance by reducing surface resistance, but the improvement mechanism is not fully understood. Herein, we employed transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy to uncover the structural and chemical differences of the Nb/air interface between the non-doped and nitrogen-doped cavities. The results indicate that nitrogen doping passivates the Nb surface by introducing a compressive stress/strain close to the Nb/air interface, which impedes the diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen atoms and reduces surface oxide thickness.

AB Reversible computation is a paradigm allowing computation to proceed not only in the usual, forward direction, but also backwards. Reversible computation has been studied in a variety of models, including sequential and concurrent programming languages, automata, process calculi, Turing machines, circuits, Petri nets, event structures, term rewriting, quantum computing, and others. Also, it has found applications in areas as different as low-power computing, debugging, simulation, robotics, database design, and biochemical modeling. Thus, while the broad idea of reversible computation is the same in all the areas, it has been interpreted and adapted to fit the various settings. The existing notions of reversible computation however have never been compared and categorized in detail. This work aims at being a first stepping stone towards a taxonomy of the approaches that co-exist under the term reversible computation. We hope that such a work will shed light on the relation among the various approaches.

TI Universal Dependence of Nuclear Spin Relaxation on the Concentration of
   Paramagnetic Centers in Nano- and Microdiamonds
SO MATERIALS
AB An analysis of our data on H-1 and C-13 spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times and rates in aqueous suspensions of purified nanodiamonds produced by detonation technique (DNDs), DNDs with grafted paramagnetic ions, and micro- and nanodiamonds produced by milling bulk high-temperature high-pressure diamonds is presented. It has been established that in all the studied materials, the relaxation rates depend linearly on the concentration of diamond particles in suspensions, the concentration of grafted paramagnetic ions, and surface paramagnetic defects produced by milling, while the relaxation times exhibit a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of paramagnetic centers. This is a universal law that is valid for suspensions, gels, and solids. The results obtained will expand the understanding of the properties of nano- and microdiamonds and will be useful for their application in quantum computing, spintronics, nanophotonics, and biomedicine.

TI Multimode metrology via scattershot sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Scattershot photon sources are known to have useful properties for optical quantum computing and bosonsampling purposes, in particular for scaling to large numbers of photons. This paper investigates the application of these scattershot sources towards the metrological task of estimating an unknown phase shift. In this regard, we introduce three different scalable multimode interferometers and quantify their quantum Fisher information performance using scattershot sources with arbitrary system sizes. We show that two of the interferometers need the probing photons to be in certain input configurations to beat the classical shot-noise precision limit, while the remaining interferometer has the necessary symmetry which allows it to always beat the classical limit no matter the input configuration. However, we can prove that all three interferometers give the same amount of information on average, which can be shown to beat the classical precision limit. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to compare the interferometers in different experimentally relevant regimes, as a function of the number of samples.

TI Tunable Spin-Orbit Splitting in Bilayer Graphene/WSe2 Quantum
   Devices
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) complicates spin and valley manipulation. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhances the SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding SOC strength and tunability. Here, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe2 heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we reproducibly demonstrate spin-orbit splitting up to 1.5 meV-more than 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine BLG. Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression via the perpendicular electric field. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish the SOC as a control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.

TI Quantum Divide and Conquer
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The divide-and-conquer framework, used extensively in classical algorithm design, recursively breaks a problem of size n into smaller subproblems (say, a copies of size n/b each), along with some auxiliary work of cost Caux(n), to give a recurrence relation C(n) <= a C(n/b) + Caux(n) for the classical complexity C(n). We describe a quantum divide-and-conquer framework that, in certain cases, yields an analogous recurrence relation CQ(n) <= root aCQ(n/b) + O(Caux Q (n)) that characterizes the quantum query complexity. We apply this framework to obtain near-optimal quantum query complexities for various string problems, such as (i) recognizing the regular language Sigma & lowast;20 & lowast;2 Sigma & lowast; over the alphabet Sigma = {0, 1, 2}; (ii) decision versions of String Rotation and String Suffix; and natural parameterized versions of (iii) Longest Increasing Subsequence and (iv) Longest Common Subsequence.

TI Quantum-Dot CA-Based Fredkin Gate and Conservative D-Latch for
   Reliability-Based Information Transmission on Reversible Computing
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Reversible computation is very important to minimize energy dissipation and prevent information loss not only in quantum computing but also in digital computing. Therefore, interest in designing efficient universal logic gates has recently increased. In this study, we efficiently design the Fredkin gate (FRG), a well-known conservative reversible operation gate, using quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA), and propose a D-latch using it. The proposed FRG structure can be designed efficiently using the structure of a QCA multiplexer using cell interaction, and a symmetric structure was designed. The proposed structure was simulated using QCADesigner 2.0.3 and QCADesigner-E for accurate comparison of various performance metrics, and the proposed structure clearly shows superiority in most performances and two representative design costs. Therefore, the lightweight design of an efficient reversible gate prevents data loss and increases information reliability.

AB MemComputing is a new physics-based approach to computation that employs time non-locality (memory) to both process and store information on the same physical location [1]. Its digital version is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. A practical realization of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) can be accomplished via circuits of non-linear dynamical systems with memory engineered so that periodic orbits and chaos can be avoided. A given logic (or algebraic) problem is first mapped into this type of dynamical system whose point attractors represent the solutions of the original problem. A DMM then finds the solution via a succession of elementary avalanches (instantons) whose role is to eliminate configurations of logical inconsistency ("logical defects") from the circuit. I will discuss the physics behind MemComputing and show many examples of its applicability to various combinatorial optimization problems, Machine Learning, and Quantum Mechanics, demonstrating its advantages over traditional approaches and even quantum computing.

TI Advances in bismuth-based topological quantum materials by scanning
   tunneling microscopy
SO MATERIALS FUTURES
AB In recent years, topological quantum materials (TQMs) have attracted intensive attention in the area of condensed matter physics due to their novel topologies and their promising applications in quantum computing, spin electronics and next-generation integrated circuits. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) is regarded as a powerful technique to characterize the local density of states with atomic resolution, which is ideally suited to the measurement of the bulk-boundary correspondence of TQMs. In this review, using STM/STS, we focus on recent research on bismuth-based TQMs, including quantum-spin Hall insulators, 3D weak topological insulators (TIs), high-order TIs, topological Dirac semi-metals and dual TIs. Efficient methods for the modulation of the topological properties of the TQMs are introduced, such as interlayer interaction, thickness variation and local electric field perturbation. Finally, the challenges and prospects for this field of study are discussed.

TI Variable-Temperature Noise Characterization of N-MOSFETs Using an
   In-Situ Broadband Amplifier
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB Characterization of broadband noise of MOSFETs from room temperature down to 120 K in fine temperature steps is presented. A MOSFET is mounted on a reusable printed circuit board vehicle with a built-in low-noise amplifier, and the vehicle is loaded into a cryogenic chamber. The vehicle allows noise measurement in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 100 MHz. At low frequencies, it enables extraction of activation energies associated with electron trapping sites. At high frequencies, as has been suggested by noise figure measurements, the white noise of MOSFETs is shown to be dominated by the shot noise, which has much weaker temperature dependence than the thermal noise. The shot noise will be a problematic noise source in broadband RF CMOS circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Quantum wave function reconstruction by free-electron spectral shearing
   interferometry
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The quantum wave function measurement of a free electron remains challenging in quantum mechanics and is subject to disputes about ?-ontic/epistemic interpretations of the wave function. Here, we theoretically propose a realistic spectral method for reconstructing quantum wave function of an electron pulse, free-electron spectral shearing interferometry (FESSI). We use a Wien filter to generate two time-delayed replicas of the electron wave packet and then shift one replica in energy using a light-electron modulator driven by a mid-infrared laser. As a direct demonstration, we numerically reconstruct a pulsed electron wave function with a kinetic energy of 10 keV. FESSI is experimentally feasible and enables us to fully determine distinct orders of spectral phases and their physical implications in quantum foundations and quantum technologies, providing a universal approach to characterize ultrashort electron pulses.

TI A Setting Optimization Ensemble for a Distributed Power Grid Protective
   Relay
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB To ensure a stable and reliable power supply, the valid and timely response of protective relays are indispensable. Through the prevention of fault expansions, potential equipment damage or system collapse can be averted, where their setting is one vital prerequisite for such effective implementations. However, the increasing complexity of distribution power systems results in more challenges for protection tuning strategies. Ergo, this paper presents an ensemble that combines the independent factor evaluation (IFE) and quantum genetic optimization (QGO) models to further optimize the performance of relays according to their distributed tuning environment. In this ensemble, both near and far-end fault characteristics can be incorporated. In the first stage, the IFE dimensional reduction model is deployed for massive heterogeneous input data, where the statistical independence of input signals is calculated, the linear transformation matrix to decouple mixed signals is found, the linear combination of such signals is formed, and the non-Gaussian property to sort them is established. This can ameliorate the following calculation efficiency under those high-dimensional data scenarios. Subsequently, the QGO model is designed to further improve relay settings, where qubit representation is built to reduce required chromosomes, the linear superposition of the optimal solution probability in different states is implemented for a better diversity and convergence performance, and a self-adaption quantum gate is established to dynamically update the qubit chromosome groups and two-state solution combinations. Lastly, an empirical case study is presented, which validates the enhanced convergence, accuracy, and rapidity of the proposed ensemble.

TI Sub-hertz-linewidth hybrid-integrated laser for isolator-free silicon
   photonics
SO OPTICA
AB This work presents a hybrid-integrated external-cavity laser with a 0.45 Hz Lorentzian linewidth and exceptional feedback tolerance of up to-8.1 dB, enabling isolator-free photonic integrated circuits. Unlike current high-Q locking configurations, our approach leverages a broadband external cavity, effectively mitigating thermorefractive noise and mode-hopping while ensuring stable operation. Through a detailed analysis of noise suppression in low-Q locking configurations, we demonstrate that extending the external cavity to increase the effective photon lifetime achieves noise suppression comparable to high-Q locking. This relaxes the stringent Q-factor requirements for self-injection locking, enabling chip-scale lasers with coherence surpassing bulky fiber lasers while maintaining compatibility with broadband external cavities. The demonstrated ultra-high coherence and strong feedback insensitivity make this laser an ideal candidate for large-scale heterogeneous photonic integration, with transformative applications in optical and quantum computing, precision sensing, and metrology.

TI Fast switching of the rf trapping field in an ion trap
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Radiofrequency ion traps are essential for many experiments, ranging from quantum computing to physical chemistry and fundamental science. However, in some circumstances the trapping fields may cause undesired effects and need to be switched off briefly during operation without compromising the trap stability. By employing interference in the trap resonator circuit to enable switching faster than the resonator's natural decay, the electric field in the trap can be extinguished by >50 dB. We have demonstrated that it is possible to switch a linear Paul trap off for several microseconds without the loss of Ca-40(+) ions, even for large three-dimensional ion crystals, and have examined the effect of the switching parameters on the ion dynamics by monitoring the fluorescence rate. We have loaded N(2)(+ )ions into a crystal of trapped calcium ions via photoionisation using this technique, demonstrating that it is also possible to capture ions despite the absence of a trapping field during the ionisation.

TI Direct observation of nanometer size hydride precipitations in
   superconducting niobium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Superconducting niobium serves as a key enabling material for superconducting radio frequency (SRF) technology as well as quantum computing devices. Niobium has a high propensity for the uptake of hydrogen. At room temperature, hydrogen commonly occupies tetragonal sites in the Nb lattice as the metal (M)-gas (H) phase. When the temperature is decreased, however, a solid solution of Nb-H begins to precipitate. In this study, we show the first identified topographical features associated with nanometer-size hydride phase (Nb1-xHx) precipitates on the surface of the metallic superconducting niobium using cryogenic-atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further, high energy grazing incidence X-ray diffraction reveals information regarding the structure and stoichiometry of these precipitates. Finally, through time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), we locate atomic hydrogen sources near the top surface. This systematic study clarifies nanometer scale hydrides precipitated on the surface of the SRF Nb cavity that exhibit performance degradation at a high accelerating field regime.

TI Quantum size effects in ultra-thin
   YBa2Cu3O7-x films
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The d-wave symmetry of the order parameter with zero energy gap in nodal directions stands in the way of using high-temperature superconductors for quantum applications. We investigate the symmetry of the order parameter in ultra-thin YBa2Cu3O7 - x (YBCO) films by measuring the electrical transport properties of nanowires aligned at different angles relative to the main crystallographic axes. The anisotropy of the nanowire critical current in the nodal and antinodal directions reduces with the decrease in the film thickness. The Andreev reflection spectroscopy of the nanoconstrictions shows the presence of a thickness-dependent energy gap that does not exist in bulk YBCO. We find that the thickness-dependent energy gap appears due to the quantum size effects in ultra-thin YBCO films that open the energy gap along the entire Fermi surface. The fully gapped state of the ultra-thin YBCO films makes them a promising platform for quantum applications, including quantum computing and quantum communications.
