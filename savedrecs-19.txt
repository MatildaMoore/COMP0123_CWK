TI Creating Majorana modes from segmented Fermi surface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Majorana bound states provide a fertile ground for both investigation of fundamental phenomena as well as for applications in quantum computation. However, despite enormous experimental and theoretical efforts, the currently available Majorana platforms suffer from a multitude of issues that prevent full realization of their potential. Therefore, improved Majorana systems are still highly sought after. Here we present a platform for creating Majorana bound states from 2D gapless superconducting state in spin-helical systems under the in-plane magnetic or Zeeman field. Topological 1D channels are formed by quantum confinement of quasiparticles via Andreev reflection from the surrounding fully gapped superconducting region. Our proposal can be realized using narrow strips of magnetic insulators on top of proximitized 3D topological insulators. This setup has key advantages that include: small required fields, no necessity of fine-tuning of chemical potential, removal of the low-energy detrimental states, and large attainable topological gap. Despite striking progress in promoting Majorana physics to topological quantum computation, there are many disadvantages in existing material platforms. Here, Papaj and Fu propose a new two-dimensional system for realization of Majorana physics based on a segmented Fermi surface due to the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic field.

TI Bosonic field digitization for quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation of quantum field theory is a flagship application of quantum computers that promises to deliver capabilities beyond classical computing. The realization of quantum advantage will require methods that can accurately predict error scaling as a function of the resolution and parameters of the model and that can be implemented efficiently on quantum hardware. In this paper, we address the representation of lattice bosonic fields in a discretized field amplitude basis, develop methods to predict error scaling, and present efficient qubit implementation strategies. A low-energy subspace of the bosonic Hilbert space, defined by a boson occupation number cutoff, can be represented with exponentially good accuracy by a low-energy subspace of a finite-size Hilbert space. The finite representation construction and the associated errors are directly related to the accuracy of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling and the finite Fourier transforms of the boson number states in the field and the conjugate-field bases. We analyze the relation between the boson mass, the discretization parameters used for wave function sampling, and the finite representation size. Numerical simulations of small size Phi(4) problems demonstrate that the boson mass optimizing the sampling of the ground state wave function is a good approximation to the optimal boson mass yielding the minimum low-energy subspace size. However, we find that accurate sampling of general wave functions does not necessarily result in accurate representation. We develop methods for validating and adjusting the discretization parameters to achieve more accurate simulations.

TI Non-Abelian three-loop braiding statistics for 3D fermionic topological
   phases
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fractional statistics is one of the most intriguing features of topological phases in 2D. In particular, the so-called non-Abelian statistics plays a crucial role towards realizing topological quantum computation. Recently, the study of topological phases has been extended to 3D and it has been proposed that loop-like extensive objects can also carry fractional statistics. In this work, we systematically study the so-called three-loop braiding statistics for 3D interacting fermion systems. Most surprisingly, we discover new types of non-Abelian three-loop braiding statistics that can only be realized in fermionic systems (or equivalently bosonic systems with emergent fermionic particles). On the other hand, due to the correspondence between gauge theories with fermionic particles and classifying fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases with unitary symmetries, our study also gives rise to an alternative way to classify FSPT phases. We further compare the classification results for FSPT phases with arbitrary Abelian unitary total symmetry G(f) and find systematical agreement with previous studies. Non-Abelian statistics plays a crucial role towards realizing topological quantum computation. Here, the authors discover new types of non-Abelian three-loop braiding statistics that can only be realized in 3D interacting fermionic systems.

TI Spin correlations and Bell nonlocality in ΛΛ pair production from
   e+e- collisions with a thrust cut
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present a comprehensive theoretical study of spin correlations in Lambda Lambda production from e+e- annihilation, providing the theoretical predictions for the Belle II experiment. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first resummation of large logarithms for the longitudinal (CLL) and transverse (CTT) spin correlations for events with a cut on the thrust variable. Our calculation achieves next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and incorporates the determination of polarized fragmenting jet functions. This framework provides robust predictions with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to fixed-order parton model approaches. Furthermore, we establish a direct mapping between the experimentally accessible spin correlation, CTT, and a testable CHSH-Bell inequality. This result reframes CTT as a quantitative probe of quantum decoherence, providing a novel tool to measure the degree of parton-level entanglement that survives the fragmentation and hadronization process.

TI Decoherence effects in reactor and Gallium neutrino oscillation
   experiments: a QFT approach
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We adopt the quantum field theoretical method to calculate the amplitude and event rate for a neutrino oscillation experiment, considering neutrino production, propagation and detection as a single process. This method allows to take into account decoherence effects in the transition amplitude induced by the quantum mechanical uncertainties of all particles involved in the process. We extend the method to include coherence loss due to interactions with the environment, similar to collisional line broadening. In addition to generic decoherence induced at the amplitude level, the formalism allows to include, in a straightforward way, additional damping effects related to phase-space integrals over momenta of unobserved particles as well as other classical averaging effects. We apply this method to neutrino oscillation searches at reactor and Gallium experiments and confirm that quantum decoherence is many orders of magnitudes smaller than classical averaging effects and therefore unobservable. The method used here can be applied with minimal modifications also to other types of oscillation experiments, e.g., accelerator based beam experiments.

TI Codes for entanglement-assisted classical communication
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement-assisted classical communication (EACC) aims to enhance communication systems using entanglement as an additional resource. However, there is a scarcity of explicit protocols designed for finite transmission scenarios, which presents a challenge for real-world implementation. In response, we introduce a new EACC scheme capable of correcting a fixed number of erasures/errors. It can be adjusted to the available amount of entanglement and sends classical information over a quantum channel. We establish a general framework to accomplish such a task by reducing it to a classical problem. Comparing with specific bounds, we identify optimal parameter ranges. The scheme requires only the implementation of super-dense coding which has been demonstrated successfully in experiments. Furthermore, our results show that an adaptable entanglement use confers a communication advantage. Overall, our work sheds light on how entanglement can elevate various finite-length communication protocols, opening new avenues for exploration in the field.

TI Benchmarks and Recommendations for Quantum, Digital, and GPU Annealers
   in Combinatorial Optimization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Annealers leverage quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulas to address combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and have shown potential to outperform classical computers. This paper examines three prominent types of annealers: quantum, digital, and GPU annealers. Quantum annealers (QAs) are exemplified by the D-Wave Advantage, which relies on the quantum tunneling phenomenon to rapidly locate the minimum-energy system state corresponding to the optimal solution to a COP. Digital annealers (DAs) are typified by the Fujitsu Digital Annealing Unit (DAU), which is based on a quantum-inspired digital architecture to perform parallel and real-time optimization calculations to solve a COP. GPU annealers (GPUAs) are exemplified by the Compal Quantix solver, which harnesses graphics processing units (GPUs) to conduct the diverse adaptive bulk search for the optimal COP solution. This paper first provides an introductory overview of the QA, DA, and GPUA, and then proceeds to benchmark their performance on solving various well-known COPs such as the subset sum, maximum cut, vertex cover, 0/1 knapsack, graph coloring, Hamiltonian cycle, traveling salesperson, and job-shop scheduling problems. Their performance is also compared with that of state-of-the-art algorithms running on classical computers. Through comprehensive performance benchmarks in terms of the solution quality and the execution time, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of each annealer. In addition, we also provide recommendations to improve the performance of each annealer. Specifically, we recommend using the genetic algorithm, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the ant colony optimization algorithm in all annealers, using quantum pausing, quenching, and reverse annealing in the QA, using built-in separated penalty terms, one-way/two-way one-hot constraints, and linear inequality constraints in the DA, and implementing some parallel algorithms in the GPUA for performance improvement.

TI Particle Creation: Schwinger plus Unruh plus Hawking
SO JETP LETTERS
AB We discuss the interconnection between the Schwinger pair creation in electric field, Hawking radiation and particle creation in the Unruh effect. All three processes can be described in terms of the entropy and temperature. These thermodynamic like processes can be combined. We consider the combined process of creation of charged and electrically neutral particles in the electric field, which combine the Schwinger and Unruh effects. We also consider the creation of the charged black and white holes in electric field, which combines the Schwinger effect and the black hole entropy. The combined processes obey the sum rules for the entropy and for the inverse temperature. Some contributions to the entropy and to the temperature are negative, which reflects the quantum entanglement between the created objects.

TI Second-order statistics of fermionic Gaussian states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the statistical behavior of entanglement in quantum bipartite systems over fermionic Gaussian states as measured by von Neumann entropy and entanglement capacity. The focus is on the variance of von Neumann entropy and the mean entanglement capacity that belong to the so-defined second-order statistics. The main results are the exact yet explicit formulas of the two considered second-order statistics for fixed subsystem dimension differences. We also conjecture the exact variance of von Neumann entropy valid for arbitrary subsystem dimensions. Based on the obtained results, we analytically study the numerically observed phenomena of Gaussianity of von Neumann entropy and linear growth of average capacity.

TI On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetryresolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.

TI Power networks SCADA communication cybersecurity, a Qiskit
   implementation
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and source-destination addresses. Power networks supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) communication is part of the critical information infrastructure, subjected to increasing risk and vulnerability from cyberattacks. As information technology (IT) in internet-connected environments through optical fibre networks is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), it significantly increases complexity as a successful OT attack has the potential to damage power system equipment and cause a large-scale cascading outage. In the IT-OT interwoven regime, where some overlap is inevitable, securing the future ecosystem faces fresh challenges in the quantum endeavour, where traditional encryption is anticipated to be insufficient. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity for dealing with streaming data, a computational problem in essence. This paper demonstrates an integrated Qiskit through two different quantum circuit implementations for encoding, encrypting, and decrypting an open-source packet dataset of six fields treated as six variables for corresponding interconnected SCADA centres. It found that the results of encrypted and decrypted traffic data match with the identical keys of Alice and Bob for the dataset samples, and thus are encouraging for the possible future framework development of real-time streaming data. It highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in a plausible quantum computing and communication regime. While the topic entails the intersection of many domains, in the end, the computational paradigm forms one of the building blocks of the ecosystem owing to the reality of managing huge data, real-time streaming in nature, and the adequacy of computational resources. Nonetheless, the inevitable trade-off scenario of software and hardware interface for achieving the required performance vis-& agrave;-vis computation time is another criterion.

TI Enhanced discrimination of high-dimensional quantum states by
   concatenated optimal measurement strategies
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The impossibility of deterministic and error-free discrimination among nonorthogonal quantum states lies at the core of quantum theory and constitutes a primitive for secure quantum communication. Demanding determinism leads to errors, while demanding certainty leads to some inconclusiveness. One of the most fundamental strategies developed for this task is the optimal unambiguous measurement. It encompasses conclusive results, which allow for error-free state retrodictions with the maximum success probability, and inconclusive results, which are discarded for not allowing perfect identifications. Interestingly, in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces the inconclusive results may contain valuable information about the input states. Here, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate the discrimination of nonorthogonal states from both conclusive and inconclusive results in the optimal unambiguous strategy, by concatenating a minimum-error measurement at its inconclusive space. Our implementation comprises four- and nine-dimensional spatially encoded photonic states. By accessing the inconclusive space to retrieve the information that is wasted in the conventional protocol, we achieve significant increases of up to a factor of 2.07 and 3.73, respectively, in the overall probabilities of correct retrodictions. The concept of concatenated optimal measurements demonstrated here can be extended to other strategies and will enable one to explore the full potential of high-dimensional nonorthogonal states for quantum communication with larger alphabets.

TI Cryogenic DC-coupled readout electronics for high-speed superconducting
   nanowire single-photon detectors based on a commercial operational
   amplifier
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) have the advantages of high maximal counting rate (MCR), high detection efficiency, and low dark count rate. They play an important role in the fields of optical quantum communication, optical quantum computing, laser ranging, and imaging. The MCR (i.e. detection speed) of SNSPD can be affected by the front-end readout circuit. To increase MCR, it is usually necessary to use a cryogenic DC-coupled readout circuit with a broad bandwidth. This study reports an SNSPD cryogenic DC-coupled amplification readout circuit based on a commercial high-speed operational amplifier chip OPA855. We systematically characterize its performance parameters in a temperature range from a room temperature of 300 K to a low temperature of 4.2 K. We address the problem of bandwidth loss of the circuit in a low-temperature environment by increasing the operating voltage of the OPA855 chip. For example, at 40 K,the operating voltage increases from +/- 2.5 V to +/- 4.9 V, and the quiescent current is about 8 mA, which is equivalent to a power consumption of 78 mW; meanwhile, the gain of this readout circuit is 16.7 dB, and the -3 dB cutoff bandwidth is similar to 2.7 GHz. We further install a cryogenic DC-coupled readout circuit based on the OPA855 amplifier at 40 K and characterize the performance parameters of the SNSPD at 2.2 K, such as the switching current, system detection efficiency, and MCR. The comparison with the conventional AC-coupled readout circuit at room temperature shows that the MCR increases about 1.3 times after using the DC-coupling circuit. Our study provides the interesting information about the OPA855 amplifier's performance at low temperatures which facilitates its application in cryogenic environments and related fields.

TI Narain CFTs and quantum codes at higher genus
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Code CFTs are 2d conformal field theories defined by error-correcting codes. Recently, Dymarsky and Shapere generalized the construction of code CFTs to include quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we explore this connection at higher genus. We prove that the higher-genus partition functions take the form of polynomials of higher-weight theta functions, and that the higher-genus modular group acts as simple linear transformations on these polynomials. We explain how to solve the modular constraints explicitly, which we do for genus 2. The result is that modular invariance at genus 1 and genus 2 is much more constraining than genus 1 alone. This allows us to drastically reduce the space of possible code CFTs. We also consider a number of examples of "isospectral theories" - CFTs with the same genus 1 partition function - and we find that they have different genus 2 partition functions. Finally, we make connection to some 2d CFTs known from the modular bootstrap. The n = 4 theory conjectured to have the largest possible gap in Virasoro characters, the SO(8) WZW model, is a code CFT, allowing us to give an expression for its genus 2 partition function. We also find some other known CFTs which are not code theories but whose partition functions satisfy the same simple polynomial ansatz as the code theories. This leads us to speculate about the usefulness of the code polynomial form beyond the study of code CFTs.

TI Isotopically Enriched Layers for Quantum Computers Formed by 28Si
   Implantation and Layer Exchange
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB 28Si enrichment is crucial for production of group IV semiconductor-based quantum computers. Cryogenically cooled, monocrystalline 28Si is a spin-free, vacuum-like environ-ment where qubits are protected from sources of decoherence that cause loss of quantum information. Currently, 28Si enrichment techniques rely on deposition of centrifuged SiF4 gas, the source of which is not widely available, or bespoke ion implantation methods. Previously, conventional ion implantation into naturalSi substrates has produced heavily oxidized 28Si layers. Here we report on a novel enrichment process involving ion implantation of 28Si into Al films deposited on native-oxide free Si substrates followed by layer exchange crystallization. We measured continuous, oxygen-free epitaxial 28Si enriched to 99.7%. Increases in isotopic enrichment are possible, and improvements in crystal quality, aluminum content, and thickness uniformity are required before the process can be considered viable. TRIDYN models, used to model 30 keV 28Si implants into Al to understand the observed post-implant layers and to investigate the implanted layer exchange process window over different energy and vacuum conditions, showed that the implanted layer exchange process is insensitive to implantation energy and would increase in efficiency with oxygen concentrations in the implanter end-station by reducing sputtering. Required implant fluences are an order of magnitude lower than those required for enrichment by direct 28Si implants into Si and can be chosen to control the final thickness of the enriched layer. We show that implanted layer exchange could potentially produce quantum grade 28Si using conventional semiconductor foundry equipment within production-worthy time scales.

TI Development of a New Zeta Formula and Its Role in Riemann Hypothesis and
   Quantum Physics
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this study, we investigated a new zeta formula in which the zeta function can be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of delta and cosine functions. Our findings demonstrate that this formula possesses duality characteristics and we established a direct connection between the Riemann hypothesis and this new formula. Additionally, we explored the behavior of energy or particles in quantum physics within the proposed mathematical model framework based on the new formula. Our model provides a valuable understanding of several important physics inquiries, including the collapse of the wave function during measurement and quantum entanglement, as well as the double slits experiment.

TI Enhancing the performances of autonomous quantum refrigerators via
   two-photon transitions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.

TI Dissipation and gate timing errors in SWAP operations of qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We examine how dissipation and gate timing errors affect the fidelity of a sequence of SWAP gates on a chain of interacting qubits in comparison to noise in the interqubit interaction. Although interqubit interaction noise and gate timing errors are always present in any qubit platform, dissipation is a special case that can arise in multivalley semiconductor spin qubit systems, such as Si-based qubits, where dissipation may be used as a general model for valley leakage. In our Hamiltonian, each qubit is coupled via Heisenberg exchange to every other qubit in the chain, with the strength of the exchange interaction decreasing exponentially with distance between the qubits. Dissipation is modeled through the term -i gamma 1 in the Hamiltonian, and gamma is chosen so as to be consistent with the experimentally observed intervalley tunneling in Si. We show that randomness in the dissipation parameter should have little to no effect on the SWAP gate fidelity in the currently fabricated Si circuits. We introduce quasistatic noise in the interqubit interaction and random gate timing error and average the fidelities over 10 000 realizations for each set of parameters. The fidelities are then plotted against J(SWAP), the strength of the exchange coupling corresponding to the SWAP gate. We find that dissipation decreases the fidelity of the SWAP operation-though the effect is small compared to that of the known noise in the interqubit interaction-and that gate timing error creates an effective optimal value of J(SWAP), beyond which infidelity begins to increase.

TI Conditional diffusion-based parameter generation for quantum approximate
   optimization algorithm
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that shows promise in efficiently solving the Max-Cut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the parameter optimization pipeline, where the parameter initialization strategy is nontrivial due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by issues with low-quality local minima. Recent inspiration comes from the diffusion of classical neural network parameters, which has demonstrated that neural network training can benefit from generating good initial parameters through diffusion models. However, whether the diffusion model can enhance the parameter optimization and performance of QAOA by generating well-performing initial parameters is still an open topic. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task and propose the initial parameter generation scheme through dataset-conditioned pre-trained parameter sampling. Concretely, the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to learn the distribution of pre-trained parameters conditioned on the graph dataset. Intuitively, the proposed framework aims to effectively distill knowledge from pre-trained parameters to generate well-performing initial parameters for QAOA. To benchmark our framework, we adopt trotterized quantum annealing (TQA)-based and graph neural network (GNN) prediction-based initialization protocols as baselines. Through numerical experiments on Max-Cut problem instances of various sizes, we show that conditional DDPM can consistently generate high-quality initial parameters, improve convergence to the approximation ratio, and exhibit greater robustness against local minima over baselines. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that the conditional DDPM trained on small problem instances can be extrapolated to larger ones, thus demonstrating the extrapolation capacity of our framework in terms of the qubit number.

TI High comprehensive performance superconducting nanowire detector
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) has been widely used in quantum communication, quantum computing and other fields because of its excellent timing jitter and response speed. However, due to the mutual restraint of the technical parameters of SNSPD nanowires, there are technical challenges to further improve the comprehensive performance of SNSPD, and thus limiting its application on a large scale. Combining high detection efficiency with high timing performance is still an outstanding challenge. In this work, we report the SNSPD with 12-& mu;m small active area, which has high speed, high efficiency, low jitter and broadband absorption. Au/SiO2 membrane cavity, which is determined by finite element analysis simulation, is used to widen the optical response bandwidth. And it is easier to process and improve the alignment accuracy at the same time. The flat substrate is more conducive to the growth of superconducting thin films, so flattening process is introduced. Device package is also optimized to match smaller detector. Self aligned packaging makes optical alignment more convenient and time-saving. Special optical fibers with small mode-field diameters can reduce the negative effect of the detector on optical coupling. The detector can achieve a maximum SDE of 82% at the central wavelength of 1310 nm and the temperature of 2.2 K, and the SDE of more than 65% in the wavelength range of 1200-1600 nm, with DCR of 70 cps. The detector also exhibits a count rate of 40 MHz@3 dB and a timing jitter of 38 ps, which is significantly improved compared with 23-& mu;m active area detector. Furthermore, the minimum timing jitter of 22 ps can be obtained by using cryogenic amplifier readout. In this work, high comprehensive performance detector is developed, which provides an important technical reference for practical and product SNSPD.

TI Fast and robust magnon transport in a spin chain
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A protocol for fast and robust magnon transport in a one-dimensional spin chain is devised. Employing an approximate mapping between the chain and a single harmonically trapped particle, we exploit the known analytic control protocols for the latter and adopt them to achieve fast, high-fidelity transport in the chain. We compare the performance with finite time adiabatic protocols, showing that the designed scheme allows for significantly faster and more stable transport. Furthermore, we show that a sharp transition exists between regions in which the protocol is effective and when it breaks down, giving rise to a heuristic speed limit for the process.

TI Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored
   Non-Markovian Quantum Systems With a Markovian Embedding
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the "diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the "off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.

TI Nonreciprocal microwave-optical entanglement in a magnon-based hybrid
   system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal microwave-optical entanglement in a magnon-based hybrid system where an optical photon in a spinning resonator is coupled to a phonon representing the quantum of the mechanical deformation of a yttrium iron garnet crystal via radiation pressure. Meanwhile, the magnon interacts with the phonon and the microwave through the magnetostrictive and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, respectively. By spinning the resonator, the light driven in opposite directions propagates irreversibly, which leads to the classical nonreciprocity of mean optical photon numbers. Strikingly, the nonreciprocal entanglement between microwave and optical photons can be generated owing to the Fizeau light-dragging effect. Physically, the magnon-phonon entanglement induced by the magnomechanical parametric downconversion interaction is partially transferred to the microwave-optical subsystem through magnon-microwave and optomechanical state-exchange interactions. Moreover, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be manipulated by properly choosing various system parameters and the ideal nonreciprocal microwave-optical entanglement could be achieved, in which the entanglement depending on the effective optical detuning is present in a chosen direction but disappears in the other direction. Our work could be applied in the multi-task quantum information processing and construction of chiral quantum networks. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Large violations in Kochen Specker contextuality and their applications
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB It is of interest to study how contextual quantum mechanics is, in terms of the violation of Kochen Specker state-independent and state-dependent non-contextuality inequalities. We present state-independent non-contextuality inequalities with large violations, in particular, we exploit a connection between Kochen-Specker proofs and pseudo-telepathy games to show KS proofs in Hilbert spaces of dimension d >= 2(17) with the ratio of quantum value to classical bias being O(root d/ log d). We study the properties of this KS set and show applications of the large violation. It has been recently shown that Kochen-Specker proofs always consist of substructures of state-dependent contextuality proofs called 01-gadgets. We show a one-to-one connection between 01-gadgets in C-d and Hardy paradoxes for the maximally entangled state in C-d circle times C-d. We use this connection to construct large violation 01-gadgets between arbitrary vectors in C-d, as well as novel Hardy paradoxes for the maximally entangled state in C-d circle times C-d, and give applications of these constructions. As a technical result, we show that the minimum dimension of the faithful orthogonal representation of a graph in R-d is not a graph monotone, a result that may be of independent interest.

TI Constellation design and performance of future quantum satellite gravity
   missions
SO EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
AB Temporal aliasing is currently the largest error contributor to time-variable satellite gravity field models. Therefore, the evolution of sensor technologies has to be complemented by strategies to reduce temporal aliasing errors. The most straightforward way to improve temporal aliasing is through extended satellite constellations because they improve the observation geometry and increase the achievable temporal resolution. Therefore, strategies to optimize the design of larger satellite constellations are investigated in this contribution. A complete constellation modeling procedure is presented, starting from primary design variables (such as the required targeted resolutions) and concluding with concrete orbital elements for the individual satellites. In parallel, it is evaluated if improved instrument sensitivities based on quantum technologies (cold atom interferometry) can be fully exploited in the case of larger constellations. For this, future quantum satellite gravity missions adopting the gradiometry concept (similar to the GOCE mission) and the low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking concept (similar to GRACE/-FO) are simulated on optimized constellations with up to 6 satellites/pairs. The retrieval performance of a 6-pair mission in terms of the global equivalent water height RMS can be improved by a factor of roughly 3 compared to an inclined double-pair mission. 3D-gradiometry intrinsically has a better de-aliasing behavior but has extremely high accuracy requirements for the gradiometer (about 10 mu Eotvos) and the attitude reconstruction to be of any benefit. All simulations show that when incorporating improved sensor technologies, such as future quantum sensing instruments in extended constellations, temporal aliasing will remain the dominant error source by far, up to five orders of magnitude larger than the instrument errors. Therefore, improving sensor technologies has to go hand in hand with larger satellite constellations and improved space-time parameterization strategies to further reduce temporal aliasing effects.

First, we investigate the inverse eigenvalue problem for symmetric entanglement witnesses-that is, we investigate what their possible spectra are. Second, we investigate the problem of characterizing which separable symmetric quantum states remain separable after conjugation by an arbitrary unitary acting on symmetric space-that is, which states are separable in every orthonormal symmetric basis. Both of these questions have been investigated thoroughly in the non-symmetric setting, and we contrast the answers that we find with their non-symmetric counterparts. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Optical Properties of Low-Defect Large-Area Hexagonal Boron Nitride for
   Quantum Applications
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Intrinsic defects and their concentrations in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) play a key role in single-photon emission. In this study, the optical properties of large-area multilayer h-BN-on-sapphire grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition are explored. Based on the detailed spectroscopic characterization using both cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements, the material is devoid of random single-point defects instead of a few clustered complex defects. The emission spectra of the measurements confirm a record-low-defect concentration of approximate to 104 cm-2. Post-annealing, no significant changes are observed in the measured spectra and the defect concentrations remain unaltered. Through CL and PL spectroscopy, an optically active boron vacancy spin defect is identified and a novel complex defect combination arising from carbon impurities is revealed. This complex defect, previously unreported, signifies a unique aspect of the material. In these findings, the understanding of defect-induced optical properties in h-BN films is contributed, providing insights for potential applications in quantum information science.
   In this article, the characterization results of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are reported, which is considered as one of the most promising materials for next-generation quantum technologies. Spectroscopic characterizations by both cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence measurements elucidate the optical properties of large-area low-defect six-monolayer h-BN-on-sapphire grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Selective Undercut of Undoped Optical Membranes for Spin-Active Color
   Centers in 4H-Silicon Carbide
SO ACS NANO
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is a semiconductor used in quantum information processing, microelectromechanical systems, photonics, power electronics, and harsh environment sensors. However, its high-temperature stability, high breakdown voltage, wide bandgap, and high mechanical strength are accompanied by a chemical inertness, which makes complex micromachining difficult. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching is a simple, rapid means of wet processing SiC, including the use of dopant-selective etch stops that take advantage of the mature SiC homoepitaxy. However, dopant-selective PEC etching typically relies on highly doped material, which poses challenges for device applications such as quantum defects and photonics that benefit from low doping to produce robust emitter properties and high optical transparency. In this work, we develop a selective PEC process that relies not on high doping but on the electrical depletion of a fabricated diode structure, allowing the selective etching of an n-doped substrate wafer versus an undoped epitaxial (carrier density of 1(10)(14) cm(-3)) device layer. We characterize the photoresponse and PEC behavior of the diode under bias and use those insights to suspend large (100 x 100 mu m) undoped membranes of SiC. We further characterize the compatibility of membranes with quantum emitters, performing comparative spin spectroscopy between undoped and highly doped membrane structures, finding the use of undoped material improves ensemble spin lifetime by >5x. This work enables the fabrication of high-purity suspended thin films suitable for scalable photonics, mechanics, and quantum technologies in SiC.

TI Anti-Stokes excitation of optically active point defects in
   semiconductor materials
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Optically addressable point defects in semiconductor materials have been identified as promising single-photon sources and spin qubits in quantum information technologies. The traditional method of exploring the optical and spin properties of these defects is using a laser with a wavelength shorter than the point defects' zero-phonon-line (ZPL) to Stokes exciting and detecting the Stokes photoluminescence (PL). On the other hand, anti-Stokes excitation with the pumping laser's wavelength longer than the defects' ZPL can also be used to investigate their optical and spin properties. The anti-Stokes excitation has shown many advantages and attracted great interest. Here, we provide a brief review of the anti-Stokes excitation of optically active point defects in semiconductor materials. The Stokes and anti-Stokes PL spectra of different point defect systems in semiconductor materials are compared. We then discuss the main mechanisms of the anti-Stokes excitation of different physical systems and conclude that the anti-Stokes excitation of the point defect system in the semiconductor is a single-photon absorption phonon-assisted process. Finally, we summarize some practical applications of anti-Stokes excitation, including laser cooling of semiconductor materials, high-sensitivity quantum thermometry, and enhancement of the readout signal contrast of the point defect spin states. The anti-Stokes excitation of point defects in semiconductors extends the boundary of quantum technologies.

TI Electronic ladder model harboring Z 4 parafermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Parafermions are anyons with the potential for realizing nonlocal qubits that are resilient to local perturbations. Compared with Majorana zero modes, braiding of parafermions implements an extended set of topologically protected quantum gates. This, however, comes at the price that parafermionic zero modes cannot be realized in the absence of strong interactions, posing a challenge for their theoretical depiction. In this paper, we construct a simple lattice model for interacting spinful electrons with parafermionic zero-energy modes. The explicit microscopic nature of the considered model highlights realization avenues for these exotic excitations in recently fabricated quantum dot arrays. By density matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a broad range of parameters, with well-localized zero modes, whose parafermionic nature is substantiated by their unique 8 pi pi periodic Josephson spectrum.

TI Estimation of light-matter coupling constant under dispersive
   interaction based on quantum Fisher information
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum parameter estimation is one of the most important applications in quantum metrology. The basictheory of quantum parameter estimation???quantum Cramer-Rao bound???shows that the precision limit ofquantum parameter estimation is directly related to quantum Fisher information. Therefore quantum Fisherinformation is extremely important in the quantum parameter estimation. In this paper we use quantumparameter estimation theory to estimate the coupling constant of the Jaynes-Cummings model with largedetuning. The initial probing state is the direct product state of qubit and radiation field in which Fock state,thermal state and coherent state are taken into account respectively. We calculate the quantum Fisherinformation of the hybrid system as well as qubit and radiation field for each probing state after the parameterevolution under the Hamiltonian of the Jaynes-Cummings model with large detuning. The results show that thequantum Fisher information increases monotonically with the average photon number increasing. The optimaldetection state is that when the qubit system is in the equal weight superposition of the ground and the excitedstate, at this time the quantum Fisher information always reaches a maximum value, When the radiation fieldof probing state is Fock state or the thermal state, the information about the estimated parameter is includedonly in the qubit. The estimation accuracy of the coupling constant with thermal state or coherent state ishigher than that with Fock state

TI Imaging dynamic exciton interactions and coupling in transition metal
   dichalcogenides
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as a possible material platform for quantum information science and related device applications. In TMD monolayers, the dephasing time and inhomogeneity are crucial parameters for any quantum information application. In TMD heterostructures, coupling strength and interlayer exciton lifetimes are also parameters of interest. However, many demonstrations in TMDs can only be realized at specific spots on the sample, presenting a challenge to the scalability of these applications. Here, using multi-dimensional coherent imaging spectroscopy, we shed light on the underlying physics-including dephasing, inhomogeneity, and strain-for a MoSe2 monolayer and identify both promising and unfavorable areas for quantum information applications. We, furthermore, apply the same technique to a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. Despite the notable presence of strain and dielectric environment changes, coherent and incoherent coupling and interlayer exciton lifetimes are mostly robust across the sample. This uniformity is despite a significantly inhomogeneous interlayer exciton photoluminescence distribution that suggests a bad sample for device applications. This robustness strengthens the case for TMDs as a next-generation material platform in quantum information science and beyond. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI AN HHL-BASED ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING HITTING PROBABILITIES OF QUANTUM
   WALKS
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We present a novel application of the HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm - a quantum algorithm solving systems of linear equations - in solving an open problem about quantum walks, namely computing hitting (or absorption) probabilities of a general (not only Hadamard) one-dimensional quantum walks with two absorbing boundaries. This is achieved by a simple observation that the problem of computing hitting probabilities of quantum walks can be reduced to inverting a matrix. Then a quantum algorithm with the HHL algorithm as a subroutine is developed for solving the problem, which is faster than the known classical algorithms by numerical experiments.

TI Complete Physical Characterization of Quantum Nondemolition Measurements

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a self-consistent tomography for arbitrary quantum nondemolition (QND) detectors. Based on this, we build a complete physical characterization of the detector, including the measurement processes and a quantification of the fidelity, ideality, and backaction of the measurement. This framework is a diagnostic tool for the dynamics of QND detectors, allowing us to identify errors, and to improve their calibration and design. We illustrate this on a realistic Jaynes-Cummings simulation of a superconducting qubit readout. We characterize nondispersive errors, quantify the backaction introduced by the readout cavity, and calibrate the optimal measurement point.

TI Fewest Switches Surface Hopping with Decoherence in the Marcus Inverted
   Regime: Correct Rates but Wrong Thermal Populations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) is a well benchmarked dynamical method for simulating nonadiabatic systems. In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.

TI Ultracompact Single-Photon Sources of Linearly Polarized Vortex Beams
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Ultracompact chip-integrated single-photon sources of collimated beams with polarization-encoded states are crucial for integrated quantum technologies. However, most of currently available single-photon sources rely on external bulky optical components to shape the polarization and phase front of emitted photon beams. Efficient integration of quantum emitters with beam shaping and polarization encoding functionalities remains so far elusive. Here, ultracompact single-photon sources of linearly polarized vortex beams based on chip-integrated quantum emitter-coupled metasurfaces are presented, which are meticulously designed by fully exploiting the potential of nanobrick-arrayed metasurfaces. The authors first demonstrate on-chip single-photon generation of high-purity linearly polarized vortex beams with prescribed topological charges of 0, - 1, and +1. The multiplexing of single-photon emission channels with orthogonal linear polarizations carrying different topological charges are further realized and their entanglement is demonstarated. The work illustrates the potential and feasibility of ultracompact quantum emitter-coupled metasurfaces as a new quantum optics platform for realizing chip-integrated high-dimensional single-photon sources.
   Ultracompact chip-integrated single-photon sources of linearly polarized vortex beams are proposed based on quantum emitter-coupled metasurfaces. The design strategy facilitates the control of the polarization, orbital angular momentums (OAMs), and entanglement of multichannel single-photon emission, enabling simultaneous generation of high-purity orthogonal linearly polarized single-photon beams with arbitrary different OAMs, which meets growing demands for increasing the quantum information channel capacity of highly integrated quantum system.image

TI Resolution in Two-Photon Imaging: A Local Manifestation of Entanglement
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The resolution of a classical imaging system is limited by diffraction. This limit can be overcome, for example, by implementing various forms of localization microscopy in which the center of a fluorescence distribution is estimated to an accuracy scaling with the square root of the number of detected photons, N . In quantum imaging the object can be illuminated using correlated photon-pairs, leading early work to suggest that a 2 improvement could be obtained as a result of averaging the position of N = 2 events. However, similar to quantum lithography, which relies upon quantum illumination using entangled photon-pairs and two-photon absorption, the minimum resolvable feature size is reduced by a factor of 2, not just 2 . Quantum imaging schemes can also lead to a factor of 2 improvement. By using a similar source of correlated photon-pairs to illuminate an object, a single-photon sensitive camera to detect the photon-pairs, and an image processing algorithm to record and sum the bisector positions of the transmitted photon-pairs, we realize a similar factor of x2 improvement in image resolution, surpassing that of most earlier quantum imaging work.

TI Measurement-induced criticality and entanglement clusters: A study of
   one-dimensional and two-dimensional Clifford circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Entanglement transitions in quantum dynamics present a novel class of phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems. When a many-body quantum system undergoes unitary evolution interspersed with monitored random measurements, the steady state can exhibit a phase transition between volume- and area-law entanglement. There is a correspondence between measurement-induced transitions in nonunitary quantum circuits in d spatial dimensions and classical statistical mechanical models in d + 1 dimensions. In certain limits these models map to percolation, but there is analytical and numerical evidence to suggest that away from these limits the universality class should generically be distinct from percolation. Intriguingly, despite these arguments, numerics on 1 + 1D qubit circuits give bulk exponents which are nonetheless close to those of 2D percolation, with some possible differences in surface behavior. In the first part of this work we explore the critical properties of 2 + 1D Clifford circuits. In the bulk, we find many properties suggested by the percolation picture, including several matching bulk exponents, and an inverse power law for the critical entanglement growth, S(t, L) similar to L(1 - a/t), which saturates to an area law. We then utilize a graph-state-based algorithm to analyze in 1 + 1D and 2 + 1D the critical properties of entanglement clusters in the steady state. We show that in a model with a simple geometric map to percolation-the projective transverse field Ising model-these entanglement clusters are governed by percolation surface exponents. However, in the Clifford models we find large deviations in the cluster exponents from those of surface percolation, highlighting the breakdown of any possible geometric map to percolation. Given the evidence for deviations from the percolation universality class, our results raise the question of why nonetheless many bulk properties behave similarly to those of percolation.

TI Recent advances in InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used in applications requiring extremely weak light detection. In the near-infrared region, SPDs based on InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the primary candidates for practical applications because of their small size, low cost and ease of operation. Driven by the escalating demands for quantum communication and lidar, the performance of InGaAs/InP SPDs has been continuously enhanced. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advances in InGaAs/InP SPDs over the past 10 years, including the investigation into SPAD structures and mechanisms, as well as emerging readout techniques for both gated and free-running mode SPDs. In addition, future prospects are also summarised.

TI Behavior-aware energy management in microgrids using quantum-classical
   hybrid algorithms under social and demand dynamics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The increasing intricacy of modern microgrids, driven by uncertain consumption patterns, decentralized renewables, and user behavioral dynamics, calls for innovative optimization methodologies. This study introduces a hybrid quantum-classical framework for demand-side energy management, leveraging behavioral modeling to foster resilience and flexibility. By embedding principles from Social Cognitive Theory-such as behavioral imitation, confidence in personal capability, and social reinforcement-into a multi-objective optimization scheme, the model supports distributed decision-making and promotes adaptive prosumer behavior. The proposed approach employs Quantum Annealing in combination with NSGA-III to efficiently navigate the complex solution space, accounting for real-time uncertainties and the stochastic nature of both demand and renewable supply. The framework is tested within a case study of a peer-to-peer microgrid network, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing energy efficiency, lowering peak demand, and improving operational resilience. Performance comparisons with traditional methods, including Mixed-Integer Programming and conventional metaheuristics, underline the improved scalability and robustness of the quantum-inspired model in handling trade-offs between cost, reliability, and socially-driven demand response. The research highlights the potential of integrating quantum-inspired optimization with behavioral energy modeling to advance intelligent and socially-responsive microgrid control systems.

TI Dynamics of spin-momentum entanglement from superradiant phase
   transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multilevel atoms remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities of intralevel quantum correlations. In this work, we consider an experimentally feasible many-body cavity QED model describing a four-level system, where each of those levels is formed from a combination of different spin and momentum states of ultracold atoms in a cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudospin operators, effectively capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses, ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in steering the system's dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in systems with multilevel atom descriptions.

TI A Hybrid Encryption Scheme for Quantum Secure Video Conferencing
   Combined with Blockchain
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Traditional video conference systems depend largely on computational complexity to ensure system security, but with the development of high-performance computers, the existing encryption system will be seriously threatened. To solve this problem, a hybrid encryption scheme for quantum secure video conferencing combined with blockchain is proposed in this study. In the system solution architecture, first, the quantum key distribution network is embedded in the classic network; then, the "classical + quantum" hybrid encryption scheme is designed according to the secret level required for the video conference content. Besides, the real-time monitoring module of the quantum key distribution network is designed to ensure that users can check the running state of the network at any time. Meeting minutes can be shared by combining with blockchain. In order to quickly query meeting minutes, a cache-efficient query method based on B+ tree is proposed. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional video conference system, the quantum secure video conference system sufficiently integrates the technical advantages of the quantum key distribution to resist the security threats such as channel eavesdropping and high-performance computational attacks while ensuring the stable operation of the classic system, thus providing a video conference system with a higher security level. Meanwhile, the query time cost of blockchain with different lengths is tested, and the query efficiency of the proposed method is 3.15-times higher than the original query efficiency of blockchain.

TI Vibronic fingerprints in the luminescence of graphene quantum dots at
   cryogenic temperature
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Atomically precise graphene quantum dots synthesized by bottom-up chemistry are promising versatile single emitters with potential applications for quantum photonic technologies. Toward a better understanding and control of graphene quantum dot (GQD) optical properties, we report on single-molecule spectroscopy at cryogenic temperature. We investigate the effect of temperature on the GQDs' spectral linewidth and vibronic replica, which we interpret building on density functional theory calculations. Finally, we highlight that the vibronic signatures are specific to the GQD geometry and can be used as a fingerprint for identification purposes.

TI Oxygen vacancies in niobium pentoxide as a source of two-level system
   losses in superconducting niobium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We identify a major source of quantum decoherence in three-dimensional superconducting radio- frequency (SRF) resonators and two-dimensional transmon qubits composed of oxidized niobium: oxygen vacancies in the niobium pentoxide, which drive two-level system (TLS) losses. By probing the effect of sequential in situ vacuum-baking treatments on the rf performance of bulk Nb SRF resonators and on the oxide structure of a representative Nb sample using TOF SIMS, we find a nonmonotonic evolution of cavity quality factor Q 0 , which correlates with the interplay of Nb2O5 2 O 5 vacancy generation and oxide-thickness reduction. We localize this effect to the oxide itself and present the insignificant role of diffused interstitial oxygen in the underlying Nb by regrowing the oxide via wet oxidation, which reveals a mitigation of aggravated TLS losses. We hypothesize that such vacancies in the pentoxide serve as magnetic impurities and are a source of TLS-driven rf loss.

TI Von Neumann entropy and Lindblad decoherence in the high-energy limit of
   strong interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum properties of the state associated to the gluon Green's function in the Balitsky-Fadin-KuraevLipatov approach are studied using a discretization in virtuality space. Considering the coupling constant as imaginary, its density matrix corresponds to a pure state for any energy. Nonlinear corrections due to high gluon densities are modeled through a suppression of infrared modes in the Hamiltonian making it no longer Hermitian. This introduces quantum decoherence into the evolution equation. When the coupling is real this leads to unbounded normalization of states which becomes bounded for sufficient saturation of infrared modes. Physical quantum properties, such as a purity smaller than one or a positive von Neumann entropy, hence are recovered when the infrared/ultraviolet original symmetry of the formalism is broken. Similarly to the work of Armesto, Dominguez, Kovner, Lublinsky and Skokov in [J. High Energy Phys. 05 (2019) 025], an evolution equation of Lindblad type for the normalized density matrix describing the open system is obtained.

TI Direct coherent switching with decay of mixing for intersystem crossing
   dynamics of thioformaldehyde: The effect of decoherence
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We evaluate the effect of electronic decoherence on intersystem crossing in the photodynamics of thioformaldehyde. First, we show that the state-averaged complete-active-space self-consistent field electronic structure calculations with a properly chosen active space of 12 active electrons in 10 active orbitals can predict the potential energy surfaces and the singlet-triplet spin-orbit couplings quite well for CH2S, and we use this method for direct dynamics by coherent switching with decay of mixing (CSDM). We obtain similar dynamical results with CSDM or by adding energy-based decoherence to trajectory surface hopping, with the population of triplet states tending to a small steady-state value over 500 fs. Without decoherence, the state populations calculated by the conventional trajectory surface hopping method or the semiclassical Ehrenfest method gradually increase. This difference shows that decoherence changes the nature of the results not just quantitatively but qualitatively.

TI Quantum feedback induced genuine magnon-photon-magnon entanglement and
   steering in a cavity magnonical system
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We present an alternative scheme to generate genuine tripartite entanglement and steering among one photon and two magnons in a cavity magnonical system, where two yttrium iron garnet spheres are respectively placed inside two microwave cavities driven by a two-mode squeezed field and subjected to homodyne-measurement feedback. It is found that quantum feedback on two cavities plays a crucial role in enhancing quantum correlations of photons and magnons. In the absence of measurement feedback, only bipartite entanglement between two magnons is existent. In contrast, when the continuous measurement feedback is present, two magnons are strongly entangled and magnon-photon entanglement also appears. More importantly, the stable genuine magnon-photon-magnon tripartite entanglement and steering could be obtained based on the homodyne-measurement feedback on two microwave cavities, which are robust against the thermal fluctuations. The work we present provides a feasible way to manipulate the multipartite quantum correlations including entanglement and steering in hybrid quantum systems.

TI Entangled time-crystal phase in an open quantum light-matter system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Time crystals are nonequilibrium many-body phases in which the state of the system dynamically approaches a limit cycle. While these phases have recently been the focus of intensive research, it is still far from clear whether they can host quantum correlations. In fact, mostly classical correlations have been observed so far, and time crystals appear to be effectively classical high-entropy phases. Here, we consider the nonequilibrium behavior of an open quantum light-matter system, realizable in current experiments, which maps to a paradigmatic time-crystal model after an adiabatic elimination of the light field. The system displays a bistable regime with coexistent time-crystal and stationary phases, terminating at a tricritical point from which a second-order phase transition line departs. While light and matter are uncorrelated in the stationary phase, the time-crystal phase features bipartite correlations of both quantum and classical nature. Our work unveils that time-crystal phases in collective open quantum systems can sustain quantum correlations, including entanglement, and are thus more than effectively classical many-body phases.

TI Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines With a D-Wave Quantum Annealer
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an energy-based, undirected graphical model. It is commonly used for unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Typically, RBM is trained using contrastive divergence (CD). However, training with CD is slow and does not estimate the exact gradient of the log-likelihood cost function. In this work, the model expectation of gradient learning for RBM has been calculated using a quantum annealer (D-Wave 2000Q), where obtaining samples is faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) used in CD. Training and classification results of RBM trained using quantum annealing are compared with the CD-based method. The performance of the two approaches is compared with respect to the classification accuracies, image reconstruction, and log-likelihood results. The classification accuracy results indicate comparable performances of the two methods. Image reconstruction and log-likelihood results show improved performance of the CD-based method. It is shown that the samples obtained from quantum annealer can be used to train an RBM on a 64-bit "bars and stripes" dataset with classification performance similar to an RBM trained with CD. Though training based on CD showed improved learning performance, training using a quantum annealer could be useful as it eliminates computationally expensive MCMC steps of CD.

TI Decoherence in neutrino oscillation at the ESSnuSB experiment
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Neutrino oscillation experiments provide a unique window in exploring several new physics scenarios beyond the standard three flavour. One such scenario is quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillation which tends to destroy the interference pattern of neutrinos reaching the far detector from the source. In this work, we study the decoherence in neutrino oscillation in the context of the ESSnuSB experiment. We consider the energy-independent decoherence parameter and derive the analytical expressions for P-mu e and P-mu mu probabilities in vacuum. We have computed the capability of ESSnuSB to put bounds on the decoherence parameters namely, Gamma(21) and Gamma(32) and found that the constraints on Gamma(21) are competitive compared to the DUNE bounds and better than the most stringent LBL ones from MINOS/MINOS+. We have also investigated the impact of decoherence on the ESSnuSB measurement of the Dirac CP phase delta(CP) and concluded that it remains robust in the presence of new physics.

TI Pauli blockade catalogue and three- and four-particle Kondo effect in
   bilayer graphene quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Pauli blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that also serves as a powerful tool for qubit manipulation and readout. While most systems exhibit a simple even-odd pattern of double-dot Pauli spin blockade due to the preferred singlet pairing of spins, the additional valley degree of freedom offered by bilayer graphene greatly alters this pattern. Inspecting bias-triangle measurements at double-dot charge degeneracies with up to four electrons in each dot reveals a much richer double-dot Pauli blockade catalog with both spin and/or valley blockade. In addition, we use single-dot Kondo effect measurements to substantiate our understanding of the three- and four-particle state spectra by analyzing their magnetic field dependence. With high controllability and reported long valley- and spin-relaxation times, bilayer graphene is a rising platform for hosting semiconductor quantum dot qubits. A thorough understanding of state spectra is crucial for qubit design and manipulation, and the rich Pauli blockade catalog provides an abundance of qubit operational possibilities and opportunities to explore intriguing spin and valley physics.

TI Decoherence out of fire: purity loss in expanding and contracting
   universes
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We investigate quantum decoherence in a class of models which interpolates between expanding (inflation) and contracting (ekpyrosis) scenarios. For the cases which result in a scale-invariant power spectrum, we find that ekpyrotic universes lead to complete decoherence of the curvature perturbation before the bounce. This is in stark contrast to the inflationary case, where recoherence has been previously observed in some situations. Although the purity can be computed for couplings of all sizes, we also study the purity perturbatively and observe that late-time (secular growth) breakdown of perturbation theory often occurs in these cases. Instead, we establish a simple yet powerful late-time purity resummation which captures the exact evolution to a remarkable level, while maintaining analytical control. We conclude that the cosmological background plays a crucial role in the decoupling of the heavy fields during inflation and alternatives.

TI Qualifying quantum approaches for hard industrial optimization problems.
   A case study in the field of smart-charging of electric vehicles
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In order to qualify quantum algorithms for industrial NP-Hard problems, comparing them to available polynomial approximate classical algorithms and not only to exact exponential ones is necessary. This is a great challenge as, in many cases, bounds on the reachable approximation ratios exist according to some highly-trusted conjectures of Complexity Theory. An interesting setup for such qualification is thus to focus on particular instances of these problems known to be "less difficult" than the worst-case ones and for which the above bounds can be outperformed: quantum algorithms should perform at least as well as the conventional approximate ones on these instances, up to very large sizes. We present a case study of such a protocol for two industrial problems drawn from the strongly developing field of smart-charging of electric vehicles. Tailored implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have been developed for both problems, and tested numerically with classical resources either by emulation of Pasqal's Rydberg atom based quantum device or using Atos Quantum Learning Machine. In both cases, quantum algorithms exhibit the same approximation ratios as conventional approximation algorithms or improve them. These are very encouraging results, although still for instances of limited size as allowed by studies on classical computing resources. The next step will be to confirm them on larger instances, on actual devices, and for more complex versions of the problems addressed.

TI Posiform planting: generating QUBO instances for benchmarking
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We are interested in benchmarking both quantum annealing and classical algorithms for minimizing quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Such problems are NP-hard in general, implying that the exact minima of randomly generated instances are hard to find and thus typically unknown. While brute forcing smaller instances is possible, such instances are typically not interesting due to being too easy for both quantum and classical algorithms. In this contribution, we propose a novel method, called posiform planting, for generating random QUBO instances of arbitrary size with known optimal solutions, and use those instances to benchmark the sampling quality of four D-Wave quantum annealers utilizing different interconnection structures (Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr hardware graphs) and the simulated annealing algorithm. Posiform planting differs from many existing methods in two key ways. It ensures the uniqueness of the planted optimal solution, thus avoiding groundstate degeneracy, and it enables the generation of QUBOs that are tailored to a given hardware connectivity structure, provided that the connectivity is not too sparse. Posiform planted QUBOs are a type of 2-SAT boolean satisfiability combinatorial optimization problems. Our experiments demonstrate the capability of the D-Wave quantum annealers to sample the optimal planted solution of combinatorial optimization problems with up to 5, 627 qubits.

TI Energy efficiency optimisation in massive multiple-input,
   multiple-output network for 5G applications using new quantum genetic
   algorithm
SO IET NETWORKS
AB Devising efficient optimisation methods has been a subject of great research attention since current evolving trends in communication networks, machine learning, and other cutting-edge systems that need a fast and accurate optimised computational model. Classical computers became incapable of handling new optimisation problems posed by newly emerging trends. Quantum optimisation algorithms appear as alternative solutions. The existing bottleneck that restricts the use of the newly developed quantum strategies is the limited qubit size of the available quantum computers (the size of the most recent universal quantum computer is 433 qubits). A new quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) is proposed that handles the presented problem. A quantum extreme value searching algorithm and quantum blind computing framework are utilised to extend the search capabilities of the GA. The quantum genetic strategy is exploited to maximise energy efficiency at full spectral efficiency of massive multiple-input, multiple-output (M-MIMO) technology as a toy example for pointing out the efficiency of the presented quantum strategy. The authors run extensive simulations and prove how the presented quantum method outperforms the existing classical genetic algorithm.

TI Multiple Dimerization Modes in Thiocarboxylate Paddlewheel Complexes: A
   Comprehensive View of Energy Landscapes from DFT Calculations and
   Statistics
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Thiocarboxylate paddlewheels (PWs) [MTr(SOCR)4L] (M = Pt, Pd; Tr = first-row transition metal; L = Tr-coordinated axial ligand) form a variety of dimeric structures via M<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>M' and M<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>S' contacts. We found that [PtVO(SOCPh)4] (1), a molecular spin qubit, yields three crystalline toluene (tol) solvates, namely 1<middle dot>0.875tol and two polymorphic 1<middle dot>0.5tol phases. The crystals contain either staggered quasi-coaxial dimers with short Pt<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>Pt' distances (3.17-3.23 & Aring;) or heavily bent noncoaxial molecular pairs supported by Pt<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>S' contacts (3.34-3.38 & Aring;). By contrast, in the known solvatomorphs 1<middle dot>CH2Cl2 and 1<middle dot>0.5hex (hex = n-hexane), two collinear molecules compose a "square" dimer via a pair of reciprocating Pt<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>S' contacts (3.13-3.16 & Aring;). According to gas-phase DFT calculations (PBE0/def2-TZVPP/D3BJ), dimerization is energetically favored by 15-20 kcal mol-1 and is guided by a shallow potential energy surface, with staggered dimers as ground configurations but eclipsed and square dimers well within energetic reach. Inspection of the local energy minima also disclosed a previously unrecognized eclipsed arrangement with similar to 45 degrees twisting of both PWs relative to the metal plane, whose existence was confirmed by statistical analysis of PW structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. Our results led to a new classification scheme for these PW dimers relevant to molecular magnetism and quantum technologies.

TI Phase Symmetry Breaking of Counterpropagating Light in Microresonators
   for Switches and Logic Gates
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The rapidly growing field of integrated photonics is enabling a large number of novel devices for optical data processing, neuromorphic computing and circuits for quantum photonics. While many photonic devices are based on linear optics, nonlinear responses at low threshold power are of high interest for optical switching and computing. In the case of counterpropagating light, nonlinear interactions can be utilized for chip-based isolators and logic gates. In this work, a symmetry breaking of the phases of counterpropagating light waves is found in high-Q ring resonators. This abrupt change in the phases can be used for optical switches and logic gates. In addition to these experimental results, theoretical models are provided that describe the phase symmetry breaking of counterpropagating light in ring resonators.

TI Nanoscopic Charge Fluctuations in a Gallium Phosphide Waveguide Measured
   by Single Molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present efficient evanescent coupling of single organic molecules to a gallium phosphide (GaP) subwavelength waveguide (nanoguide) decorated with microelectrodes. By monitoring their Stark shifts, we reveal that the coupled molecules experience fluctuating electric fields. We analyze the spectral dynamics of different molecules over a large range of optical powers in the nanoguide to show that these fluctuations are light-induced and local. A simple model is developed to explain our observations based on the optical activation of charges at an estimated mean density of 2.5 x 10(22) m(-3) in the GaP nanostructure. Our work showcases the potential of organic molecules as nanoscopic sensors of the electric charge as well as the use of GaP nanostructures for integrated quantum photonics.

TI Quantum advantage for differential equation analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum algorithms for differential equation solving, data processing, and machine learning potentially offer an exponential speedup over all known classical algorithms. However, there also exist obstacles to obtaining this potential speedup in useful problem instances. The essential obstacle for quantum differential equation solving is that outputting useful information may require difficult postprocessing, and the essential obstacle for quantum data processing and machine learning is that inputting the data is a difficult task just by itself. In this study, we demonstrate that, when combined, these difficulties solve one another. We show how the output of quantum differential equation solving can serve as the input for quantum data processing and machine learning, allowing dynamical analysis in terms of principal components, power spectra, and wavelet decompositions. To illustrate this, we consider continuous-time Markov processes on epidemiological and social networks. These quantum algorithms provide an exponential advantage over existing classical Monte Carlo methods.

TI Enhancement of the Quantum Coherence in a Hierarchical Environment
   System by Weak Measurement and Weak Measurement Reversal
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The quantum coherence of a two-qubit system in which each qubit is coupled to its own hierarchical environment is studied. The effect of the hierarchical environment is explored in order to improve the coherence effectively. It is discovered that the dynamics of coherence can be manipulated by the number N of the second-layer cavities (mn$m_{n}$), the coupling strengths omega(0), omega, kappa, respectively for the qubit-cavity (m(0)), nearest-neighbor, and m(0)-mn$m_{n}$ cavities. It depends also on the decay rate Gamma of second-layer cavities. Furthermore, an effective scheme for enhancing coherence is proposed by using weak measurement and weak measurement reversal. The explicit conditions of the optimal measurement strengths to improve the coherence comparatively are derived. It is seen that the final stable value of the coherence is independent of the number N of second-layer cavities but is related to the weak measurement strength m when the coupling strength between two nearest-neighbor cavities is taken into account.

TI Quasiprobabilities in Quantum Thermodynamics and Many-Body Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation, and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance, the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical method for electron-phonon systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Interactions between electrons and phonons play a crucial role in quantum materials. Yet, there is no universal method that would simultaneously accurately account for strong electron-phonon interactions and electronic correlations. By combining methods of the variational quantum eigensolver and the variational non-Gaussian solver, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for this type of correlated systems. This hybrid method tackles systems with arbitrarily strong electron-phonon coupling without increasing the number of required qubits and quantum gates, as compared to purely electronic models. We benchmark our method by applying it to the paradigmatic Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling, and show that it correctly captures the competition between charge density wave and antiferromagnetic phases, quantitatively consistent with exact diagonalization.

TI Local discrimination of orbital angular momentum in entangled states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we address the use of a calcite crystal-based local detector for the discrimination of the orbital angular momentum of quantum radiation produced by parametric down-conversion, using only a portion of the beam. Specifically, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that discrimination can be achieved by exploiting the introduction of a precise and controlled spatial shift between two replicas of the state within the crystals. This approach utilizes a robust and intrinsically stable monolithic configuration, obviating the need for feedback mechanisms or thermal drift compensation. Our method offers a promising avenue for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of quantum communication systems, and we believe that this technology could significantly advance the development of quantum communication techniques, where information encoding is based on orbital angular momentum, or spatially distributed orbital angular momentum detection.

AB Quantum mechanics (QM) is a favorite area of physics to feature in "science and religion" discussions. We argue that this is at least partly because the arcane results of QM can be deployed to make big theological claims by the linguistic sleight of hand of "register switching"-sliding imperceptibly from technical into everyday language using the same vocabulary. We clarify the discussion by deploying the formal mapping of QM into classical statistical mechanics (CSM) via the mathematical device of "Wick rotation." This equivalence between QM and CSM suggests caution in claiming distinctiveness for quantum theologizing. After outlining two areas in which quantum insights nevertheless resonate with longstanding themes in theological reflection (hiddenness and visualizability), we suggest that both QM and CSM point to a theology of science in which scientists participate in the divine gaze on creation as imago Dei.

TI Charge States of Single Quantum Dots in a Microcavity
   p-n-p Heterostructure with the Built-in Coulomb
   Blockade
SO JETP LETTERS
AB The charge state of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots in microcavity p-n-p heterostructures in the presence of built-in Coulomb blockade induced by a thin layer with the n-type conductivity located near quantum dots is studied. The optimal doping profile and thickness of layers in the heterostructure are determined analytically by solving the Poisson equation. The number and sign of carriers in a single quantum dot are determined by experimental studies of spin dynamics and statistics of single-photon radiation under resonant and quasi-resonant excitation. The possibility of obtaining neutral and positively and negatively charged quantum dots with a probability exceeding 90% is shown, which opens up new opportunities for the study of optical processes in single quantum dots and their application in quantum photonics.

TI Enhancing single photon emission through quasi-bound states in the
   continuum of monolithic hexagonal boron nitride metasurface
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB A patterned structure of monolithic hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on a glass substrate, which can enhance the emission of the embedded single photon emitters (SPEs), is useful for onchip single-photon sources of high-quality. Here, we design and demonstrate a monolithic hBN metasurface with quasi-bound states in the continuum mode at emission wavelength with ultrahigh Q values to enhance fluorescence emission of SPEs in hBN. Because of ultrahigh electric field enhancement inside the proposed hBN metasurface, an ultrahigh Purcell factor (3.3 x 10(4)) is achieved. In addition, the Purcell factor can also be strongly enhanced in most part of the hBN structure, which makes the hBN metasurface suitable for e.g. monolithic quantum photonics.

TI Progress in Photonics Quantum Metrology (Invited)
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Quantum metrology, as one of the primary applications of contemporary quantum mechanics, has emerged as a crucial area of research in quantum technology in recent years. The fundamental objective of quantum metrology is to utilize quantum resources to enhance the precision of measuring unknown parameters in physical systems. Compared with other physical systems, photon-based systems possess distinct advantages such as long coherence time and low interaction with the environment, making them an ideal platform for processing quantum information. Improving sensing precision through photon-based sensors stands as a pivotal task within optical quantum metrology. The fundamental theory of quantum metrology is based on the principles of parameter estimation theory. The quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) serves as a widely utilized mathematical tool in quantum metrology for evaluating the ultimate limit of precision.In the context of single parameter estimation, it is inversely proportional to the quantum Fisher information (QFI). By scrutinizing the QFI associated with different quantum states encoding parameters, one can determine which type of quantum states would be the most optimal for a given sensing task involving an unknown parameter. The optical interferometer is a crucial apparatus in optics and plays an indispensable role in quantum metrology. Its applications range widely, from spectroscopic interferometric techniques to remarkable examples involving stellar interferometry and gravitational wave detection. Classical theory does not provide precise analysis of phase shift estimation in the interferometer, while the semi-classical theory, considering the quantized detection process, establishes the shot noise limit or standard quantum limit (SQL) of precision with N detected photons. However, it should be noted that SQL should not be considered as the fundamental bound when non-classical states of light, such as squeezed states, are injected into the interferometer. The maximally entangled photon number state known as NOON state can achieve a precision of 1/N referred to as the Heisenberg limit (HL). In comparison with SQL, HL exhibits scaling improvement and represents the fundamental bound for parameter estimation. Quantum resources like squeezing and entanglement can genuinely enhance phase estimation precision, while employing a sequential strategy where probe states undergo a sequential process can also yield maximal precision. In recent years, quantum metrology has experienced rapid development, witnessing the generation of numerous non-classical quantum states with inherent metrological advantages and the invention of various interferometer structures aimed at enhancing phase estimation precision. Consequently, it is imperative to comprehensively and meticulously summarize existing research in order to provide guidance for future advancements in this field. Progress The general process of quantum metrology can be abstracted into four steps:1) preparation of a probe state;2) interaction of the probe with the system to be measured;3) measurement;4) classical estimation, as shown in the main text (Fig.1). In terms of unitary evolution, Lloyd et al. compared the precision bound provided by four strategies, i.e., classical-classical (CC) strategy,classical-quantum (CQ) strategy, quantum-classical (QC) strategy and quantum-quantum (QQ) strategy (Fig.2). The QC and QQ strategies provide the ultimate precision of parameter estimation beyond the CQ and CC strategies.
   By analyzing the different strategies, one can easily find the relationships among the Fisher information, the QFI, the SQL and the HL (Table 1).The fundamental principles of quantum metrology are elucidated, albeit in an abstract manner. To provide a more concrete illustration, we will consider the phase estimation problem as a prime example, which represents the most captivating application within quantum metrology. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) serves as the prevailing structure (Fig.4). Numerous studies propose that by introducing distinct non-classical quantum states such as squeezed states and NOON states into the MZI, it is possible to enhance the estimation precision of phase shift in its two arms. Other types of interferometers like Michelson interferometer and Sagnac interferometer (Fig.6) also play significant roles in gravitational wave detection and quantum gyroscope applications. In practical scenarios, noise inevitably exists within interferometers. For instance, losses are almost unavoidable and can compromise precision levels. This review introduces several approaches aimed at mitigating the impact of loss. In most realistic sensing scenarios, the system to be measured typically encompasses multiple unknown parameters. Multi parameter quantum metrology is also a crucial research aspect within the field of quantum information science, encompassing tasks such as estimating multiple phases, distributed quantum sensing, phase and phase diffusion, and so on. Besides addressing the phase estimation problem, optical quantum metrology finds numerous other applications including imaging and magnetometer.Finally, we provide a brief overview of some relevant works. Conclusions and Prospects Photon, as an excellent information carrier, is suitable to be applied in quantum metrology, thereby establishing optical quantum metrology as a pivotal and burgeoning field of research. Further comprehensive and meticulous investigations are imperative to advance the theoretical and experimental development of optical quantum sensing. This review gives an in-depth and detailed introduction of recent progress in optical quantum process and we hope it will inspire some interest of readers.

TI Detecting chirality-induced spin selectivity in chromophore-linked DNA
   hairpins using photogenerated radical pairs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) results in spin polarization of electrons transmitted through chiral molecules and materials. Since CISS results in spin polarization even at room temperature, it affords the possibility of using it to develop quantum technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. We have shown previously that photo-driven hole transfer within DNA hairpins provides a facile route to generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs). To study the effect of CISS on the spin dynamics of SCRPs in DNA hairpins, we prepared a series of electron donor-chiral bridge-acceptor molecules where the chiral bridge is a B-form DNA helix consisting of 4 to 6 base pairs. Naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) serves as the hairpin linker chromophore and electron acceptor. Photoexcitation of NDI results in rapid hole transfer through the it-stacked purine bases of the DNA and trapping of the hole on a terminal stilbene diether (Sd) to generate the NDI center dot-- Sd center dot+SCRP. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the SCRPs at X-(9.6 GHz), Q-(34 GHz), and W-(94 GHz) bands show that the CISS effect imparts significant triplet character to the SCRP. We do not observe a significant dependence of CISS on DNA length, likely resulting from hole delocalization over the guanine bases in the G-tract. Interestingly, we find that the CISS contribution significantly increases with magnetic field strength. These findings should be considered in any future modeling of CISS.

TI SUVS: Secure Unencrypted Voting Scheme
SO INFORMATICA
AB In this paper, we propose a light-weight electronic voting protocol. The approach used by our protocol to conceal the ballots does not imply encryption, and guarantees the privacy of the direction of the vote unless all the contestants (parties) agree to do so. Our method is based on the division of the ballot into different pieces of information, which separately reveal no information at all, and that can be latter aggregated to recover the original vote. We show that, despite its simplicity, this scheme is powerful, it does not sacrifice any of the security properties demanded in a formal electronic voting protocol, and, furthermore, even in post-quantum scenarios, neither the casted votes can be tampered with, nor the identity of any elector can be linked with the direction of her vote.

TI Persistency of quantum non-multi-local correlations in noisy acyclic
   networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The topic of network quantum nonlocal correlations arises from the large-scale quantum communications. It has been demonstrated that non-m-local correlations (m is the number of sources) in some special kinds of networks will decay under the influence of noises from imperfect devices as these networks extend, including linear and star networks. Furthermore, we observe that under the same noisy level, persistency of non-multi-local correlations in aforementioned different kinds of networks appears obvious discrepancy. Therefore, it becomes a natural and challenging task to check the persistency of non-multi-locality in more complex acyclic network, since star and linear networks can be regarded as acyclic networks. It is worth noting that an acyclic network is one indeterminate forked tree-shaped networks. So the study is focused on the tree-shaped network. We first devote to discussing the determinate forked case. We obtain inequality persistency criteria of determinate k-forked tree-shaped network non-(s n (k))-local correlations (s n (k) is the number of total sources). We show that the larger the fork number k is larger, the better the non-multi-locality of this network persists. In the indeterminate forked case, the inequality persistency criteria are also established. We observe that the larger the number of parties in the last layer of an acyclic network, the better the non-multi-locality of this network is persisted. This theoretical research may guide us how to build quantum networks with the stronger correlation in practical communications.

TI An Optimal Linear-combination-of-unitaries-based Quantum Linear System
   Solver
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Solving systems of linear equations is one of the most important primitives in many different areas, including in optimization, simulation, and machine learning. Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems have the potential to provide a quantum advantage for these problems.
   In this work, we recall the Chebyshev iterative method and the corresponding optimal polynomial approximation of the inverse. We show that the Chebyshev iteration polynomial can be efficiently evaluated both using quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) as well as linear combination of unitaries (LCU). We achieve this by bounding the 1-norm of the coefficients of the polynomial expressed in the Chebyshev basis. This leads to a considerable constant-factor improvement in the runtime of quantum linear system solvers that are based on LCU or QSVT (or, conversely, a several orders of magnitude smaller error with the same runtime/circuit depth).

TI High-fidelity four-photon GHZ states on chip
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Mutually entangled multi-photon states are at the heart of all-optical quantum technologies. While impressive progresses have been reported in the generation of such quantum light states using free space apparatus, high-fidelity high-rate on-chip entanglement generation is crucial for future scalability. In this work, we use a bright quantum-dot based single-photon source to demonstrate the high fidelity generation of 4-photon Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with a low-loss reconfigurable glass photonic circuit. We reconstruct the density matrix of the generated states using full quantum-state tomography reaching an experimental fidelity to the target state of F GHZ 4 = ( 86.0 +/- 0.4 ) % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\rm{GHZ}}}}}_{4}}=(86.0\pm 0.4)\, \%$$\end{document} , and a purity of P GHZ 4 = ( 76.3 +/- 0.6 ) % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}_{{{{{\rm{GHZ}}}}}_{4}}=(76.3\pm 0.6)\, \%$$\end{document} . The entanglement of the generated states is certified with a semi device-independent approach through the violation of a Bell-like inequality by more than 39 standard deviations. Finally, we carry out a four-partite quantum secret sharing protocol on-chip where a regulator shares with three interlocutors a sifted key with up to 1978 bits, achieving a qubit-error rate of 10.87%. These results establish that the quantum-dot technology combined with glass photonic circuitry offers a viable path for entanglement generation and distribution.

TI Two types of cooperation between the photons in multiple scattering
   lasing and their possible application
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The two types of cooperative effects between the converted photons in the multiple steps of Raman lasing are proposed. The first type involves the cooperative process between the photons of one of the steps of Raman conversion. The second cooperative effect appears between the photons belonging to different steps of multiple conversions. This new type of generated coherent state is proposed by novel bimodal entangled sources, which take into consideration both the coherence and collective phenomena between the photons belonging to the system of the bimodal field obtained in multiple Raman emissions. For this, the creation and annihilation operators of the new resonator quasi-particle ware introduced taking into consideration the Hilbert space of field vectors at frequency differences, ! p +1 - ! p between the anti-Stokes components of multiple Raman lasing. The application of higher-order multiple Roman bimodal coherent field quantum information is described in accordance with the definition of quantum amplitude and phase of such entangled states of light. The cooperative properties of the bimodal field in the multiple scattering processes of Raman lasing in the cavity/fiber and its interaction with ensemble of atoms prepared in coherent state are proposed. We introduced the new characteristics of bi-modes field in which the multiple Raman scattering takes into consideration the interaction with coherent excitation and non-stationary quantum fluctuations of the generation rate of the introduced quasi particles. Here, we represent the rate moments through the annihilation and generation operators of the cavity quasi-parties.

TI Response of quantum spin networks to attacks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB We investigate the ground states of spin models defined on networks that we imprint (e.g., non-complex random networks like Erdos-Renyi, or complex networks like Watts-Strogatz, and Barabasi-Albert), and their response to decohering processes which we model with network attacks. We quantify the complexity of these ground states, and their response to the attacks, by calculating distributions of network measures of an emergent network whose link weights are the pairwise mutual information between spins. We focus on attacks which projectively measure spins. We find that the emergent networks in the ground state do not satisfy the usual criteria for complexity, and their average properties are captured well by a single dimensionless parameter in the Hamiltonian. While the response of classical networks to attacks is well-studied, where classical complex networks are known to be more robust to random attacks than random networks, we find counter-intuitive results for our quantum networks. We find that the ground states for Hamiltonians defined on different classes of imprinted networks respond similarly to all our attacks, and the attacks rescale the average properties of the emergent network by a constant factor. Mean field theory explains these results for relatively dense networks, but we also find the simple rescaling behavior away from the regime of validity of mean field theory. Our calculations indicate that complex spin networks are not more robust to projective measurement attacks, and presumably also other quantum attacks, than non-complex spin networks, in contrast to the classical case. Understanding the response of the spin networks to decoherence and attacks will have applications in understanding the physics of open quantum systems, and in designing robust complex quantum systems-possibly even a robust quantum internet in the long run-that is maximally resistant to decoherence.

SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB This paper presents, to our knowledge, a new approach in developing integrated pure heralded single-photon sources based on the interplay between the spontaneous four-wave mixing and sum-frequency generation parametric processes. We introduce a comprehensive quantum model to exploit this interplay in AlGaAs and LiNbO3 nanophotonic waveguides. The developed model is used to assess the performance of the sources based on the photon-pair generation and the associated spectral purity. We find that this approach can remarkably improve the spectral purity of low-pure generated photon pairs, relaxing the restrictions on the structure design and the used pump wavelength. In addition, it overcomes the current hurdles in implementing on-chip photon detectors operating at room temperature, paving the way for advanced applications in integrated quantum photonics and information processing.

Using quantum-resistant tools, like lattice-based hashing, modified Poseidon functions, and zk-SNARK proofs, we ensure fast, privacy-preserving verification without relying on trusted third parties. Post-Quantum VerITAS offers a scalable, post-quantum-ready solution for image integrity, with direct applications in journalism, social media, and secure digital communication.

TI Critical fluctuations and noise spectra in two-dimensional
   Fe3GeTe2 magnets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Critical fluctuations play a crucial role in determining spin orders in low-dimensional magnetic materials. However, experimentally linking these fluctuations to scaling theory-and thereby uncovering insights into spin interaction models-remains a challenge. Here, we utilize a nitrogen-vacancy center-based quantum decoherence imaging technique to probe critical fluctuations in the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2. Our data reveal that critical fluctuations produce a random magnetic field, with noise spectra undergoing significant changes near the critical temperature. To explain this phenomenon, we developed a theoretical framework showing that the spectral density exhibits 1/f noise characteristics near the critical temperature, transitioning to white noise behavior away from this regime. By experimentally adjusting the sample-to-diamond distance, we identified the crossover temperature between these two noise types. These findings offer an approach to studying phase transition dynamics through critical fluctuations, enabling precise determination of critical exponents associated with long-range correlations. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of critical phenomena across diverse physical systems.

AB Code-based cryptography received attention after the NIST started the post-quantum cryptography standardization process in 2016. A central NP-hard problem is the binary syndrome decoding problem, on which the security of many code-based cryptosystems lies. The best known methods to solve this problem all stem from the information-set decoding strategy. A recent line of work considers augmented versions of this strategy, with hints provided by side-channel information. In this work, we consider the integer syndrome decoding problem, where the integer syndrome is available but might be noisy. We study how the performance of the decoder is affected by the noise. We provide experimental results on cryptographic parameters for the Classic McEliece and BIKE cryptosystems, which are in the fourth round of the NIST standardization process.

AB Measuring the security of cryptographic systems is not a simple task. Nevertheless, there is an increasing need for a cryptographic metric which could assist in decision making when choosing between various candidates. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has launched a process to standardize quantum-resistance public key encryption, key encapsulation and digital signature algorithms. This is NIST's response to the threat posed by quantum computers against classical public key cryptography. In this paper, we apply a metric taxonomy, produced by earlier studies, to two NIST third round finalist digital signature algorithms Dilithium and Falcon in order to asses the effectiveness and extensiveness of the metric. Although, our results show that clear differences can be found with used metrics, we propose some improvements to them to allow more comprehensive analysis.

TI Variational Quantum Simulators Based on Waveguide QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Waveguide QED simulators are analog quantum simulators made by quantum emitters interacting with one-dimensional photonic band gap materials. One of their remarkable features is that they can be used to engineer tunable-range emitter interactions. Here, we demonstrate how these interactions can be a resource to develop more efficient variational quantum algorithms for certain problems. In particular, we illustrate their power in creating wave function Ansatze that capture accurately the ground state of quantum critical spin models (XXZ and Ising) with fewer gates and optimization parameters than other variational Ansatze based on nearest-neighbor or infinite-range entangling gates. Finally, we study the potential advantages of these waveguide Ansatze in the presence of noise. Overall, these results evidence the potential of using the interaction range as a variational parameter and place waveguide QED simulators as a promising platform for variational quantum algorithms.

TI Full configuration interaction simulations of exchange-coupled donors in
   silicon using multi-valley effective mass theory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Donor spins in silicon have achieved record values of coherence times and single-qubit gate fidelities. The next stage of development involves demonstrating high-fidelity two-qubit logic gates, where the most natural coupling is the exchange interaction. To aid the efficient design of scalable donor-based quantum processors, we model the two-electron wave function using a full configuration interaction method within a multi-valley effective mass theory. We exploit the high computational efficiency of our code to investigate the exchange interaction, valley population, and electron densities for two phosphorus donors in a wide range of lattice positions, orientations, and as a function of applied electric fields. The outcomes are visualized with interactive images where donor positions can be swept while watching the valley and orbital components evolve accordingly. Our results provide a physically intuitive and quantitatively accurate understanding of the placement and tuning criteria necessary to achieve high-fidelity two-qubit gates with donors in silicon.

TI Evidence for a possible quantum effect on the formation of lithium-doped
   amorphous calcium phosphate from solution
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Differential isotope effects are an emerging tool for discovering possible nontrivial quantum mechanical effects within biological systems. However, it is often nearly impossible to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which a biological isotope effect manifests due to the complexity of these systems. As such, one proposed in vitro system of study for a quantum isotope effect is calcium phosphate aggregation, where symmetric calcium phosphate molecular species, known as Posner molecules, have been theorized to have phosphorus nuclear spin-dependent self-binding rates, which could be differently modulated by doping with stable lithium isotopes. Here, we present in vitro evidence for such a differential lithium isotope effect on the formation and aggregation of amorphous calcium phosphate from solution under certain conditions. Experiments confirm that lithium incorporates into amorphous calcium phosphate, lithium isotope effects. Given the importance of calcium phosphate in biological systems-ranging from mitochondrial signaling pathways to key biomineralization these results present an important step in understanding calcium phosphate nucleation as well as the potential role of calcium phosphate for quantum biology and processing.

AB Lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic algorithm FALCON needs to execute the time-critical Fast-Fourier Transformation (FFT). Existing works in the literature have explored hardware for FFT of FALCON using Cooley-Tukey. In this work, we have designed an efficient hardware-software co-design of FFT for FALCON using Winograd's FFT method. Winograd's FFT is a widely adopted technique for FFT and reduces the multiplication counts for higherradix FFT than the Cooley-Tukey, with a penalty of some extra addition/subtraction. Our Winograd radix-8 framework for FFT outperforms the traditional Cooley-Tukey method. Moreover,our proposed architecture is flexible in adopting different instruction sets and can also be configured for any type of FFT method with specific instruction sets.

TI Chirality encoding in resonant metasurfaces governed by lattice
   symmetries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Chiral metasurfaces provide invaluable tools for controlling structured light required for biosensing, photochemistry, holography, and quantum photonics. Here we suggest and realize a universal strategy for engineering chiral response of resonant metasurfaces via the interplay of meta-atom geometry and lattice arrangements within all five possible planar Bravais symmetries. By introducing chiral gradient metasurfaces, we illustrate how our approach allows producing a predictable chiral response tunable by simple parameter variations. We highlight that the symmetry-controlled chiral response provides an additional degree of freedom in optical signal processing, and showcase this with simultaneous mid-IR image encoding in two fundamental quantities, transmission and circular dichroism. Our proposed concept represents a universal toolkit for on-demand design and control of chiral metastructures that has potential for numerous applications in life sciences, quantum optics and more.

TI Reconstructing quantum states via unambiguous state discrimination
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework for the reconstruction of quantum states. The reconstruction of an unknown quantum state requires the information of a complete set of observables, obtained through experimental measurements of Hermitian operators usually defined as positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). The scheme involves a single-qubit unambiguous state discrimination POVM, which can be generalized to perform n-qubit measurements. We also use maximum likelihood estimation as a method in the reconstruction of the density matrix from experimental data and show that the expected value of the cleaner is independent of the parameter of the density operator.

TI A New Type of Classical Logic Circuit with Exponential Speedup
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Compared with classical algorithms, quantum algorithms can show the advantage of exponential speedup in solving some problems. Solving the NAND-Tree problem is a typical example, which can be speed up exponentially by quantum walk. This scheme is groundbreaking due to the universality of the negative-AND (NAND) gate. In fact, the NAND gate is also universal for classical computation, making it an important target for development. Herein, the quantum NAND-Tree onto the classical circuit network is mapped and a new type of classical logic circuit with the NAND gate that can perform the quantum algorithms is designed. These classical logic gates that are designed have exponential speedup functions compared with conventional ones. Because classical circuit networks possess good scalability and stability, the present scheme is expected to have potential applications for information processing in the era of big data.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics of generation of bound states in the continuum
   via single-photon scattering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multiqubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables us to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics, hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.

TI Photophysics of Intrinsic Single-Photon Emitters in Silicon Nitride at

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A robust process for fabricating intrinsic single-photon emitters in silicon nitride is recently established. These emitters show promise for quantum applications due to room-temperature operation and monolithic integration with technologically mature silicon nitride photonics platforms. Here, the fundamental photophysical properties of these emitters are probed through measurements of optical transition wavelengths, linewidths, and photon antibunching as a function of temperature from 4.2 to 300 K. Important insight into the potential for lifetime-limited linewidths is provided through measurements of inhomogeneous and temperature-dependent broadening of the zero-phonon lines. At 4.2 K, spectral diffusion is found to be the main broadening mechanism, while spectroscopy time series reveal zero-phonon lines with instrument-limited linewidths.

TI Flat-optics generation of broadband photon pairs with tunable
   polarization entanglement
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The concept of "flat optics" is quickly conquering different fields of photonics, but its implementation in quantum optics is still in its infancy. In particular, polarization entanglement, strongly required in quantum photonics, is so far not realized on "flat" platforms. Meanwhile, relaxed phase matching of "flat" nonlinear optical sources enables enormous freedom in tailoring their polarization properties. Here we use this freedom to generate photon pairs with tunable polarization entanglement via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in a 400-nm GaP film. By changing the pump polarization, we tune the polarization state of photon pairs from maximally entangled to almost disentangled, which is impossible in a single bulk SPDC source. Polarization entanglement, together with the broadband frequency spectrum, results in an ultranarrow (12 fs) Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and promises extensions to hyper- entanglement.

TI Two-electron conduction band of a graphene quantum dot and coherent spin
   manipulation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB To get a carbon-based qubit, we pay attention to the two-electron conduction band of a graphene quantum dot (GQD) in the presence of an external magnetic field and an extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI). To help understand the formation of the two-electron spectra, we first calculate the tight-binding (TB) spectra. There exist the sensitivity of the conduction band to magnetic fields and the mixing of spin states induced by a Rashba SOI. The two factors inspire the study of the magnetic-field modulation of the conduction band for realizing a spin qubit. We present the method for calculating the electronic structure of a few-electron GQD. The roles of the Coulomb interaction and the Rashba SOI in the two-electron conduction band are investigated. The Coulomb interaction contributes to a singlet-triplet level crossing and the Rashba SOI leads to a singlet-triplet mixing. The fast initialization and coherent manipulation of spin states are demonstrated by the magnetic control of singlet-triplet splitting.

TI Unruh quantum Otto engine in the presence of a reflecting boundary
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We introduce a new model of relativistic quantum analogue of the classical Otto engine in the presence of a perfectly reflecting boundary. A single qubit acts as the working substance interacting with a massless quantum scalar field, with the boundary obeying the Dirichlet condition. The quantum vacuum serves as a thermal bath through the Unruh effect. We observe that the response function of the qubit gets significantly modified by the presence of the reflecting boundary. From the structure of the correlation function, we find that three different cases emerge, namely, the intermediate boundary regime, the near boundary regime, and the far boundary regime. As expected, the correlation in the far boundary regime approaches that of the Unruh quantum Otto engine (UQOE) when the reflecting boundary goes to infinity. The effect of the reflecting boundary is manifested through the reduction of the critical excitation probability of the qubit and the work output of the engine. Inspite of the reduced work output, the efficiency of the engine remains unaltered even in the presence of the boundary.

   applications
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The fundamental understanding of molecular quantum electrodynamics via the strong light-matter interactions between a nanophotonic cavity and quantum emitters opens various applications in quantum biology, biophysics, and chemistry. However, considerable obstacles to obtaining a clear understanding of coupling mechanisms via reliable experimental quantifications remain to be resolved before this field can truly blossom toward practical applications in quantitative life science and photochemistry. Here, we provide recent advancements of state-of-the-art demonstrations in plexcitonic and vibro-polaritonic strong couplings and their applications. We highlight recent studies on various strong coupling systems for altering chemical reaction landscapes. Then, we discuss reports dedicated to the utilization of strong coupling methods for biomolecular sensing, protein functioning studies, and the generation of hybrid light-matter states inside living cells. The strong coupling regime provides a tool for investigating and altering coherent quantum processes in natural biological processes. We also provide an overview of new findings and future avenues of quantum biology and biochemistry.

TI Physiological Search for Quantum Biological Sensing Effects Based on the
   Wigner-Yanase Connection between Coherence and Uncertainty
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A fundamental concept of quantum physics, the Wigner-Yanase information, is used here as a measure of quantum coherence in spin-dependent radical-pair reactions pertaining to biological magnetic sensing. This measure is connected to the uncertainty of the reaction yields and, further, to the statistics of a cellular receptor-ligand system used to biochemically convey magnetic-field changes. Measurable physiological quantities, such as the number of receptors and fluctuations in ligand concentration, are shown to reflect the introduced Wigner-Yanase measure of singlet-triplet coherence. A quantum-biological uncertainty relation connecting the product of a biological resource and a biological figure of merit with the Wigner-Yanase coherence is arrived at. This approach can serve as a general search for quantum-coherent effects within cellular environments.
   Quantum biology promises to synthesize two until now rather disjoint fields of science: quantum science and life science. To promote this synthesis, this work takes advantage of concepts used by scientists interested in building quantum computers and applies them to biochemical scenarios relevant to measurements performed by biologists in cellular environments.image

TI Implementation and Performance Evaluation of Quantum-Inspired Clustering
   Scheme for Energy-Efficient WSNs
SO SENSORS
AB Advancements in communication technologies and the proliferation of smart devices have significantly increased the demand for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These networks play an important role in the IoT environment. The wireless sensor network has many sensor nodes that are used to monitor the surrounding environment. Energy consumption is the main issue in WSN due to the difficulty in recharging or replacing batteries in the sensor nodes. Cluster head selection is one of the most effective approaches to reduce overall network energy consumption. In recent years, quantum technology has become a growing research area. Various quantum-based algorithms have been developed by researchers for clustering. This article introduces a novel, energy-efficient clustering scheme called the quantum-inspired clustering scheme (QICS), which is based on the Quantum Grover algorithm. It is mainly used to improve the performance of cluster head selection in a wireless sensor network. The research conducted simulations that compared the proposed cluster selection method against established algorithms, LEACH, GSACP, and EDS-KHO. The simulation environment used 100 nodes connected via specific energy and communication settings. QICS stands out as the superior clustering method since it extends the lifetime of the network by 30.5%, decreases energy usage by 22.4%, and increases the packet delivery ratios by 19.8%. The quantum method achieved an increase in speed with its clustering procedure. This study proves how quantum-inspired techniques have become an emerging approach to handling WSN energy restrictions, thus indicating future potential for IoT systems with energy awareness and scalability.

TI Distributed entanglement generation from asynchronously excited qubits
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB The generation of GHZ states calls for simultaneous excitation of multiple qubits. The peculiarity of such states is reflected in their nonzero distributed entanglement which is not contained in other entangled states. We study the optimal way to excite three superconducting qubits through a common cavity resonator in a circuit such that the generation of distributed entanglement among them could be obtained at the highest degree in a time-controllable way. A non-negative measure quantifying this entanglement is derived as a time function of the quadripartite system evolution. We find that this measure does not stay static but obtains the same maximum periodically. When the qubit-resonator couplings are allowed to vary, its peak value is enhanced monotonically by increasing the greatest coupling strength to one of the qubits. The period of its peak to peak revival maximizes when the couplings become inhomogeneous, thus qubit excitation becoming asynchronous, at a relative ratio of 0.35. The study demonstrates the role of asynchronous excitations for time-controlling multi-qubit systems, in particular in extending entanglement time.

TI Inverse Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in Multimode Cavity
   Optomechanical Systems
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Cavity optomechanical systems are the cross field of quantum optics and classical physics, which study the mixed interactions between light field and mechanical motion. As cavity optomechanical systems develop, scientists have discovered the phenomenon of inverse electromagnetically induced transparency (IEIT). We propose a new system that inserts two transmissive active mirrors into an optical cavity to form a structure of an optical cavity and two mechanical oscillators. A beam of pump light and a beam of probe light are emitted from the left side, while there is only one beam of probe light on the right side. Driven by the three beams of light, the system can still undergo the IEIT phenomenon, and the cavity field energy is equal to the energy sum of the two mechanical oscillators after adjusting the cavity field power and the parameter n (the ratio of two mechanical oscillators b(1) and b(2) to coupling coefficients). When a mechanical oscillator is added and driven by the same cavity field power, the coupling effect is better than that of a single oscillator, and the mechanical oscillator energy can also be controlled by adjusting the parameter n. Our study may have good application prospects in filtering, quantum information processing, quantum communication, and other fields.
   Methods Beginning with a new optomechanical system model, we investigate the composition of the system and provide definitions for each parameter. The obtained Hamiltonian is solved by Heisenberg equations of motion, factorization, and other methods, and the relationship between the cavity field and the output field is established. Finally, the relationship between cavity field energy and mechanical oscillator energy under different parameters is explored to conduct further analysis.
   Results and discussions The results indicate that when n is set as different values, it can all satisfy epsilon(outL+) = epsilon(outR+) = 0, which means that the IEIT phenomenon occurs. The satisfied condition is G(2) = 2 kappa/root n(2) + 1 (Fig. 2), and the coupling effect is significantly enhanced. When n = 0, only the mechanical oscillator b(2) has energy, as shown in Fig. 3(b), while under n = 1, mechanical oscillators b(1) and b(2) have the same energy, as shown in Fig. 3(d). Figs. 4(b), 4(c), 5(b), and 5(c) respectively represent the energy possessed by the mechanical oscillators b(1) and b(2) at n = 0. 5 and n = 1. 5. By comparing with the energy of the cavity field, when IEIT occurs, number of photons in the cavity probe is equal to the sum of mechanical excitations. Adjusting n can achieve energy distribution adjustment.
   Conclusions We propose a composite multimode cavity optomechanical system, which consists of a control field and two probe fields driven by an optical resonant cavity coupled with two mechanical oscillators. The parameters in this system are controlled, including the coupling strength between the mechanical oscillator and the cavity photon, and the ratio between the coupling strengths of the mechanical oscillators. Numerical results show that this cavity optomechanical system can realize the IEIT phenomenon and further discuss the energy residency problem. Additionally, the coupling effect of the system is significantly enhanced with the action of two mechanical oscillators. By adjusting the cavity field power and the coupling relationship between the mechanical oscillators and the cavity, the system will have potential applications in filtering, energy distribution regulation, quantum communication, and energy storage.

TI QiMARL: Quantum-Inspired Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Strategy for
   Efficient Resource Energy Distribution in Nodal Power Stations
SO AI
AB The coupling of quantum computing with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides an exciting direction to tackle intricate decision-making tasks in high-dimensional spaces. This work introduces a new quantum-inspired multi-agent reinforcement learning (QiMARL) model, utilizing quantum parallelism to achieve learning efficiency and scalability improvement. The QiMARL model is tested on an energy distribution task, which optimizes power distribution between generating and demanding nodal power stations. We compare the convergence time, reward performance, and scalability of QiMARL with traditional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning methods, such as Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling, MADDPG, QMIX, and PPO methods with a comprehensive ablation study. Our findings show that QiMARL yields better performance in high-dimensional systems, decreasing the number of training epochs needed for convergence while enhancing overall reward maximization. We also compare the algorithm's computational complexity, indicating that QiMARL is more scalable to high-dimensional quantum environments. This research opens the door to future studies of quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) with potential applications to energy optimization, traffic management, and other multi-agent coordination problems.

TI Toward compact high-efficiency grating couplers for visible wavelength
   photonics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Although grating couplers have become the de-facto standard for optical access to integrated silicon photonics platforms, their performance at visible wavelengths, in moderate index contrast platforms such as silicon nitride, leaves significant room for improvement. In particular, the index contrast governs the diffraction efficiency per grating tooth and the resulting overall coupler length. In this work, we develop two approaches to address this problem: a dielectric grating that sums multiple optical modes to increase the overall output intensity; and an embedded metal grating that enhances the attainable refractive index contrast, and therefore reduces the on-chip footprint. We present experimental results that can be developed to realize compact efficient visible wavelength photonic interconnects, with a view toward cryogenic deployment for quantum photonics, where space is constrained and efficiency is critical.

TI General measurements with limited resources and their application to
   quantum unambiguous state discrimination
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this report, we present a framework for implementing an arbitrary n-outcome generalized quantum measurement (POVM) on an m-qubit register as a sequence of two-outcome measurements requiring only single ancillary qubit. Our procedure offers a particular construction for the two-outcome partial measurements which can be composed into a full implementation of the measurement on any gate architecture. This implementation in general requires classical feedback; we present specific cases when this is not the case. We apply this framework on the unambiguous state discrimination and analyze possible strategies. In the simplest case, it gives the same construction as is known, if we opt for performing conclusiveness measurement first. However, it also offers possibility of performing measurement for one of the state outcomes first, leaving conclusiveness measurement for later. This shows flexibility of presented framework and opens possibilities for further optimization. We present discussion also on biased qubit case as well as general case of unambiguous quantum state discrimination in higher dimension.

AB We provide explicit radical N-isogeny formulae for all odd integers N. The formulae are compact closed-form expressions which require one Nth root computation and O(N) basic field operations. The formulae are highly efficient to compute a long chain of N-isogenies, and have the potential to be extremely beneficial for speeding up certain cryptographic protocols such as CSIDH. Unfortunately, the formulae are conjectured, but we provide ample supporting evidence which strongly suggests their correctness.
   For CSIDH-512, we notice an additional 35% speed-up when using radical isogenies up to N = 199, compared to the work by Castryck, Decru, Houben and Vercauteren, which uses radical isogenies up to N = 19 only. The addition of our radical isogenies also speeds up the computation of larger class group actions in a comparable fashion.

TI Photonic heat transport in three terminal superconducting circuit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We report an experimental realization of a three-terminal photonic heat transport device based on a superconducting quantum circuit. The central element of the device is a flux qubit made of a superconducting loop containing three Josephson junctions, which can be tuned by magnetic flux. It is connected to three resonators terminated by resistors. By heating one of the resistors and monitoring the temperatures of the other two, we determine photonic heat currents in the system and demonstrate their tunability by magnetic field at the level of 1 aW. We determine system parameters by performing microwave transmission measurements on a separate nominally identical sample and, in this way, demonstrate clear correlation between the level splitting of the qubit and the heat currents flowing through it. Our experiment is an important step towards realization of heat transistors, heat amplifiers, masers pumped by heat and other quantum heat transport devices.
   Quantum heat transport devices are currently intensively studied. Here, the authors report the photonic heat transport modulated by superconducting qubit in a three-terminal device. Flux dependent heat power correlates with microwave measurements.

TI Certifying nonlocal properties of noisy quantum operations
SO QUANTUM
AB Certifying quantum properties from the probability distributions they induce is an important task for several purposes. While this framework has been largely explored and used for quantum states, its extrapolation to the level of channels started recently in a variety of approaches. In particular, little is known about to what extent noise can spoil certification methods for channels. In this work we provide a unified methodology to certify nonlo cal properties of quantum channels from the correlations obtained in prepare-and-measurement protocols: our approach gathers fully and semi-device-independent existing methods for this purpose, and extends them to new certification criteria. In addition, the effect of different models of de-phasing noise is analysed. Some noise models are shown to generate nonlocality and entanglement in special cases. In the extreme case of complete dephasing, the measurement protocols discussed yield particularly simple tests to certify nonlocality, which can be obtained from known criteria by fixing the dephasing basis. These are based on the relations between bipartite quantum channels and their classical analogues: bipartite stochastic matrices defining conditional distributions.

TI Inverse matrices with applications in public-key cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF ALGORITHMS & COMPUTATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB The applications of non-square binary matrices span many domains including mathematics, error-correction coding, machine learning, data storage, navigation signals, and cryptography. In particular, they are employed in the McEliece and Niederreiter public-key cryptosystems. For the parity check matrix of these cryptosystems, a systematic non-square binary matrix H with dimensions m x n, n > m, m = n - k, there exist 2m((n -m) )distinct inverse matrices. This article presents an algorithm to generate these matrices as well as a method to construct a random inverse matrix. Then it is extended to non-square matrices in arbitrary fields. This overcomes the limitations of the Moore-Penrose and Gauss-Jordan methods. The application to public-key cryptography is also discussed.

In this note, we review some applications of finite non-abelian simple groups to cryptography and discuss different scenarios in which this theory is clearly central, providing the relevant definitions to make the material accessible to both cryptographers and group theorists, in the hope of stimulating further interaction between these two (non-disjoint) communities. In particular, we look at constructions based on various group-theoretic factorization problems, review group theoretical hash functions, and discuss fully homomorphic encryption using simple groups. The Hidden Subgroup Problem is also briefly discussed in this context.

TI Metalens array for quantum random number
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum random number generation (QRNG) leveraging intrinsic quantum uncertainty has attracted significant interest in the field of integrated photonic architecture, with applications in quantum cryptography, tests of quantum nonlocality, and beyond. The demand for compact, low-energy consumption, robust, fast, and cost-effective QRNGs integrated into photonic chips is highlighted, whereas most previous works focused on bulk optics. Here, based on the metalens array entangled source, we experimentally realized a miniaturized, high-dimensional quantum random number generator via a meta-device without post-randomness extraction. Specifically, the device has a high-density output with 100 channels per square millimeter. This chip-scale quantum randomness source can obtain random number arrays without post-randomness extraction and enable compact integration for quantum applications needing secure keys or randomness. Our approach demonstrates potential in secure key generation and randomness for quantum applications.

TI Inhibition of spread of typical bipartite and genuine multiparty
   entanglement in response to disorder
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The distribution of entanglement of typical multiparty quantum states is not uniform over the range of the measure utilized for quantifying the entanglement. We intend to find the response to disorder in the state parameters on this non-uniformity for typical states. We find that the typical entanglement, averaged over the disorder, is taken farther away from uniformity, as quantified by decreased standard deviation, in comparison to the clean case. The feature is seemingly generic, as we see it for Gaussian and non-Gaussian disorder distributions, for varying strengths of the disorder, and for disorder insertions in one and several state parameters. The non-Gaussian distributions considered are uniform and Cauchy-Lorentz. Two- and three-qubit pure state Haar-uniform generations are considered for the typical state productions. We also consider noisy versions of the initial states produced in the Haar-uniform generations. A genuine multiparty entanglement monotone is considered for the three-qubit case, while concurrence is used to measure two-qubit entanglement.

TI Robustness- and weight-based resource measures without convexity
   restriction: Multicopy witness and operational advantage in static and
   dynamical quantum resource theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework to analyze quantum properties as resources for achieving advantages in quantum information processing. The generalized robustness and the weight of resource have been gaining increasing attention as useful resource quantifiers. However, the existing analyses of these measures were restricted to the cases where convexity of the set of free states is assumed, and physically motivated resources do not necessarily satisfy this restriction. In this paper, we give characterizations of robustness- and weight-based measures in general QRTs without convexity restriction through two different yet related approaches. On the one hand, we characterize the generalized robustness and the weight of resource by introducing a nonlinear witness. We show a general construction of new witness observables that detect the resourcefulness of a given state from multiple copies of the state and, using these witnesses, we provide operational interpretations of the above resource measures even without any convexity assumption. On the other hand, we find that the generalized robustness and the weight of resource can also be interpreted as the worst-case maximum advantage in variants of channel-discrimination and channel-exclusion tasks, respectively, where the set of free states consists of several convex subsets corresponding to multiple restrictions. We further extend these results to QRTs for quantum channels and quantum instruments. These characterizations show that every quantum resource exhibits an advantage for the corresponding tasks, even in general QRTs without convexity assumption. Thus, we establish the usefulness of robustness-based and weight-based techniques beyond the conventional scope of convex QRTs, leading to a better understanding of the general structure of QRTs.

TI Tunable Anderson localization of dark states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Random scattering of photons in disordered one-dimensional solids gives rise to an exponential suppression of transmission, which is known as Anderson localization. Here, we experimentally study Anderson localization in a superconducting waveguide quantum electrodynamics system comprising eight individually tunable qubits coupled to a photonic continuum of a waveguide. Employing the qubit frequency control, we artificially introduce frequency disorder to the system and observe an exponential suppression of the transmission coefficient in the vicinity of its subradiant dark modes. The localization length decreases with the disorder strength, which we control in situ by varying individual qubit frequencies. Employing a one-dimensional noninteracting model of coupled qubits and photons, we are able to support and complement the experimental results. The difference between our investigation and previous studies of localization in qubit arrays is the coupling via a common waveguide, allowing us to explore the localization of mediating photons in an intrinsically open system. The experiment opens the door to the study of various localization phenomena on a new platform, which offers a high degree of control and readout possibilities.

TI Undecidability in physics: A review
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally, we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems. (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI On-chip topological edge state cavities
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Confining light in an on-chip photonic cavity with strong light-matter interactions is pivotal for numerous applications in optical and quantum sciences. Recently, topological valley photonics has introduced new schemes for light confinement with topological protection, enabling robust on-chip light manipulation. Here, we present a topological edge state cavity that confines light within a topological bandgap while robustly guiding it to circulate around the cavity via topological edge states. We demonstrate a giant enhancement in the intrinsic quality factor by three orders of magnitude, while simultaneously increasing the free spectral range from 5.1 to 7.1 GHz through tailoring the radiation leakage and group index of topological valley edge state. Our work provides a novel and robust on-chip cavity platform for a wide range of applications, including high-capacity communications, nonlinear optics, atomic clocks, and quantum photonics.

TI Proposal for a cavity-induced measurement of the exchange coupling in
   quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In spin qubit arrays the exchange coupling can be harnessed to implement two-qubit gates and to realize intermediate-range qubit connectivity along a spin bus. In this work, we propose a scheme to characterize the exchange coupling between electrons in adjacent quantum dots. We investigate theoretically the transmission of a microwave resonator coupled to a triple quantum dot occupied by two electrons. We assume that the right quantum dot (QD) is always occupied by one electron while the second electron can tunnel between the left and center QDs. If the two electrons are in adjacent dots they interact via the exchange coupling. By means of analytical calculations we show that the transmission profile of the resonator directly reveals the value of the exchange coupling strength between two electrons. From perturbation theory up to second order we conclude that the exchange can still be identified in the presence of magnetic gradients. A valley splitting comparable to the interdot tunnel coupling will lead to further modifications of the cavity transmission dips that also depend on the valley phases.

TI Squeezing in the quantum Rabi model with parametric nonlinearity
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The squeezing effect arising in the interacting qubit-oscillator system is studied with the presence of a parametric oscillator in the Rabi model. To solve the system, we employ the generalized rotating wave approximation which works well in the wide range of coupling strength as well as detuning. The analytically derived approximate energy spectrum portrays good agreement with the numerically determined spectrum of the Hamiltonian. For the initial state of the bipartite system, the dynamical evolution of the reduced density matrix corresponding to the oscillator is obtained by partial tracing over the qubit degree of freedom. The oscillator's reduced density matrix yields the nonnegative phase space quasi-probability distribution known as Husimi Q-function which is utilized to compute the quadrature variance. It is noticed that the squeezing produced in the oscillator sector gets reduced with increasing coupling strength. We demonstrate the role of the parametric term to obtain adequate squeezing in the strong coupling regime. We also study the revival-collapse phenomenon and the generation of squeezed coherent state.

TI Controlling two-photon emission from superluminal and accelerating index
   perturbations
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Despite their relevance for quantum technology, photon-pair sources are difficult to control. A theoretical proposal shows how photon pairs can be created from vacuum fluctuations in time-dependent systems, potentially enabling heralded single-photon frequency combs.
   Sources of photons with controllable quantum properties such as entanglement and squeezing are desired for applications in quantum information, metrology and sensing. However, fine-grained control over these properties is hard to achieve, especially for two-photon sources. Here we propose a mechanism for the controlled generation of entangled and squeezed photon pairs using superluminal or accelerating modulations of the refractive index in a medium or both. By leveraging time-changing dielectric media, where quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field can be converted into photon pairs, we show that energy and momentum conservation in multimode systems give rise to frequency and angle correlations of photon pairs controlled by the trajectory of index modulation. In our examples, these radiation effects are two-photon analogues of Cherenkov and synchrotron radiation by moving charged particles such as free electrons. We find that synchrotron-like radiation into photon pairs exhibits frequency correlations that can enable a heralded single-photon frequency comb. These effects are sensitive to the local density of photonic states and can be strongly enhanced using photonic nanostructures. For example, index modulations propagating near the surface of graphene produce entangled pairs of graphene plasmons with high efficiency.

TI Toward Hole-Spin Qubits in Si p-MOSFETs within a Planar CMOS
   Foundry Technology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hole spins in semiconductor quantum dots represent a viable route for the implementation of electrically controlled qubits. In particular, the qubit implementation based on Si p-MOSFETs offers great potentialities in terms of integration with the control electronics and long-term scalability. Moreover, the future down scaling of these devices will possibly improve the performance of both the classical (control) and quantum components of such monolithically integrated circuits. Here, we use a multiscale approach to simulate a hole-spin qubit in a down-scaled Si-channel p-MOSFET, the structure of which is based on a commercial 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator device. Our calculations show the formation of well-defined hole quantum dots within the Si channel and the possibility of a general electrical control, with Rabi frequencies of the order of 100 MHz for realistic field values. A crucial role of the channel aspect ratio is also demonstrated, as well as the presence of a favorable parameter range for the qubit manipulation.

TI Dynamic Interplay of Nonlocal Recombination Pathways in Quantum Emitters
   in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Optically active defects in wide bandgap materials play a central role in several emerging applications in quantum information and sensing as they allow for manipulating and harvesting the internal degrees of freedom of single electrons with optical means. Interactions among defect states and with the surrounding environment represent a crucial feature for sensing but can severely hamper the coherence of the quantum states and prevent an efficient integration with photonic architectures due to unpredictable spectral instability. Understanding and controlling defect interactions would mitigate the effects of spectral instabilities and enable quantum applications based on long-range interactions. Here, we investigate the photoluminescence spectral dynamics of quantum emitters in defective hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a material whose emission spectrum notoriously displays spectral wandering and diffusion, and we identify several optical transitions with discrete energy jumps. We associate the spectral jumps with the interplay amid competing recombination pathways available to the defect states in a process like donor-acceptor-pairs (DAP). The discrete spectral jumps observed in the emission spectrum of hBN arise from interactions between the harmonic states of nitrogen pi orbitals of delocalized defects, and their energies can be ascribed to a DAP-like transition sequence. Our results allow mapping of the defect geometry in an hBN lattice, setting the basis for mitigating the effects of spectral jumping in this platform and paving the way toward using the long-range interaction of defect ensembles for quantum technology.

TI An efficient quantum circuit implementation of ZUC-128 cipher with low
   T-depth
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB The Zu Chongzhi cryptographic algorithm (ZUC) is a stream cipher algorithm published in China. This paper focuses on the realization of the complete quantum circuit for the ZUC-128 algorithm with low T-depth. The S-box is a crucial component of the nonlinear aspect of the ZUC-128 algorithm. Initially, we derive the classical circuit implementations of S0 and S-1 using an exhaustive pruning strategy and tower domain decomposition technology. Subsequently, we develop quantum circuits for S-0 and S-1 in two steps: first by reducing the AND-depth of the classical circuit, and then by ensuring that the T-depth of the quantum circuit equals the AND-depth of the classical circuit. Our new S-0 and S-1 quantum circuits both have a T-depth of 7. We are currently researching the quantum circuit implementation of the adder and L function in order to minimize the T-depth of the entire circuit. Finally, we propose the construction of quantum circuit to realize the whole process of ZUC-128 algorithm with low T-depth. When the number of rounds L = 32 in the working step, this quantum circuit requires 46008 qubits, 682340 T gates, 2008535 CNOT gates and 42680 NOT gates, with the T-depth of 11341, and the number of qubits multiplied by T-depth is 5.22 x 108.

TI Quantum Crosstalk Robust Quantum Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The prevalence of quantum crosstalk in current quantum devices poses challenges for achieving highfidelity quantum logic operations and reliable quantum processing. Through quantum control theory, we develop an analytical condition for achieving crosstalk-robust single-qubit control of multiqubit systems. We examine the effects of quantum crosstalk via a cumulant expansion and develop a condition to suppress the leading order contributions to the dynamics. The efficacy of the condition is illustrated in the domains of quantum state preservation and noise characterization through the development of crosstalk-robust dynamical decoupling and quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) protocols. Using the IBM Quantum Experience, crosstalk-robust state preservation is demonstrated on 27 qubits, where up to a 3.5x improvement in coherence decay is observed for single-qubit product and multipartite entangled states. Through the use of noise injection, we demonstrate crosstalk-robust dephasing QNS on a seven qubit processor, where a 104 improvement in reconstruction accuracy over alternative protocols is found. Together, these experiments highlight the significant impact the crosstalk suppression condition can have on improving multiqubit characterization and control on current quantum devices.

TI Streamlined NTRU Prime on FPGA
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB We present a novel full hardware implementation of Streamlined NTRU Prime, with two variants: a high-speed, high-area implementation and a slower, low-area implementation. We introduce several new techniques that improve performance, including a batch inversion for key generation, a high-speed schoolbook polynomial multiplier, an NTT polynomial multiplier combined with a CRT map, a new DSP-free modular reduction method, a high-speed radix sorting module, and new encoders and decoders. With the high-speed design, we achieve the to-date fastest speeds for Streamlined NTRU Prime, with speeds of 5007, 10,989, and 64,026 cycles for encapsulation, decapsulation, and key generation, respectively, while running at 285 MHz on a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+. The entire design uses 40,060 LUT, 26,384 flip-flops, 36.5 Bram, and 31 DSP.

TI Bosonic Randomized Benchmarking with Passive Transformations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the most commonly employed protocol for the characterization of unitary operations in quantum circuits due to its reasonable experimental requirements and robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. So far, the protocol has been limited to discrete or fermionic systems, whereas extensions to bosonic systems have been unclear for a long time due to challenges arising from the underlying bosonic Hilbert space. In this work, we close the gap for bosonic systems and develop an RB protocol to benchmark passive Gaussian transformations on any particle-number subspace, which we call passive bosonic RB. The protocol is built on top of the recently developed filtered RB framework [J. Helsen et al., PRX Quantum 3, 020357 (2022), M. Heinrich et al., Randomized benchmarking with random quantum circuits, arxiv:2212.06181 [quant-ph]] and is designed to isolate the multitude of exponential decays arising for passive bosonic transformations. We give explicit formulas and a Julia implementation for the necessary postprocessing of the experimental data. We also analyze the sampling complexity of passive bosonic RB by deriving analytical expressions for the variance. They show a mild scaling with the number of modes, suggesting that passive bosonic RB is experimentally feasible for a moderate number of modes. We focus on experimental settings involving Fock states and particle-number-resolving measurements, but also discuss Gaussian settings, deriving the first results for heterodyne measurements.

TI Creation of NV centers over a millimeter-sized region by intense
   single-shot ultrashort laser irradiation
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Recently, ultrashort laser processing has attracted attention for creating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers because this method can create single NV centers in spatially-controlled positions, which is an advantage for quantum information devices. On the other hand, creating high-density NV centers in a wide region is also important for quantum sensing because the sensitivity is directly enhanced by increasing the number of NV centers. A recent study demonstrated the creation of high-density NV centers by irradiating femtosecond laser pulses, but the created region was limited to micrometer size, and this technique required many laser pulses to avoid graphitization of diamond. Here, we demonstrate the creation of NV centers in a wide region using only an intense single femtosecond laser pulse irradiation. We irradiated a diamond sample with a femtosecond laser with a focal spot size of 41 mu m and a laser fluence of up to 54 J/cm(2), which is much higher than the typical graphitization threshold in multi-pulse processing. We found that single-pulse irradiation created NV centers without post-annealing for a laser fluence higher than 1.8 J/cm(2), and the region containing NV centers expanded with increasing laser fluence. The diameter of the area was larger than the focal spot size and reached over 100 mu m at a fluence of 54 J/cm(2). Furthermore, we demonstrated the NV centers' creation in a millimeter-sized region by a single-shot defocused laser pulse over 1100 mu m with a fluence of 33 J/cm(2). The demonstrated technique will bring interest in the fundamentals and applications of fabricating ultrahigh-sensitivity quantum sensors.

TI Light-induced fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage in cold
   atomic ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we have demonstrated that optically generated fictitious magnetic fields can be utilized to extend the lifetime of quantum memories in cold atomic ensembles. All the degrees of freedom of an AC Stark shift, such as polarization, spatial profile, and temporal waveform, can be readily controlled in a precise manner. Temporal fluctuations over several experimental cycles and spatial inhomogeneities along a cold atomic gas have been compensated by an optical beam. The advantage of employing fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage lies in the speed and spatial precision with which these fields can be synthesized. Our simple and versatile technique can find widespread application in coherent pulse and single-photon storage across various atomic species.

TI Spontaneous emission dynamics of giant atom controlled by quantum
   coherent feedback
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB We investigated the spontaneous emission of a giant atom coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide. Our model considers the giant atom a two-level system coupled to the semi-infinite waveguide at two points. Based on the Hamiltonian in real space, the first-order delay-differential equation for the atomic excitation amplitude is obtained using the Schrodinger equation. Furthermore, the dynamics of spontaneous emission controlled by quantum coherent feedback due to the semi-infinite waveguide in the non-Markov regime are discussed in two cases, with the coupling strengths between the giant atom and the semi-infinite waveguide at the two coupling points being identical in one case and having a phase difference in the other case. The spontaneous emission exhibits partial decay due to multiple excitations from the quantum feedback and two-point coupling. When the coupling strengths are identical, the decay of the atomic excitation can be either increased or inhibited substantially, even forming a steady state, due to the self-interference due to the two-point coupling. The quantum coherent feedback can either further increase the decay of the excited state or maintain the steady state formed by self-interference. Moreover, a new steady state can be built due to quantum coherent feedback, which cannot exist in the self-interference system. The decay rates can also be increased or decreased by manipulating the phase difference between the coupling strengths at the two coupling points. It can destroy the steady state formed by self-interference or build a steady state based on the chosen phase difference. One can leverage quantum coherent feedback to manipulate the steady state value of the population of the excited states by adjusting the phase difference. The dissipation can increase the decay rates of the excited states. Furthermore, it also destroys steady states. Our results may find applications in developing quantum devices such as quantum memory based on giant atom-waveguide systems.

TI Single-molecule electron spin resonance by means of atomic force
   microscopy
SO NATURE
AB Understanding and controlling decoherence in open quantum systems is of fundamental interest in science, whereas achieving long coherence times is critical for quantum information processing1. Although great progress was made for individual systems, and electron spin resonance (ESR) of single spins with nanoscale resolution has been demonstrated2-4, the understanding of decoherence in many complex solid-state quantum systems requires ultimately controlling the environment down to atomic scales, as potentially enabled by scanning probe microscopy with its atomic and molecular characterization and manipulation capabilities. Consequently, the recent implementation of ESR in scanning tunnelling microscopy5-8 represents a milestone towards this goal and was quickly followed by the demonstration of coherent oscillations9,10 and access to nuclear spins11 with real-space atomic resolution. Atomic manipulation even fuelled the ambition to realize the first artificial atomic-scale quantum devices12. However, the current-based sensing inherent to this method limits coherence times12,13. Here we demonstrate pump-probe ESR atomic force microscopy (AFM) detection of electron spin transitions between non-equilibrium triplet states of individual pentacene molecules. Spectra of these transitions exhibit sub-nanoelectronvolt spectral resolution, allowing local discrimination of molecules that only differ in their isotopic configuration. Furthermore, the electron spins can be coherently manipulated over tens of microseconds. We anticipate that single-molecule ESR-AFM can be combined with atomic manipulation and characterization and thereby paves the way to learn about the atomistic origins of decoherence in atomically well-defined quantum elements and for fundamental quantum-sensing experiments.
   By using a pump-probe atomic force microscopy detection scheme, electron spin transitions between non-equilibrium triplet states of individual pentacene molecules, as well as the ability to manipulate electron spins over tens of microseconds, is demonstrated.

AB We study a quantum switch that creates shared end-to-end entangled quantum states to multiple sets of users that are connected to it. Each user is connected to the switch via an optical link across which bipartite Bell-state entangled states are generated in each time-slot with certain probabilities, and the switch merges entanglements of links to create end-to-end entanglements for users. One qubit of an entanglement of a link is stored at the switch and the other qubit of the entanglement is stored at the user corresponding to the link. Assuming that qubits of entanglements of links decipher after one time-slot, we characterize the capacity region, which is defined as the set of arrival rates of requests for end-to-end entanglements for which there exists a scheduling policy that stabilizes the switch. We propose a Max-Weight scheduling policy and show that it stabilizes the switch for all arrival rates that lie in the capacity region. We also provide numerical results to support our analysis.

TI Analysis of converting C0-circuit into C∗-circuit
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A C-& lowast;-circuit, which was proposed in Asiacypt 2022 by Huang and Sun (Advances in cryptology - ASIACRYPT 2022, pp. 614-644, 2022), can directly perform calculations with the existing quantum states, thereby reducing the use of quantum resources in quantum logic synthesis. We theoretically prove how to convert a C-0-circuit into the corresponding C-& lowast;-circuit through two lemmas and one theorem. The first lemma proves the interchangeability of CNOT gates and NOT gates by using the equivalence of quantum circuits. The second lemma proves that adding CNOT gates to the front of a quantum circuit whose initial states are all |0 > s will not change the output states of the circuit. The theorem is used to describe what kind of C-0-circuit can be transformed into C-& lowast;-circuit, and the correctness of this transformation is proved. Our work will provide a theoretical basis for converting C-0-circuit to C-& lowast;-circuit. Then applying the theoretical analysis results to the multiplication over GF(2(8)), the constructed quantum circuit needs 27 Toffoli gates and 118 CNOT gates, which is 15 fewer Toffoli gates and 43 CNOT gates than the current best result. This shows that the method of constructing quantum circuits by using the conversion of C-0-circuit to C-& lowast;-circuit is very efficient.

TI Analysis of micro- vs. macro-flows management in QKD-secured edge
   computing
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) holds the promise of a secure exchange of cryptographic material between applications that have access to the same network of QKD nodes, interconnected through fiber optic or satellite links. Worldwide several such networks are being deployed at a metropolitan level, where edge computing is already offered by the telco operators to customers as a viable alternative to both cloud and on-premise hosting of computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the implications of enabling QKD for edge-native applications from a practical perspective of resource allocation in the QKD network and the edge infrastructure. Specifically, we consider the dichotomy between aggregating all the applications on the same source-destination path vs. adopting a more flexible micro-flow approach, inspired from Software Defined Networking (SDN) concepts. Our simulation results show that there is a fundamental trade-off between the efficient use of resources and the signaling overhead, which we managed to diminish with the use of suitable hybrid solutions.

TI Influence Matrix Approach to Many-Body Floquet Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Recent experimental and theoretical works have made much progress toward understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in thermalizing systems, which act as thermal baths for their small subsystems, and many-body localized systems, which fail to do so. The description of time evolution in many-body systems is generally challenging due to the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement. In this work, we introduce an approach to study quantum many-body dynamics, inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Focusing on a family of interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the influence matrix, which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics of a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect dephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as a perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin. For the models considered here, we establish that PD points include dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD points, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a short memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the influence matrix temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS computations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in terms of an effective "statistical-mechanics" description. We finally illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix approach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.

TI Time-Bin Superposition Methods for DPS-QKD
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Key generation efficiency, and security, in differential phase-shift quantum key distribution (DPS-QKD) improve with an increase in the number of optical delays or time-bin superpositions. We demonstrate the implementation of superposition states using time-bins, with two different approaches. In Type-A, we use an optical pulse and create superposition states with optical splitters and path delays. Similar superposition states are created, in Type-B, by applying direct phase modulation within a single weak coherent pulse. We establish the equivalence between both the approaches, and note that higher-order superposition states of Type-B are easier to generate for DPS-QKD. We set up DPS-QKD, over 105 km of single mode optical fiber, with a quantum bit error rate of less than 15% at a secure key rate of 2 kbps. With temporal guard bands, the QBER reduced to less than 10%, but with a 20% reduction in the key rate.

TI Entanglement via rotational blockade of MgF molecules in a magic
   potential
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Diatomic polar molecules are one of the most promising platforms of quantum computing due to their rich internal states and large electric dipole moments. Here, we propose entangling rotational states of MgF molecules in an optical tweezer array via strong electric dipole-dipole interactions. We employ two rotational states with the projection quantum number of the total angular momentum M-F = 0 to maximize the dipole-dipole interaction with a given separation distance. The splitting of 1.27 kHz between two entangled states is predicted for MgF molecules separated by 1 mu m. The resolution of the entangled states can be achieved in a magic optical potential where the rotational states have the same trap frequencies. The magic potential can be formed by tuning the angle between the molecules' quantization axis and the linear polarization of trapping light to a "magic angle". We calculate the magic angle for MgF molecules under reasonable experimental conditions and obtain that the trap frequencies of the two involved states can be matched within a few 10s of Hz. By establishing an entanglement scheme for the molecules, our results provide a first step towards quantum computing using MgF molecules.

TI Intra-Cavity Laser Manipulation of High-Dimensional Non-Separable States
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Non-separable states of structured light have the analogous mathematical forms with quantum entanglement, which offer an effective way to simulate quantum process. However, the classical multi-partite non-separable states analogue to multi-particle entanglements can only be controlled by bulky free-space modulation of light through coupling multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) with orbital angular momentum (OAM) to achieve high dimensionality and other DoFs to emulate multi-parties. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to directly emit multi-partite non-separable states from a simple laser cavity to mimic multi-particle quantum entanglement. Through manipulating three DoFs as OAM, polarization, and wavevector inside a laser cavity, the eight-dimensional (8D) tripartite states and all Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states can be generated and controlled on demand. In addition, an effective method is proposed to perform state tomography employing convolutional neural network (CNN), for measuring the generated GHZ-like states with highest fidelity up to 95.11%. This work reveals a feasibility of intra-cavity manipulation of high-dimensional multipartite non-separable states, opening a compact device for quantum-classical analogy and paving the path for advanced quantum scenarios.
   By introducing the spin-orbital coupling into a folded geometric cavity, a group of classical non-separable states with three degrees of freedom are generated and controlled directly from a laser. The high-dimensional non-separable laser states can fully emulate the three-particle entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, which are experimentally verified by a proposed quantum-like state tomography method to reconstruct density matrices and calculate fidelities, providing a compact "at-the-source" solution of high-dimensional quantum-classical simulations and informatics.image

TI A Quantum String-Matching Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A novel quantum algorithm for string-matching is introduced that significantly enhances the complexity of this fundamental operation, essential in numerous computing applications. The algorithm is designed as a composite quantum denoising procedure applied to a quantum-generated dot-matrix plot, which is treated as an image. This approach effectively identifies regions of similarity between two input strings of lengths N and M. For strings of equal length, the algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(N+log(N)+6N2)$O( {N + log( N ) + 6{{N}<^>2}} )$ and a space complexity of O(log(2N))$O( {log( {2N} )} )$, demonstrating a clear advantage in quantum computational efficiency.

TI Bound energy, entanglement and identifying critical points in 1D
   long-range Kitaev model
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the entanglement structure of a bipartite quantum system through the lens of quantum thermodynamics in the absence of conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider the long-range Kitaev model, where the pairing interaction decays as a power law with exponent alpha , with broken conformal symmetry for alpha < 3/2. We analytically show that the bound energy, a quantum thermodynamical quantity, is linearly proportional to the square of entanglement entropy per unit system size for alpha =1 where conformal symmetry is broken. We further show that for all values of alpha , bound energy, in the thermodynamic limit, shows a pronounced minimum at the critical point, which enables the identification of mu= 1.

TI Testing entanglement between free-traveling electron-positron pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. While the entanglement of confined electron pairs has been established early on, the entanglement of free-traveling electron pairs, particularly at high energies, remains largely unexplored due to the substantial challenges involved in measuring the spins of free-traveling electrons. In this study, we investigate the entanglement and the Bell inequality violation of free-traveling electron-positron pairs generated in a fixed-target experiment. This experimental setup facilitates the creation of a controllable source of entangled electron-positron pairs, where entangled events are produced in specific phase spaces. Based on this source and the prior knowledge of the entangled state, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the polarization correlations of the entangled e & thorn;e-pairs through their individual secondary scatterings off two separate additional targets.

TI Polarization Division Multiplexing CV-QKD with Pilot-Aided
   Polarization-State Sensing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with local local oscillator (LLO) is well-studied for its security and simplicity, but enhancing performance and interference resistance remains challenging. In this paper, we utilize polarization division multiplexing (PDM) to enhance spectral efficiency and significantly increase the key rate of the CV-QKD system. To address dynamic changes in the state of polarization (SOP) in Gaussian modulated coherent states (GMCS) signals due to polarization impairment effects, we designed a time-division multiplexing pilot scheme to sense and recover changes in SOP in GMCS signals, along with other digital signal processing methods. Experiments over 20 km show that our scheme maintains low excess noise levels (0.062 and 0.043 in shot noise units) and achieves secret key rates of 4.65 Mbps and 5.66 Mbps for the two polarization orientations, totaling 10.31 Mbps. This work confirms the effectiveness of PDM GMCS-CV-QKD and offers technical guidance for high-rate QKD within metropolitan areas.

AB In a typical integrated circuit electronic design automation (EDA) flow, scheduling is a key step in high-level synthesis, which is the first stage of the EDA flow that synthesizes a cycle-accurate register transfer level (RTL) from the given behavior description, while physical design is the last stage in the EDA flow that generates the final geometric layout of the transistors and wires for fabrication. As a result, scheduling and physical design are usually carried out independently. In this paper, I discuss multiple research projects that I have been involved with, where the interaction between scheduling and physical design are shown to be highly beneficial. I shall start with my very first paper in EDA on multi-layer channel routing which benefited from an unexpected connection to the optimal two-processor scheduling algorithm, a joint work with Prof. Martin Wong, who is being honored at this conference for the 2024 ISPD Lifetime Achievement Award. Then, I shall further demonstrate how scheduling can help to overcome interconnect bottleneck, enable parallel placement and routing, and, finally, play a key role in layout synthesis for quantum computing.

TI Bath-induced decoherence in finite-size Majorana wires at non-zero
   temperature
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Braiding Majorana zero-modes around each other is a promising route toward topological quantum computing. Yet, two competing maxims emerge when implementing Majorana braiding in real systems: on the one hand, perfect braiding should be conducted adiabatically slowly to avoid non-topological errors. On the other hand, braiding must be conducted fast such that decoherence effects introduced by the environment are negligible, which are generally unavoidable in finite-size systems. This competition results in an intermediate time scale for Majorana braiding that is optimal, but generally not error-free. Here, we calculate this intermediate time scale for a T-junction of short one-dimensional topological superconductors coupled to a bosonic bath that generates fluctuations in the local electric potential, which stem from, e.g. environmental photons or phonons of the substrate. We thereby obtain boundaries for the speed of Majorana braiding with a predetermined gate fidelity. Our results emphasize the general susceptibility of Majorana-based information storage in finite-size systems and can serve as a guide for determining the optimal braiding times in future experiments.

TI Quantum-Driven Chaos-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Efficient
   Feature Selection and Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) poses significant problems in securing heterogeneous, massive, and high-volume network traffic against cyber threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often found to be poorly scalable, or are ineffective computationally, because of the presence of redundant or irrelevant features, and they suffer from high false positive rates. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid intelligent model that combines quantum computing, chaos theory, and deep learning to achieve efficient feature selection and effective intrusion classification. The proposed system offers four novel modules for feature optimization: chaotic swarm intelligence, quantum diffusion modeling, transformer-guided ranking, and multi-agent reinforcement learning, all of which work with a graph-based classifier enhanced with quantum attention mechanisms. This architecture allows as much as 75% feature reduction, while achieving 4% better classification accuracy and reducing computational overhead by 40% compared to the best-performing models. When evaluated on benchmark datasets (NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and UNSW-NB15), it shows superior performance in intrusion detection tasks, thereby marking it as a viable candidate for scalable and real-time IoT security analytics.

TI ADDITION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ZX-DIAGRAMS
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing. It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interest. A peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general, inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams. Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles, one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables. Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g. for solving optimization problems). Technically, the differentiation of ZX-diagrams is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules. We also introduce an alternative, non-inductive, differentiation technique rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.

TI Quantum Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Opportunities
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The meeting between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Quantum Computing has been very successful in recent years, leading to the development of several approaches of the so-called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This is a hybrid field in which the potential of quantum mechanics is exploited and applied to critical aspects of language processing, involving different NLP tasks. Approaches developed so far span from those that demonstrate the quantum advantage only at the theoretical level to the ones implementing algorithms on quantum hardware. This paper aims to list the approaches developed so far, categorizing them by type, i.e., theoretical work and those implemented on classical or quantum hardware; by task, i.e., general purpose such as syntax-semantic representation or specific NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis or question answering; and by the resource used in the evaluation phase, i.e., whether a benchmark dataset or a custom one has been used. The advantages offered by QNLP are discussed, both in terms of performance and methodology, and some considerations about the possible usage QNLP approaches in the place of state-of-the-art deep learning-based ones are given.

TI Capacitive crosstalk in gate-based dispersive sensing of spin qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In gate-based dispersive sensing, the response of a resonator attached to a quantum dot gate is detected by a reflected radio frequency signal. This enables fast readout of spin qubits and tune up of arrays of quantum dots but comes at the expense of increased susceptibility to crosstalk, as the resonator can amplify spurious signals and induce fluctuations in the quantum dot potential. We attach tank circuits with superconducting NbN inductors and internal quality factors Q(i )> 1000 to the interdot barrier gate of silicon double quantum dot devices. Measuring the interdot transition in transport, we quantify radio frequency crosstalk that results in a ring-up of the resonator when neighboring plunger gates are driven with frequency components matching the resonator frequency. This effect complicates qubit operation and scales with the loaded quality factor of the resonator, the mutual capacitance between device gate electrodes, and with the inverse of the parasitic capacitance to ground. Setting qubit frequencies below the resonator frequency is expected to substantially suppress this type of crosstalk.

TI Sharing quantum nonlocality and genuine nonlocality with independent
   observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently the authors of Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 090401 (2020) considered the following scenario: Alice and Bob each have half of a pair of entangled qubit states. Bob measures his half and then passes his part to a second Bob who measures again, and so on. The goal is to maximize the number of Bobs that can have an expected violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality with the single Alice. By taking themaximally entangled pure two-qubit state vertical bar phi > = 1/root 2 (vertical bar 00 > + vertical bar 11 >) as an example, it has been constructively proved that arbitrarily many independent Bobs can share the nonlocality with the single Alice. Here we demonstrate that arbitrarily many independent observers can share the nonlocality of a single arbitrary dimensional bipartite entangled but not necessary two-qubit entangled state. Furthermore, taking the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as an example, we show that at most two Charlies can share the genuine nonlocality of a single generalized GHZ state with an Alice and a Bob.

TI On physics-informed neural networks for quantum computers
SO FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
AB Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) emerged as a powerful tool for solving scientific computing problems, ranging from the solution of Partial Differential Equations to data assimilation tasks. One of the advantages of using PINN is to leverage the usage of Machine Learning computational frameworks relying on the combined usage of CPUs and co-processors, such as accelerators, to achieve maximum performance. This work investigates the design, implementation, and performance of PINNs, using the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) co-processor. We design a simple Quantum PINN to solve the one-dimensional Poisson problem using a Continuous Variable (CV) quantum computing framework. We discuss the impact of different optimizers, PINN residual formulation, and quantum neural network depth on the quantum PINN accuracy. We show that the optimizer exploration of the training landscape in the case of quantum PINN is not as effective as in classical PINN, and basic Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizers outperform adaptive and high-order optimizers. Finally, we highlight the difference in methods and algorithms between quantum and classical PINNs and outline future research challenges for quantum PINN development.

It is observed that in the case of a three-level atomic system in the presence of ID, the decay of QFI and VNE is rapid and significant but no prominent effect of the Stark effect is observed. Hence, for a three-level atom, the decay of quantum entanglement (QE) with respect to time is very fast and rapid in the absence of atomic motion with an increasing value of ID. Moreover, ID is not suitable to maintain the QE for three-level atomic systems in the absence of atomic motion. The Stark effect has no significant effect on the QE. In the case of three-level atoms, ID and the Stark do not affect the periodic nature of QFI and VNE with time evolution in the presence of atomic motion. The periodic response of QFI and VNE is observed under the effect of the Stark effect and ID in the presence of a motion of a three-level atom. The QE sudden death and birth is observed in the presence of atomic motion. Therefore, the ID with the Stark effect is suitable to sustain and maintain the QE in the presence of atomic motion for three-level atomic systems. These results show the strong dependence of QFI and VNE on the Stark effect and ID.

TI A scalable helium gas cooling system for trapped-ion applications
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Microfabricated ion-trap devices offer a promising pathway towards scalable quantum computing Research efforts have begun to focus on the engineering challenges associated with developing large-scale ion-trap arrays and networks. However, increasing the size of the array and integrating on-chip electronics can drastically increase the power dissipation within the ion-trap chips. This leads to an increase in the operating temperature of the ion-trap and limits the device performance. Therefore, effective thermal management is an essential consideration for any large-scale architecture. Presented here is the development of a modular cooling system designed for use with multiple ion-trapping experiments simultaneously. The system includes an extensible cryostat that permits scaling of the cooling power to meet the demands of a large network. Following experimental testing on two independent ion-trap experiments, the cooling system is expected to deliver a net cooling power of 111 W at similar to 70 K to up to four experiments. The cooling system is a step towards meeting the practical challenges of operating large-scale quantum computers with many qubits.

TI Sensing birefringence and diattenuation with undetected light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Developing advanced technologies for sensing and imaging biological samples is crucial for medical applications, making quantum-enhanced methods particularly valuable, as they promise significant benefits over classical techniques. An important aspect of biological imaging is the characterization of tissue, which often involves resolving complex structural information such as birefringence and diattenuation. These measures require polarization-sensitive sensing which remains largely unaddressed in quantum-imaging techniques with undetected light. However, the bicolor nature and supreme phase sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers make them particularly advantageous for biological sensing. Hence, we theoretically introduce controllable polarizations of the interrogating light in a quantum-imaging setup and show the potential of nonlinear interferometers to simultaneously sense birefringence and diattenuation with undetected light while discussing both the low-and high-gain regime.

TI Practical Side-Channel Attack on Free-Space QKD Systems With Misaligned
   Sources and Countermeasures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Practical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols can introduce additional degrees of freedom in the quantum states that may render them distinguishable to an eavesdropper. This is the case of QKD systems using a different laser source to generate each quantum state, which can lead to temporal, spectral and/or spatial differences among them that can be exploited by a malicious party to extract information of the key. In this work we characterize, and experimentally verify, a side-channel attack on spatially distinguishable states against free-space QKD systems with misaligned laser sources. Specifically, for those emitting Gaussian beams, which is the most common case in free-space QKD. The attack makes theoretically unsafe any QKD system with any angular misalignment between the laser sources. Finally, we propose two countermeasures to eliminate the spatial distinguishability and secure the key exchange.

   Imaging and Temperature Sensing
SO MATERIALS
AB Upconversion Nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted exceptional attention due to their great potential in high-contrast, free-background biofluorescence deep tissue imaging and quantum sensing. Most of these interesting studies have been performed using an ensemble of UCNPs as fluorescent probes in bioapplications. Here, we report a synthesis of small and efficient YLiF4:Yb,Er UCNPs for single-particle imaging as well as sensitive optical temperature sensing. The reported particles demonstrated a bright and photostable upconversion emission at a single particle level under a low laser intensity excitation of 20 W/cm(2). Furthermore, the synthesized UCNPs were tested and compared to the commonly used two-photon excitation QDs and organic dyes and showed a nine times better performance at a single particle level under the same experimental conditions. In addition, the synthesized UCNPs demonstrated sensitive optical temperature sensing at a single particle level within the biological temperature range. The good optical properties of single YLiF4:Yb,Er UCNPs open an avenue for small and efficient fluorescent markers in imaging and sensing applications.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Colour centres in diamonds have attracted considerable interest for quantum sensing applications. Boasting great photostability, long coherence times at room temperature and unique electronic properties that allow for optical initialization and readout of their quantum state, colour centres have found use in a variety of techniques for thermometry, magnetometry and nanoscale spectroscopy. Coupled with the possibility of preparing nanoparticles, their excellent biocompatibility and versatile surface chemistry that allows for functionalization and fine-tuning of surface properties, diamonds hosting colour centres have proven to be a versatile and flexible platform for measurements of local properties in a wide range of biological and biochemical systems. In this perspective, we summarize the key properties of the colour centres in diamonds and how different surface chemistry impacts their electronic properties. Finally, we discuss the crucial role of surface chemistry in various sensing applications and highlight the potential of diamond materials to address current challenges in quantum science and technology.

TI Fabrication of Nitrogen Vacancy Center-Doped Free-Standing Diamond
   Photonic Devices via Faraday Cage-Angled Etching
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Herein, methods for the fabrication of monolithic diamond integrated photonic devices via Faraday cage-angled etching of functional epitaxial diamond layers are presented. Optimal waveguide width is determined via simulation and the fabrication of nitrogen vacancy (NV) center-doped microring resonators is demonstrated. The performance of the devices is verified via microphotoluminescence as well as cathodoluminescence scans of the in-grown NV centers, revealing clearly visible cavity lines. The scalable fabrication method allows for the realization of large numbers of lateral waveguide structures as needed for future applications in integrated quantum sensing devices as well as novel spin-based quantum computers.
   The presented work deals with the scalable fabrication of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers-doped lateral diamond-based photonic devices. Via electron beam lithography and dry etching, free-standing waveguides and microring resonators are processed from bulk substrates. The latter are analyzed via photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence, revealing resonant cavity lines on the broad NV phonon sideband.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Efficient photon-pair generation in layer-poled lithium niobate
   nanophotonic waveguides
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Integrated photon-pair sources are crucial for scalable photonic quantum systems. Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising platform for on-chip photon-pair generation through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). However, the device implementation faces practical challenges. Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), despite enabling flexible quasi-phase matching, suffers from poor fabrication reliability and device repeatability, while conventional modal phase matching (MPM) methods yield limited efficiencies due to inadequate mode overlaps. Here, we introduce a layer-poled lithium niobate (LPLN) nanophotonic waveguide for efficient photon-pair generation. It leverages layer-wise polarity inversion through electrical poling to break spatial symmetry and significantly enhance nonlinear interactions for MPM, achieving a notable normalized second-harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiency of 4615% W-1cm-2. Through a cascaded SHG and SPDC process, we demonstrate photon-pair generation with a normalized brightness of 3.1 x 106 Hz nm-1 mW-2 in a 3.3 mm long LPLN waveguide, surpassing existing on-chip sources under similar operating configurations. Crucially, our LPLN waveguides offer enhanced fabrication reliability and reduced sensitivity to geometric variations and temperature fluctuations compared to PPLN devices. We expect LPLN to become a promising solution for on-chip nonlinear wavelength conversion and non-classical light generation, with immediate applications in quantum communication, networking, and on-chip photonic quantum information processing.
   Electrically creating bi-layer ferroelectric domains in a thin-film lithium niobate waveguide enables high-efficiency second-harmonic generation and photon-pair generation.

TI Solving a real-world package delivery routing problem using quantum
   annealers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Research focused on the conjunction between quantum computing and routing problems has been very prolific in recent years. Most of the works revolve around classical problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the Vehicle Routing Problem. The real-world applicability of these problems is dependent on the objectives and constraints considered. Anyway, it is undeniable that it is often difficult to translate complex requirements into these classical formulations. The main objective of this research is to present a solving scheme for dealing with realistic instances while maintaining all the characteristics and restrictions of the original real-world problem. Thus, a quantum-classical strategy has been developed, coined Q4RPD, that considers a set of real constraints such as a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, priority deliveries, and capacities characterized by two values: weight and dimensions of the packages. Q4RPD resorts to the Leap Constrained Quadratic Model Hybrid Solver of D-Wave. To demonstrate the application of Q4RPD, an experimentation composed of six different instances has been conducted, aiming to serve as illustrative examples.

TI Security Protocol Function Using Quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography

SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Quantum Computing (QC). The content of node or sink nodes is pro-cessed using the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. However, crypto-graphy techniques face several other issues, such as availability, integrity, andvulnerability, to name a few. The researchers have overcome many obstacles,yet security remains a crucial concern in QC. However, experimenters recentlydiscovered that the QC has a lot more data hacking than static networks. More-over, the bitwise error is still present in implementing the Quantum ComputingCryptography Protocol (QCCP). Because all nodes are mobile and dynamic topol-ogy occurs, the proposed research uses the Quantum Elliptical Curve Cryptogra-phy (QECC) protocol. To provide the appropriate key generation and key sharingmechanism to convert the fool node to a brawny node and avoid packet loss andenergy consumption in the network. By turning the fool node into a vital node, theQECC lowers the network's error rate. The experiment uses Network Simulator2 to achieve successful outcomes such as decreased packet loss, reduced error ratewith increased energy consumption, increased pair key generation for additionalnodes, and increased packet size.

TI Unraveling metastable Markovian open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the dynamics of metastable Markovian open quantum systems by unraveling their average dynamics into stochastic trajectories. We use quantum reset processes as examples to illustrate metastable phenomenology, including a simple three-state model whose metastability is of classical type, and a two-qubit model that features a metastable decoherence-free subspace. In the three-state model, the trajectories exhibit classical metastable phenomenology: fast relaxation into distinct phases and slow transitions between them. This extends the existing correspondence between classical and quantum metastability. It enables the computation of committors for the quantum phases, and the mechanisms of rare transitions between them. For the two-qubit model, the decoherence-free subspace appears in the unraveled trajectories as a slow manifold on which the quantum state has a continuous slow evolution. This provides a classical (nonmetastable) analog of this quantum effect. We discuss the general implications of these results, and we highlight the useful role of quantum reset processes for analysis of quantum trajectories in metastable systems.

TI Design of Nanoscale Quantum Interconnects Aided by Conditional
   Generative Adversarial Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Interconnecting nanodevices with the aim of assembling quantum computing architectures is one of the current outstanding challenges. At the nanoscale, the quantum interconnects become comparable in complexity with the active devices and should be treated on equal footing. In addition, they can play an active role in the switching properties. Here, we investigate the charge localization in neuromorphic bi-dimensional systems, which serve as quantum interconnects (QIs) between quantum dot registers. We define a device structure where, by manipulating the charging of a floating gate array, one defines the QI potential map, which can host a few interacting electrons. The ground state charge density may be extracted by measuring the tunneling current perpendicular to the device surface, yielding a convoluted image of the electron distribution. Using image-to-image translation methods, we achieve the mapping of the charge density from the confinement potential, as well as by deconvoluting the tunneling current map, which can be obtained by a direct measurement. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept for a reconfigurable device, which can be used to design quantum many-electron devices.

TI The Sound of Swarm. Auditory Description of Swarm Robotic Movements
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION
AB Movements of robots in a swarm can be mapped to sounds, highlighting the group behavior through the coordinated and simultaneous variations of musical parameters across time. The vice versa is also possible: Sound parameters can be mapped to robotic motion parameters, giving instructions through sound. In this article, we first develop a theoretical framework to relate musical parameters such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and articulation (for each time) with robotic parameters such as position, identity, motor status, and sensor status. We propose a definition of musical spaces as Hilbert spaces and musical paths between parameters as elements of bigroupoids, generalizing existing conceptions of musical spaces. The use of Hilbert spaces allows us to build up quantum representations of musical states, inheriting quantum computing resources, already used for robotic swarms. We present the theoretical framework and then some case studies as toy examples. In particular, we discuss a 2D video and matrix simulation with two robo-caterpillars; a 2D simulation of 10 robo-ants with Webots; a 3D simulation of three robo-fish in an underwater search-and-rescue mission.

AB Strong photonic spin-orbit coupling arises under tight optical confinement in a subwavelength waveguide, where propagating fields exhibit spin-orbit entanglement. To date, while the confinement-induced spin-orbit coupling has been investigated only in linear optics, its role in nonlinear optical processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and theoretical analysis of unconventional nonlinear optical frequency conversion enabled by the confinement-induced spin-orbit coupling. By pumping a silica optical nanofiber with a spin-polarized Gaussian laser beam, we generate a third-harmonic optical vortex carrying orbital angular momentum-an outcome forbidden in isotropic media under conventional conditions. This approach enables simple and cost-effective generation of optical vortices with ultrafast all-optical switching, not requiring structured pump beams, engineered media, or specialized materials. Our results open new avenues for spin-orbit-coupled nanophotonic systems, providing a platform to explore nonlinear light-matter interactions involving exotic structured light and to uncover spin-orbit-coupling-induced phenomena across various disciplines.

TI Harmony Search Algorithm with Two Problem-Specific Operators for Solving
   Nonogram Puzzle
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The nonogram is a logic puzzle where each cell should be colored or left blank according to row and column clues to reveal a hidden picture. This puzzle is known as an NP-complete combinatorial problem characterized by an exponential increase in the number of candidate solutions with increasing puzzle size. So far, some methods have been investigated to address these challenges, including conventional line-solving techniques, integer programming, and neural networks. This study introduces a novel Harmony Search (HS)-based approach for solving nonogram puzzles, incorporating problem-specific operators designed to effectively reduce the solution search space and accelerate convergence. Experimental results obtained from benchmark puzzles demonstrate that the proposed HS model utilizing a clue-constrained random-generation operator significantly reduces the average number of iterations and enhances the solution-finding success rate. Additionally, the HS model integrating an initially confirmed cell-scanning operator exhibited promising performance on specific benchmark problems. The authors think that the nonogram puzzle can be a good benchmark problem for quantum computing-based optimization in the future, and the proposed HS algorithm can also be combined with quantum computing mechanisms.

TI Enhancing the excitation gap of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Connecting double quantum dots via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment offers a platform for creating a two-site Kitaev chain that hosts Majorana zero modes at a finely tuned sweet spot. However, the effective couplings mediated by Andreev bound states in the hybrid are generally weak in the tunneling regime. As a consequence, the excitation gap is limited in size, presenting a formidable challenge for using this platform to demonstrate non-Abelian statistics and realize topological quantum computing. Here we systematically study the effects of increasing the dot-hybrid coupling. In particular, the proximity effect transforms the dot orbitals into Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, and as the coupling strength increases, the excitation gap is significantly enhanced and sensitivity to local perturbation is reduced. We also discuss how the strong-coupling regime shows in experimentally accessible quantities, such as conductance, and provide a protocol for tuning a double-dot system into a sweet spot with a large excitation gap.
   A quantum dot-superconductor array can form a Kitaev chain which hosts Majorana zero modes at a sweet spot. The authors examine how to enhance the excitation gap of the Majorana zero modes, which is crucial for implementing topological quantum computing with enhanced protection.

AB This paper introduces a vision for Quantum Software Development lifecycle, proposing a hybrid full-stack iterative model that integrates quantum and classical computing. Addressing the current challenges in Quantum Computing (QC) such as the need for integrating diverse programming languages and managing the complexities of quantum-classical systems, this model is rooted in the principles of DevOps and continuous software engineering.

TI Dilution refrigeration technology
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Dilution refrigerator, as a refrigeration technology that can obtain extremely low temperatures below 10 mK, is widely used in fields such as quantum computing, and condensed matter physics. The development of the most widely used typical dry dilution refrigerators has been relatively mature, while there is little research on other types of dilution refrigerators, and there is a lack of comprehensive and systematic research on dilution refrigeration technology. This paper focuses on the current status of dilution refrigeration technology research, introduces its basic principles, and points out that the fundamental reason for continuous refrigeration is the limited solubility of 3 He in 4 He and the difference in enthalpy between the concentrated phase and the dilute phase. This paper summarizes the realization forms and research progress of typical dilution refrigerators, 4 He cycle dilution refrigerators, cold cycle dilution refrigerators, and space dilution refrigerators, and discusses their respective application occasions and advantages and disadvantages. From the Kapitza thermal resistance, osmotic pressure, and resistance, this paper analyzes the key influencing factors and design calculation methods for realizing dilution refrigerators below 10 mK, which provides reference for studying dilution refrigeration technology.

TI Unified linear response theory of quantum electronic circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Modeling the electrical response of multi-level quantum systems at finite frequency has been typically performed in the context of two incomplete paradigms: (i) input-output theory, which is valid at any frequency but neglects dynamic losses, and (ii) semiclassical theory, which captures dynamic dissipation effects well but is only accurate at low frequencies. Here, we develop a unifying theory, valid for arbitrary frequencies, that captures both the small-signal quantum behavior and the non-unitary effects introduced by relaxation and dephasing. The theory allows a multi-level system to be described by a universal small-signal equivalent-circuit model, a resonant RLC circuit, whose topology only depends on the number of energy levels. We apply our model to a double-quantum-dot charge qubit and a Majorana qubit, showing the capability to continuously describe the systems from adiabatic to resonant and from coherent to incoherent, suggesting new and realistic experiments for improved quantum state readout. Our model will facilitate the design of hybrid quantum-classical circuits and the simulation of qubit control and quantum state readout.

AB If we use the path integral approach, we can write quantum electrodynamics (QED) in a way that is manifestly relativistic. However the path integrals are confined to paths that are on mass-shell. What happens if we extend QED by computing the path integrals over all paths in energy momentum space, not only those on mass-shell? We use the requirement of covariance to do this in an unambiguous way. This gives a QED where the time/energy components appear in a way that is manifestly parallel to the space/momentum components: we have dispersion in time, entanglement in time, full equivalence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) in time to the HUP in space, and so on. Entanglement in time has the welcome side effect of eliminating the ultraviolet divergences. We recover standard QED in the long time limit. We predict effects at scales of attoseconds. With recent developments in attosecond physics and in quantum computing, these effects should be detectable. Since the predictions are unambiguous and testable the approach is falsifiable. Falsification would sharpen our understanding of the role of time in QED. Confirmation would have significant implications for attosecond physics, quantum computing and communications, and quantum gravity.

TI Temperature-Controlled Cascaded Fabry-Pérot Filters: A Scalable Solution
   for Ultra-Low-Noise Stokes Photon Detection in Quantum Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB This study addresses the issue of cross-interference that occurs when locked continuous light and signal photons are collinear during interferometer measurements. To tackle this, a temperature-controlled Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity filter with a heterogeneous cascaded structure is proposed and applied. The system consists of six filtering stages, created by designing Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavities of three different lengths, each used twice (to match optical frequencies), along with temperature control settings. By applying differentiated linewidth regulation, the approach effectively suppresses interference from locked light while significantly enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in photon detection. This method overcomes the challenge of interference from same-frequency noise photons in atomic ensemble-entangled sources, achieving a noise-photon extinction ratio on the order of 106 and surpassing the frequency resolution limit of a single filter. Experimental results demonstrate that the system reduces the noise floor in the detection optical path to below 10-16, while maintaining a photon transmission efficiency above 53% for the signal. This technology effectively addresses key challenges in noise suppression and photon state fidelity optimization in optical fiber quantum communication, offering a scalable frequency-photon noise filtering solution for long-distance quantum communication. Furthermore, its multi-parameter cooperative filtering mechanism holds broad potential applications in areas such as quantum storage and optical frequency combs.

TI Quantum Phase Transitions for an Integrable Quantum Rabi-like Model with
   Two Interacting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A two-interacting-qubit quantum Rabi-like model with vanishing transverse fields on the qubit pair is studied. Independently of the coupling regime, this model can be exactly and unitarily reduced to two independent single-spin quantum Rabi models, where the spin-spin coupling plays the role of the transverse field. This transformation and the analytical treatment of the single-spin quantum Rabi model provide the key to prove the integrability of our model. The existence of different first-order quantum phase transitions, characterized by discontinuous two-spin magnetization, mean photon number, and concurrence, is brought to light.

TI Decoherence of VB- spin defects in monoisotopic
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising quantum systems for the design of flexible two-dimensional quantum sensing platforms. Here we rely on hBN crystals isotopically enriched with either B-10 or B-11 to investigate the isotope-dependent properties of a spin defect featuring a broadband photoluminescence signal in the near infrared. By analyzing the hyperfine structure of the spin defect while changing the boron isotope, we first confirm that it corresponds to the negatively charged boron-vacancy center (V-B(-)). We then show that its spin coherence properties are slightly improved in B-10-enriched samples. This is supported by numerical simulations employing cluster correlation expansion methods, which reveal the importance of the hyperfine Fermi contact term for calculating the coherence time of point defects in hBN. Using cross-relaxation spectroscopy, we finally identify dark electron spin impurities as an additional source of decoherence. This work provides new insights into the properties of V-B(-) spin defects, which are valuable for the future development of hBN-based quantum sensing foils.

TI Robust Strong-Coupling Architecture in Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We report on a robust method to achieve strong coupling between a superconducting flux qubit and a high-quality quarter-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator. We demonstrate the progression from the strong to ultrastrong coupling regime by varying the length of a shared inductive coupling element, ultimately achieving a qubit-resonator coupling strength of 655 MHz, 10% of the resonator frequency. We derive an analytical expression for the coupling strength in terms of circuit parameters and also discuss the maximum achievable coupling within this framework. We experimentally characterize flux qubits coupled to superconducting resonators using one- and two-tone spectroscopy methods, demonstrating excellent agreement with the proposed theoretical model.

AB Given the limitations of current hardware, the theoretical gains promised by quantum computing remain unrealized across practical applications. But the gap between theory and hardware is closing, assisted by developments in quantum algorithmic modeling. One such recent development is QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), an open-source software framework that leverages state-of-the-art optimization-based solvers to find provably optimal compact circuit decompositions, which are exact up to global phase and machine precision. The quantum circuit design problem can be modeled using non-linear, non-convex constraints. However, QCOpt reformulates these non-linear constraints using well-known linearization techniques such that the resulting design problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear programming model. In this work, we instead explore whether the QCOpt's model could also be effective with a continuous Non-Linear Programming (NLP) model obtained via relaxation of the integer variables in the non-linear constraints. We are able to present not only multiple significant enhancements to QCOpt, with up to 11.3x speed up in run times on an average, but also opportunities for more generally exploring the behavior of gradient-based NLP solvers.

AB Using numerically exact solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation together with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) calculations, here we compare the effects of spatial nonlocality versus nonlocal causality for the ground state and for real-time evolution of two entangled electrons in parabolic potential in one spatial dimension. It was found that the spatial entanglement quantified by the linear quantum entropy is predicted with good accuracy using the spatial nonlocality, parameterized naturally within the TDQMC approach. At the same time, the nonlocal causality predicted by the exact solution leads to only small oscillations in the quantum trajectories which belong to the idler electron as the driven electron is subjected to a strong high frequency electric field, without interaction between the electrons.

Lattice topology has emerged as a means of protecting photonic states from disorder, but entanglement across different topologies remains unexplored. We report biphoton entanglement between topologically distinct spatial modes in a bipartite array of silicon waveguides. The results highlight topology as an additional degree of freedom for entanglement and open avenues for investigating information teleportation between trivial and topological modes.

   Multi-Dressing Quantization
SO PHOTONICS
AB The fifth-order nonlinear polarizability has been extensively studied in the field of quantum communication due to its ease of manipulation. By adjusting the relative size of the Rabi frequency and dephasing rate of the dressing field, natural non-Hermitian exceptional points can be generated, and further evolution can be achieved by varying the types of dressing fields. However, as the demand for information capacity in quantum communication continues to increase, research on the higher-order seventh-order nonlinear polarizability, based on four-photon states, and the number of coherent channels and resonance positions has gradually come to the forefront. This paper focuses on the simultaneous generation of a seventh-order nonlinear polarizability through a spontaneous eight-wave mixing (SEWM) process in an atomic medium involving four photons. Compared to the fifth-order nonlinear polarizability, the seventh-order polarizability shows an exponential increase in coherent channels and resonance positions due to its strong dressing effect. Additionally, the interaction between the four photons is stronger than that between three photons, making it possible for even the difficult-to-dress eigenvalues to be influenced by the dressing field and dephasing rate, resulting in more complex coherent channels. These are manifested as more complex, damped Rabi oscillations, with periods that can be controlled by the dressing field. These findings may contribute to a promising new method for quantum communication.

TI Layer-Dependent Magnetism and Spin Fluctuations in Atomically Thin van
   der Waals Magnet CrPS4
SO NANO LETTERS
AB van der Waals (vdW) magnets, an emerging family of two-dimensional (2D) materials, have received tremendous attention due to their rich fundamental physics and significant potential for cutting-edge technological applications. In contrast to the conventional bulk counterparts, vdW magnets exhibit significant tunability of local material properties, such as stacking engineered interlayer coupling and layer-number dependent magnetic and electronic interactions, which promise to deliver previously unavailable merits to develop multifunctional microelectronic devices. As a further ingredient of this emerging topic, here we report nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging of the atomically thin vdW magnet chromium thiophosphate CrPS4, revealing its characteristic layer-dependent 2D static magnetism and dynamic spin fluctuations. We also show a large tunneling magnetoresistance in CrPS4-based spin filter vdW heterostructures. The excellent material stability and robust strategy against environmental degradation in combination with tailored magnetic properties highlight the potential of CrPS4 in developing state-of-the-art 2D spintronic devices for next-generation information technologies.

TI The functions of a reservoir offset voltage applied to physically
   defined p-channel Si quantum dots
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose and define a reservoir offset voltage as a voltage commonly applied to both reservoirs of a quantum dot and study the functions in p-channel Si quantum dots. By the reservoir offset voltage, the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot can be modulated. In addition, when quantum dots in different channels are capacitively coupled, the reservoir offset voltage of one of the QDs can work as a gate voltage for the others. Our results show that the technique will lead to reduction of the number of gate electrodes, which is advantageous for future qubit integration.

AB The decades-old Pattern Matching with Edits problem, given a length-n string T) (the text), a length-m string P (the pattern), and a positive integer : (the threshold), asks to list all fragments of) that are at edit distance at most k from P. The one-way communication complexity of this problem is the minimum amount of space needed to encode the answer so that it can be retrieved without accessing the input strings P and T.
   The closely related Pattern Matching with Mismatches problem (defined in terms of the Hamming distance instead of the edit distance) is already well understood from the communication complexity perspective: Clifford, Kociumaka, and Porat [SODA 2019] proved that Omega(n/m center dot k log(m/k)) bits are necessary and O(n/m center dot k log(m vertical bar Sigma vertical bar k) bits are sufficient; the upper bound allows encoding not only the occurrences of P in) with at most k mis-matches but also the substitutions needed to make each k-mismatch occurrence exact.
   Despite recent improvements in the running time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz; FOCS 2020 and 2022], the communication complexity of Pattern Matching with Edits remained unexplored, with a lower bound of Omega (n/m center dot k log (m/k)) bits and an upper bound of O(n/m center dot k(3) log m) bits stemming from previous research. In this work, we prove an upper bound of O(n/m center dot k log(2) m) bits, thus establishing the optimal communication complexity up to logarithmic factors. We also show that O(n/m center dot k log m log(m vertical bar Sigma vertical bar)) bits allow encoding, for each k-error occurrence of P in T, the shortest sequence of edits needed to make the occurrence exact. Our result further emphasizes the close relationship between Pattern Matching with Mismatches and Pattern Matching with Edits.
   We leverage the techniques behind our new result on the communication complexity to obtain quantum algorithms for Pattern Matching with Edits: we demonstrate a quantum algorithm that uses O(n(1+o(1))/m. root km) queries and O(n(1+o(1))/m center dot (root km + k(3.5))) quantum time. Moreover, when determining the existence of at least one occurrence, the algorithm uses O(root n(1+o(1)) /m . root km) queries and O(root n(1+o(1))/m center dot (root km + k(3.5))) time. For both cases, we establish corresponding lower bounds to demonstrate that the query complexity is optimal up to sub-polynomial factors.

We demonstrate the derivation of an effective Hamiltonian for the strongly dispersive regime for this system. The qubit works as a quantum switch, allowing a conditioned transfer of excitations between the TLR and NEMS. We show that this regime allows the system to be employed for signal processing and force estimation. Additionally, we explore the ability of the quantum switch to generate non-classical states.

This algorithm uses a quantum processing unit to probe the needed probability mass functions and a classical processing unit perform the remaining calculations, including the energy minimization. The ansatz form does not restrict the Fock space and provides full control over the trial state, including the implementation of symmetry and other physically motivated constraints.

TI Low-depth Amplitude Estimation without Really Trying
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Standard quantum amplitude estimation algorithms provide quadratic speedup to Monte-Carlo simulations but require a circuit depth that scales as inverse of the estimation error. In view of the shallow depth in near-term devices, the precision achieved by these algorithms would be low. In this article, we bypass this limitation by performing the classical Monte-Carlo method on the quantum algorithm itself, achieving a higher than classical precision using low-depth circuits. We require the quantum algorithm to be weakly biased in order to avoid error accumulation during this process. Our method is parallel and can be as weakly biased as the constituent algorithm in some cases.

AB Understanding the physical nature of the D-Wave annealers remains a subject of active investigation. In this study, we analyze the sampling behavior of these systems and explore whether their results can be replicated using quantum and Markovian models. Employing the standard and the fast annealing protocols, we observe that the D-Wave annealers sample states with frequencies matching the Gibbs distribution for sufficiently long annealing times. Using Bloch equation simulations for single-qubit problems and Lindblad and Markovian master equations for two-qubit systems, we compare experimental data with theoretical predictions. Our results provide insights into the role of quantum mechanics in these devices.

TI Violation of Bell's inequality for helical Mathieu-Gauss vector modes
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Vector beams display varying polarisation over planes transversal to their direction of propagation. The variation of polarisation implies that the electric field cannot be expressed as a product of a spatial mode and its polarisation. This non-separability has been analysed for particular vector beams in terms of non-quantum entanglement between the spatial and the polarisation-degrees of freedom, and equivalently, with respect to the degree of polarisation of light. Here we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that Mathieu-Gauss vector modes violate a Bell-like inequality known as the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt-Bell inequality. This demonstration provides new insights on the violation of Bell inequalities by a more general class of vector modes with elliptical symmetry.

The dynamical evolution of a black hole including the back-reaction of the Hawking radiation on the metric is formulated as an initial-value problem. The quantum stress-energy tensor is evaluated using a point-splitting regularization along spacelike geodesics. To account for the quantum entanglement of the matter fields, they are treated as a set of bilocal collective fields defined on spacelike hypersurfaces. The resulting semiclassical field equations include terms up to fourth order in derivatives that can be treated in a perturbative PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI expansion. The formulation we arrive at should be amenable to numerical simulation of time-dependent semiclassical spacetime.

AB Microwave-driven logic is a promising alternative to laser control in scaling trapped-ion based quantum processors. We implement Mt lmer-St rensen two-qubit gates on 43Ca+ hyperfine clock qubits in a cryogenic (=i25 K) surface trap, driven by near-field microwaves. We achieve gate durations of 154 mu s [with 1.0(2)% error] and 331 mu s [0.5(1)% error], which approaches the performance of typical laser-driven gates. In the 331 mu s gate, we demonstrate a Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling scheme which suppresses errors due to fluctuations in the qubit frequency as well as imperfections in the decoupling drive itself.

While it is well known that probabilistic no-signalling resources (such as quantum non-locality) are stronger than deterministic ones, we show-by invoking the axiom of choice-the opposite: functional (deterministic) no-signalling resources can be stronger than probabilistic ones (e.g. stronger than quantum entanglement or non-locality in general). To prove this, we devise a Bell-like game that shows a systematic advantage of functional no-signalling with respect to any probabilistic no-signalling resource.

TI On construction of quantum codes with dual-containing quasi-cyclic codes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB One of the main objectives of quantum error-correction theory is to construct quantum codes with optimal parameters and properties. In this paper, we propose a class of 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes and study their applications in the construction of quantum codes over small fields. Firstly, some sufficient conditions for these 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes to be dual-containing concerning Hermitian inner product are determined. Then, we utilize these Hermitian dual-containing quasi-cyclic codes to produce quantum codes via the famous Hermitian construction. Moreover, we present a lower bound on the minimum distance of these quasi-cyclic codes, which is helpful to construct quantum codes with larger lengths and dimensions. As the computational results, many new quantum codes that exceed the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound are constructed over F-q, where q is 2, 3, 4, 5. In particular, 16 binary quantum codes raise the lower bound on the minimum distance in Grassl's table (Grassl in bounds on the minimum distance of linear codes and quantum codes. http://www.codetables.de). In nonbinary cases, many quantum codes are new or have better parameters than those in the literature.

SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Special fermionic systems entered the realm of quantum chemistry in the seventies in the work of Borland and Dennis in the form of a toy model. This work was leading to a detailed study of the N-representability problem by Klyachko. The topic then has been reconsidered in the light of entanglement theory boiling down to the notion of entanglement polytopes. Recently building on certain properties of such special fermionic systems, a connection between the coupled cluster method and entanglement has been established. In this paper we show that precisely such a special class of systems also provides an interesting physical realization for structures related to the Lie algebras of exceptional groups. This result draws such exotic symmetry structures under the umbrella of entangled systems of physical relevance.

A quantum ultrafast Raman spectroscopy is developed for condensed-phase molecules, to monitor the exciton populations and coherences. Analytic results are obtained, showing an entanglement-enabled time-frequency scale not attainable by classical light. The Raman signal presents an unprecedented selectivity of molecular correlation functions, as a result of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.

TI Quantum and Classical Correlations in Open Quantum Spin Lattices via
   Truncated-Cumulant Trajectories
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The study of quantum many-body physics in Liouvillian open quantum systems becomes increasingly important with the recent progress in experimental control on dissipative systems and their exploitation for technological purposes. A central question in open quantum systems concerns the fate of quantum cor-relations, and the possibility of controlling them by engineering the competition between the Hamiltonian dynamics and the coupling of the system to a bath. Such a question is very challenging from a theoretical point of view, as numerical methods faithfully accounting for quantum correlations are either relying on exact diagonalization, drastically limiting the sizes that can be treated numerically, or on approximations on the range or strength of quantum correlations, associated with the choice of a specific ansatz for the den-sity matrix. In this work we propose a new method to treat open quantum spin lattices, based on stochastic quantum trajectories for the solution of the open-system dynamics. Along each trajectory, the hierarchy of equations of motion for many-point spin-spin correlators is truncated to a given finite order, assuming that multivariate kth-order cumulants vanish for k exceeding a cutoff kc. This scheme allows one to track the evolution of quantum spin-spin correlations up to order kc for all length scales. We validate this approach in the paradigmatic case of the dissipative phase transitions of the two-dimensional XYZ lattice subject to spontaneous decay. We convincingly assess the existence of steady-state phase transitions from para-magnetic to ferromagnetic, and back to paramagnetic, upon increasing one of the Hamiltonian spin-spin couplings, as well as the classical Ising nature of such transitions. Moreover, the approach allows us to show the presence of significant quantum correlations in the vicinity of the dissipative critical point, and to unveil the presence of spin squeezing, which can be proven to be a tight lower bound to the quantum Fisher information.

TI Complexity from the reduced density matrix: a new diagnostic for chaos
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate circuit complexity to characterize chaos in multiparticle quantum systems. In the process, we take a stride to analyze open quantum systems by using complexity. We propose a new diagnostic of quantum chaos from complexity based on the reduced density matrix by exploring different types of quantum circuits. Through explicit calculations on a toy model of two coupled harmonic oscillators, where one or both of the oscillators are inverted, we demonstrate that the evolution of complexity is a possible diagnostic of chaos.

TI The pseudochiral Fermi surface of α-RuI3
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In continuation of research into RuCl3 and RuBr3 as potential quantum spin liquids, a phase with unique magnetic order characterised by long-range quantum entanglement and fractionalised excitations, the compound RuI3 has been recently synthesised. Here, we show RuI3 is a moderately correlated metal with two bands crossing the Fermi level, implying the absence of any quantum spin liquids phase. We find that the Fermi surface as measured or calculated for a 2D (k(x), k(y)) slice at any k(z) lacks mirror symmetry, i.e. is pseudochiral. We link this phenomenon to the ABC stacking in the R3 over bar space group of alpha-RuI3, which is achiral but lacks any mirror or glide symmetries. We further provide a formal framework for understanding when such a pseudochiral electronic structure may be observed.

TI Simulating scalar field theories on quantum computers with limited
   resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantum algorithm for implementing 04 lattice scalar field theory on qubit computers. The field is represented in the discretized field amplitude basis. The number of qubits and elementary gates required by the implementation of the evolution operator is proportional to the lattice size. The algorithm allows efficient 04 state preparation for a large range of input parameters in both the normal and broken-symmetry phases. The states are prepared using a combination of variational and adiabatic evolution methods. First, the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, which includes the 04 self-interaction, is prepared using short variational circuits. Next, this state is evolved by switching on the coupling between the lattice sites adiabatically. The parameters defining the local Hamiltonian are adjustable and constitute the input of our algorithm. We present a method to optimize these parameters in order to reduce the adiabatic time required for state preparation. For preparing broken-symmetry states, the adiabatic evolution problems caused by crossing the phase transition critical line and by the degeneracy of the broken-symmetry ground state can be addressed using an auxiliary external field which gradually turns off during the adiabatic process. We show that the time dependence of the external field during the adiabatic evolution is important for addressing the broken-symmetry ground state degeneracy. The adiabatic time dependence on the inverse error tolerance can be reduced from quadratic to linear by using a field strength that decreases exponentially in time relative to one that decreases linearly.

TI Single-Shot Decoding of Linear Rate LDPC Quantum Codes With High
   Performance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We construct and analyze a family of low-density parity check (LDPC) quantum codes with a linear encoding rate, distance scaling as n(epsilon) for epsilon > 0 and efficient decoding schemes. The code family is based on tessellations of closed, four-dimensional, hyperbolic manifolds, as first suggested by Guth and Lubotzky. The main contribution of this work is the construction of suitable manifolds via finite presentations of Coxeter groups, their linear representations over Galois fields and topological coverings. We establish a lower bound on the encoding rate k/n of 13/72 = 0.180... and we show that the bound is tight for the examples that we construct. Numerical simulations give evidence that parallelizable decoding schemes of low computational complexity suffice to obtain high performance. These decoding schemes can deal with syndrome noise, so that parity check measurements do not have to be repeated to decode. Our data is consistent with a threshold of around 4% in the phenomenological noise model with syndrome noise in the single-shot regime.

TI Tensor-Network Decoding Beyond 2D
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Decoding algorithms based on approximate tensor-network (TN) contraction have proven tremendously successful in decoding two-dimensional (2D) local quantum codes such as toric or surface codes and color codes, effectively achieving optimal decoding accuracy. In this work, we introduce several techniques to generalize TN decoding to higher dimensions so that it can be applied to three-dimensional (3D) codes as well as 2D codes with noisy syndrome measurements (phenomenological noise or circuit- level noise). The 3D case is significantly more challenging than 2D, as the involved approximate tensor contraction is dramatically less well behaved than its 2D counterpart. Nonetheless, we numerically demonstrate that the decoding accuracy of our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decoders on the 3D surface code, both in the point and loop sectors, as well as for depolarizing noise. Our techniques could prove useful in near-term experimental demonstrations of quantum error correction, when decoding is to be performed off line and accuracy is of the utmost importance. To this end, we show how TN decoding can be applied to circuit-level noise and demonstrate that it outperforms the matching decoder on the rotated surface code.

TI Photon-Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time
   Fluctuations with GQuEST
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The gravity from the quantum entanglement of space-time (GQuEST) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon-counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent "geontropic" quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon-counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design, thus, enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.

TI Multiple-quantum-coherence dynamics of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate
   during quantum phase transitions
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Multiple quantum coherences are often employed to describe quantum many-body dynamics in nuclear spin systems and recently, to characterize quantum phase transitions in trapped ions. Here we investigate the multiple-quantum-coherence dynamics of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting the quadratic Zeeman shift, the condensate exhibits three quantum phases. Our numerical results show that the spectrum of multiple quantum coherence does indeed catch the quantum critical points. More importantly, with only a few low-order multiple quantum coherences, the spin-1 condensate exhibits rich signals of the many-body dynamics, beyond conventional observables. The experimental implementation of such multiple quantum coherence protocol is also discussed.

TI Tile Codes: High-Efficiency Quantum Codes on a Lattice with Boundary
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce tile codes, a simple yet powerful way of constructing quantum codes that are local on a planar 2D lattice. Tile codes generalize the usual surface code by allowing for a bit more flexibility in terms of locality and stabilizer weight. Our construction does not compromise on the fact that the codes are local on a lattice with open boundary conditions. Despite its simplicity, we use our construction to find codes with parameters [[288, 8, 12]] using weight-6 stabilizers and [[288, 8, 14]] using weight-8 stabilizers, outperforming all previously known constructions in this direction. Allowing for a slightly higher nonlocality, we find a [[512, 18, 19]] code using weight-8 stabilizers, which outperforms the rotated surface code by a factor of more than 12. Our approach provides a unified framework for understanding the structure of codes that are local on a 2D planar lattice and offers a systematic way to explore the space of possible code parameters. In particular, due to its simplicity, the construction naturally accommodates various types of boundary conditions and stabilizer configurations, making it a versatile tool for quantum error-correction code design.

Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the unitary error can be below 10(-5) in a variety of 75-ns-long two-qubit gates (CZ, iSWAP, and root iSWAP) implemented using parametric resonance. We analyze the conditional ZZ phase and demonstrate that the CZ gate needs no further phase-correction steps, while the ZZ phase error in SWAP-type gates can be compensated by choosing pulse parameters. With decoherence considered, we estimate that qubit relaxation time needs to exceed 70 mu s to achieve the 99.9% fidelity threshold.

TI Making two particle detectors in flat spacetime communicate quantumly
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A communication protocol with nonzero quantum capacity is found when the two communicating parts are particle detector models in (3 & thorn; 1)-dimensional spacetime. In particular, as detectors, we consider two harmonic oscillators interacting with a scalar field, whose evolution is generalized for whatever background spacetime and whatever spacetime smearing of the detectors. We then specialize to Minkowski spacetime and an initial Minkowski vacuum, considering a rapid interaction between the field and the two detectors, studying the case where the receiver is static and the sender is moving. The possibility to have a quantum capacity greater than zero stems from a relative acceleration between the detectors. Indeed, no reliable quantum communication is possible when the two detectors are static or moving inertially with respect to each other, but a reliable quantum communication can be achieved between a uniformly accelerated sender and an inertial receiver.

In this four-terminal geometry, the control voltage changes the occupation of Andreev states in the Josephson junction, thereby tuning the magnitude of the supercurrent. As a function of gate voltage, we find two different regimes characterized by a double -step distribution and a hot-electron distribution, respectively. Our work opens opportunities to design highly controllable Josephson junctions for tunable superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Additive conjucyclic codes over a class of Galois rings
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING
AB As a tool towards quantum error correction, additive conjucyclic codes have gained great attention. But, their algebraic structure is completely unknown over finite fields (except F-q2) as well as rings. In this article, we investigate the structure of additive conjucyclic codes over Galois rings GR(2(r), 2), where r >= 2 is an integer. We develop a one-to-one correspondence between the family of additive conjucyclic codes of length n over GR(2(r), 2) and the family of linear cyclic codes of length 2n over Z(2r). This correspondence helps to obtain additive conjucyclic codes over GR(2(r), 2) via known linear cyclic codes over Z(2r). We prove that the trace dual C Tr of an additive conjucyclic code C is also an additive conjucyclic code. Moreover, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition of additive conjucyclic codes to be self-dual. We further propose a technique for constructing linear cyclic codes over Z(2r) contained in additive conjucyclic codes over GR(2(r), 2). Last but not least, we explicitly derive the generator matrices for these codes.

TI Atomic entanglement concentration via photonic Faraday rotation in
   cavity QED
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB By utilizing Faraday rotation of photons, we present a highly efficient protocol for entanglement concentration of atomic Bell states, which departs from the conventional method of sequential interactions between the auxiliary photon and two optical cavities. Instead, the simultaneous interaction of the auxiliary photon with two atomic cavities is involved in order to significantly reduce the time requirement for achieving atomic Bell state entanglement concentration. By employing iterative applications of the protocol for entanglement concentration, the discarded states can be repeatedly concentrated, efficiently increasing the probability of success. Furthermore, our entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) operate in low-Q cavities, which are easier to implement in practical applications than high-Q cavities. Finally, it can be generalized to an N-atom GHZ states entanglement concentration protocol.

TI Fast High-Fidelity Single-Shot Readout of Spins in Silicon Using a
   Single-Electron Box
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Three key metrics for readout systems in quantum processors are measurement speed, fidelity, and footprint. Fast high-fidelity readout enables midcircuit measurements, a necessary feature for many dynamic algorithms and quantum error correction, while a small footprint facilitates the design of scalable, highly connected architectures with the associated increase in computing performance. Here, we present two complementary demonstrations of fast high-fidelity single-shot readout of spins in silicon quantum dots using a compact, dispersive charge sensor: a radio-frequency single-electron box. The sensor, despite requiring fewer electrodes than conventional detectors, performs at the state of the art achieving spin readout fidelity of 99.2% in less than 6 mu s fitted from a physical model. We demonstrate that low-loss high-impedance resonators, highly coupled to the sensing dot, in conjunction with Josephson parametric amplification are instrumental in achieving optimal performance. We quantify the benefit of Pauli spin blockade over spin-dependent tunneling to a reservoir, as the spin-to-charge conversion mechanism in these readout schemes. Our results place dispersive charge sensing at the forefront of readout methodologies for scalable semiconductor spin-based quantum processors.

TI Longitudinal field controls vector vortex beams in anisotropic
   epsilon-near-zero metamaterials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Structured light plays an important role in metrology, optical trapping and manipulation, communications, quantum technologies and nonlinear optics. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach for the manipulation of vector beams carrying longitudinal field components using metamaterials with extreme anisotropy. Implementing vectorial spectroscopy, we show that the propagation of complex beams with inhomogeneous polarization is strongly affected by the interplay of the metamaterial anisotropy with the transverse and longitudinal field structure of the beam. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in the epsilon-near-zero regime, exclusively realised for light polarized along the metamaterial optical axis, strongly influencing the interaction of longitudinal fields with the metamaterial. The requirements on the balance between the transverse and longitudinal fields to maintain a polarization singularity at the beam axis allow control of the beam modal content, filtering diffraction effects and tailoring spatial polarization distributions. The understanding of the interaction of vector beams with metamaterials opens new opportunities for applications in microscopy, information encoding, biochemical sensing and quantum technologies.

TI Fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using Bacon-Shor codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Designing efficient fault-tolerance schemes is crucial for building useful quantum computers. Most standard schemes assume no knowledge of the underlying device noise and rely on general-purpose quantum errorcorrecting (QEC) codes capable of handling arbitrary errors. Biased-noise alternatives focus on only correcting a subset of some generic error basis (e.g., Pauli error basis) and lower resource needs by channeling the redundancy to dealing only with that subset. Yet, the most resource-efficient codes are expected to be those that directly target the specific noise process that afflicts the quantum device, rather than using a generic error-basis description. However, the question of whether such noise-adapted QEC protocols are amenable to fault-tolerant implementations remains largely unexplored. Here, we design a fault-tolerance scheme based on the Bacon-Shor codes that can protect against amplitude-damping noise in the device. We construct a universal set of logical gadgets tolerant to multiple damping errors and estimate the fault-tolerance threshold of our scheme. Our work thus establishes the possibility of achieving fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using noise-adapted quantum codes, while highlighting some of the unique challenges that arise in this context.

TI Generation of multiple entangled fields via mechanical oscillator
   displacement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a convenient and efficient scheme to generate multipartite continuous-variable entanglement via mechanical oscillator displacement induced by two strong input pump fields in a conventional single-cavity optomechanical system. It is shown that multipartite entanglement among the outputs of the two pump fields and any number of relatively weak probe fields can be realized and optimized when the two pump fields with suitable amplitude ratio and relative initial phase are, respectively, tuned to the red and blue mechanical sidebands of a single-cavity mode and each probe field is red detuned by the mechanical frequency with respect to a different neighboring cavity mode. This method can, in principle, be extended to flexibly and conveniently generate an arbitrary number of nondegenerate bright entangled fields by using only coherent laser fields, and may find promising applications in realistic quantum communication and networks.

TI Non-variational quantum random access optimization with alternating
   operator ansatz
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application domains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry and the availability of broadly applicable theoretical quantum speedups. However, the ability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization problems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error correction. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to reduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO has only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the need to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult to scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show that instance-independent "fixed" parameters achieve good performance, removing the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we evaluate different design choices, such as various mixers, initial states, and QRAO-specific implementations of the QAOA cost operator, and identify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Kurtosis of von Neumann entanglement entropy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work, we study the statistical behavior of entanglement in quantum bipartite systems under the Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble as assessed by the standard measure-the von Neumann entropy. Expressions of the first three exact cumulants of von Neumann entropy are known in the literature. The main contribution of the present work is the exact formula of the corresponding fourth cumulant that controls the tail behavior of the distribution. As a key ingredient in deriving the result, we make use of what we refer to as unsimplifiable summation bases leading to a complete cancellation. In addition to providing further evidence of the conjectured Gaussian limit of the von Neumann entropy, the obtained formula also provides an improved finite-size approximation to the distribution.

TI Logical channels in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, analysis of the code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit that virtually projects onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction, even when damped, finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) channels on the logical GKP code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first uses symmetries of standard binning (SB) decoding to passively twirl over the full stabilizer group. Doing so converts small amounts of damping into stochastic Gaussian random noise (GRN). The second uses active twirling over a minimal set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allows for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping and allows the study of decoding more general than SB, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, we observe that the advantage of optimized decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases. Moreover, the performance of both decoding strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled GRN logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for two commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction in the fault-tolerance regime: (i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and (ii) the use of SB decoding.

TI Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.

TI Multispectral SNSPD Using a Modified Distributed Bragg Reflector, Gold
   Mirror, and Multilayer-Nanowire Structures
SO PHOTONICS
AB A multispectral superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) that is sensitive to different incident photon wavelength bands, is proposed. The SNSPD consists of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), a gold mirror, and two regions employing four NbN nanowire meander layers. Using the DBR, both as a filter and a reflector, creates two distinct detection bands. The first detection band has a peak absorptance of 0.792 at a wavelength of 1164 nm, while the second band has a total absorptance of >0.70 in the wavelength range 1440 to 2000 nm. The design of the proposed SNSPD can be tuned to provide sensitivity to different wavelength bands. While conventional SNSPDs do not typically provide photon wavelength sensitivity, the band-selection design proposed in this work opens up its potential applications for future quantum communication technology.

TI Pump-Driven Opto-Magnetic Properties in Semiconducting Transition-Metal
   Dichalcogenides: An Analytical Model
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenides provide an unique intrinsic entanglement between the spin/valley/orbital degrees of freedom and the polarization of scattered photons. This scenario gives rise to the well-assessed optical dichroism observed by using both steady and time-resolved probes. In this paper, we provide compact analytical modeling of the onset of a finite Faraday/Kerr optical rotation upon shining with circularly polarized light. We identify different optical features displaying optical rotation at different characteristic energies, and we describe in an analytical framework the time-dependence of their intensities as a consequence of the main spin-conserving and spin-flip processes.

TI Observation of quantum oscillations in the extreme weak anharmonic limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate a granular aluminium quantum circuit with an anharmonicity of the order of its decoherence rate in a three-dimensional microwave cavity. We perform single qubitlike manipulations such as Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Our findings, supported by quantitative numerical modeling, show that a very weakly anharmonic oscillator can also display quantum oscillations outside the qubit regime. These oscillations are hard to disambiguate from qubit oscillations in time domain measurements for a single driving frequency. This sheds light on recent findings for material superconducting quantum bits. Our platform shows in addition large magnetic field resilience which could find applications for quantum enhanced dark matter search.

Motivated by this, we fabricate and perform spectroscopy of a gated Cooper-pair box, capacitively coupled to two superconducting coplanar-waveguide resonators with different frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate the strong coupling of a charge qubit to two superconducting resonators, with the ability to perform voltage driving of the qubit at gigahertz frequencies. We go on to discuss how the measured device could be modified to operate as a cyclic quantum refrigerator by terminating the resonators with normal-metal resistors acting as heat baths.

TI High-fidelity CNOT gate for spin qubits with asymmetric driving using
   virtual gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent experiments have demonstrated two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% for semiconductor spin qubits. However, theoretically, the fidelity of controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations is limited by off-resonant driving described by off-diagonal terms in the system Hamiltonian. Here, we investigate these off-diagonal contributions and we propose a fidelity improvement of several orders of magnitude by using asymmetric driving. Therefore, we provide a description of ac virtual gates based on a simple capacitance model which not only enables a high-fidelity CNOT but also allows for crosstalk reduction when scaling up spin qubit devices to larger arrays.

We characterize both the validity and entangled nature of the X-states with maximally-mixed subsystems in terms of certain parameters and show that their properties are related to a special class of geometric hyperplanes of the symplectic polar space of order two and rank two. Finally, we introduce the concept of hyperplane-states and briefly address their non-local properties.

TI Spectrally separable photon-pair generation in dispersion engineered
   thin-film lithium niobate
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Existing nonlinear-optic implementations of pure, unfiltered heralded single-photon sources do not offer the scalability required for densely integrated quantum networks. Additionally, lithium niobate has hitherto been unsuitable for such use due to its material dispersion. We engineer the dispersion and the quasi-phasematching conditions of a waveguide in the rapidly emerging thin-film lithium niobate platform to generate spectrally separable photon pairs in the telecommunications band. Such photon pairs can be used as spectrally pure heralded single-photon sources in quantum networks. We estimate a heralded-state spectral purity of >94% based on joint spectral intensity measurements. Further, a joint spectral phase-sensitive measurement of the unheralded time-integrated second-order correlation function yields a heralded-state purity of (86 +/- 5)%.

TI Measurement Incompatibility versus Bell Nonlocality: An Approach via
   Tensor Norms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Measurement incompatibility and quantum nonlocality are two key features of quantum theory. Viola-tions of Bell inequalities require quantum entanglement and incompatibility of the measurements used by the two parties involved in the protocol. We analyze the converse question: for which Bell inequalities is the incompatibility of measurements enough to ensure a quantum violation? We relate the two questions by comparing two tensor norms on the space of dichotomic quantum measurements, one characterizing measurement compatibility and the other characterizing violations of a given Bell inequality. We provide sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two notions in terms of the matrix describing the corre-lation Bell inequality. We show that the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and its variants are the only ones that satisfy it.

TI Quantum gravity through geometric algebra
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Geometric Algebra is used to construct a model of quantum gravity in which the 4D spacetime manifold is built from qubitic quantum entangled spacetime elements of geometric algebraic nature. This is achieved by first investigating the spontaneous decomposition of the spacetime continuum's metric structure at Planck distances as one approaches what otherwise would become the Universe's initial singularity. Considering this metric deconstruction within the model one finds that the reverse induced emergence of the spacetime continuum is generated by a coupling action triggered by the embedding action between distinct pre-spacetime manifolds. Further uncovered in this re-engineering of spacetime is a Poincare-constrained quantum foam existing at infra-Planck scales.

Through its electron- and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom, the hydrogen atom is shown to lend a physically meaningful frame and a suitable Hilbert space for bipartite entanglement, the two-qubit concurrence and quantum coherence of which can be expressed in terms of the fundamental physical constants-the Planck and Boltzmann constants, electron and proton masses, the fine-structure constant, as well as the Bohr radius and the Bohr magneton. The intrinsic, natural entanglement that the hyperfine-structure (HFS) states of the H atom store at low temperatures rapidly decreases with a growth in temperature, vanishing above a tau(c) approximate to 5.35 mu eV threshold. An external magnetic field, however, can overcome this thermal loss of HFS entanglement. As one of the central findings of this paper, we show that an external magnetic field can induce and sustain an HFS entanglement, against all the odds of thermal effects, at temperatures well above the tau(c) threshold, thus enabling magnetic-field-assisted entanglement engineering in low-temperature gases and solids.

TI Large-baseline quantum telescopes assisted by partially distinguishable
   photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement can be used to extend the baseline of telescope arrays in order to increase the spatial resolution. In one proposal by Marchese and Kok [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 160801 (2023)], identical single photons are shared between receivers and interfere with a star photon. In this paper we consider two outstanding questions: (i) what is the precise effect of the low photon occupancy of the mode associated with the starlight? and (ii) what is the effect on the achievable resolution of imperfect indistinguishability (or partial distinguishability) between the ground and star photons? We find that the effect of distinguishability is relatively mild, but low photon occupancy of the optical mode of the starlight quickly deteriorates the sensitivity of the telescope for higher auxiliary photon numbers.

TI Universal Entanglement Spectrum in One-Dimensional Gapless Symmetry
   Protected Topological States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement marks a definitive feature of topological states. However, the entanglement spectrum remains insufficiently explored for topological states without a bulk energy gap. Using a combination of field theory and numerical techniques, we accurately calculate and analyze the entanglement spectrum of gapless symmetry protected topological states in one dimension. We highlight that the universal entanglement spectrum not only encodes the nontrivial edge degeneracy, generalizing the Li-Haldane conjecture to gapless topological states, but also contains the operator content of the underlying boundary conformal field theory. This implies that the bulk wave function can act as a fingerprint of both quantum criticality and topology in gapless symmetry protected topological states. We also identify a symmetry enriched conformal boundary condition that goes beyond the conventional conformal boundary condition.

TI Photoisomerization transition state manipulation by entangled two-photon
   absorption
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We demonstrate how two-photon excitation with quantum light can influence elementary photochemical events. The azobenzene trans -> cis isomerization following entangled two-photon excitation is simulated using quantum nuclear wave packet dynamics. Photon entanglement modulates the nuclear wave packets by coherently controlling the transition pathways. The photochemical transition state during passage of the reactive conical intersection in azobenzene photoisomerization is strongly affected with a noticeable alteration of the product yield. Quantum entanglement thus provides a novel control knob for photochemical reactions. The distribution of the vibronic coherences during the conical intersection passage strongly depends on the shape of the initial wave packet created upon quantum light excitation. X-ray signals that can experimentally monitor this coherence are simulated.

TI Topological protection of continuous frequency entangled biphoton states
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Topological quantum optics that manipulates the topological protection of quantum states has attracted special interests in recent years. Here we demonstrate valley photonic crystals implementing topologically protected transport of the continuous frequency entangled biphoton states. We numerically simulate the nonlinear four-wave mixing interaction of topological valley kink states propagating along the interface between two valley photonic crystals. We theoretically clarify that the signal and idler photons generated from the four-wave mixing interaction are continuous frequency entangled. The numerical simulation results imply that the entangled biphoton states are robust against the sharp bends and scattering, giving clear evidence of topological protection of entangled photon pairs. Our proposal paves a concrete way to perform topological protection of entangled quantum states operating at telecommunication wavelengths.

TI Defect Polaritons from First Principles
SO ACS NANO
AB Control over the optical properties of defects in solid-state materials is necessary for their application in quantum technologies. In this study, we demonstrate, from first principles, how to tune these properties via the formation of defect polaritons in an optical cavity. We show that the polaritonic splitting that shifts the absorption energy of the lower polariton is much higher than can be expected from a Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We also find that the absorption intensity of the lower polariton increases by several orders of magnitude, suggesting a possible route toward overcoming phonon-limited single-photon emission from defect centers. These findings are a result of an effective continuum of electronic transitions near the lowest-lying electronic transition that dramatically enhances the strength of the light-matter interaction. We expect our findings to spur experimental investigations of strong light-matter coupling between defect centers and cavity photons for applications in quantum technologies.

TI Strongly confined atomic excitation localization in a weakly-driven
   atom-waveguide interface
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB An atomic array coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide forms a strongly coupled quantum interface, exhibiting various intriguing collective features of quantum dynamics. Here we consider a homogeneous atomic array and theoretically investigate its steady-state distribution when the incident fields drive the atoms from both sides at asymmetric angles. This effectively creates an interface shared by two zones of atoms under different driving angles. This setup introduces a competition between photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions and the directionality of coupling, while differences of the traveling phases from the incident angles further influence the overall steady-state behavior. Under this asymmetric driving scheme, the presence of strongly confined localization can be identified, where localization can occur either at the interface or at one of edges. Additionally, we examine the size effect on the atomic localization, deriving an empirical formula to predict parameter regimes that favor interfaced localization. We also consider a defect-driving scheme, where a third zone is created by undriven atoms under symmetric traveling phases. This results in strongly confined single-site excitation localization, which can be explained through analytical solutions under the reciprocal coupling. Finally, we propose several methods for precise control of multiple single-site localizations under the defect-driving scheme. Our results provide insights into driven-dissipative quantum systems with nonreciprocal couplings and pave the way for quantum simulation of exotic many-body states relevant to quantum information applications.

TI Rapid exchange cooling with trapped ions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is a leading candidate for advanced quantum information processing. In current QCCD implementations, imperfect ion transport and anomalous heating can excite ion motion during a calculation. To counteract this, intermediate cooling is necessary to maintain high-fidelity gate performance. Cooling the computational ions sympathetically with ions of another species, a commonly employed strategy, creates a significant runtime bottleneck. Here, we demonstrate a different approach we call exchange cooling. Unlike sympathetic cooling, exchange cooling does not require trapping two different atomic species. The protocol introduces a bank of "coolant" ions which are repeatedly laser cooled. A computational ion can then be cooled by transporting a coolant ion into its proximity. We test this concept experimentally with two 40Ca+ ions, executing the necessary transport in 107 mu s, an order of magnitude faster than typical sympathetic cooling durations. We remove over 96%, and as many as 102(5) quanta, of axial motional energy from the computational ion. We verify that re-cooling the coolant ion does not decohere the computational ion. This approach validates the feasibility of a single-species QCCD processor, capable of fast quantum simulation and computation.
   Trapped ion quantum systems based on sympathetic cooling use ions of different species. Here the authors demonstrate exchange cooling using two ions of the same species (40Ca+) by taking advantage of the exchange of energy when the ions are brought close together.

TI Homodyne quadrature laser interferometry for the characterization of
   low-frequency residual vibrational noise in cryogenic trapped-ion
   systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Cryogenic trapped-ion systems (CTISs) have emerged as indispensable platforms for the advancement of quantum computation and precision measurement techniques. However, the sensitivity of these systems to vibrational noise, especially during the compression and expansion cycles of the cold head in a Gifford-McMahon cycle refrigerator (GMCR), poses a significant challenge. To mitigate this, we have crafted an innovative methodology for characterizing low-frequency residual vibrational noise in closed-cycle cryogenic trapped- ion systems. Our methodology is underpinned by a compact homodyne quadrature laser interferometer (HQLI) vibrometer system that boasts nanometer-scale accuracy. This state-ofthe-art system leverages elliptic curve fitting to rectify nonlinear noise artifacts and applies an inverse tangent function to demodulation phase techniques, enabling accurate vibrational displacement measurements. Unlike the conventional approach, our scheme circumvents the introduction of extraneous vibrational noise associated with piezoelectric ceramic mirrors, which are conventionally employed to track target vibrations for locking the interference signal intensity in the reference arm. This innovation not only improves the overall CTIS performance but is also significantly applied to characterize the practical realization of quantum computation and precision measurement.

TI Leveraging quantum uncertainty: Quantum randomness through the lens of
   classical communication networks
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB The generation of random numbers and the study of its properties have been an elusive field for a fair portion of the century. The application of random numbers is employed in many use cases such as cryptography, neural networks, numerical simulation, and gambling. The performance of each of these use cases is profoundly impacted by the employed random numbers; henceforth, the quality of randomness is of critical importance when it comes to their usage. A poorly generated random number can make a security system vulnerable, or any numerical or statistical evaluation misleading. Although various modes of classical random number generators exist and still function to provide strong cryptographic properties, emergence of quantum mechanical randomness has shed light on a novel path of generating certified randomness which supersedes the classical counterpart in terms of security. Harnessing quantum mechanical phenomena enables generation of true random numbers which can be certified and further implemented to elevate the net quality of the specific use cases. In this work, we generate and analyze random numbers from three different sources - 50: 50 beam splitter (BS), quantum key distribution (QKD) setup with classical post-processing scheme, and a commercially available quantum random number generator (QRNG) (ID Quantique (IDQ)). The quality of the generated random numbers from the various sources is checked in statistical tests and compared. Further on, we have developed a system which implements the QRNG-based random numbers to facilitate message authentication code (MAC) and one time password (OTP) protocols, demonstrating a communication network application. In this manner we discuss about a network which integrates quantum mechanics to the current classical networking approaches to enhance certain aspects of the networking protocol - in this case, the

TI Evidence of the Quantum Optical Nature of High-Harmonic Generation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB High-harmonic generation is a light up-conversion process occurring in a strong laser field, leading to coherent bursts of extreme ultrashort broadband radiation [Lewenstein et al., Phys. Rev. A 49 , 2117 (1994)]. As a new perspective, we propose that ultrafast strong-field electronic or photonic processes such as high-harmonic generation can potentially generate nonclassical states of light well before the decoherence of the system occurs [Gorlach et al., Nat. Commun. 11 , 4598 (2020); Stammer et al ., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 123603 (2022)]. This could address fundamental challenges in quantum technology such as scalability, decoherence, or the generation of massively entangled states [Lewenstein et al., Luca Argenti Michael Chini, 27 (2024)]. Here, we report experimental evidence of the nonclassical nature of the harmonic emission in several semiconductors excited by a femtosecond infrared laser. By investigating single- and double-beam intensity cross-correlation [Loudon, Rep. Prog. Phys. 43 , 913 (1980)], we measure characteristic nonclassical features in the single-photon statistics. We observe two-mode squeezing in the generated harmonic radiation, which depends on the laser intensity that governs the transition from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics. The measured violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality realizes a direct test of multipartite entanglement in high-harmonic generation [Wasak, Phys. Rev. A 90 , 033616 (2014)]. This result is supported by the theory of multimodal detection and the Hamiltonian from which the effective squeezing modes of the harmonics can be derived [Gonoskov et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 125110 (2024); Christ et al. New J. Phys. 13 , 033027 (2011)]. With this work, we show experimentally that high-harmonic generation is a new quantum bosonic platform that intrinsically produces nonclassical states of light with unique features such as multipartite broadband entanglement or multimode squeezing. The source operates at room temperature, using standard semiconductors and a standard commercial fiber laser, opening up new routes for the quantum industry, such as optical quantum computing, communication, and imaging.

TI Numerical Optimization of a Nanophotonic Cavity by Machine Learning for
   Near-Unity Photon Indistinguishability at Room Temperature
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Room-temperature (RT), on-chip deterministic generation of indistinguishable photons coupled to photonic integrated circuits is key for quantum photonic applications. Nevertheless, high indistinguishability (I) at RT is difficult to obtain due to the intrinsic dephasing of most deterministic single-photon sources (SPS). Here, we present a numerical demonstration of the design and optimization of a hybrid slot-Bragg nanophotonic cavity that achieves a theoretical near-unity I and a high coupling efficiency (beta) at RT for a variety of single-photon emitters. Our numerical simulations predict modal volumes in the order of 10(-3)(lambda/2n)(3), allowing for strong coupling of quantum photonic emitters that can be heterogeneously integrated. We show that high I and beta should be possible by fine-tuning the quality factor (Q) depending on the intrinsic properties of the single-photon emitter. Furthermore, we perform a machine learning optimization based on the combination of a deep neural network and a genetic algorithm (GA) to further decrease the modal volume by almost 3 times while relaxing the tight dimensions of the slot width required for strong coupling. The optimized device has a slot width of 20 nm. The design requires fabrication resolution in the limit of the current state-of-the-art technology. Also, the condition for high I and beta requires a positioning accuracy of the quantum emitter at the nanometer level. Although the proposal is not a scalable technology, it can be suitable for experimental demonstration of single-photon operation.

TI Quantum microscopy of cells at the Heisenberg limit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to a two-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward the bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.
   The authors present a method for super-resolution quantum microscopy at the Heisenberg limit by using pairs of entangled photons with balanced pathlengths. They improve the spatial resolution, imaging speed, and contrast-to-noise ratio in practice while providing a theoretical interpretation of the super-resolution feature.

TI Detection of Long-Lived Complexes in Ultracold Atom-Molecule Collisions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A thorough understanding of molecular scattering in the ultralow temperature regime is crucial for realizing long coherence times and enabling tunable interactions in molecular gases, systems which offer many opportunities in quantum simulation, quantum information, and precision measurement. Of particular importance is the nature of the long-lived intermediate complexes which may be formed in ultracold molecular collisions, as such complexes can dramatically affect the stability of molecular gases, even when exothermic reaction channels are not present. Here, we investigate collisional loss in an ultracold mixture of 40K87Rb molecules and 87Rb atoms, where chemical reactions between the two species are energetically forbidden. Through direct detection of the KRb2* intermediate complexes formed from atom-molecule collisions, we show that a 1064 nm laser source used for optical trapping of the sample can efficiently deplete the complex population via photoexcitation, an effect which can explain the strong twobody loss observed in the mixture. By monitoring the time evolution of the KRb2* population after a sudden reduction in the 1064 nm laser intensity, we measure the lifetime of the complex [0.39(6) ms], as well as the photoexcitation rate for 1064 nm light [0.50(3) mu s(-1) (kW=cm(2))(-1)]. The observed lifetime, which is similar to 10(5) times longer than recent estimates based on the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus statistical theory, calls for new theoretical insight to explain its origin.

TI Decentralized energy trading in smart grid using secured post quantum
   encryption
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB With the shifting from traditional grids to smart grids, there is an immense shift towards decentralized energy trading wherein "prosumers" can enter peer-to-peer transactions. This model decreases dependence on centralized utilities and maximizes efficient, flexible, and resilient energy distribution. It enhances transparency and trust by automating and securing trades via smart contracts. No intermediaries are required; hence transaction costs are low. However, an attack that would breach the security guarantees of blockchain systems-by tremendous quantum computers-might break a few of the older cryptographic methods or even reveal very significant portions of their keys. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralized framework for energy trading in smart grids, with a strong emphasis on post-quantum cryptography to safeguard transactions against quantum threats. We explore post-quantum cryptographic techniques, particularly lattice-based algorithms due to its compact signature sizes and strong security capability for the future-proof blockchain enabled smart grids. The proposed system model ensures secure and decentralized energy trading while incorporating off-chain signature validation to enhance computational efficiency. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on market structure or consensus protocols, this work introduces a quantum-resilient architecture with an off-chain transaction validation mechanism, enabling high-throughput trading secured against future cryptographic vulnerabilities. The novel feature of the proposed model is the integration of off-chain post-quantum cryptographic verification into a blockchain energy trading architecture that is practically deployable on embedded hardware. Compared to existing solutions, the proposed method ensures quantum-resilient authentication while reducing gas costs by 40% and improving computational efficiency achieving a signing time of 0.327 ms and verification time of 0.127 ms. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward future-proofing blockchainenabled smart grids while maintaining performance, transparency, and resilience. The outcome of this research work presents a quantum-safe solution that strengthens the resilience of smart grid operations and ensures the security of decentralized energy trading.

TI Ordered and tunable Majorana-zero-mode lattice in naturally strained
   LiFeAs
SO NATURE
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) obey non-Abelian statistics and are considered building blocks for constructing topological qubits(1,2). Iron-based superconductors with topological bandstructures have emerged as promising hosting materials, because isolated candidate MZMs in the quantum limit have been observed inside the topological vortex cores(3-9). However, these materials suffer from issues related to alloying induced disorder, uncontrolled vortex lattices(10-)(13) and a low yield of topological vortices(5-8). Here we report the formation of an ordered and tunable MZM lattice in naturally strained stoichiometric LiFeAs by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe biaxial charge density wave (CDW) stripes along the Fe-Fe and As-As directions in the strained regions. The vortices are pinned on the CDW stripes in the As-As direction and form an ordered lattice. We detect that more than 90 per cent of the vortices are topological and possess the characteristics of isolated MZMs at the vortex centre, forming an ordered MZM lattice with the density and the geometry tunable by an external magnetic field. Notably, with decreasing the spacing of neighbouring vortices, the MZMs start to couple with each other. Our findings provide a pathway towards tunable and ordered MZM lattices as a platform for future topological quantum computation.

TI Anyons in quantum Hall interferometry
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum Hall systems represent an example of topological quantum matter, where quasiparticles with fractional statistics (anyons) may emerge. This Technical Review presents a survey of recent developments in quantum Hall interferometry.
   The quantum Hall (QH) effect represents a unique playground where quantum coherence of electrons can be exploited for various applications, from metrology to quantum computation. In the fractional regime, it also hosts anyons, emergent quasiparticles that are neither bosons nor fermions and possess fractional statistics. Their detection and manipulation represent key milestones in view of topologically protected quantum computation schemes. Exploiting the high degree of phase coherence, edge states in the QH regime have been investigated by designing and constructing electronic interferometers, able to reveal the coherence and statistical properties of the interfering constituents. Here, we review the two main geometries developed in the QH regime, the Mach-Zehnder and the Fabry-Perot interferometers. We present their basic working principles, fabrication methods and the main results obtained in both the integer and the fractional QH regimes. We will also show how recent technological advances led to the direct experimental demonstration of fractional statistics for Laughlin quasiparticles in a Fabry-Perot interferometric setup.

TI Coherent Beam Splitting of Flying Electrons Driven by a Surface Acoustic
   Wave
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We develop a coherent beam splitter for single electrons driven through two tunnel-coupled quantum wires by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The output current through each wire oscillates with gate voltages to tune the tunnel coupling and potential difference between the wires. This oscillation is assigned to coherent electron tunneling motion that can be used to encode a flying qubit and is well reproduced by numerical calculations of time evolution of the SAW-driven single electrons. The oscillation visibility is currently limited to about 3%, but robust against decoherence, indicating that the SAW electron can serve as a novel platform for a solid-state flying qubit.

   synchronization

We compare system performance when the pilot tone is generated either electrically or optically, examining the effects of key parameters such as pilot tone power, laser linewidth, digital-to-analog converter resolution, and link distance. The results provide insights into pilot tone generation strategies that enhance robustness while reducing the implementation complexity of GM CV-QKD systems.

TI Impact of polarization mode dispersion on entangled photon distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber-optic lines.

TI Predicting Phonon-Induced Spin Decoherence from First Principles:
   Colossal Spin Renormalization in Condensed Matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Developing a microscopic understanding of spin decoherence is essential to advancing quantum technologies. Electron spin decoherence due to atomic vibrations (phonons) plays a special role as it sets an intrinsic limit to the performance of spin-based quantum devices. Two main sources of phonon-induced spin decoherence-the Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel mechanisms-have distinct physical origins and theoretical treatments. Here, we show calculations that unify their modeling and enable accurate predictions of spin relaxation and precession in semiconductors. We compute the phonon-dressed vertex of the spin-spin correlation function with a treatment analogous to the calculation of the anomalous electron magnetic moment in QED. We find that the vertex correction provides a giant renormalization of the electron spin dynamics in solids, greater by many orders of magnitude than the corresponding correction from photons in vacuum. Our Letter demonstrates a general approach for quantitative analysis of spin decoherence in materials, advancing the quest for spin-based quantum technologies.

TI Tuning atom-field interaction via phase shaping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A coherent electromagnetic field can be described by its amplitude, frequency, and phase. All these properties can influence the interaction between the field and an atom. Here we demonstrate the phase shaping of microwaves that are scattered by a superconducting artificial atom coupled to the end of a semi -infinite onedimensional transmission line. In particular, we input a weak exponentially rising pulse with phase modulation to a transmon qubit. We observe that atom -field interaction can be tuned from a nearly full interaction (interaction efficiency, i.e., amount of the field energy interacting with the atom, of 94.5 %) to effectively no interaction (interaction efficiency of 3.5 %).

TI How smooth is quantum complexity?
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The "quantum complexity" of a unitary operator measures the difficulty of its construction from a set of elementary quantum gates. While the notion of quantum complexity was first introduced as a quantum generalization of the classical computational complexity, it has since been argued to hold a fundamental significance in its own right, as a physical quantity analogous to the thermodynamic entropy. In this paper, we present a unified perspective on various notions of quantum complexity, viewed as functions on the space of unitary operators. One striking feature of these functions is that they can exhibit non-smooth and even fractal behaviour. We use ideas from Diophantine approximation theory and sub-Riemannian geometry to rigorously quantify this lack of smoothness. Implications for the physical meaning of quantum complexity are discussed.

TI Angle-Dependent Magic Optical Trap for the 6S1/2 ⇆
   nP3/2 Rydberg Transition of Cesium Atoms
SO PHOTONICS
AB The existence of an anisotropic tensor part of atomic states with an angular momentum greater than 1/2 causes their dynamic polarizabilities to be very sensitive to the polarization direction of the laser field. Therefore, the magic wavelength of the transition between two atomic states also depends on the polarization angle between the quantized axis and the polarization vector. We perform a calculation of the magic conditions of the 6S(1/2) <-> nP(3/2) (n = 50-90) Rydberg transition of cesium atoms by introducing an auxiliary electric diople transition connected to the target Rydberg state and a low-excited state. The magic condition is determined by the intersection of dynamic polarizabilities of the 6S(1/2) ground state and the nP(3/2) Rydberg state. The dynamic polarizability is calculated by using the sum-over-states method. Furthermore, we analyze the dependence of magic detuning on the polarization angle for a linearly polarized trapping laser and establish the relationship between magic detuning and a principal quantum number of the Rydberg state at the magic angle. The magic optical dipole trap can confine the ground-state and Rydberg-state atoms simultaneously, and the differential light shift in the 6S(1/2) <-> nP(3/2) transition can be canceled under the magic condition. It is of great significance for the application of long-lifetime high-repetition-rate accurate manipulation of Rydberg atoms on high-fidelity entanglement and quantum logic gate operation.

TI Observation of topological superconductivity in a stoichiometric
   transition metal dichalcogenide 2M-WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological superconductors (TSCs) are unconventional superconductors with bulk superconducting gap and in-gap Majorana states on the boundary that may be used as topological qubits for quantum computation. Despite their importance in both fundamental research and applications, natural TSCs are very rare. Here, combining state of the art synchrotron and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we investigated a stoichiometric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), 2M-WS2 with a superconducting transition temperature of 8.8K (the highest among all TMDs in the natural form up to date) and observed distinctive topological surface states (TSSs). Furthermore, in the superconducting state, we found that the TSSs acquired a nodeless superconducting gap with similar magnitude as that of the bulk states. These discoveries not only evidence 2M-WS2 as an intrinsic TSC without the need of sensitive composition tuning or sophisticated heterostructures fabrication, but also provide an ideal platform for device applications thanks to its van der Waals layered structure. Topological superconductors are potentially important for future quantum computation, but they are very rare in nature. Here, the authors observe topological surface states acquiring a nodeless superconducting gap with similar magnitude as that of the bulk states in 2M-WS2, suggesting an intrinsic topological superconductor.

TI A DIGITAL SIGNATURE SCHEME BASED ON THE VECTOR SPACE FACTORIZATION
   PROBLEM AND THE MPC-IN-THE-HEAD PARADIGM
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB At a time when post-quantum cryptography is more and more present in the cryptographic landscape, it is of great interest to find new hard problems on which we can rely. Here, we present a new problem, the vector space factorization problem, and use it to build a signature scheme. The idea of factorizing subspaces of a finite field is used in rank metric codes, most notably in the decoding of LRPCs. In this context, one of the subspaces is known to factorize. Factorizing without the knowledge of both subspaces appears in the signature scheme Murave, in which the rank support basis decomposition problem is introduced from a coding theory in rank metric point of view. In Bro's thesis, the SquareSpace problem is introduced, where one wants to find the "square root" of a subspace. We generalize here this problem into the vector space factorization problem, which is the same as the rank support basis decomposition problem introduced in Murave, the difference being we do not look at it from a coding theory point of view, but really from a vector subspace one. We use it here to build a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. The scheme uses the MPCitH paradigm, and especially the TCitH framework, which is an efficient way to build ZK proofs. We study the difficulty of solving the vector space factorization problem by detailing the combinatorial attacks on the problem, analyzing their complexity, and describing an algebraic model to solve the problem. We then explain the MPC protocol used to build the signature scheme. Finally, this construction allows us to obtain sizes of signature of 8.9 to 10.9 kB for the first security level defined by NIST, which is reasonable as MPC-in-the-Head signatures typically range from 2.5 kB for an MQ instance to 14 kB for lattice-based instances.

TI Defect bulk-boundary correspondence of topological skyrmion phases of
   matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Unpaired Majorana zero modes are central to topological quantum computation schemes as building blocks of topological qubits, and are therefore under intense experimental and theoretical investigation. Their gener-alizations to parafermions and Fibonacci anyons are also of great interest, in particular for universal quantum computation schemes. In this work, we find a different generalization of Majorana zero modes in effectively noninteracting systems, which are zero-energy bound states that exhibit a cross structure (two straight, perpen-dicular lines in the complex plane) composed of the complex number entries of the zero-mode wave function on a lattice, rather than a single straight line formed by complex number entries of the wave function on a lattice as in the case of an unpaired Majorana zero mode. These "cross" zero modes are realized for topological skyrmion phases under certain open boundary conditions when their characteristic momentum-space spin textures trap topological defects. They therefore serve as a second type of bulk-boundary correspondence for the topological skyrmion phases. In the process of characterizing this defect bulk-boundary correspondence, we develop recipes for constructing physically relevant model Hamiltonians for topological skyrmion phases, efficient methods for computing the skyrmion number, and introduce three-dimensional topological skyrmion phases into the literature.

TI Polarizer-free measurement of the full Stokes vector using a
   fiber-coupled superconducting nanowire single photon detector with a
   polarization extinction ratio of ∼2
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The characterization and manipulation of polarization state at single photon level are of great importance in research fields such as quantum information processing and quantum key distribution, where photons are normally delivered using single mode optical fibers. To date, the demonstrated polarimetry measurement techniques based on a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) require the SNSPD to be either highly sensitive or highly insensitive to the photon's polarization state, therefore placing an unavoidable challenge on the SNSPD's design and fabrication processes. In this article, we present the development of an alternative polarimetry measurement technique, of which the stringent requirement on the SNSPD's polarization sensitivity is removed. We validate the proposed technique by a rigorous theoretical analysis and comparisons of the experimental results obtained using a fiber-coupled SNSPD with a polarization extinction ratio of similar to 2 to that obtained using other well-established known methods. Based on the full Stokes data measured by the proposed technique, we also demonstrate that at the single photon level (similar to -100 dBm), the polarization state of the photon delivered to the superconducting nanowire facet plane can be controlled at will using a further developed algorithm. Note that other than the fiber-coupled SNSPD, the only component involved is a quarter-wave plate (no external polarizer is necessary), which when aligned well has a paid insertion loss less than 0.5 dB.

TI Quantum circuit engineering for correcting coherent noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Crosstalk and several forms of coherent noise are invisible when a qubit or a gate is calibrated or benchmarked in isolation. These are unlocked during the execution of a full quantum circuit applying entangling gates to several qubits simultaneously. Unitary crosstalk noise, such as an unwanted Z-Z coupling, limits the state fidelity during the execution of cross-resonance controlled-NOT (cNoT) gates in superconductor quantum computers. This work presents (1) a method of tracing coherent errors by exploiting their sensitivity to the arrangement of CNOT gates in the circuit and (2) a correction scheme that modifithe es original circuit by inserting carefully the chosen compensating gates (single- or two-qubit) to possibly undo coherent errors. On two vastly different types of IBMQ processors offering quantum volume 8 to 32, our experimental results show up to 25% reduction in the infidelity of [[7, 1, 3]] code vertical bar+) state (Clifford circuits) and five- to 15-qubit W states (non-Clifford circuits). Our experimental circuits aggressively deploy forced commutation of CNOT gates to obtain low-noise state-preparation circuits. An encoded state initialized with fewer errors marks an important step towards successful demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI SIKE on GPU: Accelerating Supersingular Isogeny-Based Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism on Graphic Processing Units
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Since the introduction of the Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol by Jao and de Feo in 2011, it and its variation (SIKE) have gained significant attention as a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Until now, even though several implementations of the state-of-the-art SIKE mechanism were presented on CPUs and embedded MCUs, there was no consideration of implementing SIKE on parallel graphic processing units (GPUs). With the advent of the IoT era, a number of IT devices will communicate with application servers. Thus, developing efficient instance of SIKE on server sides is also important. GPUs have been considered as a promising candidate for a cryptographic accelerator. In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) mechanism on GPUs. Even though SIKE has fascinating advantages of much smaller key and ciphertext sizes compared with other NIST PQC candidates, its computational overhead is extremely high. Until now, a large amount of research has been conducted for enhancing the performance of SIKE with respect to software on typical CPU and embedded MCUs and hardware optimization on ASIC and FPGA. However, generic software optimization utilizing GPUs has not been considered yet. We target the GPU implementation of SIKEp503 security parameters which provides the security level 2 (At least as difficult to break as SHA256). For efficiency, we optimize the underlying field arithmetic, especially field multiplication and reduction over p503 = 2(250)3(159) - 1 and take full advantage of the properties of GPU architecture including memory hierarchy. The proposed GPU software based on RTX2080Ti provides around 36376.61 KeyGens/s, 25603.72 Encaps/s, and 22211.61 Decaps/s. These are about 140.64, 157.66, and 146.81 times of improvements to the SIKE CPU Software on Intel i9-10900K CPU, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first efficient implementation of SIKE software on GPU side.

AB One of the key metrics used for defying the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is data integrity, which mostly relies on the use of cryptographic hash functions. In the last years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced SHA-3 as the new standard for better security. SHA-3 is also exploited in most of the current post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) protocols. Nevertheless, the used algorithm, i.e. Keccak, is computationally heavy and consequently limits its utilization in RISC-V-based Systems on Chip (SoC). In this work, a Keccak accelerator is proposed to speed up SHA3 computations for the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm on the RISCV-based advanced microcontroller PULPissimo. Compared to the plain SW implementation on RISC-V, our results show a speedup factor of up to 2.79 at the expense of a 12.4% resources overhead.

TI DiLizium: A Two-Party Lattice-Based Signature Scheme
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we propose DiLizium: a new lattice-based two-party signature scheme. Our scheme is constructed from a variant of the Crystals-Dilithium post-quantum signature scheme. This allows for more efficient two-party implementation compared with the original but still derives its post-quantum security directly from the Module Learning With Errors and Module Short Integer Solution problems. We discuss our design rationale, describe the protocol in full detail, and provide performance estimates and a comparison with previous schemes. We also provide a security proof for the two-party signature computation protocol against a classical adversary. Extending this proof to a quantum adversary is subject to future studies. However, our scheme is secure against a quantum attacker who has access to just the public key and not the two-party signature creation protocol.

AB We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of integrated electro-optic (EO) phase shifters based on racetrack microresonators on a 3C silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform working at near-infrared wavelengths. By applying DC voltage in the crystalline axis perpendicular to the waveguide plane, we have observed optical phase shifts from the racetrack microresonators whose loaded quality (Q) factors are similar to 30,000. We show voltage-length product (V-pi center dot L-pi) of 118 V.cm, which corresponds to an EO coefficient r(41) of 2.6 pm/V. The SiCOI platform can be used to realize tunable silicon carbide integrated photonic devices that are desirable for applications in nonlinear and quantum photonics over a wide bandwidth that covers visible and infrared wavelengths.

TI Through thick and thin: how optical cavities control spin
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB When light interacts with matter by means of scattering and absorption, we observe the resulting color. Light also probes the symmetry of matter and the result is encoded in its polarization. In the special case of circularly-polarized light, which is especially relevant in nonlinear optics, quantum photonics, and physical chemistry, a critical dimension of symmetry is along the longitudinal direction. We examine recent advances in controlling circularly-polarized light and reveal that the commonality in these advances is in judicious control of longitudinal symmetry. In particular, in the use of high quality-factor modes in dielectric metasurfaces, the finite thickness can be used to tune the modal profile. These symmetry considerations can be applied in multiplexed optical communication schemes, deterministic control of quantum emitters, and sensitive detection of the asymmetry of small molecules.

TI IoT-Enabled Secure and Scalable Cloud Architecture for Multi-User
   Systems: A Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptographic and Blockchain-Based
   Approach Toward a Trustworthy Cloud Computing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Cloud computing has revolutionized organizational operations by providing convenient, on-demand access to resources. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a new paradigm for collaborative computing, leveraging sensors and devices that generate and process vast amounts of data, thereby resulting in challenges related to scalability and security, making the significance of conventional security methods even more pronounced. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel Scalable and Secure Cloud Architecture (SSCA) that integrates IoT and cryptographic techniques, aiming to develop scalable and trustworthy cloud systems, thus enabling multi-user systems and facilitating simultaneous access to cloud resources by multiple users. The design adopts a decentralized approach, utilizing multiple cloud nodes to handle user requests efficiently and incorporates Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user information, utilizing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines MBRA, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and blockchain technology. Leveraging IoT devices, the architecture gathers data from distributed sensing resources and ensures the security of collected information through robust MBRA-PQC encryption algorithms, while the blockchain ensures that the confidential data is stored in distributed and immutable records. The proposed approach is applied to several datasets and the effectiveness is validated through various performance metrics, including response time, throughput, scalability, security, and reliability. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed SSCA, showcasing a notable reduction in response time by 1.67 seconds and 0.97 seconds for 250 and 1000 devices, respectively, in comparison to the MHE-IS-CPMT. Likewise, SSCA demonstrated significant improvements in the AUC values, exhibiting enhancements of 6.30%, 6.90%, 7.60%, and 7.30% at the 25-user level, and impressive gains of 5.20%, 9.30%, 11.50%, and 15.40% at the 50-user level when compared to the MHE-IS-CPMT, EAM, SCSS, and SHCEF models, respectively.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic quantum technology is essentially based on the exchange of individual photons as information carriers. Therefore, the development of practical single-photon sources that emit single photons on-demand is a crucial contribution to advance this emerging technology and to promote its first real-world applications. In the last two decades, a large number of quantum light sources based on solid-state emitters have been developed on a laboratory scale. Corresponding structures today have almost ideal optical and quantum-optical properties. For practical applications, however, one crucial factor is usually missing, namely direct on-chip fiber coupling, which is essential, for example, for the direct integration of such quantum devices into fiber-based quantum networks. In fact, the development of fiber-coupled quantum light sources is still in its infancy, with very promising advances having been made in recent years. Against this background, this review article presents the current status of the development of fiber-coupled quantum light sources based on solid-state quantum emitters and discusses challenges, technological solutions and future prospects. Among other things, the numerical optimization of the fiber coupling efficiency, coupling methods, and important realizations of such quantum devices are presented and compared. Overall, this article provides an important overview of the state-of-the-art and the performance parameters of fiber-coupled quantum light sources that have been achieved so far. It is aimed equally at experts in the scientific field and at students and newcomers who want to get an overview of the current developments.

TI Hybrid quantum nanophotonic devices with color centers in nanodiamonds
   [Invited]
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Optically active color centers in nanodiamonds offer unique opportunities for generating and manipulating quantum states of light. These mechanically, chemically, and optically robust emitters can be produced in mass quantities, deterministically manipulated, and integrated with a variety of quantum device geometries and photonic material platforms. Nanodiamonds with deeply sub-wavelength sizes coupled to nanophotonic structures feature a giant enhancement of light-matter interaction, promising high bitrates in quantum photonic systems. We review the recent advances in controlled techniques for synthesizing, selecting, and manipulating nanodiamond-based color centers for their integration with quantum nanophotonic devices.

TI Local Pairing of Feynman Histories in Many-Body Floquet Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We study many-body quantum dynamics using Floquet quantum circuits in one space dimension as simple examples of systems with local interactions that support ergodic phases. Physical properties can be expressed in terms of multiple sums over Feynman histories, which for these models are paths or manybody orbits in Fock space. A natural simplification of such sums is the diagonal approximation, where the only terms that are retained are ones in which each path is paired with a partner that carries the complex conjugate weight. We identify the regime in which the diagonal approximation holds and the nature of the leading corrections to it. We focus on the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) and of matrix elements of local operators, averaged over an ensemble of random circuits, making comparisons with the predictions of random matrix theory (RMT) and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). We show that properties are dominated at long times by contributions to orbit sums in which each orbit is paired locally with a conjugate, as in the diagonal approximation, but that in large systems these contributions consist of many spatial domains, with distinct local pairings in neighboring domains. The existence of these domains is reflected in deviations of the SFF from RMT predictions, and of matrix element correlations from ETH predictions; deviations of both kinds diverge with system size. We demonstrate that our physical picture of orbit-pairing domains has a precise correspondence in the spectral properties of a transfer matrix that acts in the space direction to generate the ensemble-averaged SFF. In addition, we find that domains of a second type control non-Gaussian fluctuations of the SFF. These domains are separated by walls that are related to the entanglement membrane, known to characterize the scrambling of quantum information.

TI Non-perturbative cathodoluminescence microscopy of beam-sensitive
   materials
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Cathodoluminescence microscopy is now a well-established and powerful tool for probing the photonic properties of nanoscale materials, but in many cases, nanophotonic materials are easily damaged by the electron-beam doses necessary to achieve reasonable cathodoluminescence signal-to-noise ratios. Two-dimensional materials have proven particularly susceptible to beam-induced modifications, yielding both obstacles to high spatial-resolution measurement and opportunities for beam-induced patterning of quantum photonic systems. Here pan-sharpening techniques are applied to cathodoluminescence microscopy in order to address these challenges and experimentally demonstrate the promise of pan-sharpening for minimally-perturbative high-spatial-resolution spectrum imaging of beam-sensitive materials.

TI AlGaAs-on-insulator waveguide for highly efficient photon-pair
   generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB We report on the generation of correlated photon pairs in AIGaAs-on-insulator (AIGaAs-OI) waveguides through nonlinear spontaneous four-wave-mixing (SFWM). Our measurements reveal an SFWM pair generation efficiency of similar to 0.096 x 10(12) pairs/(sW(2)) at a wavelength of 1550 nm. This is one of the highest efficiencies achieved to date for integrated SFWM sources. A maximal coincidence-to-accidental ratio of similar to 122 is measured. A spectral characterization of the device's pair emission at the quantum level demonstrates a broad generation bandwidth of 2.0 THz, which is important for frequency multiplexing applications. Our results indicate that AlGaAs-OI is an efficient material platform for integrated quantum photonics at telecom wavelengths.

TI Detecting Multipartite Entanglement Patterns Using Single-Particle
   Green's Functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a protocol for detecting multipartite entanglement in itinerant many-body electronic systems using single-particle Green's functions. To achieve this, we first establish a connection between the quantum Fisher information and single-particle Green's functions by constructing a set of witness operators built out of single electron creation and destruction operators in a doubled system. This set of witness operators is indexed by a momentum k. We compute the quantum Fisher information for these witness operators and show that for thermal ensembles it can be expressed as an autoconvolution of the single- particle spectral function. We then apply our framework to a one-dimensional fermionic system to showcase its effectiveness in detecting entanglement in itinerant electron models. We observe that the detected entanglement level is sensitive to the wave vector associated with witness operator. Our protocol will permit detecting entanglement in many-body systems using scanning tunneling microscopy and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy, two spectroscopies that measure the single-particle Green's function. It offers the prospect of the experimental detection of entanglement through spectroscopies beyond the established route of measuring the dynamical spin response.

TI Controlling Single-Photon Emission with Ultrathin Transdimensional
   Plasmonic Films
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The properties of a two-level quantum dipole emitter near an ultrathin transdimensional plasmonic film are studied theoretically. The model system studied mimics a solid-state single-photon source device. Using realistic experimental parameters, the spontaneous and stimulated emission intensity profiles are computed as functions of the excitation frequency and film thickness, followed by the analysis of the second-order photon correlations to explore the photon antibunching effect. It is shown that ultrathin transdimensional plasmonic films can greatly improve photon antibunching with thickness reduction, which allows one to control the quantum properties of light and make them more pronounced. Knowledge of these features is advantageous for solid-state single-photon source device engineering and overall for the development of the new integrated quantum photonics material platform based on the transdimensional plasmonic films.

TI Teleportation-based noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states
   of light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose and theoretically analyze a teleportation-based scheme for the high-fidelity noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states of light. In our approach, the probabilistic noiseless quantum amplification operation is encoded into a suitable auxiliary two-mode entangled state and then applied to the input coherent state via continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The scheme requires conditioning on the outcomes of homodyne measurements in the teleportation protocol. In contrast to high-fidelity noiseless quantum amplifiers based on combination of conditional single-photon addition and subtraction, the present scheme requires only photon subtraction in combination with auxiliary Gaussian squeezed vacuum states. We first provide a pure-state description of the protocol which allows us to to clearly explain its principles and functioning. Next we develop a more comprehensive model based on phase-space representation of quantum states, that accounts for various experimental imperfections such as excess noise in the auxiliary squeezed states or limited efficiency of the single-photon detectors that can only distinguish the presence or absence of photons. We present and analyze predictions of this phase-space model of the noiseless teleamplifier. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI A Study of Spin 1 Unruh-De Witt Detectors
SO UNIVERSE
AB A study of the interaction of spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors with a relativistic scalar quantum field is presented here. After tracing out the field modes, the resulting density matrix for a bipartite qutrit system is employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Unlike the case of spin 1/2, for which the effects of the quantum field result in a decrease in the size of violation, in the case of spin 1, both a decrease or an increase in the size of the violation may occur. This effect is ascribed to the fact that Tsirelson's bound is not saturated in the case of qutrits.

TI Fabrication of Diamond NV Centers Quantum Sensors and Their Applications
   in Power Systems (Invited)
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Quantum information technology (QIT), a key frontier field emphasized in China's "14th Five-Year Plan" and the 2035 long-term development goals, serves as a core driver for leading the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. Its in-depth development is of great significance for enhancing national technological competitiveness, promoting innovation-driven development, and breaking through bottlenecks in traditional information technologies. As a critical material foundation for quantum devices, diamond stands out among numerous quantum materials due to its exceptional optical, mechanical, and electronic properties. It is one of the few materials capable of achieving stable manipulation of quantum states at room temperature, thus playing an irreplaceable role in the construction of high-performance quantum information processing systems. Notably, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond-a point defect formed by a nitrogen atom and an adjacent lattice vacancy-exhibits extraordinary magnetic sensitivity at room temperature. This unique characteristic stems from its ability to realize precise manipulation of quantum states through laser polarization and microwave regulation, enabling high-precision measurement of weak magnetic fields even in complex environments. This endows it with broad application prospects in biomedicine, geological exploration, and industrial detection. In power systems, traditional magnetometers based on the principle of electromagnetic induction have long faced inherent limitations. For instance, they struggle to balance high precision and a wide measurement range, suffer from significant temperature drift during long-term operation, and are difficult to miniaturize for integration into smart grid sensor networks. These drawbacks severely hinder the advancement of intelligent monitoring of power grids, especially in scenarios such as high-precision DC current measurement and real-time status monitoring of power equipment. Against this backdrop, research on quantum magnetometers based on diamond NV color centers holds substantial scientific value and practical significance. It not only offers a novel technical pathway to overcome the bottlenecks of existing measurement technologies but also promotes the development of intelligent, integrated, and low-power-consumption measurement equipment. Furthermore, in-depth exploration of NV color center technology advances the practical application of quantum sensing, bridges the gap between fundamental quantum research and engineering applications, and lays a solid foundation for the innovative development of QIT in engineering fields such as energy, aerospace, and intelligent manufacturing.<br /> Progress This study first introduces the basic structure of NV centers and the principles of magnetic measurement (Fig. 1), with a particular focus on the continuous wave optical detection of magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) method. It then details the fabrication processes of NV center diamonds, including high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis (Fig. 4) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods (Fig. 5), as well as subsequent processing steps. The advantages of ensemble diamond parameters are also discussed. Subsequently, the framework of the quantum magnetometer system is elaborated (Fig. 7), and the integration and development of quantum magnetometers are reviewed (Fig. 10).
   The current fabrication methods of diamond quantum magnetometers are summarized, highlighting the overall trends toward system integration, probe miniaturization, high sensitivity, and low power consumption. In the latter part of the paper, the current status of current sensors is detailed (Table 4). Traditional current transformers face certain limitations in achieving high-precision measurement, a wide dynamic range, and miniaturization of measurement probes, which significantly constrain the progress of smart grid research. To address these challenges, the application of quantum current transformers (QCTs) based on NV centers (Fig. 11) is introduced, and their use in power grid current transformers is explored, offering a novel solution for current monitoring. This study also compares different QCTs (Table 5) and further demonstrates the multifaceted application potential of diamond NV center quantum devices. Finally, the existing challenges of NV center magnetometers are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.<br /> Conclusions and Prospects Research on diamond NV center-based quantum magnetometers has made steady progress. The room-temperature quantum manipulation capability, high magnetic sensitivity, and relative stability in complex environments of these magnetometers have alleviated some of the limitations of traditional magnetometers and laid the foundation for high-precision magnetic field measurements-especially in power system monitoring. However, current challenges remain, including the high cost of high-quality diamond fabrication, difficulties in system miniaturization, and the need to improve measurement accuracy and noise suppression. Future efforts should focus on optimizing diamond growth and post-processing techniques to reduce costs and enhance the performance of NV ensembles, advancing system integration to improve portability and noise suppression capabilities, and exploring multi-physical-parameter sensing to expand application scenarios. These measures will facilitate the practical application of NV center technology in the field of quantum sensing.

TI A Kind of (t, n) Threshold Quantum Secret Sharing with
   Identity Authentication
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is an important branch of quantum cryptography. Identity authentication is a significant means to achieve information protection, which can effectively confirm the identity information of both communication parties. Due to the importance of information security, more and more communications require identity authentication. We propose a d-level (t,n) threshold QSS scheme in which both sides of the communication use mutually unbiased bases for mutual identity authentication. In the secret recovery phase, the sharing of secrets that only the participant holds will not be disclosed or transmitted. Therefore, external eavesdroppers will not get any information about secrets at this phase. This protocol is more secure, effective, and practical. Security analysis shows that this scheme can effectively resist intercept-resend attacks, entangle-measure attacks, collusion attacks, and forgery attacks.

TI Hybrid dual attack on LWE with arbitrary secrets
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB In this paper, we study the hybrid dual attack over learning with errors (LWE) problems for any secret distribution. Prior to our work, hybrid attacks are only considered for sparse and/or small secrets. A new and interesting result from our analysis shows that for most cryptographic use cases a hybrid dual attack outperforms a standalone dual attack, regardless of the secret distribution. We formulate our results into a framework of predicting the performance of the hybrid dual attacks. We also present a few tricks that further improve our attack. To illustrate the effectiveness of our result, we re-evaluate the security of all LWE related proposals in round 3 of NIST's post-quantum cryptography process, and improve the state-of-the-art cryptanalysis results by 2-15 bits, under the BKZ-core-SVP model.

TI Aluminum nitride integration on silicon nitride photonic circuits: a
   hybrid approach towards on-chip nonlinear optics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Aluminum nitride (AlN) is an emerging material for integrated quantum photonics due to its large chi((2)) nonlinearity. Here we demonstrate the hybrid integration of AlN on silicon nitride (SiN) photonic chips. Composite microrings are fabricated by reactive DC sputtering of caxis oriented AlN on top of pre-patterned SiN. This new approach does not require any patterning of AlN and depends only on reliable SiN nanofabrication. This simplifies the nanofabrication process drastically. Optical characteristics, such as the quality factor, propagation losses and group index, are obtained. Our hybrid resonators can have a one order of magnitude increase in quality factor after the AlN integration, with propagation losses down to 0.7 dB/cm. Using finite-clement simulations, phase matching in these waveguides is explored. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Two (w, ω, n) weighted threshold quantum secret sharing schemes
   on d-level single quantum systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum secret sharing occupies an important position in quantum cryptography. In this paper, we propose two (w,omega,n) weighted threshold quantum secret sharing schemes on d-level single quantum systems that share classical information and quantum states, respectively. The dealer Alice distributes the secret share to each participant using the Chinese Remainder Theorem(CRT) for a polynomial ring, which can realize secret sharing among participants with different weights. In classical information sharing, the dealer can share multiple secrets in one round of the protocol and the participants can verify the correctness of the recovered secrets. In quantum state sharing, the dealer can share multiple single quantum states in one round of protocol. Finally, we demonstrate that our scheme is resistant to common external and internal attacks and compare it with related schemes.

TI Quasiparticle properties of stationary light polaritons in atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We theoretically analyze the quasiparticle properties of stationary light polariton (SLP) modes in atoms via perturbative approaches of effective atom-light interaction Hamiltonian. First, we explicitly show the five SLP eigenmodes of the Hilbert space of the SLP system. Then, the quasiparticle properties, such as group velocities and effective masses of SLPs, are investigated under various parametric conditions, which include the emergence of negative effective mass and effective mass singularity. Finally, we derive the intrinsic lifetimes of each SLP mode, which features a complementary relation among the lifetimes of SLP modes. Our results offer quantitative analysis of the quasiparticle properties in Hilbert space spanned by the SLP modes, and it is expected to contribute to SLP-based atom-light interaction applications, such as photonic quantum gates, optical simulation of many-body physics, and exotic dispersion engineering.

TI Quantum energetics of a noncommuting measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB When a measurement observable does not commute with a quantum system's Hamiltonian, the energy of the measured system is typically not conserved during the measurement. Instead, energy can be transferred between the measured system and the meter. In this work, we experimentally investigate the energetics of noncommuting measurements in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system containing a transmon qubit embedded in a 3D microwave cavity. We show through spectral analysis of the cavity photons that a frequency shift is imparted on the probe, in balance with the associated energy changes of the qubit. Our experiment provides new insights into foundations of quantum measurement, as well as a better understanding of the key mechanisms at play in quantum energetics.

TI Entanglement robustness of continuous variable
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-entangled state distributed over optical fiber
   channel
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-entangled state light field at a telecommunication wavelength of 1.5 mu m isan important quantum source for realizing the continuous variable quantum information processing and somequantum protocols over optical fiber channel. When the EPR-entangled state light field is distributed over theoptical fiber channel, the disentanglement is always present because the the EPR entangled state interacts withthe fiber channel. It affects the performance of quantum information processing. In this paper, we theoreticallycalculate the positive partial transposition (PPT) of the entangled state distributed over the optical fiberchannel in the single-channel and dual-channel distribution scheme, respectively. Three types of initialentangled light field are considered and analyzed, they being an initial EPR entangled state, an EPR entangledstate with asymmetric quadratures, and an EPR entangled state with asymmetric modes. Furthermore, theinfluence of the extra noise in the optical fiber on the transmission distance of EPR entangled state over theoptical fiber channel is investigated. In the single-channel scheme or dual-channel scheme, the extra noise in theoptical fiber channel leads the entangled state light field to be disentangled, and the transmission distance ofEPR entangled state over the optical fiber channel to decrease rapidly with the increase of the extra noise. Formaintaining the robustness of EPR entangled states in lossy optical fiber channels, the dual-channel scheme hasmore stringent requirements for the correlation quadrature symmetry and purity of the initial entangled statethan the single-channel scheme. In the single fiber noise channel scheme, the maximum transmission distanceand the robustness of the EPR entangled states with asymmetric modes are not sensitive to the asymmetrybetween modes. The change of asymmetry between modes does not lead to being disentangled. The maximumtransmission distance does not change either. However, the decrease of asymmetry between modes results in thedisentanglement in the double fiber noise channels' scheme. The maximum transmission distance is reduced andthe sudden death occurs to the entanglement. The present results will lay a foundation for continuous variablesquantum information processing based on optical fiber, such as realizing continuous variables quantumcommunication over optical fiber and constructing metropolitan quantum network over optical fiber

TI Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large
   distances
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum theory allows spatially separated observers to share nonlocal correlations, which enable them to accomplish classically inconceivable information processing and cryptographic feats. However, the distances over which nonlocal correlations can be realized remain severely limited due to their high fragility to noise and high threshold detection efficiencies. To enable loophole-free nonlocality across large distances, we introduce Bell experiments wherein the spatially separated parties randomly choose the location of their measurement devices. We demonstrate that when devices close to the source are perfect and witness extremal nonlocal correlations, such correlations can be extended to devices placed arbitrarily far from the source. To accommodate imperfections close to the source, we demonstrate an analytic trade-off: the higher the loophole-free nonlocality close to the source, the lower the threshold requirements away from the source. We utilize this trade-off and formulate numerical methods to estimate the critical requirements of individual measurement devices in such experiments.

In this paper, we present a library of various large integer polynomial multipliers to be used in hardware cryptocores. Our library contains both digitized and non-digitized multiplier flavours for circuit designers to choose from. The library is supported by a C++ generator that automatically produces the multipliersilogic in Verilog HDL that is amenable for FPGA and ASIC designs. Moreover, for ASICs, it also generates configurable and parameterizable synthesis scripts. The features of the generator allow for a quick generation and assessment of several architectures at the same time, thus allowing a designer to easily explore the (complex) optimization search space of polynomial multiplication.

TI Development of high-quality TiO2 photonics with E-gun
   evaporation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, we demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality (Q) TiO2 waveguide resonators by E-gun evaporation. The deposited titanium dioxide (TiO2) films exhibit superior roughness below 1 nm, demonstrating high-Q TiO2 integrated photonics. By employing the low-temperature, high-deposition-rate evaporation process, both low-confined and high-confined TiO2 waveguides are investigated, highlighting their potential for applications in nonlinear and quantum photonics. Meanwhile, the Q factor of waveguide resonators can reach approximately 1.1 x 105. With an optimized pulley coupling design, high extinction ratios (ER) above 27.1 dB for the silicon substrate and 68.7 dB for the glass substrate are achieved, respectively. This work shows the potential in fabricating both high-Q, high-ER waveguide resonators, and highly confined TiO2 photonic waveguides with E-gun evaporation for applications in co-packaged optics.

TI Optimizing SPHINCS+ for Low-Power Devices
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Different optimization techniques for the SHAKE variant of SPHINCS+ are explored on an FPGA with the means to find a power-efficient model for resource-constrained devices. This work explores multiple hashing implementations, such as registering inputs and directly feeding data to hashing units, as well as different variations in hashing permutations per clock cycle. The design is evaluated based on resource requirements, the signature generation rate, and both static and active power consumption. This design shows a decrease in energy consumed per signature by 20% to 30% compared to other state-of-the-art SPHINCS+ implementations, while only using 12-14k lookup tables (LUTs), depending on the SPHINCS+ variant. Moreover, an amendment is proposed to the SPHINCS+ specification that allows for decreased processing time and memory consumption while maintaining the security level and non-deterministic properties. This is accomplished by rearranging the inputs in the random oracle model.

AB As the standardization process for post-quantum cryptography progresses, the need for computer-verified security proofs against classical and quantum attackers increases. Even though some tools are already tackling this issue, none are foundational. We take a first step in this direction and present a complete formalization of the One-way to Hiding (O2H) Theorem, a central theorem for security proofs against quantum attackers. With this new formalization, we build more secure foundations for proof-checking tools in the quantum setting. Using the theorem prover Isabelle, we verify the semi-classical O2H Theorem by Ambainis, Hamburg and Unruh (Crypto 2019) in different variations. We also give a novel (and for the formalization simpler) proof to the O2H Theorem for mixed states and extend the theorem to non-terminating adversaries. This work provides a theoretical and foundational background for several verification tools and for security proofs in the quantum setting.

TI High-purity single photons obtained with moderate-NA optics from SiV
   center in nanodiamonds on a bullseye antenna
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherent exchange of single photons is at the heart of applied quantum optics. The negatively-charged silicon vacancy center in diamond is among most promising sources for coherent single photons. Its large Debye-Waller factor, short lifetime and extraordinary spectral stability is unique in the field of solid-state single photon sources. However, the excitation and detection of individual centers requires high numerical aperture (NA) optics which, combined with the need for cryogenic temperatures, puts technical overhead on experimental realizations. Here, we investigate a hybrid quantum photonics platform based on silicon-vacancy center in nanodiamonds and metallic bullseye antenna to realize a coherent single-photon resource that operates efficiently down to low NA optics with an inherent resistance to misalignment.

TI A Highly Hardware Efficient ML-KEM Accelerator with Optimised
   Architectural Layers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB The Module-Lattice-Based Key encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) scheme, which is currently being standardised, is a quantum attack resistant KEM that is based on CRYSTALS-Kyber. CRYSTALS-Kyber is the only Public-key Encryption (PKE)/ KEM scheme selected in the first set of successful candidates as part of the NIST initiated Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process. ML-KEM scheme includes three different security levels, namely security level 1, 3, and 5. In this research, we propose a highly area-time efficient hardware ML-KEM architecture. The architecture comprises three computational layers. The first layer comprises a hash and sampling module; the second layer includes a number theoretic transform (NTT), its inverse (INTT) and a point-wise multiplication (PWM) module; and the third layer comprises addition, compressing and encoding. Intra-layer pipelining and out-of-layer scheduling ensures that either layer 1 or layer 2 operate in the shortest time. In the reduction module, we propose a novel hybrid architecture to obtain the final result within 2 cycles with low area consumption. In the NTT module, the PWM pipelining method is modified and an optimised iterative FIFO access method is adopted to reduce the size of FIFO units by 55% over previous research. Look-up tables are also used to replace the first-stage of the NTT to reduce 8 cycles. Furthermore, the memory unit uses only FIFOs, the size are optimised based on the requirements of the most resource- intensive function in ML-KEM (ML-KEM.CPA.Dec). The results show that the proposed architecture has a 48.2%, 41.2%, and 78.1% reduction in computational time in comparison to previous work for security levels 1, 3, and 5, respectively. In addition, the area of proposed optimised ML-KEM designs is reduced by 73%, 70%, 76% and resulting in an improved area-time (AT) product of 15.8%, 10.7%, and 11.3%, for the Level 1, 3, and 5 security levels respectively, compared with state-of-the-art designs.

AB The erbium-doped lithium niobate on insulator (Er:LNOI) platform has great promise in the application of telecommunication, microwave photonics, and quantum photonics, due to its excellent electro-optic, piezo-electric, nonlinear nature, as well as the gain characteristics in the telecommunication C-band. Here, we report a single-frequency Er:LNOI integrated laser based on a dual-cavity structure. Facilitated by the Vernier effect and gain competition, the single-frequency laser can operate stably at 1531 nm wavelength with a 1484 nm pump laser. The output laser has a power of 0.31 mu W, a linewidth of 1.2 MHz, and a side mode suppression ratio of 31 dB. Our work allows the direct integration of this laser source with existing LNOI components and paves the way for a fully integrated LNOI system. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Measuring photon correlation using imperfect detectors

AB Single-photon detectors are "blind" after the detection of a photon, and thereafter display a characteristic recovery in efficiency, during which the number of undetected photons depends on the statistics of the incident light. We show how the efficiency recovery, photon statistics, and intensity have an interdependent relationship which suppresses a detector's ability to count photons and measure correlations. We also demonstrate this effect with an experiment using n such detectors to determine the nth-order correlation function with pseudothermal light.

TI Investigation of factors regarding the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on
   college students' depression by quantum annealer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Diverse cases regarding the impact, with its related factors, of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been reported in previous studies. In this study, multivariable datasets were collected from 751 college students who could be easily affected by pandemics based on the complex relationships between various mental health factors. We utilized quantum annealing (QA)-based feature selection algorithms that were executed by commercial D-Wave quantum computers to determine the changes in the relative importance of the associated factors before and after the pandemic. Multivariable linear regression (MLR) and XGBoost models were also applied to validate the QA-based algorithms. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that QA-based algorithms have comparable capabilities in factor analysis research to the MLR models that have been widely used in previous studies. Furthermore, the performance of the QA-based algorithms was validated through the important factor results from the algorithms. Pandemic-related factors (e.g., confidence in the social system) and psychological factors (e.g. decision-making in uncertain situations) were more important in post-pandemic conditions. Although the results should be validated using other mental health variables or national datasets, this study will serve as a reference for researchers regarding the use of the quantum annealing approach in factor analysis with validation through real-world survey dataset analysis.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver for closed-shell molecules with
   non-bosonic corrections
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The realization of quantum advantage with noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines has become one of the major challenges in computational sciences. Maintaining coherence of a physical system with more than ten qubits is a critical challenge that motivates research on compact system representations to reduce algorithm complexity. Toward this end, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) used to perform quantum simulations is considered to be one of the most promising algorithms for quantum chemistry in the NISQ era. We investigate reduced mapping of one spatial orbital to a single qubit to analyze the ground state energy in a way that the Pauli operators of qubits are mapped to the creation/annihilation of singlet pairs of electrons. To include the effect of non-bosonic (or non-paired) excitations, we introduce a simple correction scheme in the electron correlation model approximated by the geometrical mean of the bosonic (or paired) terms. Employing it in a VQE algorithm, we assess ground state energies of H2O, N2, and Li2O in good agreement with full configuration interaction (FCI) models respectively, using only 6, 8, and 12 qubits with quantum gate depths proportional to the squares of the qubit counts. With the adopted seniority-zero approximation that uses only one half of the qubit counts of a conventional VQE algorithm, we find that our non-bosonic correction method reaches reliable quantum chemistry simulations at least for the tested systems.
   Bosonic VQE that maps one pair of electrons in one spatial orbital to one single qubit, combined with a pair-crossing heuristic non-bosonic correction leads to favorable scaling in quantum resources and reliable prediction on ground state potential.

TI Singular spectrum analysis of two-photon interference from distinct
   quantum emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two-photon interference underlies the functioning of many quantum photonics devices. It also serves as the prominent tool for testing the indistinguishability of distinct photons. However, as their time-spectral profile becomes more involved, extracting relevant parameters, foremost the central frequency difference, may become difficult. In a parametric approach, these arise from the need for an exhaustive model combined with limited count statistics. Here we discuss a solution to curtail these effects on the evaluation of frequency separation relying on a semiparametric method. The time trace of the quantum interference pattern of two photons from two independent solid-state emitters is preprocessed by means of singular spectral analysis before inspecting its spectral content. This approach allows one to single out the relevant oscillations from both the envelope and the noise, without resorting to fitting. This opens the way for robust and efficient on-line monitoring of quantum emitters.

TI Visualising quantum innovation: A regional case study
SO PLOS ONE
AB At the beginning of this century, the advent of a second generation of 'quantum technologies' was announced together with its revolutionary potential to change existing information technologies. Despite the rapidly increasing paid to quantum technological development, there has been little attention paid to the specific characteristics or relationships within emerging quantum ecosystems. The aim of this study is to visualize the innovation structures and relationships that are emerging to shape these technological developments. As these structures typically depend on specific regional features, we have specifically focused on the Spanish case, as it is potentially indicative of the differences between European innovation models and other regional patterns. This objective was achieved by researching the funding network of the ecosystem, collected from a systematic review of various official sources and relevant previous literature. The resulting dataset was framed using the Innovation Ecosystem model and broken down through network analysis theory, as well as characterized through descriptive statistics. This framework identified the significant role that projects play in European scientific and technological innovation, which work as hubs to concentrate resources and incentive cooperation between actors. This is relevant because current work on quantum technologies neglects their importance, as their analysis focuses on the quantity of institutions rather than their relations. Moreover, this paper points out the prominence of public funding to drive quantum innovation, largely stemming from the European Commission. This is another key mechanism that is missed by the existing literature. Finally, it also sheds light on the recipients of this funding, who are mostly research centres. These results allow us to conceptualize the Spanish quantum ecosystem and offer the opportunity for comparative studies with other quantum technologies ecosystems.

TI Optimal local measurements in single-parameter quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LMs). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve the QCRB through LMs. The first method, dubbed the iterative matrix partition method and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a traceless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LMs as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by Zhou et al. [Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of the QCRB through LMs for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed the hierarchy of orthogonality conditions and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRBs, including the three-qubit W states and the N-qubit W states (N 3). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.

TI Quantum complexity as hydrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB As a new step toward defining complexity for quantum field theories, we map Nielsen operator complexity for SU(N) gates to two-dimensional hydrodynamics. We develop a tractable large N limit that leads to regular geometries on the manifold of unitaries as N is taken to infinity. To achieve this, we introduce a basis of noncommutative plane waves for the su(N) algebra and define a metric with polynomial penalty factors. Through the Euler-Arnold approach we identify incompressible inviscid hydrodynamics on the two-torus as a novel effective theory of large-qudit operator complexity. For large N, our cost function captures two essential properties of holographic complexity measures: ergodicity and conjugate points.

TI An Efficient Combined Bit-Width Reducing Method for Ising Models
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Annealing machines such as quantum annealing machines and semiconductor-based annealing machines have been attracting atten-tion as an efficient computing alternative for solving combinatorial opti-mization problems. They solve original combinatorial optimization prob-lems by transforming them into a data structure called an Ising model. At that time, the bit-widths of the coefficients of the Ising model have to be kept within the range that an annealing machine can deal with. However, by reducing the Ising-model bit-widths, its minimum energy state, or ground state, may become different from that of the original one, and hence the targeted combinatorial optimization problem cannot be well solved. This paper proposes an effective method for reducing Ising model's bit-widths. The proposed method is composed of two processes: First, given an Ising model with large coefficient bit-widths, the shift method is applied to re-duce its bit-widths roughly. Second, the spin-adding method is applied to further reduce its bit-widths to those that annealing machines can deal with. Without adding too many extra spins, we efficiently reduce the coefficient bit-widths of the original Ising model. Furthermore, the ground state before and after reducing the coefficient bit-widths is not much changed in most of the practical cases. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, compared to existing methods.

TI Thermodynamics of coherent energy exchanges between lasers and two-level
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the quantum thermodynamics of a coherent macroscopic electromagnetic field (laser) coupled to a two-level system (qubit) near resonance, from weak-to strong-driving regimes. This combined system is, in turn, weakly coupled to a thermal radiation field and can be described by an autonomous quantum master equation. We show that the laser acts as an autonomous work source and that, in the macroscopic limit, the work produced is independent of the phase of the laser. Using the dressed qubit approach, we show that the variation of energy in the laser is not the work transferred to the dressed qubit, which is instead obtained from the "dressed laser"-a coherent superposition of the laser and the qubit. Using a two-point measurement technique with counting fields, we obtain the full counting statistics for the work of the laser and dressed laser, and show that they satisfy the Crooks fluctuation theorems. We then use these theorems as criteria to investigate the thermodynamic consistency of quantum master equations, first in the autonomous setup for the combined system, then in the nonautonomous setup for the quantum system where the coherent field is eliminated and effectively described by a time-dependent external field. Treating the laser as an external field is known to yield expressions for the work which are in contradiction with quantum thermodynamics predictions in the strong-driving regime. We show that these inconsistencies stem from a confusion between the laser and dressed laser, and show how to correct them. We also derive a generalized Bloch master equation, thermodynamically consistent across all driving regimes, from which the Bloch and Floquet master equations can be obtained using additional approximations (of which we also examine the consistency).

TI Integrated photonic circuits for contextuality tests via sequential
   measurements in three-level quantum systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we present a protocol to obtain photonic circuits that can be used in the implementation of contextuality tests on qutrit systems. The use of photonic integrated circuits offers several advantages for performing this type of task. These include scalability, accuracy, robustness, high-speed and efficient quantum measurements, precise control over the phase properties of photons by using electrically driven heaters to induce a thermo-optic phase shift and resistance to noise. We relate the average values that appear in the inequalities with the probability of photon counting in the circuit outputs and present a realizable configuration for the desired device, taking into account state-dependent and state-independent contextuality tests.

TI A Dual Approach Cryptographic Model for Video Transmission Based on
   Association Schemes
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The security of video data requires cryptographic techniques that are resilient to both classical and quantum threats. This study presents an encryption framework based on association schemes and algebraic combinatorial tools that enable systematic and secure data transformations. In the classical setting, video encryption is achieved through random matrix transformations applied to the relations of an association scheme, producing secure and imperceptible ciphertext. Experimental evaluations, including statistical and error analyses, confirm the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method. We extend the framework to quantum cryptography by exploring unitary encryption operators derived from the Bose-Mesner algebra of association schemes. These operators are used to encrypt quantum-encoded multimedia data. The results demonstrate the potential of association schemes to support secure multimedia encryption in both classical and quantum domains.

TI Quantum-Safe Threshold Cryptography for Decentralized Group Key
   Management via Dealerless DKG (CRYSTALS-Kyber)
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Post-quantum threshold cryptography requires complete elimination of classical assumptions to achieve genuine quantum resistance. This work presents a fully lattice-based dealerless distributed key generation (DKG) protocol with threshold CRYSTALS-Kyber implementation. We implemented a four-phase DKG protocol using lattice-based primitives: SIS-based commitments for verification, Ring-LWE secret sharing, and secure multi-party key derivation without reconstructing private keys. Our approach eliminates the need for a trusted dealer while maintaining 192-bit post-quantum security through exclusive reliance on lattice problems. Experimental evaluation demonstrates & Oscr;(n2) communication complexity for lattice-based DKG setup across 3-20 participants, with secure threshold operations preserving key secrecy. Security analysis provides formal reductions to Ring-LWE and Ring-SIS assumptions, ensuring genuine quantum resistance throughout the protocol stack.

TI Decoy state quantum secret sharing protocol with collective detection
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB The quantum secret sharing protocol with collective detection has garnered significant attention due to its high communication efficiency and low demands on agent capabilities. However, practical implementations face challenges such as intolerance to channel loss and insufficient practical security analysis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a decoy quantum secret sharing protocol with collective detection. First, we analyze the potential security threats posed by multi-photon signals and propose two attack methods, rigorously demonstrating their severe impact on protocol security. Subsequently, to mitigate the adverse effects of multi-photon signals, we introduce a decoy state strategy to enhance the protocol's reliability under non-ideal conditions. Finally, detailed security analysis against the proposed attacks confirms that the improved protocol effectively resists both attacks even in non-ideal scenarios, thereby ensuring secure and reliable quantum secret sharing.

TI In-line rate encrypted links using pre-shared post-quantum keys and DPUs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The development of quantum computers poses a risk to the cryptographic algorithms utilized by current public key infrastructure (PKI). High performance computing (HPC), inter- and intra-datacenter communications, and governmental communications are particularly vulnerable to security attacks by quantum computers. In response, there are on-going efforts on implementing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) despite the considerable overhead involved in processing PQC encrypted data packets in comparison with their classical counterparts. This work aims to help with the transition to quantum resistant cryptographic schemes by means of providing a thorough experimental performance comparison of the four algorithms selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for standardization when implemented in a data processing unit (DPU). The experiments are conducted at line-rate, demonstrating for the first time operation at almost 100 Gbit/s and hence suitability for high-capacity data center environments.

TI Nonclassicality of bright Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like radiation of
   an optical parametric source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With the emerging possibility to obtain emissions of triples of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-entangled photons via direct parametric generation, we study here bright emissions of this kind which involve higher-order emissions of two triples, three triples, etc. Such states would constitute a natural generalization of the four-mode (two beams plus polarization) squeezed vacuum. We show how to avoid technical difficulties related to straight-ahead generalization of the usual approximate description of parametric down-conversion which uses a classical pump field. Using Pade approximation, we turn the first terms of the nonconverging perturbation expansion into elements of a converging series. This allows us to study nonclassicality of the new bright generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. We present both violations of local realism by such a radiation and simple entanglement indicators tailored for this case.

TI Efficient (k, n) threshold semi-quantum secret sharing
   protocol
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Most (k, n) threshold quantum secret sharing protocols are fully quantum. The message receivers must be equipped with complex quantum devices so as to prepare various quantum resources and perform complex quantum operations, which may affect the practice of these protocols. On the other hand, the qubit efficiency of most (k, n) threshold quantum secret sharing protocols is not more than 1/2. To simplify the (k, n) threshold quantum secret sharing protocol and improve its practice and qubit efficiency, a new (k, n) threshold secret sharing protocol with semi-quantum properties is proposed. In this protocol, the dealer prepares decoy particles and sends them to the receivers. The receivers insert particles carrying secret information along with Z-basis decoy particles into the received particle sequence to generate mixed-particle sequences, which are returned to the dealer. The dealer measures the received particle sequences to check for eavesdropping and establishes shared secret keys with the receivers. With the shared secret keys, the dealer distributes the secret pieces among the receivers using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Multiple secret messages can be recovered by k or more receivers. The qubit efficiency of our protocol is k/n. For an (n, n) threshold protocol, the qubit efficiency would be 100%. The proposed scheme is based on single particles without using any entangled system. Therefore, its quantum resources are relatively easy to prepare. Receivers must only prepare simple Z-basis qubits. Its semi-quantum properties enhance practice implementation. The proposed protocol has robust security against various types of attacks, including eavesdropping, internal, and collusion attacks. Furthermore, it can resist the unitary attack, which is seldom analyzed in other protocols.

TI Mediated Interactions beyond the Nearest Neighbor in an Array of
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We consider mediated interactions in an array of floating transmons, where each qubit capacitor consists of two superconducting pads galvanically isolated from ground. Each such pair contributes two quantum degrees of freedom, one of which is used as a qubit, while the other remains fixed. However, these extraneous modes can generate coupling between the qubit modes that extends beyond the nearest neighbor. We present a general formalism describing the formation of this coupling and calculate it for a one-dimensional chain of transmons. We show that the strength of coupling and its range (that is, the exponential falloff) can be tuned independently via circuit design to realize a continuum from nearest neighbor-only interactions to interactions that extend across the length of the chain. We discuss how this coupling breaks integrability, allowing the system to locally equilibrate, and so enables exploration of quantum thermalization. We present designs with capacitance and microwave simulations showing that various interaction configurations can be achieved in realistic circuits. Such a coupling could be used in analog simulation of different quantum regimes or to increase connectivity in digital quantum systems. Thus the mechanism must also be taken into account in other types of qubits with extraneous modes.

TI Compact reconfigurable on-chip polarization beam splitters enabled by
   phase change material
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we present the design of a compact reconfigurable polarization beam splitter (PBS) enabled by ultralow-loss phase-changing Sb2Se3. By harnessing the phase-change -mediated mode coupling in a directional coupler (DC), guided light with different polarizations could be routed into different paths and this routing could be dynamically switched upon the phase change of Sb2Se3. With an optimized DC region, the proposed PBS demonstrates efficient polarization splitting with crosstalk less than -21.3 dB and insertion loss less than 0.16 dB at 1550 nm for both phase states of Sb2Se3, and features energy efficient property benefitting from the nonvolatile phase change of Sb2Se3, which holds great potentials for on-chip applications involving polarization control, including polarization-division multiplexing system, quantum photonics, microwave photonics, etc.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Strain-induced exciton redistribution among quantum emitters in
   two-dimensional materials
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The discovery of quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional (2D) materials has triggered a surge of research to assess their suitability for quantum photonics. Although position-controlled QEs are routinely fabricated using static strain gradients, the use of dynamic strain fields to control the brightness of QEs has not been explored yet. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a novel device in which WSe2 monolayers are integrated onto piezoelectric pillars that provide both static and dynamic strains. The static strains are first used to induce the formation of QEs, while their energy and brightness are then controlled via voltages on piezoelectric pillars. Numerical simulations show that these effects are due to a strain-induced modification of the confining-potential landscape, which leads to a net redistribution of excitons among the different QEs. Our work provides a method to dynamically control the energy and brightness of QEs in 2D materials.

AB tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other domains has increasingly becoming a successful trend to deal complex language phenomena or to fill task or domain-specific gaps with an approach that needs less data and minor computational resources. The field that has, to date, yielded more quantum-based attention is the retrieval and classification of textual data. This work aims to replicate the excellent results of hybrid quantum approaches for syntactic tasks on semantic classification tasks. In detail, a quantum machine learning algorithm, namely, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), is used to perform sentiment analysis classification tasks. This algorithm can deduce the relationships between input features and their corresponding class affiliations us ing a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that translates classical data into quantum states. The approach has been tested on a well-known benchmark annotated dataset used for the Italian language, and the results have been compared to existing baselines, pointing out state-of-the-art scores.

TI New Identified Strategies to Forge Multivariate Signature Schemes
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A rogue certificate authority (RCA) is a dishonest entity that has the trust of web browsers and users to produce valid key pairs which are vulnerable. This work analyses two acknowledged post-quantum secure Multivariate Quadratic Problem (MQP) based signature schemes, namely the UOV and Rainbow signature schemes that obtain their key pair from a potential RCA methodology. We revisit two and provide a novel RCA methodology that would enable adversaries to forge UOV and Rainbow signatures. We also lay out two strategies to identify whether the public parameters are generated by the first two methodologies. To this end, strategies to identify the third strategy remain elusive. As such, the UOV and Rainbow schemes remain vulnerable to forgery if it was forged via the third methodology.

TI Practicality of training a quantum-classical machine in the noisy
   intermediate-scale quantum era
SO ISCIENCE
AB Advancements in classical computing have propelled machine learning applications, yet inherent limitations persist in terms of energy, resource, and speed. Quantum machine learning offers a promising avenue to overcome these limitations but poses its own hurdles. This experimental study investigates the training limits of a real quantum-classical hybrid system on an ion-trap platform using supervised protocols. It addresses the challenges of coupling ion-trap systems with classical processors and highlights the effectiveness of genetic algorithms for NISQ devices and complex binary classification tasks with many local minima. The analysis reveals why gradient-based methods may not be ideal in the NISQ era. Our results provide insights into optimizing hybrid quantum-classical systems, emphasizing the importance of training strategies and hardware design. This work not only enhances understanding of such systems but also illustrates their practical potential in solving real-world problems without relying on classical simulators, bridging the gap between quantum and classical computing paradigms.

TI Experimental sharing of Bell nonlocality with projective measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the standard Bell experiment, two parties perform local projective measurements on a shared pair of entangled qubits to generate nonlocal correlations. However, these measurements completely destroy the entanglement, rendering the post-measurement state unable for subsequent use. For a long time, it was believed that only unsharp measurements can be used to share quantum correlations. Remarkably, recent research has shown that classical randomness assisted projective measurements are sufficient for sharing nonlocality (Steffinlongo and Tavakoli 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 129 230402). Here, by stochastically combining no more than two different projective measurement strategies, we report an experimental observation of double Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violations with two measurements in a sequence made on each pair of maximally and partially entangled polarization photons. Our results reveal that the double violation achieved by partially entangled states can be 11 standard deviations larger than that achieved by maximally entangled ones. Our scheme eliminates the requirement for entanglement assistance in previous unsharp-measurement-based sharing schemes, making it experimentally easier. Our work provides possibilities for sharing other types of quantum correlations in various physical systems with projective measurements.

AB The integration of Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) techniques into the landscape of financial risk analysis presents a promising avenue for innovation. This study introduces a framework for credit risk assessment in the banking sector, combining quantum deep learning techniques with adaptive modeling for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis (RTDPA). By leveraging RTDPA, the proposed approach tailors predictive models to different loan categories, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk evaluation. While this work explores the potential of integrating quantum methods with classical deep learning for risk assessment, it focuses on the feasibility and performance of this hybrid framework rather than claiming transformative industry-wide impacts. The findings offer insights into how quantum techniques can complement traditional financial analysis, paving the way for further advancements in predictive modeling for credit risk.

TI Quantum optimization for training quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Training quantum neural networks (QNNs) using gradient-based or gradient-free classical optimization approaches is severely impacted by the presence of barren plateaus in the cost landscapes. In this paper, we devise a framework for leveraging quantum optimization algorithms to find optimal parameters of QNNs for certain tasks. To cast the optimization problem of training QNN into the context of quantum optimization, the parameters in QNN are quantized-moved from being classical to being stored in quantum registers which are in addition to those upon which the QNN is performing its computation. We then coherently encode the cost function of QNNs onto relative phases of a superposition state in the Hilbert space of the QNN parameters. The parameters are tuned with an iterative quantum optimization structure using adaptively selected Hamiltonians. The quantum mechanism of this framework exploits hidden structure in the QNN optimization problem and hence is expected to provide beyond-Grover speed up, mitigating the barren plateau issue.

TI Exceptional Photon Blockade: Engineering Photon Blockade with Chiral
   Exceptional Points
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Non-hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as exceptional points (EPs), feature the simultaneous coalescence of both eigenvalues and the associated eigenstates of a system. A host of intriguing EP effects and their applications have been revealed in the classical realm, such as loss-induced lasing, single-mode laser, and EP-enhanced sensing. Here, it is shown that a purely quantum effect, known as single-photon blockade, emerges in a Kerr microring resonator due to EP-induced asymmetric coupling between the optical modes and the nonlinearity-induced anharmonic energy-level spacing. A striking feature of this photon blockade is that it emerges at two-photon resonance which in Hermitian systems will only lead to photon-induced tunneling but not to photon blockade. By tuning the system towards or away from an EP, one can control quantum correlations, implying the potential use of their system for frequency tunable single-photon generation and an antibunching-to-bunching light switch. The work sheds new light on EP-engineered purely quantum effects, providing unique opportunities for making and utilizing various single-photon quantum EP devices.

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of quantum neural network, an algorithm suited for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, and tensor network, a quantum-inspired machine learning algorithm, against classical models such as linear regression and neural networks. To evaluate their abilities, we construct portfolios based on their predictions and measure investment performances. The empirical study on the Japanese stock market shows the tensor network model achieves superior performance compared to classical benchmark models, including linear and neural network models. Though the quantum neural network model attains the lowered risk-adjusted excess return than the classical neural network models over the whole period, both the quantum neural network and tensor network models have superior performances in the latest market environment, which suggests capability of model's capturing non-linearity between input features.

AB It was long thought that symmetric cryptography was only mildly affected by quantum attacks, and that doubling the key length was sufficient to restore security. However, recent works have shown that Simon's quantum period finding algorithm breaks a large number of MAC and authenticated encryption algorithms when the adversary can query the MAC/encryption oracle with a quantum superposition of messages. In particular, the OCB authenticated encryption mode is broken in this setting, and no quantum-secure mode is known with the same efficiency (rate-one and parallelizable).
   In this paper we generalize the previous attacks, show that a large class of OCB-like schemes is unsafe against superposition queries, and discuss the quantum security notions for authenticated encryption modes. We propose a new rate-one parallelizable mode named QCB inspired by TAE and OCB and prove its security against quantum superposition queries.

TI Cooperative properties of multiple quantum scattering: II.
   Coherentlasing
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The description model of the multiple scattering lasers using the superposition states between the generated photons in the ensemble of bi-modes of the resonator field, we introduced a concept of indistinguishable energy portions generated in the resonator following multiple scattering. Each of these quasi-quanta has energy equal to the difference between the pumping and scattering quantum energies at each step of multiple scattering. The conversion of the photons in the external electromagnetic mode of the resonator destroys this cooperative correlation between the bi-modes and established conservation lows during the cooperative emission. The master equation containing two parameters connected with the gain of quasi-energy portions, and their annihilation due to the losses from the resonator, is proposed. The competition between these two processes is numerically studied. An attractive problem is connected with established quantum correlations between the photons belonging to non-adjacent modes of the cavity. The time behavior of the evolution of correlations between such modes is observed. This conception may be used for the teleportation of information in other modes during the multiple Raman conversion.

TI Cryptanalysis of a Semi-Quantum Bi-Signature Scheme Based on W States

AB Recently, Zhao et al. proposed a semi-quantum bi-signature (SQBS) scheme based on W states with two quantum signers and just one classical verifier. In this study, we highlight three security issues with Zhao et al.'s SQBS scheme. In Zhao et al.'s SQBS protocol, an insider attacker can perform an impersonation attack in the verification phase and an impersonation attack in the signature phase to capture the private key. In addition, an eavesdropper can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain all of the signer's secret information. All of the above three attacks can pass the eavesdropping check. Without considering these security issues, the SQBS protocol could fail to ensure the signer's secret information.

TI A comprehensive perspective for single-mode Gaussian coherence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we theoretically investigate single-mode Gaussian quantum coherence from a comprehensive perspective. Based on analytical expressions of the first and second moments of single-mode Gaussian states undergoing various Gaussian noisy channels, we use quantum mater equation and the method of the relative entropy to quantify the quantum coherence of any single-mode Gaussian state. We demonstrate that the displaced thermal state achieves maximum quantum coherence when using only the displaced vacuum state, which is a pure coherent state. However, for various lossy noise channels, quantum coherence shows a significant decrease. In the context of a squeezed thermal state, when controlling the squeezing parameter for a given environmental temperature, quantum coherence has been witnessed to increase. The ultimate upper bound of quantum coherence is then attained with the squeezed vacuum state. In particular, we determined the most generalized scenario of the displaced squeezed thermal state. The maximum value of quantum coherence is obtained when displacement and squeeze parameters both attain maximum value. Our study might be important in the future for the characterisation as well as the estimation of various nonclassical quantum correlations in single-mode Gaussian states.

TI Non-classical energy squeezing of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Optomechanics and electromechanics have made it possible to prepare macroscopic mechanical oscillators in their quantum ground states(1), in quadrature-squeezed states(2) and in entangled states of motion(3). However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states. Strong quadratic coupling of motion to light could allow a way around this restriction(4-6). Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems(5,)(7,8), these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion. Here we create non-classical states by quadratically coupling motion to the energy levels of a Cooper-pair box qubit. Through microwave-frequency drives that change the state of both the oscillator and qubit, we then dissipatively stabilize the oscillator in a state with a large mean phonon number of 43 and sub-Poissonian number fluctuations of approximately 3. In this energy-squeezed state, we observe a striking feature of the quadratic coupling: the recoil of the mechanical oscillator caused by qubit transitions, closely analogous to the vibronic transitions in molecules(9,10).

TI Analytic expressions for Hubbard models with arbitrary structures in
   programmable optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the use of programmable optical lattices for quantum simulation of Hubbard models, determining analytic expressions for the hopping and Hubbard U, finding that they are suitable for emulating strongly correlated systems with arbitrary structures, including those with a multiple site basis and impurities. Programmable potentials are highly flexible, with the ability to control the depth and shape of individual sites in the optical lattice dynamically. Quantum simulators of Hubbard models with (1) an arbitrary basis are required to represent many real materials of contemporary interest, (2) broken translational symmetry are needed to study impurity physics, and (3) dynamical lattices are needed to investigate strong correlations out of equilibrium. We derive analytic expressions for Hubbard Hamiltonians in programmable potential systems. We find experimental parameters for quantum simulation of Hubbard models with an arbitrary basis, concluding that programmable optical lattices are suitable for this purpose. Finally, we demonstrate how programmable optical lattices can be used for quantum simulation of ionic Hubbard models, and thus the onset of charge transfer insulating states, in parameter regimes that are currently inaccessible to experiment.

TI Pseudorandom Function from Learning Burnside Problem
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We present three progressively refined pseudorandom function (PRF) constructions based on the learning Burnside homomorphisms with noise (Bn-LHN) assumption. A key challenge in this approach is error management, which we address by extracting errors from the secret key. Our first design, a direct pseudorandom generator (PRG), leverages the lower entropy of the error set (E) compared to the Burnside group (Br). The second, a parameterized PRG, derives its function description from public parameters and the secret key, aligning with the relaxed PRG requirements in the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali (GGM) PRF construction. The final indexed PRG introduces public parameters and an index to refine efficiency. To optimize computations in Burnside groups, we enhance concatenation operations and homomorphisms from Bn to Br for n >> r. Additionally, we explore algorithmic improvements and parallel computation strategies to improve efficiency.

TI Demonstration of Density Matrix Exponentiation Using a Superconducting
   Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a general technique for using a quantum state rho to enact the quantum operation e-(i rho theta) on a target system. It was first proposed in the context of quantum machine learning, but has since been shown to have broad applications in quantum metrology and computation. No experimental demonstration of DME has been performed thus far due to its demanding circuit depths and the need to efficiently generate multiple identical copies of rho during the finite lifetime of the target system. In this work, we describe the first demonstration of the DME algorithm, which we accomplish using a superconducting quantum processor. Our demonstration relies on a 99.7% fidelity controlled-phase gate implemented using two tunable superconducting transmon qubits. We achieve a fidelity surpassing 90% at circuit depths exceeding 70 when comparing the output of the circuit executed on our quantum processor to a simulation assuming perfect operations and measurements.

TI Effect of Inter-System Coupling on Heat Transport in a Microscopic
   Collision Model
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper we consider a bipartite system composed of two subsystems each coupled to its own thermal environment. Based on a collision model, we mainly study whether the approximation (i.e., the inter-system coupling is ignored when modeling the system-environment interaction) is valid or not. We also address the problem of heat transport unitedly for both excitation-conserving system-environment interactions and non-excitation-conserving system-environment interactions. For the former interaction, as the inter-system interaction strength increases, at first this approximation gets worse as expected, but then counter-intuitively gets better even for a stronger inter-system coupling. For the latter interaction with asymmetry, this approximation gets progressively worse. In this case we realize a perfect thermal rectification, and we cannot find an apparent rectification effect for the former interaction. Finally and more importantly, our results show that whether this approximation is valid or not is closely related to the quantum correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the weaker the quantum correlations, the more justified the approximation and vice versa.

TI Unveiling atomic structure and chemical composition of the Al/AlOx/Al
   Josephson junctions in qubits
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Qubits incorporating Josephson Junctions are essential for developing quantum computing devices, nevertheless, nanostructure and chemical information of the junction have yet been distinctly understood. To address it, comprehensive investigation is performed to decipher atomic structure and compositional features of the Josephson junction which basically consists of an Al/AlOx/Al tri-layer materials system. It is revealed that the top-Al and the bottom-Al layers are with the thickness of 25.8 & PLUSMN; 0.8 nm and 20.4 & PLUSMN; 1.4 nm, respectively, slightly smaller than the intended thickness of 30 nm, which may be due to the inherent error associated to the measuring method based on cross sectional transmission electron microscopy micrographs. In addition, both the top and bottom crystalline Al layers comprise columnar grains with the size of approximately 20 x 30 nm. The AlOx tunnel layer is roughly 2-4 nm thick and is composed of amorphous materials. The interfaces between AlOx and Al electrodes are jagged rather than flat, implying thickness inhomogeneity which can be possibly ascribed to the mechanisms of atomic steps and grain boundary grooving. Moreover, EELS spectrum imaging reveals a 0.5 nm-thick interfacial layer at boundary of AlOx barrier and Al electrodes. Unique ELNES features at the interfacial layer, including a-2 eV onset-shift of the O-K edge, are correlated with reduction of electronic properties of the barrier layer. Atom probe tomography reveals that composition of the bottom-Al/Si substrate interface primarily comprises AlO, O, C, Al2O, SiO, SiO2, P, O2 and Al2O2 and small quantities of SiC2, B and AlO2. Furthermore, significant strain, e.g.,-3% normal and shear strain, can be detected in the bottom-Al layer grains, which probably stems from the uneven Si surface during the qubit fabrication process.

AB Message matching is a critical process ensuring the correct delivery of messages in distributed and HPC environments. The advent of SmartNICs presents an opportunity to develop offloaded message-matching approaches that leverage this on-NIC programmable accelerator, retaining the flexibility of software-based solutions (e.g., tailoring to application matching behaviors or specialized for non-MPI matching semantics) while freeing up CPU resources. This can be especially beneficial for intensive I/O systems, such as those protected with Post Quantum Cryptography. In this work, we propose a bin-based MPI message approach, Optimistic Tag Matching, explicitly designed for the lightweight, highly parallel architectures typical of on-path SmartNICs. We analyze several MPI applications, showing how most of them present a matching behavior suitable for offloading with the proposed strategy (i.e., low queue depths). Additionally, we show how, in those scenarios, offloaded optimistic matching maintains message rates comparable to traditional on-CPU MPI message matching while freeing up CPU resources.

AB The distribution of bipartite entanglement in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer composed from two spin-1/2 and two spin-1 entities is investigated in detail in presence of an external magnetic field. Four different negativities measuring a strength of bipartite entanglement are analyzed at zero and non-zero temperatures. Derived rigorous analytic results and respective numerical results are discussed with the particular emphasis laid on the significance of a strength of the pair spin-spin interactions and spin diversity in the entanglement description. Based on both aforementioned driving forces the regions of parametric space, where the bipartite entanglement can exist solely for one type of spin pair or all four spin pairs, were identified.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigate a new class of fault-injection attacks against the CSIDH family of cryptographic group actions. Our disorientation attacks effectively flip the direction of some isogeny steps. We achieve this by faulting a specific subroutine, connected to the Legendre symbol or Elligator computations performed during the evaluation of the group action. These subroutines are present in almost all known CSIDH implementations. Post-processing a set of faulty samples allows us to infer constraints on the secret key. The details are implementation specific, but we show that in many cases, it is possible to recover the full secret key with only a modest number of successful fault injections and modest computational resources. We provide full details for attacking the original CSIDH proof-of-concept software as well as the CTIDH constant-time implementation. Finally, we present a set of lightweight countermeasures against the attack and discuss their security.

   Algebraic Algorithm Based on It
SO MATHEMATICS
AB To eliminate the limitations of signature randomization in known algebraic algorithms with a hidden group, the security of which is based on the computational complexity of solving large systems of power equations, a method for ensuring complete randomization is proposed. Based on this method, a new algorithm of the indicated type was developed, using a four-dimensional finite non-commutative associative algebra as an algebraic basis. We obtained estimates of the security of algorithms to direct attacks as well as from attacks based on known signatures, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed signature randomization method. Due to the relatively small size and signature of the public and private keys, the developed algorithm is of interest as a potential practical post-quantum digital signature scheme.

TI A Geometric Invariant of Linear Rank-Metric Codes
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
AB Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

TI Efficiency of SIDH-based signatures (yes, SIDH)
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB In this note, we assess the efficiency of a supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH)-based digital signature built on a weaker variant of a recent identification protocol proposed by Basso et al. Despite the devastating attacks against (the mathematical problem underlying) SIDH, this identification protocol remains secure, as its security is backed by a different (and more standard) isogeny-finding problem. We conduct our analysis by applying some known cryptographic techniques to decrease the signature size by about 70% for all parameter sets (obtaining signatures of approximately 21 kB for SIKEp434). Moreover, we propose a minor optimisation to compute many isogenies in parallel from the same starting curve. Our assessment confirms that determining the most efficient methods for isogeny-based signature schemes, including optimisations such as those presented in this paper, is still a open problem, with much more work to be done.

TI High-Fidelity CNOT Gate for Donor Electron Spin Qubits in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Donor dots realized with phosphorus atoms in silicon have proven to be excellent hosts for electron spin qubits as they provide a strong confining potential that results in small wave functions and well-isolated ground states. As a promising candidate for large-scale quantum computers, such qubits have demonstrated fast, high-fidelity single-shot readout (99.8%) and extremely long coherence times (seconds) with single-qubit gates exceeding 99.94% fidelity. However, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in this platform have been elusive, with charge noise being one of the key limiting factors. Charge noise causes unwanted fluctuations in the exchange coupling between electron spins resulting in logic gate errors, a process that could be minimized if we could engineer a large enough magnetic field difference between the qubits. In this work, we show that using the donor nuclear spins as nanomagnets we can engineer a large magnetic field gradient (> 800 MHz) between the qubits thereby minimizing sensitivity to charge noise and reducing errors during two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation. We develop a comprehensive theoretical framework with realistic noise sources for performing CNOT gates via controlled rotation (CROT) using multidonor dot qubits. We show that by engineering the number and location of donors within the dots we can control the hyperfine couplings to maximize the energy difference between electron spin qubits. As a result, we show that the CNOT gate error rates can be reduced by a factor of 4 when using multidonor dots as compared to single donors. Our results provide a theoretical roadmap to show how to achieve CNOT fidelities as high as 99.98% by optimizing both the local magnetic environment and the operating parameters of multidonor dot qubits.

TI Review of Chosen Isogeny-Based Cryptographic Schemes
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Public-key cryptography provides security for digital systems and communication. Traditional cryptographic solutions are constantly improved, e.g., to suppress brute-force attacks. However, Shor's algorithm suited for quantum computers can break the bedrock of most currently used systems, i.e., the RSA problem and discrete logarithm problem. Post-quantum cryptography can withstand attacks carried out by quantum computers. Several families of post-quantum systems exist; one of them is isogeny-based cryptography. As a main contribution, in this paper, we provide a survey of chosen, fundamental isogeny-based schemes. The target audience of this review is researchers interested in practical aspects of this field of cryptography; therefore the survey contains exemplary implementations. Our goal was not to develop an efficient implementation, but to provide materials that make it easier to analyze isogeny-based cryptography.

TI Quantum scheme of dissipative two qubits in a squeezed field:
   Entanglement and Fisher information
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A clear relationship between the quantum version of Fisher information and the bipartite system entanglement has been explored recently. Known existing results for some quantum systems having strongly nonlocal correlations are still limited. In this paper, based on the interaction between a two-qubit and squeezed field, we investigate the correlation between the dynamical behavior of qubit-qubit entanglement and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We focus on the effect of a number of photon multiplicity, low and high squeezing regime of the field on the dynamics of the QFI and entanglement quantifier. We show how the QFI and entanglement quantifier can be affected by the number of photon multiplicity and squeeze parameter during the time evolution of cases of absence and presence of dissipation effect. Our results exhibit the correlation between the entanglement quantifiers and the QFI with respect to the appearance of collapse and revival phenomena of the atomic inversion. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

AB We propose a 2-round blind signature protocol based on the random oracle heuristic and the hardness of standard lattice problems (Ring/Module-SIS/LWE and NTRU) with a signature size of 22 KB. The protocol is round-optimal and has a transcript size that can be as small as 60 KB. This blind signature is around 4 times shorter than the most compact lattice-based scheme based on standard assumptions of del Pino and Katsumata (Crypto 2022) and around 2 times shorter than the scheme of Agrawal et al. (CCS 2022) based on their newly-proposed one-more-ISIS assumption. We also propose a "keyed-verification" blind signature scheme in which the verifier and the signer need to share a secret key. This scheme has a smaller signature size of only 48 bytes, but further work is needed to explore the efficiency of its signature generation protocol.

TI Efficient Algorithms for All Port-Based Teleportation Protocols
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a form of quantum teleportation in which no corrective unitary is required on the part of the receiver. Two primary regimes exist-deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two further regimes exist within each of these, in which the resource state used for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state or free to be optimized. Recent works have resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols). Our approach to the implementation of the square-root measurement in PBT can be directly generalized to other highly symmetric state ensembles. For certain families of states, such a framework yields efficient algorithms in the case in which the Petz-recovery algorithm for the square-root measurement runs in exponential time.

TI Mesoscopic quantum thermo-mechanics: A new frontier of experimental
   physics
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB In the last decade, experimentalists have demonstrated their impressive ability to control mechanical modes within mesoscopic objects down to the quantum level: it is now possible to create mechanical Fock states, to entangle mechanical modes from distinct objects, and to store quantum information or transfer it from one quantum bit to another, among the many possibilities found in today's literature. Indeed, mechanics is quantum, very much like spins or electromagnetic degrees of freedom; and all of this is, in particular, referred to as a new engineering resource for quantum technologies. However, there is also much more beyond this utilitarian aspect: invoking the original discussions of Braginsky and Caves, where a quantum oscillator is thought of as a quantum detector for a classical field, namely, a gravitational wave, which is also a unique sensing capability for quantum fields. The subject of study is then the baths to which the mechanical mode is coupled to, let them be known or unknown in nature. This Perspective is about this new potentiality that addresses stochastic thermodynamics, potentially down to its quantum version, the search for a fundamental underlying (random) field postulated in recent theories that can be affiliated to the class of the wave-function collapse models, and more generally open questions of condensed matter like the actual nature of the elusive (and ubiquitous) two-level systems present within all mechanical objects. However, such research turns out to be much more demanding than the use of a few quantum mechanical modes: all the known baths have to be identified, experiments have to be conducted in-equilibrium, and the word "mechanics" needs to be justified by a real ability to move substantially the center-of-mass when a proper drive tone is applied to the system.

TI Quantum phase transitions of anisotropic dipolar bosons under artificial
   magnetic field
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum system composed of optical lattice and ultracold atomic gas is an ideal platform for realizing quantum simulation and quantum computing. Especially for dipolar bosons in optical lattices with artificial gauge fields, the interplay between anisotropic dipolar interactions and artificial gauge fields leads to many novel phases. Exploring the phase transition characteristics of the system is beneficial to understanding the physics of quantum many-body systems and observing quantum states of dipolar system in experiments. In this work, we investigate the quantum phase transitions of anisotropic dipolar bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice with an artificial magnetic field. Using an inhomogeneous mean-field method and a Landau phase transition theory, we obtain complete phase diagrams and analytical expressions for phase boundaries between an incompressible phase and a compressible phase. Our results show that both the artificial magnetic field and the anisotropic dipolar interaction have a significant effect on the phase diagram. When the polar angle increases, the system undergoes the phase transition from a checkerboard supersolid to a striped supersolid. For small polar angle (V-x/U - 0.2 , V-y/U - 0.1, Fig.(a)), artificial magnetic field induces both checkerboard solid phase and supersolid phase to extend to a large hopping region. For a larger polar angle (V-x/U = 0.2 , V-y/U = - 0.1, Fig.(b)), artificial magnetic field induces both striped solid and striped supersolid to extend to a large hopping region. Thus, the artificial magnetic field stabilizes the density wave and supersolid phases. In addition, we reveal the coexistence of different quantum phases in the presence of an external trapping potential. The research results provide a theoretical basis for manipulating the quantum phase in experiments on anisotropic dipolar atoms by using an artificial magnetic field.

TI Wet-Oxidation-Assisted Chemical Mechanical Polishing and
   High-Temperature Thermal Annealing for Low-Loss 4H-SiC Integrated
   Photonic Devices
SO MATERIALS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) has become a promising optical material for quantum photonics and nonlinear photonics during the past decade. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the 4H-SiC thin film quality for SiC integrated photonic chips. Firstly, we develop a wet-oxidation-assisted chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process for 4H-SiC, which can significantly decrease the surface roughness from 3.67 nm to 0.15 nm, thus mitigating the light scattering loss. Secondly, we find that the thermal annealing of the 4H-SiC devices at 1300 degrees C can help to decrease the material absorption loss. We experimentally demonstrate that the wet-oxidation-assisted CMP and the high-temperature annealing can effectively increase the intrinsic quality factor of the 4H-SiC optical microring resonators.

SO PHOTONICS
AB A bio-photonic cavity quantum electrodynamic (C-QED) framework could be imagined as a system in which both the "cavity " and the "atom " participating in the light-matter interaction scenario are bio-inspired. Can a cavity be made of a bio-polymer? If so, how should such a cavity appear and what are the best polymers to fabricate it? Can a bioluminescent material stand the comparison with new-fashion semiconductors? In this review we answer these fundamental questions to pave the way toward an eco-friendly paradigm, in which the ever-increasing demand for more performing quantum photonics technologies meets the ever-increasing yet silent demand of our planet to reduce our environmental footprint.

TI Broadband bandpass Purcell filter for circuit quantum electrodynamics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In circuit quantum electrodynamics, qubits are typically measured using dispersively coupled readout resonators. Coupling between each readout resonator and its electrical environment, however, reduces the qubit lifetime via the Purcell effect. Inserting a Purcell filter counters this effect while maintaining high readout fidelity but reduces measurement bandwidth and, thus, limits multiplexing readout capacity. In this Letter, we develop and implement a multi-stage bandpass Purcell filter that yields better qubit protection while simultaneously increasing measurement bandwidth and multiplexed capacity. We report on the experimental performance of our transmission-line-based implementation of this approach, a flexible design that can easily be integrated with current scaled-up, long coherence time superconducting quantum processors.

TI A Classical Formulation of Quantum Theory?
SO ENTROPY
AB We explore a particular way of reformulating quantum theory in classical terms, starting with phase space rather than Hilbert space, and with actual probability distributions rather than quasiprobabilities. The classical picture we start with is epistemically restricted, in the spirit of a model introduced by Spekkens. We obtain quantum theory only by combining a collection of restricted classical pictures. Our main challenge in this paper is to find a simple way of characterizing the allowed sets of classical pictures. We present one promising approach to this problem and show how it works out for the case of a single qubit.

TI ECC scanning attack with improved Grover algorithms
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Scan-based attacks represent a category of side-channel attacks that pose potential risks to elliptic curve cryptosystems. A critical computational element in such attacks is the unstructured search of the scan data. The Grover algorithm, a quantum algorithm for the unstructured search, achieves quadratic speedup over classical methods, making it a promising tool for enhancing scan-based attacks in the quantum context. In this paper, we propose two methods to improve the Grover algorithm used in the ECC scan-based attack. These methods reduce the depth of the quantum circuit by over 85% compared with the Grover-Long algorithm, thus improving the feasibility of the Grover algorithm in scan-based attacks in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Stabilizing volume-law entangled states of fermions and qubits using
   local dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We analyze a general method for the dissipative preparation and stabilization of volume-law entangled states of fermionic and qubit lattice systems in one dimension (and higher dimensions for fermions). Our approach requires minimal resources: nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian interactions that obey a suitable chiral symmetry, and the realization of just a single, spatially localized dissipative pairing interaction. In the case of a qubit array, the dissipative model we study maps to an interacting fermionic problem. Nonetheless, we analytically show the existence of a unique pure entangled steady state (a so-called rainbow state). Our ideas are compatible with a number of experimental platforms, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions.

TI Quantum digital cooling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a method for digital preparation of ground states of simulated Hamiltonians, inspired by cooling in nature and adapted to leverage the capabilities of digital quantum hardware. The cold bath is simulated by a single ancillary qubit, which is reset periodically and coupled to the system nonperturbatively. Studying this cooling method on a 1-qubit system toy model, we optimize two cooling protocols based on weak-coupling and strong-coupling approaches. Extending the insight from the 1-qubit system model, we develop two scalable protocols for larger systems. The LogSweep protocol extends the weak-coupling approach by sweeping energies to resonantly match any targeted transition. We test LogSweep on the 1D transverse-field Ising model, demonstrating approximate ground-state preparation with an error that can be made polynomially small in the computation time for all three phases of the system. The BangBang protocol extends the strong-coupling approach, and exploits a heuristics for local Hamiltonians to maximize the probability of deexciting system transitions in the shortest possible time. Although this protocol does not promise long-time convergence, it allows for a rapid cooling to an approximation of the ground state, making this protocol appealing for near-term demonstrations.

TI Cold ion beam in a storage ring as a platform for large-scale quantum
   computers and simulators: Challenges and directions for research and
   development
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW ACCELERATORS AND BEAMS
AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of constructing a large-scale storage-ring-type iontrap system capable of storing, cooling, and controlling a large number of ions as a platform for scalable quantum computing (QC) and quantum simulations. In such a trap, the ions form a crystalline beam moving along a circular path with a constant velocity determined by the frequency and intensity of the cooling lasers. In this paper, we consider a large leap forward in terms of the number of ions that serve as qubits in QC, from fewer than 100 available in state of the art linear ion-trap devices today to an order of 105 crystallized ions in the storage-ring setup. This new trap design unifies two different concepts: the storage rings of charged particles and the linear ion traps used for QC and mass spectrometry. In this paper, we use the language of particle accelerators to discuss the ion state and dynamics. We outline the differences between the above concepts, analyze challenges of the large ring with a revolving chain of ions, and propose goals for the research and development required to enable future quantum computers with 1000 times more qubits than available today. The challenge of creating such a large-scale quantum system while maintaining the necessary coherence of the qubits and the high fidelity of quantum logic operations is significant. Performing analog quantum simulations may be an achievable initial goal for such a device. Quantum calculations and simulations of complex quantum systems will move forward both the fundamental science and the applied research. Nuclear and particle physics, many-body quantum systems, lattice gauge theories, and nuclear structure calculations are just a few examples in which a largescale quantum simulation system will become a very powerful tool to move forward our understanding of nature.

TI Syndrome decoding with MRHS solver
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB syndrome decoding problem (SDP) is an NP-complete problem that has important applications in the development of post-quantum cryptography. Currently, the most efficient algorithms for SDP are based on the Information Set Decoding (ISD) approach that leverages efficiently time-memory and probability trade-offs. In our contribution, we explore a different approach based on transforming an instance of the SDP problem into a so-called Multiple Right-Hand-Sides (MRHS) Equation system. The MRHS system is then solved with a specialized MRHS solver. We explore how difficult is to solve (small) instances of SDP in MRHS form, and which trade-offs and parametric selections lead to the best results. Although our practical results are worse than those obtained by ISD, we believe that they show a better understanding of the connection between SDP and its MRHS representation, and can be a basis for future improvements.

TI Dynamic Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing With a Trusted Party Based on

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper proposes a dynamic multiparty to multiparty quantum secret sharing scheme, where two distant groups of participants can share the common secrets. In our present scheme, a trusted third party is required to reliably prepare all quantum resources. Each agent only needs to perform the local unitary operations or single-particle measurement completing the process of secret sharing. Secret can be recovered only if all agents cooperate each other. Furthermore, a new agent can be added or deleted from the current scheme with the help of the trusted third party. Finally, security analysis shows that our scheme can resist various common attacks. Compared to former existing researches, our scheme can be more efficient in real application.

TI Topology optimization using combination of quantum-inspired computing
   and genetic algorithm
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS AND MECHANICS
AB This paper introduces an improved approach to topology optimization that combines the strengths of Digital Annealer (DA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This method eliminates the need for expert-driven formulation, thereby expanding its potential applications. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its successful application in optimizing the shape of a magnetic shield. The high-speed search capability of DA on the approximate model and the global search capability of GA synergistically enhance optimization performance.

TI Correlation constraints and the Bloch geometry of two qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an inequality on the purity of a bipartite state depending solely on the length difference of the local Bloch vectors. For two qubits this inequality is tight for all marginal states and so extends the previously known solution for the two-qubit marginal problem. With this inequality we construct a three-dimensional Bloch model of the two-qubit quantum state space in terms of Bloch lengths, providing a pleasing visualization of this high-dimensional state space. This allows to characterize quantum states by a strongly reduced set of parameters and to investigate the interplay between local properties of the marginal systems and global properties encoded in the correlations.

TI Quantum Instruction Set Design for Performance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A quantum instruction set is where quantum hardware and software meet. We develop characterization and compilation techniques for non-Clifford gates to accurately evaluate its designs. Applying these techniques to our fluxonium processor, we show that replacing the iSWAP gate by its square root SQiSW leads to a significant performance boost at almost no cost. More precisely, on SQiSW we measure a gate fidelity of up to 99.72% and averaging at 99.31%, and realize Haar random two-qubit gates with an average fidelity of 96.38%. This is an average error reduction of 41% for the former and a 50% reduction for the latter compared to using iSWAP on the same processor.

TI Electrically driven spin resonance with bichromatic driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Electrically driven spin resonance (EDSR) is an established tool for controlling semiconductor spin qubits. Here, we theoretically study a frequency-mixing variant of EDSR, where two driving tones with different drive frequencies are applied, and the resonance condition connects the spin Larmor frequency with the sum of the two drive frequencies. Focusing on flopping-mode operation of a single electron in a double quantum dot with spin-orbit interaction, we calculate the parameter dependence of the Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift. A shared-control spin qubit architecture could benefit from this bichromatic EDSR scheme, as it enables simultaneous single-qubit gates.

TI Constructions and Performance of Hyperbolic and Semi-Hyperbolic Floquet
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We construct families of Floquet codes derived from color-code tilings of closed hyperbolic surfaces. These codes have weight-two check operators, a finite encoding rate and can be decoded efficiently with minimum-weight perfect matching. We also construct semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes, which have improved distance scaling, and are obtained via a fine-graining procedure. Using a circuit-based noise model that assumes direct two-qubit measurements, we show that semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes can be 48 times more efficient than planar honeycomb codes and therefore over 100 times more efficient than alternative compilations of the surface code to two-qubit measurements, even at physical error rates of 0.3% to 1%. We further demonstrate that semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes can have a teraquop footprint of only 32 physical qubits per logical qubit at a noise strength of 0.1%. For standard circuit-level depolarizing noise at p = 0.1%, we find a 30 times improvement over planar honeycomb codes and a 5.6 times improvement over surface codes. Finally, we analyze small instances that are amenable to near-term experiments, including a Floquet code derived from the Bolza surface that encodes four logical qubits into 16 physical qubits.

TI Synthetic Dimensions Using Ultrafast Free Electrons
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We propose a synthetic dimension for ultrafast free electrons based on the discrete energy sidebands in photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). The PINEM synthetic dimension can offer a powerful way to coherently shape or modulate free-electron wave functions in systems such as ultrafast transmission electron microscopes, dielectric laser accelerators, and quantum free-electron lasers. As examples of this paradigm, we demonstrate Bloch oscillations, diffraction management, and linear optics effects such as Talbot self-imaging in the PINEM lattice. These effects show the potential of PINEM synthetic dimensions as a novel quantum simulation platform.

TI Mitigating finite key effects in the BB84 protocol using spontaneous
   parametric sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The transmission of a limited number of quantum states constrains the length of the generated secret key. A parametric down-conversion source addresses this limitation by producing photon pairs, where one photon, the idler, carries the encoded information, while the other, the signal, is used for local detection to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the communication. The separation of transmitted states based on the idler photon detection modifies the emission statistics, creating an effect similar to an intensity modulation scheme. By applying the decoy theory for arbitrary statistics, the secret key rate per quantum state can be increased by up to 40% compared to the BB84 protocol implemented with a 1-decoy intensity, in case of limited block sizes.<br /> (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB CRYSTALS-Kyber has been recently selected by the NIST as a new public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithm to be standardized. This makes it important to assess how well CRYSTALS-Kyber implementations withstand side-channel attacks. Software implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber have already been analyzed and the discovered vulnerabilities were patched in the subsequently released versions. In this paper, we present a profiling side-channel attack on a hardware implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber. Since hardware implementations carry out computations in parallel, they are typically more difficult to break than their software counterparts. We demonstrate a successful message (session key) recovery attack on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber by deep learning-based power analysis. Our results indicate that currently available hardware implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber need better protection against side-channel attacks.

TI A Quantum Genetic Algorithm for Building a Semantic Textual Similarity
   Estimation Framework for Plagiarism Detection Applications
SO ENTROPY
AB The majority of the recent research on text similarity has been focused on machine learning strategies to combat the problem in the educational environment. When the originality of an idea is copied, it increases the difficulty of using a plagiarism detection system in practice, and the system fails. In cases like active-to-passive conversion, phrase structure changes, synonym substitution, and sentence reordering, the present approaches may not be adequate for plagiarism detection. In this article, semantic extraction and the quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) are integrated in a unified framework to identify idea plagiarism with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational time. Semantic similarity measures, which use the WordNet database to extract semantic information, are used to capture a document's idea. In addition, the QGA is adapted to identify the interconnected, cohesive sentences that effectively convey the source document's main idea. QGAs are formulated using the quantum computing paradigm based on qubits and the superposition of states. By using the qubit chromosome as a representation rather than the more traditional binary, numeric, or symbolic representations, the QGA is able to express a linear superposition of solutions with the aim of increasing gene diversity. Due to its fast convergence and strong global search capacity, the QGA is well suited for a parallel structure. The proposed model has been assessed using a PAN 13-14 dataset, and the result indicates the model's ability to achieve significant detection improvement over some of the compared models. The recommended PD model achieves an approximately 20%, 15%, and 10% increase for TPR, PPV, and F-Score compared to GA and hierarchical GA (HGA)-based PD methods, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy rate rises by approximately 10-15% for each increase in the number of samples in the dataset.

TI Annihilating and creating nonlocality without entanglement by
   postmeasurement information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocality without entanglement (NLWE) is a nonlocal quantum phenomenon that arises in separable state discrimination. We show that the availability of the postmeasurement information about the prepared subensemble can affect the occurrence of NLWE in discriminating non-orthogonal nonentangled states. We provide a two-qubit state ensemble consisting of four nonorthogonal separable pure states and show that the postmeasurement information about the prepared subensemble can annihilate NLWE. We also provide another two-qubit state ensemble consisting of four nonorthogonal separable states and show that the postmeasurement information can create NLWE. Our result can provide a useful method to share or hide information using nonorthogonal separable states.

TI Squeezed hole spin qubits in Ge quantum dots with ultrafast gates at low
   power
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hole spin qubits in planar Ge heterostructures are one of the frontrunner platforms for scalable quantum computers. In these systems, the spin-orbit interactions permit efficient all-electric qubit control. We propose a minimal design modification of planar devices that enhances these interactions by orders of magnitude and enables low power ultrafast qubit operations in the GHz range. Our approach is based on an asymmetric potential that strongly squeezes the quantum dot in one direction. This confinement-induced spin-orbit interaction does not rely on microscopic details of the device such as growth direction or strain and could be turned on and off on demand in state-of-the-art qubits.

TI Unconditionally Secure, Wireless-Wired Ground-Satellite-Ground
   Communication Networks Utilizing Classical & Quantum Noise
SO FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS
AB In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security. Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links, KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient satellite communications.The authors explore the value of achieving unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats, including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative, particularly for ground-based systems. Further, this paper highlights the potential for complementary roles of these technologies in hybrid networks: KLJN can facilitate secure key exchanges without QKD for ground communications connected via wire, and QKD could facilitate secure inter-island and direct-to-satellite communications. Through a detailed analysis of implementation challenges, key exchange speeds, and network architectures, this study concludes that KLJN offers significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

TI Theory of three-terminal Andreev spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this Letter, we introduce a next generation of Andreev spin qubits-three-terminal Andreev spin qubits. These qubits outperform two-terminal devices in the speed of two-qubit gates, benefiting from enhanced spin splitting. Our theoretical analysis reveals increased tunability and interqubit coupling mediated by the supercurrent. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive explanation for the results of a recent experiment on a three-terminal device [M. Coraiola et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 031024 (2024)]. We identify the optimal operational regime for single- and two-qubit gates. Moreover, our concise theoretical framework for the equilibrium multiterminal Josephson effect offers significant potential for exploring nontrivial physics in the artificial dimensions of superconducting phase differences--a rapidly growing field of research.

TI Chaos and quantum regimes in n-photon-driven dissipative bosonic
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the steady-state dynamical regimes of boundary-driven, dissipative bosonic chains subjected to n-photon drives. Using the truncated Wigner approximation, we explore how multiphoton drives shape the interplay between quantum fluctuations, nonlinear interactions, and dissipative processes in such quantum systems. We identify two main regimes: a chaotic hydrodynamic regime characterized by the restoration of a local U(1) symmetry, photon saturation due to Kerr nonlinearity, and spatial prethermalization effects and a nonchaotic resonant nonlinear wave (RNW) regime exhibiting sub-Poissonian photon statistics, persistent 7Ln symmetry, and quantum-driven phase decoherence. Our findings reveal the universal nature of the hydrodynamic regime and highlight the RNW regime's sensitivity to boundary driving conditions, suggesting novel routes for quantum state engineering in driven-dissipative quantum devices. These results are experimentally relevant for state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms.

TI Performance Evaluation and Security Analysis of UAV-Based FSO/CV-QKD
   System Employing DP-QPSK/CD
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based on free-space optical (FSO) systems combine the benefits of both the high data rate of the FSO and the mobility of UAV. However, cumulative effects of laser beam divergence and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance in the FSO link might allow an external eavesdropper located near the authorized receiver to break the transmission under certain conditions. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technique of secure communication that employs quantum mechanics-based cryptography principles. A combination of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) and Gaussian modulation of quantum coherent states (GMCS) enables a relatively secure communication system against collective attacks over FSO transmission links. However, the performance is restricted and degraded due to the influence of atmospheric turbulence and excess noise. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of a secured UAV-based FSO system utilizing prepare andmeasure CV-QKD protocol based onGMCSunder collective attack in terms of quantum bit error rate (QBER), outage probability, and secret key rate (SKR) considering the impairments of the FSO channel, link budget, deviations in the position and attitude angles of the UAV, channel fluctuating transmittance, and excess noise. The system parameters, including transmit power, receiver's field-of-view, and beam divergence angle, are optimized to satisfy the system's design criteria of threshold-QBER = 10(-3) and threshold outage probability= 10(-2). The proposed system tolerates boresight displacement up to 7 cm with the optimized values. The Closed-form expressions and analytical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations.

TI Magnetic Field Intervention Enhances Cellular Migration Rates in
   Biological Scaffolds
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB The impact of magnetic fields on cellular function is diverse but can be described at least in part by the radical pair mechanism (RPM), where magnetic field intervention alters reactive oxygen species (ROS) populations and downstream cellular signaling. Here, cellular migration within three-dimensional scaffolds was monitored in an applied oscillating 1.4 MHz radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field with an amplitude of 10 mu T and a static 50 mu T magnetic field. Given that cellular bioenergetics can be altered based on applied RF magnetic fields, this study focused on a magnetic field configuration that increased cellular respiration. Results suggest that RF accelerated cell clustering and elongation after 1 day, with increased levels of clustering and cellular linkage after 7 days. Cell distribution analysis within the scaffolds revealed that the clustering rate during the first day was increased nearly five times in the RF environment. Electron microscopy provided additional topological information and verified the development of fibrous networks, with a cell-derived matrix (CDM) visualized after 7 days in samples maintained in RF. This work demonstrates time-dependent cellular migration that may be influenced by quantum biology (QB) processes and downstream oxidative signaling, enhancing cellular migration behavior.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Bosonic mean-field theories can approximate the dynamics of systems of n bosons provided that n >> 1. We show that there can also be an exact correspondence at finite n when the bosonic system is generalized to include interactions with the environment and the mean-field theory is replaced by a stochastic differential equation. When the n -> infinity limit is taken, the stochastic terms in this differential equation vanish, and a mean-field theory is recovered. Besides providing insight into the differences between the behavior of finite quantum systems and their classical limits given by n -> infinity, the developed mathematics can provide a basis for quantum algorithms that solve some stochastic nonlinear differential equations. We discuss conditions on the efficiency of these quantum algorithms, with a focus on the possibility for the complexity to be polynomial in the log of the stochastic system size. A particular system with the form of a stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation is analyzed in more detail.

TI PauliComposer: compute tensor products of Pauli matrices efficiently
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We introduce a simple algorithm that efficiently computes tensor products of Pauli matrices. This is done by tailoring the calculations to this specific case, which allows to avoid unnecessary calculations. The strength of this strategy is benchmarked against state-of-the-art techniques, showing a remarkable acceleration. As a side product, we provide an optimized method for one key calculus in quantum simulations: the Pauli basis decomposition of Hamiltonians.

TI A (t, n) threshold protocol of semi-quantum secret sharing based
   on single particles
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Semi-quantum secret sharing is an important research issue in quantum cryptography. In this paper, we propose a (t, n) threshold semi-quantum secret sharing protocol, which combines the practicality of semi-quantum secret sharing protocols and the flexibility of (t, n) threshold quantum secret sharing protocols. Participants prepare and transmit single particles in a circular way, and then any t out of n participants can recover the secret according to Shamir's secret sharing scheme. As quantum resources, single particles are easy to prepare. Furthermore, classical participants only need to possess the capability to prepare and insert particles. The security analysis shows our protocol has security against most attacks. Except decoy particles, all particles are useful to carry the secret message, so the efficiency of the proposed protocol can achieve 100%.

TI Continuous Variable Quantum Secret Sharing with Security Enhancement in
   Practical Quantum Communications
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum communications can be conveniently implemented by two participants, but quantum secret key sharing (QSS) through multi-participant communication seems difficult in practice. In this paper, we propose a multi-participant QSS scheme with the local local oscillator (LLO) in continuous variable (CV) quantum communications. It allows an honest participant called a dealer to share a secret key with the others, making it possible to establish a secret key if and only if all participants gather together. The LLO scheme, which eliminates the need for the local oscillator (LO) to be propagated in insecure channels, can be used to avoid the potential LO attack in the traditional CVQSS scheme. Numerical simulation shows that the performance of the LLO-based CVQSS can be improved in terms of the maximal transmission distance even if it is performed with the partially trusted noise.

TI Hybrid classical-quantum sampling for lattice scalar field theory
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate lattice scalar field theory in two-dimensional Euclidean space via a quantum annealer. To accommodate the quartic interaction terms, we introduce three schemes for rewriting them as quadratic polynomials through the use of auxiliary qubits. These methods are applied on D-Wave quantum annealer, and their effectiveness is assessed by examining the annealer-generated distributions. Using these distributions, we perform Monte Carlo sampling via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and compare the outcomes with those from classical local Metropolis simulations.

TI Revocation and reconstruction of shared quantum states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting, and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state [1]. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonesta, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four-qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.

TI Off-resonant modulated driving gate protocols for two-photon ground-
   Rydberg transition and finite Rydberg blockade strength
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Recently, the concept of two-qubit controlled phase gate via off-resonant modulated driving has been introduced into the neutral atom qubit platform, with respect to both singlephoton and two-photon ground-Rydberg transitions. In order to reach a better performance practically, further developments are in need to overcome a few known limitations in previous discussions. Here, we thoroughly analyze a variety of modulation styles for two-photon transitions, demonstrating the versatility of off-resonant modulated driving protocols. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to refine the designing process for improved performances for specific finite Rydberg blockade strength values. In particular, a reduced requirement on the blockade strength can be directly linked to an improvement of connectivity in qubit array of neutral atoms. These progress are closely related to the core feature that the atomic wave function acquires a geometric phase from the time evolution, which begins and finishes at the same quantum state. Under reasonable experimental conditions readily available nowadays, we anticipate that the fidelity of such protocols can reach as high as the essential requirement of NISQ even if the effects of technical errors and cold atoms' nonzero temperatures are considered.

TI Lindblad Tomography of a Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB As progress is made towards the first generation of error-corrected quantum computers, robust char-acterization and validation protocols are required to assess the noise environments of physical quantum processors. While standard coherence metrics and characterization protocols such as T1 and T2, process tomography, and randomized benchmarking are now ubiquitous, these techniques provide only partial information about the dynamic multiqubit loss channels responsible for processor errors, which can be described more fully by a Lindblad operator in the master equation formalism. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate Lindblad tomography, a hardware-agnostic characterization protocol for tomographically reconstructing the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators of a quantum noise environment from an ensemble of time-domain measurements. Performing Lindblad tomography on a small supercon-ducting quantum processor, we show that this technique naturally builds on standard process tomography and T1/T2 measurement protocols, characterizes and accounts for state-preparation and measurement errors, and allows one to place bounds on the fit to a Markovian model. Comparing the results of single -and two-qubit measurements on a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate that Lindblad tomography can also be used to identify and quantify sources of crosstalk on quantum processors, such as the presence of always-on qubit-qubit interactions.

TI Geometric Superinductance Qubits: Controlling Phase Delocalization
   across aSingle Josephson Junction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB There are two elementary superconducting qubit types that derive directly from the quantum harmonic oscillator. In one, the inductor is replaced by a nonlinear Josephson junction to realize the widely used charge qubits with a compact phase variable and a discrete charge wave function. In the other, the junction is added in parallel, which gives rise to an extended phase variable, continuous wave functions, and a rich energy-level structure due to the loop topology. While the corresponding rf superconducting quantum interference device Hamiltonian was introduced as a quadratic quasi-one-dimensional potential approximation to describe the fluxonium qubit implemented with long Josephson-junction arrays, in this work we implement it directly using a linear superinductor formed by a single uninterrupted aluminum wire. We present a large variety of qubits, all stemming from the same circuit but with drastically different characteristic energy scales. This includes flux and fluxonium qubits but also the recently introduced quasicharge qubit with strongly enhanced zero-point phase fluctuations and a heavily suppressed flux dispersion. The use of a geometric inductor results in high reproducibility of the inductive energy as guaranteed by top-down lithography-a key ingredient for intrinsically protected superconducting qubits.

TI Riemannian approach to the Lindbladian dynamics of a locally purified
   tensor network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network Ansatz known as the locally purified density operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in nonphysical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified Ansatz.

TI Isotope-specific lithium bioactivity - physiological reality or
   laboratory oddity?
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB The efficacy of lithium in treating bipolar disorder is well established, yet its precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. A frequently overlooked dimension is the natural occurrence of two stable lithium isotopes (6Li and 7Li), which differ significantly in mass and nuclear spin and may therefore exhibit distinct bioactivity within living systems. Evidence from multiple rodent studies demonstrates isotope-dependent behaviour effects, suggesting translational relevance. Mechanistic exploration indicates that while classical lithium targets such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and myo-inositol monophosphatase do not discriminate between isotopes, differential effects emerge at the level of mitochondrial calcium handling. Lithium isotopes modulate the calcium storage capacity of brain mitochondria, potentially via incorporation into amorphous calcium phosphate structures, which form crucial calcium depots within the mitochondrial matrix. The physical basis may involve isotope-dependent differences in mass or nuclear spin, possibly interacting with amorphous calcium phosphate or influencing radical pair formation, situating these findings within the rapidly expanding field of quantum biology. However, critical experimental gaps remain, particularly regarding whether isotope-specific mitochondrial effects translate to changes in neuronal signaling. Addressing these gaps through targeted physiological and clinical studies could clarify whether lithium isotope bioactivity is a laboratory curiosity or a tractable quantum biological phenomenon with therapeutic potential.

TI Advances in Magnetics Roadmap on Spin-Wave Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS
AB Magnonics addresses the physical properties of spin waves and utilizes them for data processing. Scalability down to atomic dimensions, operation in the GHz-to-THz frequency range, utilization of nonlinear and nonreciprocal phenomena, and compatibility with CMOS are just a few of many advantages offered by magnons. Although magnonics is still primarily positioned in the academic domain, the scientific and technological challenges of the field are being extensively investigated, and many proof-of-concept prototypes have already been realized in laboratories. This roadmap is a product of the collective work of many authors, which covers versatile spin-wave computing approaches, conceptual building blocks, and underlying physical phenomena. In particular, the roadmap discusses the computation operations with the Boolean digital data, unconventional approaches, such as neuromorphic computing, and the progress toward magnon-based quantum computing. This article is organized as a collection of sub-sections grouped into seven large thematic sections. Each sub-section is prepared by one or a group of authors and concludes with a brief description of current challenges and the outlook of further development for each research direction.

TI Quantum stabilizer codes, lattices, and CFTs
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB There is a rich connection between classical error-correcting codes, Euclidean lattices, and chiral conformal field theories. Here we show that quantum error-correcting codes, those of the stabilizer type, are related to Lorentzian lattices and non-chiral CFTs. More specifically, real self-dual stabilizer codes can be associated with even self-dual Lorentzian lattices, and thus define Narain CFTs. We dub the resulting theories code CFTs and study their properties. T-duality transformations of a code CFT, at the level of the underlying code, reduce to code equivalences. By means of such equivalences, any stabilizer code can be reduced to a graph code. We can therefore represent code CFTs by graphs. We study code CFTs with small central charge c = n <= 12, and find many interesting examples. Among them is a non-chiral E-8 theory, which is based on the root lattice of E-8 understood as an even self-dual Lorentzian lattice. By analyzing all graphs with n <= 8 nodes we find many pairs and triples of physically distinct isospectral theories. We also construct numerous modular invariant functions satisfying all the basic properties expected of the CFT partition function, yet which are not partition functions of any known CFTs. We consider the ensemble average over all code theories, calculate the corresponding partition function, and discuss its possible holographic interpretation. The paper is written in a self-contained manner, and includes an extensive pedagogical introduction and many explicit examples.

TI Quantum and Randomised Algorithms for Non-linearity Estimation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Non-linearity of a Boolean function indicates how far it is from any linear function. Despite there being several strong results about identifying a linear function and distinguishing one froma sufficiently non-linear function, we found a surprising lack of work on computing the non-linearity of a function. The non-linearity is related to the Walsh coefficient with the largest absolute value; however, the naive attempt of picking the maximum after constructing a Walsh spectrum requires Theta(2(n)) queries to an n-bit function. We improve the scenario by designing highly efficient quantum and randomised algorithms to approximate the non-linearity allowing additive error, denoted lambda, with query complexities that depend polynomially on lambda. We prove lower bounds to show that these are not very far from the optimal ones. The number of queries made by our randomised algorithm is linear in n, already an exponential improvement, and the number of queries made by our quantum algorithm is surprisingly independent of n. Our randomised algorithm uses a Goldreich-Levin style of navigating all Walsh coefficients and our quantum algorithm uses a clever combination of Deutsch-Jozsa, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation to improve upon the existing quantum versions of the Goldreich-Levin technique.

TI Toward Practical Entanglement-Based Satellite FSO/QKD Systems Using
   Dual-Threshold/Direct Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a new implementation of the BBM92 protocol for satellite continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems using the dual-threshold/direct detection (DT/DD) scheme. The proposed system is less complex and therefore possibly cheaper than current discrete-variable (DV) and CV-QKD ones using coherent detection receivers. We model and analyze the performance of the proposed system in the context that a satellite distributes secret keys to two legitimate users. The analytical results are derived by considering channel loss, atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, and receiver noises. The Gaussian beam model is considered to evaluate the impact of geometric spread on the signal received by legitimate users and the possibility of being eavesdropped. Based on the design criteria for the system and analytical results, we investigate the feasibility of a case study for the Japan QKD network using the existing low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation.

TI Quantum mold casting for topological insulating and edge states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the possibility of transferring fermions from a trivial system as a particle source to an empty system but in the topological phase as a mold for casting a stable topological insulator dynamically. We show that this can be realized by a non-Hermitian unidirectional hopping, which connects a central system at topological phase and a trivial flat-band system with a periodic driving chemical potential, which scans over the valence band of the central system. The near exceptional point dynamics allows a unidirectional dynamical process: the time evolution from an initial state with a fully filled source system to approximately a stable topological insulating state. The result is demonstrated numerically by a source-assistant Qi-Wu-Zhang model and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in the presence of random perturbation. Our finding reveals a classical analogy of quench dynamics in quantum matter and provides a way for topological quantum state engineering.

TI Telecom-to-visible quantum frequency converter on a silicon nitride chip
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum frequency conversion serves a key role in the realization of hybrid quantum networks by interfacing between wavelength-incompatible platforms. Here we present what is believed to be the first quantum frequency converter connecting visible and telecom domains on a silicon nitride (SiN) chip, using Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing to upconvert heralded single photons from 1260 to 698 nm, which covers a 192 THz span. We examine the noise sources in SiN and devise approaches to suppress noise photons at the source and target frequencies to enable measurements at the single-photon level. We demonstrate an on-chip conversion efficiency of 5% in photon flux and describe design modifications that can be implemented to significantly improve it. Our results pave the way for the implementation of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible devices in quantum networks.

TI Improved bound on entropy production in a quantum annealer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB For a system described by a multivariate probability density function obeying the fluctuation theorem, the average dissipation is lower bounded by the degree of asymmetry of the marginal distributions (namely the relative entropy between the marginal and its mirror image). We formally prove that such a lower bound is tighter than the recently reported bound expressed in terms of the precision of the marginal (i.e., the thermodynamic uncertainty relation) and is saturable. We illustrate the result with examples and we apply it to achieve one of the most accurate experimental estimations of dissipation associated with quantum annealing to date.

TI Phase-locking matter-wave interferometer of vortex states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Matter-wave interferometer of ultracold atoms with different linear momenta has been extensively studied in theory and experiment. The vortex matter-wave interferometer with different angular momenta is applicable as a quantum sensor for measuring the magnetic field, rotation, geometric phase, etc. Here we report the experimental realization of a vortex matter-wave interferometer by coherently transferring the optical angular momentum to an ultracold Bose condensate. We use the angular interference technique to measure the relative phase of two vortex states. For a lossless interferometer with atoms only populating two spin states, the difference between the relative phases in the two spin states is locked to pi. We also prove the robustness of this out-of-phase relation, not sensitive to the angular-momentum difference between two vortex states, constituent of Raman optical fields and expansion of the condensate. The experimental results agree well with the calculation from the unitary evolution of wave packet in quantum mechanics. This work opens a new way to build a quantum sensor based on the vortex matter-wave interference.

TI QbC: Quantum Correctness by Construction
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Thanks to the rapid progress and growing complexity of quantum algorithms, correctness of quantum programs has become a major concern. Pioneering research over the past years has proposed various approaches to formally verify quantum programs using proof systems such as quantum Hoare logic. All these prior approaches are post-hoc: one first implements a program and only then verifies its correctness. Here we propose Quantum Correctness by Construction (QbC): an approach to constructing quantum programs from their specification in a way that ensures correctness. We use pre-and postconditions to specify program properties, and propose sound and complete refinement rules for constructing programs in a quantum while language from their specification. We validate QbC by constructing quantum programs for idiomatic problems and patterns. We find that the approach naturally suggests how to derive program details, highlighting key design choices along the way. As such, we believe that QbC can play a role in supporting the design and taxonomization of quantum algorithms and software.

TI Capabilities and limits of the unitary coupled-cluster approach with
   generalized two-body cluster operators
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Unitary cluster expansions of the electronic wavefunction have recently gained much interest because of their use in conjunction with quantum algorithms. In this contribution, we investigate some aspects of an ansatz, using generalized two-body excitation operators, which have been considered in some recent studies on quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. Our numerical results show that, in particular, two-body operators with effective particle-hole excitation level of one in connection with the usual particle-hole double excitation operators lead to a very accurate, yet compact representation of the wavefunction. Generalized two-body operators with effective excitation rank zero have a considerably less pronounced effect. We compare with standard and unitary coupled-cluster expansions and show that the above mentioned approach matches or even surpasses the accuracy of expansions with three-body particle-hole excitations, in particular at the onset of strong correlation. A downside of the approach is that it is rather difficult to rigorously converge it to its variational minimum.

TI Security of hybrid BB84 with heterodyne detection
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises everlasting security based on the laws of physics. Most common protocols are grouped into two distinct categories based on the degrees of freedom used to carry information, which can be either discrete or continuous, each presenting unique advantages in either performance, feasibility for near-term implementation, and compatibility with existing telecommunications architectures. Recently, hybrid QKD protocols have been introduced to leverage advantages from both categories. In this work we provide a rigorous security proof for a protocol introduced by Qi in 2021, where information is encoded in discrete variables as in the widespread Bennett Brassard 1984 protocol but decoded continuously via heterodyne detection. Security proofs for hybrid protocols inherit the same challenges associated with continuous-variable protocols due to unbounded dimensions. Here we successfully address these challenges by exploiting symmetry. Our approach enables truncation of the Hilbert space with precise control of the approximation errors and lead to a tight, semi-analytical expression for the asymptotic key rate under collective attacks. As concrete examples, we apply our theory to compute the key rates under passive attacks, linear loss, and Gaussian noise.

TI Optimized emulation of quantum magnetometry via superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum magnetometry based on adaptive phase estimation allows for Heisenberg precision while avoiding creation and maintenance of complex entangled states. However, the absolute sensitivity is limited by the nonoptimal use of quantum resources provided by multiple-qubit devices and algorithmic realizations of the protocol. Here, addressing both issues, we advance the time-ascending phase estimation protocol by numerical improvements of Bayesian learning, i.e., sequential updating of the field distribution, and optimal exploitation of resources provided by unentangled qubits with limited coherence. Such algorithmic improvements are used to evaluate the absolute sensitivity both on a simulator and by pulsed-transmon experiments conducted on the IBMQ platform, where we take advantage of high coherence time. In addition, we compare the proficiency of separable and entangled states for magnetometry and show that, in practice, separable states provide superior performance. Flux-sensing emulation experiments demonstrate that a sensitivity of (0.17-1.74) mu Phi(0) (root Hz)(-1) (where Phi(0) is the flux quantum) for a single-qubit magnetometer and (0.06-0.65) mu Phi(0) (root Hz)(-1) for a five-qubit magnetometer can be achieved for slowly oscillating 1-10 kHz magnetic fields, which is comparable to more established experimental platforms for magnetometry.

TI Quantum tomography beyond the leading order
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum tomography, as a tool to probe foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, relies on extracting spin information from angular distributions. This is inherently a leading-order technique, ill-defined when higher-order corrections are significant. For those cases, we propose to treat higher-order corrections as a background, to be modeled and subtracted from data in the same way as other backgrounds are. We illustrate this procedure for Higgs decays H -> ZZ -> e+e-mu+mu-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow e<^>+ e<^>- \mu <^>+ \mu <^>-$$\end{document}, which is of high interest for upcoming qutrit entanglement tests at the Large Hadron Collider.

TI Quantum-parallel vectorized data encodings and computations on
   trapped-ion and transmon QPUs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Compact data representations in quantum systems are crucial for the development of quantum algorithms for data analysis. In this study, we present two innovative data encoding techniques, known as QCrank and QBArt, which exhibit significant quantum parallelism via uniformly controlled rotation gates. The QCrank method encodes a series of real-valued data as rotations on data qubits, resulting in increased storage capacity. On the other hand, QBArt directly incorporates a binary representation of the data within the computational basis, requiring fewer quantum measurements and enabling well-established arithmetic operations on binary data. We showcase various applications of the proposed encoding methods for various data types. Notably, we demonstrate quantum algorithms for tasks such as DNA pattern matching, Hamming weight computation, complex value conjugation, and the retrieval of a binary image with 384 pixels, all executed on the Quantinuum trapped-ion QPU. Furthermore, we employ several cloud-accessible QPUs, including those from IBMQ and IonQ, to conduct supplementary benchmarking experiments.

TI AI-Enhanced Quantum-Secured IoT Communication Framework for 6G Cognitive
   Radio Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advent of 6G wireless communication promises improvements in signal coverage, data rates, and latency, addressing increased connectivity demands due to the proliferation of 5G, IoT, and augmented reality. This paper introduces a Quantum-Secured IoT Communication Framework designed for 6G Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in order to cater to the growing need for dependable and protected connectivity. Noteworthy aspects of this framework encompass dual-layer authentication utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), secured spectrum access regulations, and efficient beamforming strategies. Moreover, the framework employs a Reinforcement Learning-based Ensemble Regression (RL-ER) model for spectrum sensing and a Multi-Layer Perceptron with Kalman Filter (MLP-KF) for Channel State Information (CSI) prediction. Simulations demonstrate that the framework significantly improves prediction accuracy, encryption and decryption times, and error rates, thereby enhancing IoT network performance with better signal coverage, reduced latency, and robust security.

TI Demonstration of atom interrogation using photonic integrated circuits
   anodically bonded to ultra-high vacuum envelopes for epoxy-free scalable
   quantum sensors
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Reliable integration of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) into quantum sensors has the potential to drastically reduce sensor size, ease manufacturing scalability, and improve performance in applications where the sensor is subject to high accelerations, vibrations, and temperature changes. In a traditional quantum sensor assembly, free-space optics are subject to pointing inaccuracies and temperature-dependent misalignment. Moreover, the use of epoxy or sealants for affixing either free-space optics or PICs within a sensor vacuum envelope leads to sensor vacuum degradation and is difficult to scale. In this paper, we describe the hermetic integration of a PIC with a vacuum envelope via anodic bonding. We demonstrate utility of this assembly with two proof-of-concept atom-interrogation experiments: (i) spectroscopy of a cold-atom sample using a grating-emitted probe; (ii) spectroscopy of alkali atoms using an evanescent field from an exposed ridge waveguide. This work shows a key process step on a path to quantum sensor manufacturing scalability. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

Current physical realizations of qubits require a careful calibration, composed by different experiments, due to noise and decoherence phenomena. Among the different characterization experiments, a crucial step is to develop a model to classify the measured state by discriminating the ground state from the excited state. In this proceedings we benchmark multiple classification techniques applied to real quantum devices.

TI Frequency-Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Quantum Dense Coding
   with Broadband Entanglement
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum dense coding (QDC) provides great potential for high-capacity quantum communication. However, it is highly demanded for practical applications to realize high-capacity QDC with multiple coded information. Here, a high-capacity QDC with multiple streams is reported in different channels simultaneously through frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). The broadband entangled state is generated from a pair of degenerate optic al parametric amplifiers with short cavity lengths. Based on the resultant broadband entanglement, multiple pieces of information coded using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) are transferred with the FDM method. As an experimental demonstration, four pieces of information composed of pseudo-random numbers are transmitted at a rate of 4 Mbit s-1 using BPSK encoding. The decoded bit error rate reaches 10-3$ 10<^>{-3}$, which is an average 35-fold improvement compared with the classical scheme. Furthermore, it is possible to make full use of sideband resource for four different information by using orthogonal FDM. This scheme can be extended to more different information by directly increasing the FDM sideband subchannels, and opens an avenue to construct high-capacity quantum communication, while minimizing the cost of quantum resource.

TI Long-Lived Circular Rydberg Qubits of Alkaline-Earth Atoms in Optical
   Tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-n (n = 79) circular states of Sr-88. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular-state tweezer trapping exploiting the Srthorn core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.

TI Sequential Discrimination of Mixed Quantum States
SO ENTROPY
AB Classical mixtures of quantum states often give rise to decoherence and are generally considered detrimental to quantum processing. However, in the framework of sequential measurement, such mixtures can be beneficial for state discrimination. We investigate the sequential discrimination of mixed states and compare the results with those of pure states under the condition of equal fidelity. It is found that the successful probability of the mixed-state protocol is superior to the pure one under the equal-fidelity condition. It is shown that the difference between the sequential discrimination of pure and mixed states is more reliable under the equal-fidelity condition than under single-shot discrimination, and this difference increases with the mixability of the initial mixed states. For scenarios in which classical communication is allowed, the optimal successful probability of pure-state discriminations is larger than that for mixed states on the contrary. We also show that the classical mixture of basic vectors from quantum decoherence has a subtle impact on the communication channel induced by the coincidence of the maximal mutual information and optimal successful probability of sequential discrimination for pure states.

TI Error Propagation in NISQ Devices for Solving Classical Optimization
   Problems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a random circuit model that attempts to capture the behavior of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices when used for variationally solving classical optimization problems. Our model accounts for the propagation of arbitrary single-qubit errors through the circuit. We find that, even with a small noise rate, the quality of the obtained optima implies that a single-qubit error rate of 1/(nD) (where n is the number of qubits and D is the circuit depth) is needed for the possibility of a quantum advantage. We estimate that this translates to an error rate lower than 10-6 using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for classical optimization problems with two-dimensional circuits.

TI Multimode physics of the unimon circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a superconducting half-wavelength resonator that is grounded at its both ends and contains a single Josephson junction. Previously this circuit was considered as a unimon qubit in the single-mode approximation where dc-phase-biasing the junction to pi leads to increased anharmonicity and 99.9% experimentally observed single-qubit gate fidelity. Inspired by the promising first experimental results, we develop here a theoretical and numerical model for the detailed understanding of the multimode physics of the unimon circuit. To this end, first, we consider the high-frequency modes of the unimon circuit and find that even though these modes are at their ground state, they imply a significant renormalization to the Josephson energy. We introduce an efficient method to fully account for the relevant modes and show that unexcited high-lying modes lead to corrections in the qubit energy and anharmonicity. Interestingly, provided that the junction is offset from the middle of the circuit, we find strong cross-Kerr coupling strengths between a few low-lying modes. This observation paves the way for the utilization of the multimode structure, for example, as several qubits embedded into a single unimon circuit.

   Quantum Optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In this Letter, we show that by combining quantum metrology and networking tools, it is possible to extend the baseline of an interferometric optical telescope and thus improve diffraction-limited imaging of point source positions. The quantum interferometer is based on single-photon sources, linear optical circuits, and efficient photon number counters. Surprisingly, with thermal (stellar) sources of low photon number per mode and high transmission losses across the baseline, the detected photon probability distribution still retains a large amount of Fisher information about the source position, allowing for a significant improvement in the resolution of positioning point sources, on the order of 10 mu as. Our proposal can be implemented with current technology. In particular, our proposal does not require experimental optical quantum memories.

TI Velocity Filtering Using Quantum 3D FFT
SO PHOTONICS
AB In this work, the quantum version of 3D FFT is proposed for constructing velocity filters. Velocity filters are desirable when we need to separate moving objects with a specific velocity range in amplitude and direction in a rapidly changing background. These filters are useful in many application fields, such as for monitoring regions for security reasons or inspecting processes in experimental physics. A faster and more attractive way to implement this filtering procedure is through 3D FFT instead of using 3D FIR filters. Additionally, 3D FFT provides the capability to create banks of ready-made filters with various characteristics. Thus, 3D filtering is carried out in the frequency domain by rejecting appropriate frequency bands according to the spectral content of the trajectory of the object to be isolated. The 3D FFT procedure and the corresponding inverse one are required in the beginning and end of the filtering process. Although 3D FFT is computationally effective, it becomes time-consuming when we need to process large data cubes. The implementation of velocity filters by means of the quantum version of 3D FFT is investigated in this work. All necessary quantum circuits and quantum procedures needed are presented in detail. This proposed quantum structure results in velocity filtering with a short execution time. For this purpose, a review of the necessary quantum computational units is presented for the implementation of quantum 3D FFT and representative examples of applications of velocity filtering are provided.

TI Entanglement area law violation from field-curvature coupling
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We investigate the ground state entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field nonminimally coupled to spacetime curvature, assuming a static, spherically symmetric background. We first discretize the field Hamiltonian by introducing a lattice of spherical shells and imposing a cutoff in the radial direction. We then study the ground state of the field and quantify deviations from area law due to nonminimal coupling, focusing in particular on Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Hayward spacetimes, also discussing de Sitter spacetime as a limiting case. We show that large positive coupling constants can significantly alter the entropy scaling with respect to the boundary area, in case of coordinate-dependent spacetime curvature. Our outcomes are interpreted in view of black hole entropy production and early universe scenarios.

By using two new entanglement measures based on dual entropy, the S-t-entropy entanglement and T-q(t)-entropy entanglement measures, we present the general monogamy relations in multi-qubit quantum systems. We show that these newly derived monogamy inequalities are tighter than the existing ones. Based on these general monogamy relations, we construct the set of multipartite entanglement indicators for N-qubit states, which are shown to work well even for the cases that the usual concurrence-based indicators do not work. Detailed examples are presented to illustrate our results.

TI Highly tunable magneto-optical response from magnesium-vacancy color
   centers in diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Defect quantum bits (qubits) constitute an important emerging technology. However, it is necessary to explore new types of defects to enable large-scale applications. In this article, we examine the potential of magnesium-vacancy (MgV) in diamond to operate as a qubit by computing the key electronic- and spin properties with robust theoretical methods. We find that the electronic structure of MgV permits the coexistence of two loosely separated spin-states, where both can emerge as a ground state and be interconverted depending on the temperature and external strain. These results demonstrate a route to control the magneto-optical response of a qubit by modulating the operational conditions.

TI Dissipation-Induced Information Scrambling in a Collision Model
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we present a collision model to stroboscopically simulate the dynamics of information in dissipative systems. In particular, an all-optical scheme is proposed to investigate the information scrambling of bosonic systems with Gaussian environmental states. Varying the states of environments, in the presence of dissipation, transient tripartite mutual information of system modes may show negative value, signaling the appearance of information scrambling. We also find that dynamical indivisibility based non-Markovianity plays dual roles in affecting the dynamics of information.

TI Trustworthy and reliable computing using untrusted and unreliable
   quantum hardware
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Security and reliability are primary concerns in any computing paradigm, including quantum computing. Currently, users can access quantum computers through a cloud-based platform where they can run their programs on a suite of quantum computers. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect that more companies including untrusted/less-trusted/unreliable vendors will begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at varied price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue could be long, the users will be motivated to use the cheaper and readily available but unreliable/less-trusted hardware. The less-trusted vendors can tamper with the results, providing a sub-optimal solution to the user. For applications such as, critical infrastructure optimization, the inferior solution may have significant socio-political implications. Since quantum computers cannot be simulated in classical computers, users have no way of verifying the computation outcome. In this paper, we address this challenge by modeling adversarial tampering and simulating it's impact on both pure quantum and hybrid quantum-classical workloads. To achieve trustworthy computing in a mixed environment of trusted and untrusted hardware, we propose an equitable distribution of total shots (i.e., repeated executions of quantum programs) across hardware options. On average, we note approximate to 30X and approximate to 1.5X improvement across the pure quantum workloads and a maximum improvement of approximate to 5X for hybrid-classical algorithm in the chosen quality metrics. We also propose an intelligent run adaptive shot distribution heuristic leveraging temporal variation in hardware quality to user's advantage, allowing them to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more number of shots to the reliable hardware, which results in a maximum improvement of approximate to 190X and approximate to 9X across the pure quantum workloads and an improvement of up to approximate to 2.5X for hybrid-classical algorithm.

TI Quantum-assisted distortion-free audio signal sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors are known for their high sensitivity in sensing applications. However, this sensitivity often comes with severe restrictions on other parameters which are also important. Examples are that in measurements of arbitrary signals, limitation in linear dynamic range could introduce distortions in magnitude and phase of the signal. High frequency resolution is another important feature for reconstructing unknown signals. Here, we demonstrate a distortion-free quantum sensing protocol that combines a quantum phase-sensitive detection with heterodyne readout. We present theoretical and experimental investigations using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, showing the capability of reconstructing audio frequency signals with an extended linear dynamic range and high frequency resolution. Melody and speech based signals are used for demonstrating the features. The methods could broaden the horizon for quantum sensors towards applications, e.g. telecommunication in challenging environment, where low-distortion measurements are required at multiple frequency bands within a limited volume.
   High sensitivity in quantum sensing comes often at the expense of other figures of merit, usually resulting in distortion. Here, the authors propose a protocol with good sensitivity, readout linearity and high frequency resolution, and benchmark it through signal measurements at audio bands with NV centers.

TI Multi-party semiquantum private comparison of size relationship with
   d-dimensional Bell states
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, we utilize d-dimensional Bell states to construct a multi-party semiquantum private comparison (MSQPC) protocol with two supervisors, which can determine the size relationship of more than two classical users' private inputs under the control of two supervisors within one round implementation. The two supervisors, i.e., one quantum third party (TP) and one classical TP, are both semi-honest, which means that they can misbehave at their own wishes but are not permitted to conspire with anyone else. Neither quantum entanglement swapping nor unitary operations are required in the proposed MSQPC protocol. The security analysis certifies that the proposed MSQPC protocol can overcome both the outside attacks and the participant attacks.

TI Experimental Implementation of Dimension-Dependent Contextuality
   Inequality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a derivation and experimental implementation of a dimension-dependent contextuality inequality to certify both the quantumness and dimensionality of a given system. Existing methods for certification of the dimension of a quantum system can be cheated by using larger classical systems, creating a potential loophole in these benchmarks, or can in practice only be evaluated assuming pure quantum states. Our approach uses contextuality inequalities that cannot be violated by classical systems thus closing the previous loopholes. We validate this framework experimentally with photons, observing violations of a CHSH-based contextuality inequality and surpassing the qutrit bound of the CGLMP4-based contextuality inequality. These show that contextuality can be used for noise-robust tests of the number of qubits.

TI Limitations of free operations in quantum resource theory
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Quantum resource theories provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding inherent quantum-mechanical properties that serve as resources in quantum information processing. State conversion can be implemented by free operations. The partial trace and the incoherent operation, similarly to the local operation and classical communication, are all free operations in the corresponding quantum resource theory. This work mainly studies the limitations of these two types of free operations: (1) Masking information is a protocol that encodes quantum information into a bipartite correlated state while the information is completely unknown to local systems. While the no-masking theorem turns out that it is not possible to determinately mask arbitrary quantum states, quantum information in certain restricted sets of states can be masked. We consider the new regime of probabilistic and approximate masking quantum information. Here, the goal is to mask a set of quantum states with maximal probability, allowing for a small error in the masking. And we provide limits on both the fidelity and the probability of masking, and derive limitations on the masking of quantum information by providing bounds on the maximal masking fidelity. (2) From quantum sensors to quantum computers, many technologies require quantum resources. The properties of such states are coherent or correlated in a way that would not be possible in classical physics. Ideally, for technology applications, these states should be in the so-called maximally resource state, one in which all possible measures of quantum resource are maximized. In a quantum system with noise, an important question is whether there exists maximal resource states. This work answered this important quantum question with a negative answer, i.e., there are no maximal resource states in general. In order to do so, this work considers the case of rank-2 states and shows that for particular values of the eigenvalues, there exists no state that can be transformed to all other states under free operations. This in particular implies that in these cases the state that maximizes a given resource measure among all states depends on the choice of resource measure, i.e., it cannot be that the aforementioned family of states maximizes all resource measures.

   quantum system
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We study the indirect detection of Cosmological Constant from an open quantum system of interacting spins, weakly interacting with a thermal bath, a massless scalar field minimally coupled with the static de Sitter background, by computing the spectroscopic shifts. By assuming pairwise interaction between spins, we construct states using a generalization of the superposition principle. The corresponding spectroscopic shifts, caused by the effective Hamiltonian of the system due to Casimir Polder interaction, are seen to play a crucial role in predicting a very tiny value of the Cosmological Constant, in the static patch of de Sitter space, which is consistent with the observed value from the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Reliability Research on Quantum Neural Networks
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) leverage the strengths of both quantum computing and neural networks, offering solutions to challenges that are often beyond the reach of traditional neural networks. QNNs are being used in areas such as computer games, function approximation, and big data processing. Moreover, quantum neural network algorithms are finding utility in social network modeling, associative memory systems, and automatic control mechanisms. Nevertheless, ensuring the reliability of quantum neural networks is crucial as it directly influences network performance and stability. To investigate the reliability of quantum neural networks, this paper proposes a methodology wherein operator measurements are performed on the final states of the output quantum states of a quantum neural network. The proximity of these measurements to the target value is compared, and the fidelity value, combined with a quantum gate operation, is utilized to assess the reliability of the quantum neural network. Through network training, the results demonstrate that, under optimal parameters, both the fidelity of the final state measurement value and the target value of the model approach are approximately equal to 1. It indicates that training mitigates the errors stemming from encoding into the initial quantum state, thereby resulting in enhanced system reliability and accuracy.

TI Securing Smart City Ecosystems: A Taxonomy-Based Review of Emerging
   Technologies and Frameworks for Scalable Collaborative Services
SO IET SMART CITIES
AB The smart city concept integrates various collaborative services to enhance urban living. However, these services introduce significant security concerns, especially in authentication, authorisation, and access control (AAA). To address these security challenges, researchers must design and implement frameworks that safeguard data exchange between smart services. This paper offers a taxonomy-based review of current solutions, focusing on how emerging technologies like Blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and hybrid approaches address AAA concerns. We evaluate these technologies based on key factors such as confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA), trust, privacy, and scalability. Through a systematic review of literature from 2017 to 2024, we classify and assess methods that strengthen authentication, optimise access control, and refine authorisation processes to mitigate risks in data sharing. A major contribution of this paper is the integration of case studies, demonstrating real-world applications of these technologies in smart city contexts. Additionally, we explore the applicability of these solutions, highlighting their challenges and future potential. This research also outlines future directions for building secure, efficient, and scalable smart city ecosystems, ultimately facilitating the development of adaptable frameworks for smart city services.

TI A Taxonomy for the Mereology of Entangled Quantum Systems
SO JOURNAL FOR GENERAL PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB The emerging field of quantum mereology considers part-whole relations in quantum systems. Entangled quantum systems pose a peculiar problem in the field, since their total states are not reducible to that of their parts. While there exist several established proposals for modelling entangled systems, like monistic holism or relational holism, there is considerable unclarity, which further positions are available. Using the lambda operator and plural logic as formal tools, we review and develop conceivable models and evaluate their consistency and distinctness. The main result is an exhaustive taxonomy of six distinct and precise models that both provide information about the mereological features as well as about the entangled property. The taxonomy is well-suited to serve as the basis for future systematic investigations.

SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Lasers with orbital angular momentum (OAM) are crucial for quantum detection, quantum entanglement and related research. However, achieving efficient generation of high-topological-helicity vortex beams in these lasers remains challenging. The resolution of diffraction elements and the divergence of higher-order modes are the main limiting factors. Here, we introduce a fiber-free-space hybrid laser design, with a vortex half-wave plate (VHP) serving as a higher-order mode converter, and cascaded VHPs to reduce the resolution limit of the device, enabling the generation of vortex beams with topological charge up to 264. The slope efficiency of the vortex laser is as high as 24 %. This method provides an expandable solution for the development of high-power, arbitrary-high-order vortex lasers.

SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum mechanics sets a limit for the precision of continuous measurement of the position of an oscillator. We show how it is possible to measure an oscillator without quantum back-action of the measurement by constructing one effective oscillator from two physical oscillators. We realize such a quantum mechanics-free subsystem using two micromechanical oscillators, and show the measurements of two collective quadratures while evading the quantum back-action by 8 decibels on both of them, obtaining a total noise within a factor of 2 of the full quantum limit. This facilitates the detection of weak forces and the generation and measurement of nonclassical motional states of the oscillators. Moreover, we directly verify the quantum entanglement of the two oscillators by measuring the Duan quantity 1.4 decibels below the separability bound.

AB Unclonable cryptography builds primitives that enjoy some form of unclonability, such as quantum money, software copy protection, and bounded execution programs. These are impossible in the classical model as classical data is inherently clonable. Quantum computing, with its no-cloning principle, offers a solution. However, it is not enough to realize bounded execution programs; these require one-time memory devices that self-destruct after a single data retrieval query. Very recently, a new no-cloning technology has been introduced [Eurocrypt'22], showing that unclonable polymers-proteins-can be used to build bounded-query memory devices and unclonable cryptographic applications. In this paper, we investigate the relation between these two technologies; whether one can replace the other, or complement each other such that combining them brings the best of both worlds. Towards this goal, we review the quantum and unclonable polymer models, and existing unclonable cryptographic primitives. Then, we discuss whether these primitives can be built using the other technology, and show alternative constructions and notions when possible. We also offer insights and remarks for the road ahead. We believe that this study will contribute in advancing the field of unclonable cryptography on two fronts: developing new primitives, and realizing existing ones using new constructions.

AB The systematic evaluation of the performance of Quantum Computers allows users to identify the best platform to execute a certain class of workload, and it can also guide the future developments of hardware companies. The NEASQC Benchmark Suite (TNBS) is a methodology designed in the context of the NEASQC (NExt ApplicationS of Quantum Computing) European project to perform such evaluation across several benchmark cases identified as common in one or several domains of application of Quantum Computing. TNBS follows several design principles identified as relevant after a thorough evaluation of the existing benchmarking methodologies: (1) benchmarks are defined at high-level not being linked to any algorithmic approach or implementation, (2) benchmarks are scalable (in qubits) and their output is classically verifiable, (3) performance metrics may be defined per case to fit the nature of the outputs of each case, and (4) the benchmark report also keeps record of all the relevant components of the execution stack. Finally, in the future, the reports may be submitted to a centralized repository, which is equipped with a web interface allowing a systematic and objective comparison of different platforms across the different cases. The first release of TNBS is composed of 4 benchmark cases and provides a reference implementation in myQLM. Documentation and code are available at https://github.com/NEASQC/WP3 Benchmark.

TI Josephson effect in topological semimetal-superconductor
   heterojunctions*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Topological semimetals are exotic phases of quantum matter with gapless electronic excitation protected by symmetry. Benefitting from its unique relativistic band dispersion, topological semimetals host abundant quantum states and quantum effects, such as Fermi-arc surface states and chiral anomaly. In recent years, due to the potential application in topological quantum computing, the hybrid system of topology and superconductivity has aroused wide interest in the community. Recent experimental progress of topological semimetal-superconductor heterojunctions is reviewed in two aspects: 1) Josephson current as a mode filter of different topological quantum states; 2) detection and manipulation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. For the former, utilizing Josephson interference, ballistic transport of Fermi-arc surface states is revealed, higher-order topological phases are discovered, and finite-momentum Cooper pairing and superconducting diode effect are realized. For the latter, by detecting a.c. Josephson effect in Dirac semimetals, the 4 pi-periodic supercurrent is discovered. By all-electric gate control, the topological transition of superconductivity is obtained. Outlooks of future research on topological semimetal-superconductor heterojunctions and their application in Majorana braiding and topological quantum computing are discussed.

TI A Quantum Q-Learning Fault Diagnosis Method for Intelligent
   Manufacturing Equipment
SO MACHINES
AB In the era of rapid industrial automation advancements, the complexity of intelligent manufacturing equipment has been steadily escalated. Stringent demands for high-efficiency and high-precision diagnosis are increasingly being unmet by conventional fault diagnosis methods. To address these challenges, a novel fault diagnosis approach grounded in quantum Q-learning is presented in this paper. The distinct advantages of quantum computing are innovatively integrated with the decision-making framework of Q-learning through this method. By harnessing the multi-information-carrying capacities of qubits, vast amounts of multi-source heterogeneous data generated during equipment operation can be efficiently processed. Latent fault features are thereby rapidly uncovered, significantly reducing the time required for fault-feature extraction. Furthermore, optimal decisions can be dynamically formulated by Q-learning within evolving production environments, leveraging precise analysis outcomes from quantum computing. Real-time equipment status is continuously monitored to accurately identify fault types, pinpoint locations, and promptly generate targeted maintenance strategies. Fault-diagnosis tests conducted on typical industrial intelligent manufacturing equipment demonstrate that the quantum Q-learning method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of diagnosis accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to complex fault patterns. This breakthrough opens up new frontiers for fault diagnosis in intelligent manufacturing systems.

TI Stabilizing persistent currents in an atomtronic Josephson junction
   necklace
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Arrays of Josephson junctions are at the forefront of research on quantum circuitry for quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. They provide a testing bed for exploring a variety of fundamental physical effects where macroscopic phase coherence, nonlinearities, and dissipative mechanisms compete. Here we realize finite-circulation states in an atomtronic Josephson junction necklace, consisting of a tunable array of tunneling links in a ring-shaped superfluid. We study the stability diagram of the atomic flow by tuning both the circulation and the number of junctions. We predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that the atomic circuit withstands higher circulations (corresponding to higher critical currents) by increasing the number of Josephson links. The increased stability contrasts with the trend of the superfluid fraction - quantified by Leggett's criterion - which instead decreases with the number of junctions and the corresponding density depletion. Our results demonstrate atomic superfluids in mesoscopic structured ring potentials as excellent candidates for atomtronics applications, with prospects towards the observation of non-trivial macroscopic superpositions of current states.
   Josephson junction arrays lead quantum circuitry research, vital for quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Here the authors show that increasing the number of links in an atomtronic Josephson junction necklace enhances the atomic circuit's resilience to higher circulations, corresponding to higher critical currents.

TI A Quantum Adaptation for the Morra Game and Some of Its Variants
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GAMES
AB The Morra game is quite old. Back in time, traces of it can be found in ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, and even China. It involves two players who, for a limited number of turns, must try to suppose the sum of the number personally chosen with the number chosen by the opponent. The rules are simple, but it is rather difficult to play at a high level as there are multiple cognitive, motor, and perceptual processes involved. The goal of this article is to illustrate the process of implementing a quantum random player for the Morra game and some of its variants. This can be done by using a quantum number generator circuit to generate two numbers and a quantum adder to obtain the supposed sum. The advantage of this proposal is that, unlike the implementations of the Morra game on classical computers, which only allow the generation of pseudorandom numbers, true randomness can be obtained through quantum computing. In addition to the description of the entire algorithms, the source code of the implementations is provided to give everyone the freedom to easily test both the quantum implementation of the Morra game and the variants discussed in this article.

TI Enabling Efficient Real-Time Calibration on Cloud Quantum Machines
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are widely used for quantum computing (QC) from quantum cloud providers. Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7% (up to 36.7%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) is a powerful platform for integrated photonic circuits. Recently, advanced applications in nonlinear and quantum optics require to controllably fabricate nano-resolution domain structures in LNOI. Here, we report on the fabrication of stable domain structures with sub-100 nm feature size through piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) tip poling in a z-cut LNOI. In experiment, the domain dot with an initial diameter of 80 nm and the domain line with an initial width of 50 nm can survive after a storage of more than 3 months. Particularly, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of 1D stable domain array with a period down to 100 nm and a duty cycle of -50%. Our method paves the way to precisely manipulate frequency conversion and quantum entanglement on an LNOI chip.

TI Quadratic Growth of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators in Quantum Kicked
   Rotor Model
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate both theoretically and numerically the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) in quantum resonance conditions for a kicked rotor model. We employ various operators to construct OTOCs in order to thoroughly quantify their commutation relation at different times, therefore unveiling the process of quantum scrambling. With the help of quantum resonance condition, we have deduced the exact expressions of quantum states during both forward evolution and time reversal, which enables us to establish the laws governing OTOCs' time dependence. We find interestingly that the OTOCs of different types increase in a quadratic function of time, breaking the freezing of quantum scrambling induced by the dynamical localization under non-resonance condition. The underlying mechanism is discovered, and the possible applications in quantum entanglement are discussed.

TI Automatic Repair of Quantum Programs via Unitary Operation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB With the continuous advancement of quantum computing (QC), the demand for high-quality quantum programs (QPs) is growing. To avoid program failure, in software engineering, the technology of automatic program repair (APR) employs appropriate patches to remove potential bugs without the intervention of a human. However, the method tailored for repairing defective QPs is still absent. This article proposes, to the best of our knowledge, a new APR method named UnitAR that can repair QPs via unitary operation automatically. Based on the characteristics of superposition and entanglement in QC, the article constructs an algebraic model and adopts a generate-and-validate approach for the repair procedure. Furthermore, the article presents two schemes that can respectively promote the efficiency of generating patches and guarantee the effectiveness of applying patches. For the purpose of evaluating the proposedmethod, the article selects 29 mutated versions as well as five real-world buggy programs as the objects and introduces two traditional APR approaches GenProg and TBar as baselines. According to the experiments, UnitAR can fix 23 buggy programs, and this method demonstrates the highest efficiency and effectiveness among three APR approaches. Besides, the experimental results further manifest the crucial roles of two constituents involved in the framework of UnitAR.

TI Quantum-inspired framework for big data analytics: evaluating the impact
   of movie trailers and its financial returns
SO JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB In the context of the growing influence of businesses and marketers on social media platforms, understanding the impact of emotionally charged content on consumer behavior has become increasingly crucial. This study proposes a novel framework, leveraging quantum computing principles, to assess the emotional impact of movie trailers. The framework incorporates big data analytics and utilizes Quantum Walk andQuantum Time Series models to investigate the relationship between a movie trailer's emotional intensity and its financial performance. Unlike sequential problem-solving approach of traditional computing models, Quantum superposition allows exploring multiple options at once. An analysis of 141 movie trailers released after January 1, 2022, revealed a positive correlation between a trailer's emotive score and its financial success. These findings suggest that trailers evoking a stronger emotional response tend to achieve greater box office returns compared to those with a lower emotional impact. This research underscores the pivotal role of emotionally resonant content in shaping consumer behavior and cinematic outcomes. It would offer valuable insights for filmmakers and marketers to optimize audience engagement and financial returns.

TI A Low-Complexity Quantum Principal Component Analysis Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose a low-complexity quantum principal component analysis (qPCA) algorithm. Similar to the state-of-the-art qPCA, it achieves dimension reduction by extracting principal components of the data matrix, rather than all components of the data matrix, to quantum registers, so that the samples of measurement required can be reduced considerably. Both our qPCA and Lin's qPCA are based on quantum singular-value thresholding (QSVT). The key of Lin's qPCA is to combine QSVT, and modified QSVT is to obtain the superposition of the principal components. The key of our algorithm, however, is to modify QSVT by replacing the rotation-controlled operation of QSVT with the controlled-NOT operation to obtain the superposition of the principal components. As a result, this small trick makes the circuit much simpler. Particularly, the proposed qPCA requires three phase estimations, while the state-of-the-art qPCA requires five phase estimations. Since the runtime of qPCA mainly comes from phase estimations, the proposed qPCA achieves a runtime of roughly 3/5 of that of the state of the art. We simulate the proposed qPCA on the IBM quantum computing platform, and the simulation result verifies that the proposed qPCA yields the expected quantum state.

TI Quantum tomography benchmarking
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recent advances in quantum computers and simulators are steadily leading us toward full-scale quantum computing devices. Due to the fact that debugging is necessary to create any computing device, quantum tomography (QT) is a critical milestone on this path. In practice, the choice between different QT methods faces the lack of comparison methodology. Modern research provides a wide range of QT methods, which differ in their application areas, as well as experimental and computational complexity. Testing such methods is also being made under different conditions, and various efficiency measures are being applied. Moreover, many methods have complex programming implementations; thus, comparison becomes extremely difficult. In this study, we have developed a general methodology for comparing quantum-state tomography methods. The methodology is based on an estimate of the resources needed to achieve the required accuracy. We have developed a software library (in MATLAB and Python) that makes it easy to analyze any QT method implementation through a series of numerical experiments. The conditions for such a simulation are set by the number of tests corresponding to real physical experiments. As a validation of the proposed methodology and software, we analyzed and compared a set of QT methods. The analysis revealed some method-specific features and provided estimates of the relative efficiency of the methods.

TI On-Chip Active Non-Reciprocal Topological Photonics
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Chip-scale non-reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non-reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non-reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto-optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley-conserved non-reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries, enable ultra-compact and efficient non-reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3 dB and a low chip loss of 2.6 dB is experimentally achieved by fine-tuning the non-reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 x 2.5 lambda 2. An all-optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48 dB. The development of a non-reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

TI Design of classical-quantum systems with UML
SO COMPUTING
AB Developers of the many promising quantum computing applications that currently exist are urging companies in many different sectors seriously consider integrating this new technology into their business. For these applications to function, not only are quantum computers required, but quantum software also. Accordingly, quantum software engineering has become an important research field, in that it attempts to apply or adapt existing methods and techniques (or propose new ones) for the analysis, design, coding, and testing of quantum software, as well as playing a key role in ensuring quality in large-scale productions. The design of quantum software nevertheless poses two main challenges: the modelling of software quantum elements must be done in high-level modelling languages; and the need to further develop so-called "hybrid information systems", which combine quantum and classical software. To address these challenges, we first propose a quantum UML profile for analysing and designing hybrid information systems; we then demonstrate its applicability through various structural and behavioural diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, activity, and deployment. In comparison to certain other quantum domain-specific languages, this UML profile ensures compliance with a well-known international standard that is supported by many tools and is followed by an extensive community.

TI New advances for quantum-inspired optimization
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Advances in quantum computing with applications in combinatorial optimization have evolved at an increasing rate in recent years. The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model is at the center of these developments and has become recognized as an effective alternative method for representing a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Additional momentum has resulted from the arrival of quantum computers and their ability to solve the Ising spin glass problem, another form of the QUBO model. This paper highlights advances in solving QUBO models and extensions to more general polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) models as important alternatives to traditional approaches. Computational experience is provided that compares the performance of unique quantum-inspired metaheuristic solvers-the Next Generation Quantum (NGQ) solver for QUBO models and the NGQ-PUBO solver for PUBO models-with the performance of CPLEX and the Dwave quantum advantage solver. Extensive results, including experiments with a set of large set partitioning problems representing the largest QUBO models reported in the literature to date, along with maximum diversity and max cut problem sets, disclose that our solvers outperform both CPLEX and Dwave by a wide margin in terms of both computational time and solution quality.

TI Communication-efficient public key encryption with (fine-grained
   delegated) equality test
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB With the rise of cloud storage and the looming threat of quantum computing, traditional encryption methods are encountering significant challenges that hinder data manipulation without decryption. To counter quantum attacks while maintaining data manipulation capabilities, new architectures such as quantum-resistant public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) must be developed. Our study presents the initial PKEET that leverages the Learning with Rounding (LWR) problem, which provides security within standard model. We also introduce its variants, public key encryption with delegated equality test (PKE-DET) and PKEET supporting flexible authorization (PKEET-FA). Our proposals could achieve fine-grained delegation at the ciphertext-specified level compared to previous PKE-DET schemes. For example, our PKE-DET supports a delegated tester function while ensuring security against quantum computing threats. Our PKEET-FA could accord users even more controls over what ciphertexts they want to compare. Our schemes' security is founded on the LWR problem which avoids the need for discrete Gaussian sampling, unlike the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. This distinction renders our methods both simpler and more efficient compared to those based on LWE. Moreover, our schemes enjoy smaller-sized ciphertexts.

TI Optimal Defense Strategies Against Ransomware With Quantum Acceleration
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling ransomware propagation and control across networked systems. We develop an eight-compartment model that captures the sequential stages of ransomware attacks: initial infection, scanning, lateral movement, encryption, ransom demand, final impact, malware propagation, and recovery. The model uses ordinary differential equations to analyze key factors including infection spread rates, detection times, and system recovery. We derive the basic reproduction number R-0 and perform stability analysis to determine conditions for outbreak control (R-0 < 1) versus persistence (R-0 > 1). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the proportion of infected systems becoming new malware sources (parameter m) most strongly influences outbreak potential. We extend the model to incorporate quantum computing effects, introducing quantum-enhanced malware and quantum-resistant defenses. Optimal control strategies are developed using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to minimize system damage while balancing intervention costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum threats can increase the reproduction number by 281%, while quantum defenses can reduce this amplification by 29%. The results provide actionable insights for cybersecurity policy, emphasizing early intervention and quantum-aware defense strategies.

TI A Technique to Improve Accuracy of S-Parameter Measurements of Coaxial
   Connectorized Devices at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Recent developments in microwave-based quantum computing technologies have motivated the need for the development of new and improved cryogenic microwave devices packaged in coaxial connectorized technology, and for their performance to be accurately characterized through S-parameter measurements made at cryogenic operating temperatures. To facilitate such accurate characterization, S-parameter measurement systems utilizing in situ calibration techniques at cryogenic temperatures have been developed. This required the use of cryogenic RF switches inside cryostats to select between calibration standards and devices to perform calibration and measurement in a single cooling cycle. However, this caused significant measurement errors due to nonidentical signal paths, due to differences in switch paths, which limited the measurement accuracy of such measurement systems. In this work, a new technique is proposed to significantly improve the accuracy of cryogenic S-parameter measurements of coaxial connectorized devices by accounting for nonideal effects in such switch-based cryogenic calibration units. The technique is demonstrated at room temperature (296 K) and cryogenic temperature (1.5 K) through S-parameter measurements of coaxial devices with up to two ports.

TI Roadmap for Schottky barrier transistors
SO NANO FUTURES
AB In this roadmap we consider the status and challenges of technologies that use the properties of a rectifying metal-semiconductor interface, known as a Schottky barrier (SB), as an asset for device functionality. We discuss source gated transistors, which allow for excellent electronic characteristics for low power, low frequency environmentally friendly circuits. We also consider reconfigurable field effect transistors. In such devices, two or more independent gate electrodes can be used to program different functionalities at the device level, enabling ultra-secure embedded devices. Both types of transistors can be used for neuromorphic systems, notably by combining them with ferroelectric SB transistors which enable a large number of analog states. At cryogenic temperatures SB transistors can advantageously serve for the control electronics in quantum computing devices. If the source/drain of the metallic contact becomes superconducting, Josephson junctions with a tunable phase can be realized for scalable quantum computing applications. Developing applications using SB devices requires physics-based and compact models that can be used for circuit simulations, which are also discussed. The roadmap reveals that the main challenges for these technologies are improving processing, access to industrial technologies and modeling tools for circuit simulations.

TI Analysis of Quantum-Classical Hybrid Deep Learning for 6G Image
   Processing with Copyright Detection
SO INFORMATION
AB This study investigates the integration of quantum computing, classical methods, and deep learning techniques for enhanced image processing in dynamic 6G networks, while also addressing essential aspects of copyright technology and detection. Our findings indicate that quantum methods excel in rapid edge detection and feature extraction but encounter difficulties in maintaining image quality compared to classical approaches. In contrast, classical methods preserve higher image fidelity but struggle to satisfy the real-time processing requirements of 6G applications. Deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, demonstrate potential in complex image analysis tasks but demand substantial computational resources. To promote the ethical use of AI-generated images, we introduce copyright detection mechanisms that employ advanced algorithms to identify potential infringements in generated content. This integration improves adherence to intellectual property rights and legal standards, supporting the responsible implementation of image processing technologies. We suggest that the future of image processing in 6G networks resides in hybrid systems that effectively utilize the strengths of each approach while incorporating robust copyright detection capabilities. These insights contribute to the development of efficient, high-performance image processing systems in next-generation networks, highlighting the promise of integrated quantum-classical-classical deep learning architectures within 6G environments.

TI Quantum-Resistant Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol
   for Fog-Based Microgrids
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A microgrid is a flexible and localized grid that can disconnect from the main grid and operate independently on the traditional and/or renewable resource. It also can work with the main grid, and even provide power to the main grid when it has excess power to help relieve the pressure of energy. The flow of power between main grid and microgrid is monitored by smart meter, which kept the end user's privacy information and his/her energy usage in real time. Hence, ensuring the privacy and security of these information is a considerable challenge. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between microgrids and the main grid, and design a quantum-resistant lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol based on fog computing. The proposed protocol provides the mutual authentication and generates a session key between a smart meter and a fog node. More importantly, it can resist against quantum computing attacks, as the security of our scheme relies on the hardness of the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem, an NP-complete problem. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol and prove that our protocol is more lightweight and efficient.

TI Interference resurrection of the τ dipole through quantum tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Helicity selection rules can suppress the leading contributions from dimension-6 operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), reducing sensitivity to potential new physics. This paper explores how the interference contributions from the tau lepton's anomalous dipole moment is restored in different observables, in particular comparing the sensitivity to SMEFT operators of quantum information observable and more traditional spin correlations. We compute the sensitivity of various observables-including entanglement measures, Bell inequality violations, and quantum uncertainties-to new physics effects using Monte Carlo simulations. Spin correlation observables are found to outperform both the integrated cross section and quantum information observables in sensitivity to both CP-conserving and-violating effects, improving the sensitivity to the scale of new physics by up to a factor of 3. Our results suggest that quantum information observables are suboptimal probes for resurrecting the interference, and more in general to disentangle the CP properties of new physics.

TI Optimized squeezing for accurate differential sensing under large phase
   noise
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Atom interferometers are reaching sensitivities fundamentally constrained by quantum fluctuations. A main challenge is to integrate entanglement into quantum sensing protocols to enhance precision while ensuring robustness against noise and systematics. Here, we theoretically investigate differential phase measurements with two atom interferometers using spin-squeezed states of N atoms, accounting for common-mode phase noise spanning the full 2 pi range. We estimate the differential signal using model-free ellipse fitting, a robust method requiring no device calibration and resilient to additional noise sources. Our results show that spin-squeezing enables sensitivities below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Specifically, we identify optimal squeezed states that minimize the differential phase uncertainty, scaling as N-2/3, thus overcoming the SQL by a factor N1/6, while eliminating the bias inherent in ellipse fitting methods. We benchmark our protocol against the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound and compare it with hybrid methods that incorporate auxiliary classical sensors. Our findings provide a pathway to robust and high-precision atom interferometry, in realistic noisy environments and using readily available states and estimation methods.

TI Modeling Robotic Thinking and Creativity: A Classic-Quantum Dialogue
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The human mind can be thought of as a black box, where the external inputs are elaborated in an unknown way and lead to external outputs. D'Ariano and Faggin schematized thinking and consciousness through quantum state dynamics. The complexity of mental states can be formalized through the entanglement of the so-called qualia states. Thus, the interaction between the mind and the external world can be formalized as an interplay between classical and quantum-state dynamics. Since quantum computing is more and more often being applied to robots, and robots constitute a benchmark to test schematic models of behavior, we propose a case study with a robotic dance, where the thinking and moving mechanisms are modeled according to quantum-classic decision making. In our research, to model the elaboration of multi-sensory stimuli and the following decision making in terms of movement response, we adopt the D'Ariano-Faggin formalism and propose a case study with improvised dance based on a collection of poses, whose combination is presented in response to external and periodic multi-sensory stimuli. We model the dancer's inner state and reaction to classic stimuli through a quantum circuit. We present our preliminary results, discussing further lines of development.

TI A New Lattice-Based Blind Ring Signature for Completely Anonymous
   Blockchain Transaction Systems
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Blockchain technology has been widely applied in numerous industries with its decentralization, verifiability, distributivity, and immutability. However, the identity privacy security of blockchain users is facing serious threats because of the openness of traditional blockchain transaction information. Moreover, numerous traditional cryptographic algorithms used by blockchain transaction networks are difficult to attack quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a new lattice-based blind ring signature scheme in allusion to completely anonymous blockchain transaction systems. There into, the blind ring signature can implement the complete anonymity of user identity privacy in blockchain transactions. Meanwhile, lattice cryptography can availably resist quantum computing attacks. Firstly, the proposed signature scheme has strong computational security based on the small integer solution (SIS) problem and a high sampling success rate by utilizing the techniques of rejection sampling from bimodal Gaussian distribution. Secondly, the proposed signature scheme can satisfy the correctness and security under the random oracle model, including anonymity, blindness, and one-more unforgeability. Thirdly, we construct a blockchain transaction system based on the proposed blind ring signature algorithm, which realizes the completely anonymous and antiquantum computing security of the blockchain users' identity privacy. Finally, the performance evaluation results show that our proposed blind ring signature scheme has lower latency, smaller key size, and signature size than other similar schemes.

TI Quantum enhanced probing of multilayered samples
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum sensing exploits quantum phenomena to enhance the detection and estimation of classical parameters of physical systems and biological entities, particularly so as to overcome the inefficiencies of its classical counterparts. A particularly promising approach within quantum sensing is quantum optical coherence tomography which relies on nonclassical light sources to reconstruct the internal structure of multilayered materials. Compared to traditional classical probing, quantum optical coherence tomography provides enhanced-resolution images and is unaffected by even-order dispersion. One of the main limitations of this technique lies in the appearance of artifacts and echoes, i.e., fake structures that appear in the coincidence interferogram, which hinder the retrieval of information required for tomography scans. Here, by utilizing a full theoretical model, in combination with a fast genetic algorithm to postprocess the data, we successfully extract the morphology of complex multilayered samples and thoroughly distinguish real interfaces, artifacts, and echoes. We test the effectiveness of the model and algorithm by comparing its predictions to experimentally generated interferograms through the controlled variation of the pump wavelength. Our results could potentially lead to the development of practical high-resolution probing of complex structures and noninvasive scanning of photodegradable materials for biomedical imaging/sensing, clinical applications, and materials science.

TI Magnetic Field Sensitivity Optimization of Negatively Charged Boron
   Vacancy Defects in hBN.
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Optically active spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as compelling quantum sensors hosted by a two dimensional (2D) material. The photodynamics and sensitivity of spin defects are governed by their level structure and associated transition rates. These are, however, poorly understood for spin defects in hBN. Here, optical and microwave pump-probe measurements are used to characterize the relaxation dynamics of the negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B(-))-the most widely-studied spin defect in hBN. A 5-level model is used to deduce transition rates that give rise to spin-dependent V-B(-) photoluminescence, and the lifetime of the V-B(-) intersystem crossing metastable state. The obtained rates are used to simulate the magnetic field sensitivity of V-B(-) defects and demonstrate high resolution imaging of the magnetic field generated by a single magnetic particle using optimal sensing parameters predicted by the model. The results reveal the rates that underpin V-B(-) photodynamics, which is important for both a fundamental understanding of the V-B(-) as a spin-photon interface and for achieving optimal sensitivity in quantum sensing applications.

AB Quantum sensing based on solid-state spin defects provides a uniquely versatile platform for nanoscale magnetometry under diverse environmental conditions. Operation of most sensors used to-date is based on projective measurement along a single axis combined with computational extrapolation. Here, we show that an individually addressable carbon-related spin defect in hexagonal boron nitride is a multi-axis nanoscale sensor with large dynamic range. For this spin-1 system, we demonstrate how its spin-dependent photodynamics give rise to three optically detected spin resonances that show up to 90% contrast and are not quenched under off-axis magnetic field exceeding 100 mT, enabling mu T/Hz-1/2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mu \,{{\rm{T}}}/{{{\rm{Hz}}}<^>{-1/2}}$$\end{document} sensitivity. Finally, we show how this system can be used to unambiguously determine the three components of a target magnetic field via the use of two bias fields. Alongside these features, the room-temperature operation and the nanometer-scale proximity enabled by the van der Waals host material further consolidate this system as a promising quantum sensing platform.

TI A Novel Broadband Channel Estimation Technique Based on Dual-Module QGAN
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In the era of 6G, the rapid increase in communication data volume poses higher demands on traditional channel estimation techniques and those based on deep learning, especially when processing large-scale data as their computational load and real-time performance often fail to meet practical requirements. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper introduces quantum computing techniques, exploring for the first time the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN) to broadband channel estimation challenges. Although generative adversarial technology has been applied to channel estimation, obtaining instantaneous channel information remains a significant challenge. To address the issue of instantaneous channel estimation, this paper proposes an innovative QGAN with a dualmodule design in the generator. The adversarial loss function and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function are separately applied for the parameter updates of these two modules, facilitating the learning of statistical channel information and the generation of instantaneous channel details. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed dual -module QGAN technique in channel estimation on the Pennylane quantum computing simulation platform. This research opens a new direction for physical layer techniques in wireless communication and offers expanded possibilities for the future development of wireless communication technologies.

TI Multi-Objective Quantum-Inspired Seagull Optimization Algorithm
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Objective solutions of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) are required to balance convergence and distribution to the Pareto front. This paper proposes a multi-objective quantum-inspired seagull optimization algorithm (MOQSOA) to optimize the convergence and distribution of solutions in multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm adopts opposite-based learning, the migration and attacking behavior of seagulls, grid ranking, and the superposition principles of quantum computing. To obtain a better initialized population in the absence of a priori knowledge, an opposite-based learning mechanism is used for initialization. The proposed algorithm uses nonlinear migration and attacking operation, simulating the behavior of seagulls for exploration and exploitation. Moreover, the real-coded quantum representation of the current optimal solution and quantum rotation gate are adopted to update the seagull population. In addition, a grid mechanism including global grid ranking and grid density ranking provides a criterion for leader selection and archive control. The experimental results of the IGD and Spacing metrics performed on ZDT, DTLZ, and OF test suites demonstrate the superiority of MOQSOA over NSGA-II, MOEA/D, MOPSO, IMMOEA, RVEA, and LMEA for enhancing the distribution and convergence performance of MOPs.

TI Testing Multi-Subroutine Quantum Programs: From Unit Testing to
   Integration Testing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize various domains by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. As quantum hardware and algorithms continue to advance, developing high-quality quantum software has become crucial. However, testing quantum programs poses unique challenges due to the distinctive characteristics of quantum systems and the complexity of multi-subroutine programs. This article addresses the specific testing requirements of multi-subroutine quantum programs. We begin by investigating critical properties by surveying existing quantum libraries and providing insights into the challenges of testing these programs. Building upon this understanding, we focus on testing criteria and techniques based on the whole testing process perspective, spanning from unit testing to integration testing. We delve into various aspects, including IO analysis, quantum relation checking, structural testing, behavior testing, integration of subroutine pairs, and test case generation. We also introduce novel testing principles and criteria to guide the testing process. We conduct comprehensive testing on typical quantum subroutines, including diverse mutants and randomized inputs, to evaluate our proposed approach. The analysis of failures provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of our testing methodology. Additionally, we present case studies on representative multi-subroutine quantum programs, demonstrating the practical application and effectiveness of our proposed testing principles and criteria.

TI Dynamic Cost Ant Colony Algorithm to Optimize Query for Distributed
   Database Based on Quantum-Inspired Approach
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A distributed database model can be effectively optimized through using query optimization. In such a model, the optimizer attempts to identify the most efficient join order, which minimizes the overall cost of the query plan. Successful query processing largely relies on the methodology implemented by the query optimizer. Many researches are concerned with the fact that query processing is considered an NP-hard problem especially when the query becomes bigger. Regarding large queries, it has been found that heuristic methods cannot cover all search spaces and may lead to falling in a local minimum. This paper examines how quantum-inspired ant colony algorithm, a hybrid strategy of probabilistic algorithms, can be devised to improve the cost of query joins in distributed databases. Quantum computing has the ability to diversify and expand, and thus covering large query search spaces. This enables the selection of the best trails, which speeds up convergence and helps avoid falling into a local optimum. With such a strategy, the algorithm aims to identify an optimal join order to reduce the total execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed quantum-inspired ant colony offers a faster convergence with better outcome when compared with the classic model.

TI Modeling of Radiative Emission from Shallow Color Centers in Single
   Crystalline Diamond
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Optically active defects in diamond are widely used as bright single-photon sources for quantum sensing, computing, and communication. For many applications, it is useful to place the emitter close to the diamond surface, where the radiative properties of the emitter are strongly modified by its dielectric environment. It is well-known that the radiative power from an electric dipole decreases as the emitter approaches an interface with a lower-index dielectric, leading to an increase in the radiative lifetime. For emitters in crystalline solids, modeling of this effect needs to take into account the crystal orientation and direction of the surface cut, which can greatly impact the emission characteristics. In this paper, a framework for analyzing the emission rates of shallow (< 100 nm) defects is provided, in which optical transitions are derived from electric dipoles in a plane perpendicular to their spin axis. The calculations for the depth-dependent radiative lifetime for color centers in (100)-, (110)-, and (111)-cut diamond are presented, which can be extended to other vacancy defects in diamond.

TI Method for Efficient Large-Scale Cryogenic Characterization of CMOS
   Technologies
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Semiconductor integrated circuits operated at cryogenic temperature will play an essential role in quantum computing architectures. These can offer equivalent or superior performance to their room-temperature counterparts while enabling a scaling up of the total number of qubits under control. Silicon integrated circuits can be operated at a temperature stage of a cryogenic system where cooling power is sufficient (similar to 3.5 + K) to allow for analog signal chain components (e.g., amplifiers and mixers), local signal synthesis, signal digitization, and control logic. A critical stage in cryo-electronics development is the characterization of individual transistor devices in a particular technology node at cryogenic temperatures. This data enables the creation of a process design kit (PDK) to model devices and simulate integrated circuits operating well below the minimum standard temperature ranges covered by foundry-released models (e.g., -55 degrees C). Here, an efficient approach to the characterization of large numbers of components at cryogenic temperature is reported. We developed a system to perform dc measurements with Kelvin sense of individual transistors at 4.2 K using integrated on-die multiplexers, enabling bulk characterization of thousands of devices with no physical change to the measurement setup.

TI Voltage Reference and Voltage Regulator for the Cryogenic Performance
   Evaluation of the 22nm FDSOI Technology
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents the design and cryogenic electrical characterization of a voltage reference and a linear voltage regulator at temperatures between 6 K and 300 K. Both circuits are employed as test vehicles for the experimental performance evaluation of the 22 nm FDSOI MOS technology when used as platform for the development of cryogenic analog systems, whose role is relevant in Quantum Computing (QC) applications. Additionally, we report the impact that MOS transistor cryogenic phenomena have over these circuits and propose to take advantage of some of those phenomena in analog circuit design. In particular, we focus on the cryogenic threshold voltage (V- th) saturation, the transconductance (g(m)) increase and the low frequency (LF) excess noise. Our experimental results indicate that the cryogenic V-th saturation and the g(m) increase can be used as circuit design tools, while the LF excess noise is a performance handicap for cryogenic analog circuits.

TI Benchmark dataset and instance generator for real-world
   three-dimensional bin packing problems
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB In this article, a benchmark for real-world bin packing problems is proposed. This dataset consists of 12 instances of varying levels of complexity regarding size (with the number of packages ranging from 38 to 53) and user-defined requirements. In fact, several real-world-oriented restrictions were taken into account to build these instances: i) item and bin dimensions, ii) weight restrictions, iii) affinities among package categories iv) preferences for package ordering and v) load balancing. Besides the data, we also offer an own developed Python script for the dataset generation, coined Q4RealBPP-DataGen. The benchmark was initially proposed to evaluate the performance of quantum solvers. Therefore, the characteristics of this set of instances were designed according to the current limitations of quantum devices. Additionally, the dataset generator is included to allow the construction of general-purpose benchmarks. The data introduced in this article provides a baseline that will encourage quantum computing researchers to work on real-world bin packing problems.

TI A Blockchain-Based Secure Multi-Party Computation Scheme with Multi-Key
   Fully Homomorphic Proxy Re-Encryption
SO INFORMATION
AB At present, secure multi-party computing is an effective solution for organizations and institutions that want to derive greater value and benefit from the collaborative computing of their data. Most current secure multi-party computing solutions use encryption schemes that are not resistant to quantum attacks, which is a security risk in today's quickly growing quantum computing, and, when obtaining results, the result querier needs to collect the private keys of multiple data owners to jointly decrypt them, or there needs to be an interaction between the data owner and the querier during the decryption process. Based on the NTRU cryptosystem, which is resistant to quantum computing attacks and has a simple and easy-to-implement structure, and combined with multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (MKFHE) and proxy re-encryption, this paper proposes a secure multi-party computing scheme based on NTRU-type multi-key fully homomorphic proxy re-encryption in the blockchain environment, using the blockchain as trusted storage and a trusted execution environment to provide data security for multi-party computing. The scheme meets the requirements of being verifiable, conspiracy-proof, individually decryptable by the querier, and resistant to quantum attacks.

TI Selective area epitaxy of PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires on a lattice-matched
   substrate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Topological quantum computing is based on the braiding of Majorana zero modes encoding topological qubits. A promising candidate platform for Majorana zero modes is semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanowires. The realization of topological qubits and braiding operations requires scalable and disorder-free nanowire networks. Selective area growth of in-plane InAs and InSb nanowires, together with shadow-wall growth of superconductor structures, have demonstrated this scalability by achieving various network structures. However, the noticeable lattice mismatch at the nanowire-substrate interface, acting as a disorder source, imposes a serious obstacle along with this road map. Here, combining selective area and shadow-wall growth, we demonstrate the fabrication of PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires-another potentially promising Majorana system-on a nearly perfectly lattice-matched substrate CdTe, all done in one molecular beam epitaxy chamber. Transmission electron microscopy shows the single-crystal nature of the PbTe nanowire and its atomically sharp and clean interfaces to the CdTe substrate and Pb overlayer, without noticeable interdiffusion or strain. The nearly ideal interface condition, together with the strong screening of charge impurities due to the large dielectric constant of PbTe, holds promise towards a clean nanowire system to study Majorana zero modes and topological quantum computing.

TI A little bit of self-correction
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate the emergence of stable subspaces in the low-temperature quantum thermal dynamics of finite spin chains. Our analysis reveals the existence of effective decoherence-free qudit subspaces, persisting for timescales exponential in beta. Surprisingly, the appearance of metastable subspaces is not directly related to the entanglement structure of the ground state(s). Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited states. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of stable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations. This work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the thermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more extensive studies of self-correction in such systems.

TI THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS: THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PROBLEM
SO AGORA-PAPELES DE FILOSOFIA
AB Thought experiments in physics involve epistemological questions such as: How can we learn about the world through merely thinking about imagined scenarios? Realist and empiricist philosophers face that question disregarding that such experiments are about idealized systems. We try to sustain that thought experiments, because of their very nature, neither provide new knowledge-confirmed true statements-nor new empirical data about the physical world. Instead, as Kuhn maintains, their import could improve our conceptual apparatus, allowing a new understanding of the physical world. As a study case, we analyze Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen<acute accent>s paradox to give support for these claims. The proposed novel topic in this paper is the study of such paradox in the light of Kuhn<acute accent>s epistemological account of thought experiments.

TI Nonlocal generalized quantum measurements of bipartite spin products
   without maximal entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Measuring a nonlocal observable on a space-like separated quantum system is a resource-hungry and experimentally challenging task. Several theoretical measurement schemes have already been proposed to increase its feasibility, using a shared maximally-entangled ancilla. We present a new approach to this problem, using the language of generalized quantum measurements, to show that it is actually possible to measure a nonlocal spin product observable without necessarily requiring a maximally-entangled ancilla. This approach opens the door to more economical arbitrary-strength nonlocal measurements, with applications ranging from nonlocal weak values to possible new tests of Bell inequalities. The relation between measurement strength and the amount of ancillary entanglement needed is made explicit, bringing a new perspective on the links that tie quantum nonlocality, entanglement and information transmission together.

   superconducting state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. A Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been made toward the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms have been reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, a chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials, and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host an effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to the chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens an avenue to exploration of topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Bures-Wasserstein geometry for positive-definite Hermitian matrices and
   their trace-one subset
SO INFORMATION GEOMETRY
AB In his classical argument, Rao derives the Riemannian distance corresponding to the Fisher metric using a mapping between the space of positive measures and Euclidean space. He obtains the Hellinger distance on the full space of measures and the Fisher distance on the subset of probability measures. In order to highlight the interplay between Fisher theory and quantum information theory, we extend this construction to the space of positive-definite Hermitian matrices using Riemannian submersions and quotient manifolds. The analog of the Hellinger distance turns out to be the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) distance, a distance measure appearing in optimal transport, quantum information, and optimisation theory. First we present an existing derivation of the Riemannian metric and geodesics associated with this distance. Subsequently, we present a novel derivation of the Riemannian distance and geodesics for this metric on the subset of trace-one matrices, analogous to the Fisher distance for probability measures.

TI Universal rapidity scaling of entanglement entropy inside hadrons from
   conformal invariance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB When a hadron is probed at high energy, a nontrivial quantum entanglement entropy inside the hadron emerges due to the lack of complete information about the hadron wave function extracted from this measurement. In the high-energy limit, the hadron becomes a maximally entangled state, with a linear dependence of entanglement entropy on rapidity, as has been found in a recent analysis based on parton description. In this paper, we use an effective conformal field theoretic description of hadrons on the light cone to show that the linear dependence of the entanglement entropy on rapidity found in parton description is a general consequence of approximate conformal invariance and does not depend on the assumption of weak coupling. Our result also provides further evidence for a duality between the parton and string descriptions of hadrons.

TI Switchable optical vortex beam generator based on an all-dielectric
   metasurface governed by merging bound states in the continuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The polarization topology around the bound states in continuum (BIC) affects the optical vortex (OV) beam generation. We propose a cross-cross-shaped resonator based on a THz metasurface to realize an OV beam generator in real space by exploiting the inherent winding topology around the BIC. The BIC merging at the point & UGamma; is achieved by tuning the width of the cross resonator, which significantly improves the Q factor and enhances the field localization. Furthermore, the switching between the high-order OV beam generator governed by the merged BIC and the low-order OV beam generator is realized. This extends the application of BIC in modulating orbital angular momentum. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum metrology via chaos in a driven Bose-Josephson system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement preparation and signal accumulation are essential for quantum parameter estimations, which pose significant challenges to both theories and experiments. Here, we propose how to utilize chaotic dynamics in a periodically driven Bose-Josephson system for achieving high-precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL). Starting from an initial nonentangled state, the chaotic dynamics generates many-body quantum entanglement and simultaneously encodes the parameter to be estimated. By using suitable chaotic dynamics, the ultimate measurement precision of the estimated parameter can beat the SQL. The sub-SQL measurement precision scaling can also be reached via specific observables, such as collective spin measurement, which can be realized with state-of-art techniques. Our study not only provides insights for understanding quantum chaos and quantum-classical correspondence, but also of promising applications in entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology.

TI An accurate, non-empirical method for incorporating decoherence into
   Ehrenfest dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics methods, the anchoring of the electronic wave function to a single nuclear geometry results in both quantitative and qualitative errors in the dynamics. In the context of both Ehrenfest and trajectory surface hopping methods, methods for incorporating decoherence are widely used to eliminate these errors. However, the accuracy of these methods often depends strongly on the parameterization of the decoherence time and/or other related quantities. Here, we present a refinement of the recently introduced collapse to a block (TAB) scheme for incorporating decoherence into Ehrenfest dynamics. The proposed approach incorporates an approximation to the history of the population dynamics and treats the coherence decay as Gaussian, rather than exponential. This method uses parameters that can be obtained from first principles, rather than empirical fitting. Application to one-dimensional models indicates excellent agreement with numerically exact simulations. We also introduce a second refinement to the TAB method: a robust linear least-squares algorithm for determining collapse probabilities. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

SO AXIOMS
AB We investigate some new aspects of the nonlinear interaction between a three-level & UXi;-type atom and bimodal field. The photon-assisted atomic phase damping, detuning parameter, Kerr nonlinearity and the time-dependent coupling have been considered. The general solution has been obtained by using the Schrodinger equation when the atom and the field are initially prepared in the excited state and coherent state, respectively. The atomic population inversion and concurrence are discussed. It is shown that the time-dependent coupling parameter and the detuning parameter can be considered as quantum controller parameters of the atomic population inversion and quantum entanglement in the considered model.

SO QUANTUM
AB We show that the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Brandao & Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 791 (2010)] is not correct due to a gap in the argument leading to Lemma III.9. Hence, the main achievability result of Brandao & Plenio is not known to hold. This puts into question a number of established results in the literature, in particular the reversibility of quantum entanglement [Brandao & Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 829 (2010); Nat. Phys. 4, 873 (2008)] and of general quantum resources [Brandao & Gour, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 070503 (2015)] under asymptotically resource non-generating operations. We discuss potential ways to recover variants of the newly unsettled results using other approaches.

TI Enriched Presheaf Model of Quantum FPC
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Selinger gave a superoperator model of a first-order quantum programming language and proved that it is fully definable and hence fully abstract. This paper proposes an extension of the superoperator model to higher-order programs based on modules over superoperators or, equivalently, enriched presheaves over the category of superoperators. The enriched presheaf category can be easily proved to be a model of intuitionistic linear logic with cofree exponential, from which one can cave out a model of classical linear logic by a kind of bi-orthogonality construction. Although the structures of an enriched presheaf category are usually rather complex, a morphism in the classical model can be expressed simply as a matrix of completely positive maps.
   The model inherits many desirable properties from the superoperator model. A conceptually interesting property is that our model has only a state whose "total probability" is bounded by 1, i.e. does not have a state where true and false each occur with probability 2/3. Another convenient property inherited from the superoperator model is a omega CPO-enrichment. Remarkably, our model has a sufficient structure to interpret arbitrary recursive types by the standard domain theoretic technique. We introduce Quantum FPC, a quantum lambda-calculus with recursive types, and prove that our model is a fully abstract model of Quantum FPC.

TI Robust and compact single-lens crossed-beam optical dipole trap for
   Bose-Einstein condensation in microgravity
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a novel concept for a compact and robust crossed-beam optical dipole trap (cODT) based on a single lens, designed for the efficient generation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) under dynamic conditions. The system employs two independent two-dimensional acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) in combination with a single high-numerical-aperture lens to provide full three-dimensional control over the trap geometry, minimizing potential misalignments and ensuring long-term operational stability. By leveraging time-averaged potentials, rapid and efficient evaporative cooling sequences toward BECs are enabled. The functionality of the cODT under microgravity conditions has been successfully demonstrated in the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover, Germany, where the beam intersection was shown to remain stable throughout the microgravity phase of the flight. In addition, the system has been implemented in the sensor head of the INTENTAS project to verify BEC generation. Additional realization of one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrays of condensates through dynamic trap shaping was achieved. This versatile approach allows for advanced quantum sensing applications in mobile and space-based environments based on all-optical BECs.

TI Probing stress and magnetism at high pressures with two-dimensional
   quantum sensors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 3.5 GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr1+delta Te2. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.

TI High-speed and energy-efficient non-volatile silicon photonic memory
   based on heterogeneously integrated memresonator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, interest in programmable photonics integrated circuits has grown as a potential hardware framework for deep neural networks, quantum computing, and field programmable arrays (FPGAs). However, these circuits are constrained by the limited tuning speed and large power consumption of the phase shifters used. In this paper, we introduce the memresonator, a metal-oxide memristor heterogeneously integrated with a microring resonator, as a non-volatile silicon photonic phase shifter. These devices are capable of retention times of 12 hours, switching voltages lower than 5 V, and an endurance of 1000 switching cycles. Also, these memresonators have been switched using 300 ps long voltage pulses with a record low switching energy of 0.15 pJ. Furthermore, these memresonators are fabricated on a heterogeneous III-V-on-Si platform capable of integrating a rich family of active and passive optoelectronic devices directly on-chip to enable in-memory photonic computing and further advance the scalability of integrated photonic processors.
   Photonic integrated circuits have grown as potential hardware for neural networks and quantum computing, yet the tuning speed and large power consumption limited the application. Here, authors introduce the memresonator, a memristor heterogeneously integrated with a microring resonator, as a non-volatile silicon photonic phase shifter to address these limitations.

TI Entanglement Hamiltonian and orthogonal polynomials
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.

This groundbreaking method offers unique advantages, such as nonlocal RF signal encoding and robust resistance to dispersion-induced frequency fading. We explore the versatility of processing the quantum microwave photonic signal by utilizing coincidence window selection on the biphoton coincidence distribution. The demonstration includes finely tunable RF phase shifting, flexible multitap transversal filtering (with up to 14 taps), and photonically implemented RF mixing, leveraging the nonlocal RF mapping characteristic of QMWP. These accomplishments significantly enhance the capability of microwave photonic systems in processing ultraweak signals, opening up new possibilities for various applications.

TI Entanglement induced by noncommutativity: anisotropic harmonic
   oscillator in noncommutative space
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Quantum entanglement, induced by spatial noncommutativity, is investigated for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Exact solutions for the system are obtained after the model is re-expressed in terms of canonical variables, by performing a particular Bopp's shift to the noncommutating degrees of freedom. Employing Simon's separability criterion, we find that the states of the system are entangled provided a unique function of the (mass and frequency) parameters obeys an inequality. Entanglement of Formation for this system is also computed and its relation to the degree of anisotropy is discussed. It is worth mentioning that, even in a noncommutative space, entanglement is generated only if the harmonic oscillator is anisotropic. Interestingly, the Entanglement of Formation saturates for higher values of the deformation parameter theta, that quantifies spatial noncommutativity.

TI Quantum and non-local effects offer over 40 dB noise resilience
   advantage towards quantum lidar
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-local effects have the potential to radically move forward quantum enhanced imaging to provide an advantage over classical imaging not only in laboratory environments but practical implementation. In this work, we demonstrate a 43dB higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using a quantum enhanced LiDAR based on time-frequency entanglement compared with a classical phase-insensitive quantum imaging system. Our system can tolerate more than 3 orders of magnitude higher noise than classical single-photon counting quantum imaging systems before detector saturation with a detector dead time of 25ns. To achieve these advantages, we use non-local cancellation of dispersion to take advantage of the strong temporal correlations in photon pairs in spite of the orders of magnitude larger detector temporal uncertainty. We go on to incorporate this scheme with purpose-built scanning collection optics to image non-reflecting targets in an environment with noise.

TI Intrinsic Decoherence and Recurrences in a Large Ferromagnetic
   F=1 Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Decoherence with recurrences appear in the dynamics of the one-body density matrix of an F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, initially prepared in coherent states, in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field and within the single mode approximation. The phenomenon emerges as a many-body effect of the interplay of the quadratic Zeeman effect, which breaks the rotational symmetry, and the spin-spin interactions. By performing full quantum diagonalizations, a very accurate time evolution of large condensates is analyzed, leading to heuristic analytic expressions for the time dependence of the one-body density matrix, in the weak and strong interacting regimes, for initial coherent states. We are able to find accurate analytical expressions for both the decoherence and the recurrence times, in terms of the number of atoms and strength parameters, which show remarkable differences depending on the strength of the spin-spin interactions. The features of the stationary states in both regimes are also investigated. We discuss the nature of these limits in light of the thermodynamic limit.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum technology is approaching a level of maturity, recently demonstrated in space-borne experiments and in-field measurements, which would allow for adoption by non-specialist users. Parallel advancements made in microprocessor-based electronics and database software can be combined to create robust, versatile and modular experimental monitoring systems. Here, we describe a monitoring network used across a number of cold atom laboratories with a shared laser system. The ability to diagnose malfunction, unexpected or unintended behavior and passively collect data for key experimental parameters, such as vacuum chamber pressure, laser beam power, or resistances of important conductors, significantly reduces debugging time. This allows for efficient control over a number of experiments and remote control when access is limited.

TI False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer
   and time-averaged observables
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise respectively from deep IR fluctuations, which appear as background modes to a local observer, and from violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when proper observables are considered. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To incorporate these observer's perspective, we propose to use in effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and in the late universe.

TI Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics analysis of hybrid Dion-Jacobson 2D
   leads iodide perovskites
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The past six years have witnessed the rapid growth of interest in Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites as optoelectronic materials with considerable intrinsic stability. The precise relationships between structural variations and the resulting charge carrier dynamics at finite temperature in these materials are keys to practical applications and are not yet completely understood. Here, we study 3-(aminomethyl) piperidinium (3AMP) and 4-(aminomethyl) piperidinium (4AMP) spacer cation-based lead iodide DJ phase systems and find these spacer cations to have a profound impact on the structural dynamics. Particularly, large conformational dynamics of the 3AMP-based perovskite compared to that of the 4AMP at room temperature leads to pronounced state energy fluctuation near band edges and further results in a shorter quantum coherence. The faster quantum decoherence of the 3AMP spacer-based perovskite underpins a longer nonradiative lifetime, offering insight into its superior performance as an optoelectronic material. This work sheds light on the relationship between structural fluctuations and charge carrier dynamics that can help in designing 2D perovskites with superior photophysical properties.

TI Suppression of charges within an Al2O3
   high-κ dielectric and reduction of interface traps at the
   cryogenic temperature of a Ge n-MOS capacitor fabricated by plasma
   postoxidation and forming gas annealing
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Germanium (Ge)-based quantum devices are considered as promising candidates for scalable quantum information processing due to strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the capability for ultrafast all-electrical spin manipulation. To fabricate fault-tolerant quantum encoding devices, it is important to improve the cryogenic properties of a Ge-based metal oxide semiconductor (Ge MOS) structure with thin gate dielectric layers as much as possible. Based on a thin Al2O3/GeOx dielectric stack, we investigate the effects of oxygen plasma postoxidation (PPO) power and hydrogen forming gas annealing (H2 FGA) temperature on the cryogenic properties of Ge MOS capacitors in depth. By systematically depicting the distribution of the interface trap density (Dit) within the Ge bandgap, we found that the formation of GeOx reduces the energy state density of characteristic defects across the Ge bandgap, thereby leading to the reduction of the Dit. The contribution of FGA to the reduction of the fixed charge within the Al2O3 dielectric is clarified, and the C-V hysteresis effect improvement is revealed by suppressing the trap charge area density within the Al2O3 dielectric by integrating the PPO and FGA processes. Finally, the Dit of the Ge n-MOS capacitor with the Al2O3/GeOx dielectric stack is reduced to 5 x 1011 cm-2 eV-1 (@Ev + 0.13 eV) at 15 K. The area density of the fixed charge and the trap charge within Al2O3 are reduced from 1.4 x 1012-7.2 x 1011cm-2 and from 1.28 x 1012-5.13 x 1010 cm-2, respectively. This provides a technical pathway for the development of Ge-based devices for quantum computation.

TI Causality and signalling of garden-path sentences
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Sheaves are mathematical objects that describe the globally compatible data associated with open sets of a topological space. Original examples of sheaves were continuous functions; later they also became powerful tools in algebraic geometry, as well as logic and set theory. More recently, sheaves have been applied to the theory of contextuality in quantum mechanics. Whenever the local data are not necessarily compatible, sheaves are replaced by the simpler setting of presheaves. In previous work, we used presheaves to model lexically ambiguous phrases in natural language and identified the order of their disambiguation. In the work presented here, we model syntactic ambiguities and study a phenomenon in human parsing called garden-pathing. It has been shown that the information-theoretic quantity known as 'surprisal' correlates with human reading times in natural language but fails to do so in garden-path sentences. We compute the degree of signalling in our presheaves using probabilities from the large language model BERT and evaluate predictions on two psycholinguistic datasets. Our degree of signalling outperforms surprisal in two ways: (i) it distinguishes between hard and easy garden-path sentences (with a p-value <10-5), whereas existing work could not, (ii) its garden-path effect is larger in one of the datasets (32 ms versus 8.75 ms per word), leading to better prediction accuracies. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice'.

TI Dispersive Readout of Molecular Spin Qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We study the physics of a magnetic molecule described by a ???giant??? spin with multiple (d > 2) spin states interacting with the quantized cavity field produced by a superconducting resonator. By means of the input-output formalism, we derive an expression for the output modes in the dispersive regime of operation. It includes the effect of magnetic anisotropy, which makes different spin transitions addressable. We find that the measurement of the cavity transmission allows us to uniquely determine the spin state of the qudits. We discuss, from an effective Hamiltonian perspective, the conditions under which the qudit readout is a nondemolition measurement and consider possible experimental protocols to perform it. Finally, we illustrate our results with simulations performed for realistic models of existing magnetic molecules.

TI Thermal self-oscillations in monolayer graphene coupled to a

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Nonlinear phenomena in superconducting resonator circuits are of great significance in the field of quantum technology. We observe thermal self-oscillations in a monolayer graphene flake coupled to molybdenum-rhenium superconducting resonator. The graphene flake forms a SINIS junction coupled to the resonator with strong temperature dependent resistance. In certain conditions of pump power and frequency, this nonlinearity leads to thermal self-oscillations appearing as sidebands in cavity transmission measurements with strong temperature dependence and gate tunability. The experimental observations fit well with theoretical model based on thermal instability. The modelling of the oscillation sidebands provides a method to evaluate electron phonon coupling in disordered graphene sample at low energies.

TI Phase space theory for open quantum systems with local and collective
   dissipative processes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this article we investigate driven dissipative quantum dynamics of an ensemble of two-level systems given by a Markovian master equation with collective and local dissipators. Exploiting the permutation symmetry in our model, we employ a phase space approach for the solution of this equation in terms of a diagonal representation with respect to certain generalized spin coherent states. Remarkably, this allows to interpolate between mean field theory and finite system size in a formalism independent of Hilbert-space dimension. Moreover, in certain parameter regimes, the evolution equation for the corresponding quasiprobability distribution resembles a Fokker-Planck equation, which can be efficiently solved by stochastic calculus. Then, the dynamics can be seen as classical in the sense that no entanglement between the two-level systems is generated. Our results expose, utilize and promote techniques pioneered in the context of laser theory, which can be powerful tools to investigate problems of current theoretical and experimental interest.

TI Distinguishing beyond-standard model effects in neutrino oscillation
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We systematically assess the DUNE experiment's ability to distinguish between various beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses pair combinations. For a pair comparison, we evaluate the statistical separation, where one hypothesis plays the role of the true signal while the other corresponds to the test signal. The beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses under scrutiny include neutrino decay (invisible and visible), non-standard interactions, quantum decoherence, and the violation of the equivalence principle. We found that the violation of the equivalence principle is the easiest to differentiate compared to the rest of the hypotheses. Additionally, from our x2 statistical separation test, we investigate potential discrepancies between the measured CP-violation phase SAP, 623, and Delta m231 relative to their respective true values, which could occur for a given comparison. In our analysis, we will take the true values of SAP as 90 degrees and 180 degrees, while 623 and Delta m231 are fixed in its global fit values. In particular, even in cases where the scenarios of beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses are statistically indistinguishable, the measured values can exhibit significant deviations from their true values.

TI Majorana zero modes in impurity-assisted vortex of LiFeAs superconductor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The iron-based superconductor is emerging as a promising platform for Majorana zero mode, which can be used to implement topological quantum computation. One of the most significant advances of this platform is the appearance of large vortex level spacing that strongly protects Majorana zero mode from other low-lying quasiparticles. Despite the advantages in the context of physics research, the inhomogeneity of various aspects hampers the practical construction of topological qubits in the compounds studied so far. Here we show that the stoichiometric superconductor LiFeAs is a good candidate to overcome this obstacle. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover that the Majorana zero modes, which are absent on the natural clean surface, can appear in vortices influenced by native impurities. Our detailed analysis reveals a new mechanism for the emergence of those Majorana zero modes, i.e. native tuning of bulk Dirac fermions. The discovery of Majorana zero modes in this homogeneous material, with a promise of tunability, offers an ideal material platform for manipulating and braiding Majorana zero modes, pushing one step forward towards topological quantum computation. Despite the discovery of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in iron-based superconductors, sample inhomogeneity may destroy MZMs during braiding. Here, authors observe MZM in impurity-assisted vortices due to tuning of the bulk Dirac fermions in a homogeneous superconductor LiFeAs.

TI A hybrid spiking neural network - quantum framework for spatio-temporal
   data classification: a case study on EEG data
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The study introduces a hybrid computational framework that combines neuro-inspired information processing using spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantum information processing using quantum kernels to develop quantum-enhanced machine learning models for spatio-temporal data, demonstrated through the classification of EEG data as a case study. In the proposed SNN-quantum computation (SNN-QC) framework, SNN with spike time information representation is employed to learn spatio-temporal interactions (EEG recorded from multiple channels over time). Frequency-based (rate-based) information as spike frequency state vectors are extracted from the SNN and classified using a quantum classifier. In the latter part, we use the quantum kernel approach utilising feature maps for classification tasks. The proposed SNN-QC is demonstrated on a benchmark EEG dataset to classify three distinct wrist movement tasks in six binary classification setups as a proof of concept. We introduce a novel high-order nonlinear feature map that demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art feature maps and several machine learning methods across most of the tasks studied. Furthermore, the role of hyperparameters for enhanced feature maps is also highlighted. The performance of SNN-QC is evaluated using statistical metrics and cross-validation techniques, demonstrating its efficacy across multiple binary classifiers. Quantum hardware validation is conducted using both a superconducting IBM-QPU and a high-fidelity noisy simulation that replicates a real QPU. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the SNN-QC outperforms models that use statistical features rather than features extracted from the SNN, as the SNN accounts for the temporal interaction between the spatio-temporal input variables. Finally, we conclude that the SNN-QC offers a potential pathway for developing more accurate neuromorphic-quantum enhanced systems that are both energy-efficient and biologically-inspired, well-suited for dealing with spatio-temporal data.

TI Monitoring Dark-State Dynamics of a Single Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in
   Nanodiamond by Auto-Correlation Spectroscopy: Photonionization and
   Recharging
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this letter, the photon-induced charge conversion dynamics of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in nanodiamond between two charge states, negative (NV-) and neutral (NV0), is studied by the auto-correlation function. It is observed that the ionization of NV- converts to NV0, which is regarded as the dark state of the NV-, leading to fluorescence intermittency in single NV centers. A new method, based on the auto-correlation calculation of the time-course fluorescence intensity from NV centers, was developed to quantify the transition kinetics and yielded the calculation of transition rates from NV- to NV0 (ionization) and from NV0 to NV- (recharging). Based on our experimental investigation, we found that the NV--NV0 transition is wavelength-dependent, and more frequent transitions were observed when short-wavelength illumination was used. From the analysis of the auto-correlation curve, it is found that the transition time of NV- to NV0 (ionization) is around 0.1 mu s, but the transition time of NV0 to NV- (recharging) is around 20 ms. Power-dependent measurements reveal that the ionization rate increases linearly with the laser power, while the recharging rate has a quadratic increase with the laser power. This difference suggests that the ionization in the NV center is a one-photon process, while the recharging of NV0 to NV- is a two-photon process. This work, which offers theoretical and experimental explanations of the emission property of a single NV center, is expected to help the utilization of the NV center for quantum information science, quantum communication, and quantum bioimaging.

TI Quantum Process Tomography with Digital Twins of Error Matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Accurate and robust quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for verifying quantum gates and diagnosing implementation faults in experiments aimed at building universal quantum computers. However, the reliability of QPT protocols is often compromised by faulty probes, particularly state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which introduce fundamental inconsistencies in traditional QPT algorithms. We propose and investigate enhanced QPT for multiqubit systems by integrating the error matrix in a digital twin of the identity process matrix, enabling statistical refinement of SPAM error learning and improving QPT precision. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach enables highly accurate and faithful process characterization. We further validate our method experimentally in superconducting quantum processors, achieving at least an order-of-magnitude fidelity improvement over standard QPT. Our results provide a practical and precise method for assessing quantum gate fidelity and enhancing QPT on a given hardware.

TI The "Cyber Security via Determinism" Paradigm for a Quantum Safe Zero
   Trust Deterministic Internet of Thin (IoT)
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) will control the critical infrastructure of the 21st century, including the Smart Power Grid and Smart Cities. It will also support Deterministic Communications, where 'deterministic traffic flows' (D-flows) receive strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. A `Cybersecurity via Determinism' paradigm for the next-generation 'Industrial and Tactile Deterministic IoT' is presented. A forwarding sub-layer of simple and secure 'deterministic packet switches' (D-switches) is introduced into layer-3. This sub-layer supports many deterministic Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WANs), along with 3 new tools for improving cyber security: Access Control, Rate Control, and Isolation Control. A Software Defined Networking (SDN) control-plane configures each D-switch (ie FPGA) with multiple deterministic schedules to support D-flows. The SDN control-plane can embed millions of isolated Deterministic Virtual Private Networks (DVPNs) into layer 3. This paradigm offers several benefits: 1) All congestion, interference, and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attacks are removed; 2) Buffer sizes in D-switches are reduced by 1000+ times; 3) End-to-end IoT delays can be reduced to ultra-low latencies, i.e., the speed-of-light in fiber; 4) The D-switches do not require Gigabytes of memory to store large IP routing tables; 5) Hardware support is provided in layer 3 for the US NIST Zero Trust Architecture; 6) Packets within a DVPN can be entirely encrypted using Quantum Safe encryption, which is impervious to attacks by Quantum Computers using existing quantum algorithms; 7) The probability of an undetected cyberattack targeting a DVPN can be made arbitrarily small by using long Quantum Safe encryption keys; and 8) Savings can reach $10s of Billions per year, through reduced capital, energy and operational costs.

TI Ultrafast spin dynamics in magnetic trimer and tetramer clusters: a step
   towards prototypic spin-SHIFT registers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Ultrafast magnetic dynamics is a necessary ingredient for magnetic recording and ultrafast information processing. The shift functionality, although not mandatory for Boolean logic, is always implemented in CMOS CPUs and therefore must be also present in magnetic logic. In this respect, using ab initio calculations we show ultrafast spin dynamics in molecular clusters such as Co3 +CO and Ni4. In this work, we establish that clusters with magnetic atoms can provide a theoretical toolbox for efficient spin charge dynamics whose operation time can range up to a few picoseconds. The prime underlying mechanism for all spin manipulation scenarios in the above mentioned clusters are laser-induced Lambda processes where the laser parameters are fully optimized using a genetic algorithm. In general, a structural asymmetry enforces substantial spin localization on the active centers of both magnetic clusters. Keeping in mind the shift functionality, we theoretically suggest a series of spin-transfer scenarios between the Co and Ni atoms in each of these two clusters independently to construct a 3-bit and a 4-bit cyclic spin-SHIFT register, respectively. The maximum operational time for both logic devices is 2 ps, which is much faster than the response time of conventional spintronic devices. Additionally, for a better understanding of the transfer cycles, their feasibility and reversibility are also investigated through the analysis of the optical spectra of the related states. Our results provide important theoretical guidance for ultrafast spin manipulation in molecular structures as well as their potential spin functionality, and thus step closer to the realization of future spin-based logic devices and quantum computation. This effectively motivates the investigation and precise establishment of the shift functionality in magnetic trimers and tetramers.

TI Page curve and symmetries
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Motivated by the quantum process of black hole evaporation and its implications for symmetries, we consider a qubit system with a random dynamics as a toy model of black hole. We compute its symmetry-resolved entropies and discuss its implications. We first consider the case where charges are conserved and compute the symmetry-resolved entropies. We derive a symmetry-resolved analogue of the Page curve. We then consider the case where symmetry is explicitly broken and charges are no longer conserved. It serves as a toy model for global symmetry breaking in black hole evaporation. Despite the simple framework, the symmetry-resolved entropies capture various interesting features during the analogous process of black hole evaporation in our qubit model.

TI Hermitian matrix definiteness from quantum phase estimation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB An algorithm to classify a general Hermitian matrix according to its signature (positive semi-definite, negative or indefinite) is presented. It builds on the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm, which stores the sign of the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix in one ancillary qubit. The signature of the matrix is extracted from the mean value of a spin operator in this single ancillary qubit. The algorithm is probabilistic, but it shows good performance, achieving 97% of correct classifications with few qubits. The computational cost scales comparably to the classical one in the case of a generic matrix, but improves significantly for restricted classes of matrices like k-local or sparse Hamiltonians.

TI The learnability of Pauli noise
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, several quantum benchmarking algorithms have been developed to characterize noisy quantum gates on today's quantum devices. A fundamental issue in benchmarking is that not everything about quantum noise is learnable due to the existence of gauge freedom, leaving open the question what information is learnable and what is not, which is unclear even for a single CNOT gate. Here we give a precise characterization of the learnability of Pauli noise channels attached to Clifford gates using graph theoretical tools. Our results reveal the optimality of cycle benchmarking in the sense that it can extract all learnable information about Pauli noise. We experimentally demonstrate noise characterization of IBM's CNOT gate up to 2 unlearnable degrees of freedom, for which we obtain bounds using physical constraints. In addition, we show that an attempt to extract unlearnable information by ignoring state preparation noise yields unphysical estimates, which is used to lower bound the state preparation noise.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver techniques for simulating carbon
   monoxide oxidation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The variational quantum eigensolver is a quantum-classical algorithm used to solve optimisation problems in machine learning but demonstrates limitations when applied to simulations of large molecules. Here, the authors explore the use of adaptive variational algorithms and demonstrate how they can be used to improve performance when simulating molecules participating in carbon monoxide processes.
   Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) methods aim to maximize the resources of existing noisy devices. However, they encounter difficulties in simulating molecules of industrially-relevant sizes, such as constructing the efficient ansatz. Adaptive variational algorithms (ADAPT-VQE) can solve this problem but with a significant increase in the number of measurements. Here, we reduce the measurement overhead of ADAPT-VQE via adding operator batches to the ansatz while keeping it compact. We reformulate the previously proposed qubit pool completeness criteria for the tapered qubit space and propose an automated pool construction procedure. Our numerical results indicate that reducing the qubit pool size from polynomial to linear conversely increases the number of measurements. We simulate a set of molecules, participating in the carbon monoxide oxidation processes using the statevector simulator and compare the results with VQE-UCCSD and classical methods. Our results pave the way towards usage of variational approaches for solving practically relevant chemical problems.

AB Topological quantum codes are favored because they allow suitable qubit layouts for practical implementation. An N-qubit topological code can be decoded by minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) with complexity O(poly(N)). Recently it is shown that various quantum codes, including topological codes, can be decoded by an adapted belief propagation with memory effects (denoted MBP) with complexity almost linear in N. In this paper, we show that various two-dimensional topological codes, CSS or non-CSS, regardless of the layout, can be decoded by MBP, including color codes and a family of twisted XZZX codes. We will comprehensively compare these codes in terms of code efficiency and decoding performance, assuming perfect error syndromes.

TI Fundamental decoherence from quantum spacetime
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding whether quantum gravitational effects can lead to a fundamental decoherence, affecting all systems regardless of their environment, is a long standing open challenge. Here we provide a rigorous derivation of decoherence within a full-fledged model of quantum spacetime, encoded by noncommutativity at the Planck scale. Specifically, we obtain a generalized time evolution of quantum systems in which pure states can evolve into mixed states. This takes the form of a Lindblad-like time evolution for the density operator when the action of time translations generator is deformed by the effects of spacetime noncommutativity. The decoherence time for the evolution of a free particle is used to show that the Planck mass is the maximum allowed mass for elementary quantum systems.
   Bridging quantum mechanics and general relativity, two pillars of modern physics, lies at the forefront of scientific research. In this manuscript, the authors shed light on this problem by showing that the fundamental properties of spacetime at the Planck scale dictate quantum decoherence that transforms a pure quantum state into a mixed state.

TI Emergence of strong tunable linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling in
   two-dimensional hole gases in semiconductor quantum wells
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) in semiconductor quantum wells are promising platforms for spintronics and quantum computation, but suffer from the lack of the k-linear term in the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is essential for spin manipulations without magnetism. The Rashba SOC in 2DHGs is commonly believed to be a k-cubic term as the lowest order. Here, contrary to conventional wisdom, we taking Ge/Si system as an example uncover a strong and tunable k-linear Rashba SOC in 2DHGs of semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) by performing atomistic pseudopotential calculations in conjunction with theoretical analysis based on the effective model Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate that this emergent k-linear Rashba SOC is a first-order direct Rashba effect, originating from a combination of heavy-hole-light-hole mixing and direct dipolar coupling to the external electric field. The enhanced interband mixing renders [110]-oriented Ge/Si QWs a much stronger linear Rashba SOC than [001]-oriented counterpart with the maximal strength exceeding 120 meVA, comparable to the highest values reported in two-dimensional electron gases made by narrow band-gap III-V semiconductors, which suffers from short spin lifetime due to the presence of nuclear spin. These findings confirm Ge-based 2DHGs to be an excellent platform for large-scale quantum computation.

TI Ligand field design enables quantum manipulation of spins in
   Ni2+ complexes
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Creating the next generation of quantum systems requires control and tunability, which are key features of molecules. To design these systems, one must consider the ground-state and excited-state manifolds. One class of systems with promise for quantum sensing applications, which require water solubility, are d(8) Ni2+ ions in octahedral symmetry. Yet, most Ni2+ complexes feature large zero-field splitting, precluding manipulation by commercial microwave sources due to the relatively large spin-orbit coupling constant of Ni2+ (630 cm(-1)). Since low lying excited states also influence axial zero-field splitting, D, a combination of strong field ligands and rigidly held octahedral symmetry can ameliorate these challenges. Towards these ends, we performed a theoretical and computational analysis of the electronic and magnetic structure of a molecular qubit, focusing on the impact of ligand field strength on D. Based on those results, we synthesized <bold>1</bold>, [Ni(ttcn)(2)](BF4)(2) (ttcn = 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane), which we computationally predict will have a small D (D-calc = +1.15 cm(-1)). High-field high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data yield spin Hamiltonian parameters: g(x) = 2.1018(15), g(x) = 2.1079(15), g(x) = 2.0964(14), D = +0.555(8) cm(-1) and E = +0.072(5) cm(-1), which confirm the expected weak zero-field splitting. Dilution of <bold>1</bold> in the diamagnetic Zn analogue, [Ni0.01Zn0.99(ttcn)(2)](BF4)(2) (<bold>1 '</bold>) led to a slight increase in D to similar to 0.9 cm(-1). The design criteria in minimizing D in <bold>1</bold> via combined computational and experimental methods demonstrates a path forward for EPR and optical addressability of a general class of S = 1 spins.

TI Purcell-enhanced single photons at telecom wavelengths from a quantum
   dot in a photonic crystal cavity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum dots are promising candidates for telecom single photon sources due to their tunable emission across the different low-loss telecommunications bands, making them compatible with existing fiber networks. Their suitability for integration into photonic structures allows for enhanced brightness through the Purcell effect, supporting efficient quantum communication technologies. Our work focuses on InAs/InP QDs created via droplet epitaxy MOVPE to operate within the telecoms C-band. We observe a short radiative lifetime of 340 ps, arising from a Purcell factor of 5, owing to integration of the QD within a low-mode-volume photonic crystal cavity. Through in-situ control of the sample temperature, we show both temperature tuning of the QD's emission wavelength and a preserved single photon emission purity at temperatures up to 25K. These findings suggest the viability of QD-based, cryogen-free C-band single photon sources, supporting applicability in quantum communication technologies.

TI Taming Quantum Systems: A Tutorial for Using Shortcuts-To-Adiabaticity,
   Quantum Optimal Control, and Reinforcement Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Precise manipulation of quantum effects at the atomic and nanoscale has become an essential task in ongoing scientific and technological endeavors. Quantum control methods are thus routinely exploited for research in areas such as quantum materials, quantum chemistry, and atomic and molecular physics, as well as in the development of quantum technologies like computing, simulation, and sensing. Here, we present a pedagogical introduction to the basics of quantum control methods in tutorial form, with the aim of providing newcomers to the field with the core concepts and practical tools to use these methods in their research. We focus on three areas: shortcuts to adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and machinelearning-based control. We lay out the basic theoretical elements of each area in a pedagogical way and describe their application to a series of example cases. For these, we include detailed analytical derivations as well as extensive numerical results. As an outlook, we discuss quantum control methods in the broader context of quantum technologies development and complex quantum systems research, outlining potential connections and synergies between them.

TI Exploration of the Global Minimum and Conical Intersection with Bayesian
   Optimization
SO MOLECULAR INFORMATICS
AB Conventional molecular geometry searches on a potential energy surface (PES) utilize energy gradients from quantum chemical calculations. However, replacing energy calculations with noisy quantum computer measurements generates errors in the energies, which makes geometry optimization using the energy gradient difficult. One gradient-free optimization method that can potentially solve this problem is Bayesian optimization (BO). To use BO in geometry search, an acquisition function (AF), which involves an objective variable, must be defined suitably. In this study, we propose a strategy for geometry searches using BO and examine the appropriate AFs to explore two critical structures: the global minimum (GM) on the singlet ground state (S0) and the most stable conical intersection (CI) point between S0 and the singlet excited state. We applied our strategy to two molecules and located the GM and the most stable CI geometries with high accuracy for both molecules. We also succeeded in the geometry searches even when artificial random noises were added to the energies to simulate geometry optimization using noisy quantum computer measurements.

TI Sagnac-type entangled photon source using only conventional polarization
   optics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We designed and implemented a novel combination of a Sagnac-interferometer with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a source of polarization-entangled photons. The new versatile configuration does not require multi-wavelength polarization optics, yet it performs with a good polarization quality and phase-stability over a wide wavelength range. We demonstrate the interferometer using only standard commercial optics to experimentally realize the pulsed generation of polarization-entangled photon-pairs at wavelengths of 764 nm and 1221 nm via type-I spontaneous four-wave mixing in a polarization-maintaining fiber. Polarization entanglement was verified by a polarization-correlation measurement with a visibility of 95.5% from raw coincidence counts and the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality with S = 2.70 +/- 0.04. The long-term phase-stability was characterized by an Allan deviation of 8 degrees over an integration time of about 1 h with no active phase-stabilization.

This method avoids all reservoir approximations and offers new insights into quantum correlations, accurately capturing all non-Markovian dynamics. This method overcomes challenges in quantizing non-Hermitian systems and is applicable to diverse nanophotonic geometries.

TI An on-chip phased array for non-classical light
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum science and technology can offer fundamental enhancements in sensing, communications and computing. The expansion from wired to wireless links is an exciting prospect for quantum technologies. For classical technologies, the advent of phased arrays enabled directional and adaptive wireless links by manipulating electromagnetic waves over free space. Here we demonstrate a phased array system on a chip that can receive, image and manipulate non-classical light over free space. We use an integrated photonic-electronic system with more than 1000 functional components on-chip to detect squeezed light. By integrating an array of 32 sub-wavelength engineered metamaterial antennas, we demonstrate a direct free-space-to-chip interface for reconfigurable quantum links. On the same chip, we implement a large-scale array of quantum-limited coherent receivers that can resolve non-classical signals simultaneously across 32 channels. With coherent readout and manipulation of these signals, we demonstrate 32-pixel imaging and spatially configurable reception of squeezed light over free space. Our work advances wireless quantum technologies that could enable practical applications in quantum communications and sensing.

TI Homoepitaxial growth of isotopically enriched h10BN layers on
   h11BN crystals by high-temperature molecular beam epitaxy
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Isotope-enriched bulk hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals have enhanced properties that improve the performance of nanophotonic and quantum technologies. Developing methods to deposit epitaxial layers on such crystals enables the exciting prospects of producing isotope-engineered hBN layers and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the homoepitaxial growth of hBN with phase-separated 10B and 11B isotopes by high-temperature molecular beam epitaxy (HT-MBE). Controlled nucleation, improved surface uniformity, and step-flow growth of an h10BN epilayer were achieved by etching the h11BN bulk crystals with molecular hydrogen. The alignment of the h10BN epilayer and host h11BN lattices was confirmed by lattice-resolved atomic force microscopy. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy show that the bulk h11BN and h10BN epilayer have distinct phonon energies, with no intermixing of the van der Waals layers, thus enabling the different boron isotopes to be spatially separated in the heterostructure. This work demonstrates the potential of HT-MBE to produce isotopic heterostructures of hBN to advance future nanophotonic and quantum technologies.

TI Ramsey Imaging of Optical Traps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The mapping of the potential landscape with high spatial resolution is crucial for quantum technologies based on ultracold atoms. However, the imaging of optical dipole traps is challenging because purely optical methods, commonly used to profile laser beams in free space, are not applicable in a vacuum. In this work, we demonstrate precise in situ imaging of optical dipole traps by probing a hyperfine transition with Ramsey interferometry. Thereby, we obtain an absolute map of the potential landscape with micrometer resolution and shot-noise-limited spectral precision. The idea of the technique is to control the polarization ellipticity of the trap laser beam to induce a differential light shift proportional to the trap potential. By studying the response to polarization ellipticity, we uncover a small but significant nonlinearity in addition to a dominant linear behavior, which is explained by the geometric distribution of the atomic ensemble. Our technique for imaging of optical traps can find wide application in quantum technologies based on ultracold atoms, as it applies to multiple atomic species and is not limited to a particular wavelength or trap geometry.

TI Quantum range-migration-algorithm for synthetic aperture radar
   applications
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The 3D range-migration algorithm (RMA) and its 2D equivalent, the omega-k algorithm, are employed in a wide range of applications where reconstruction of synthetic aperture data is required, from satellite radar imaging of planets over seismic imaging of the earth crust, down to phased-array ultrasound and ultrasonic application, and recently in-line synthetic aperture radar for non-destructive testing. These algorithms are based on Fourier transforms and share their time-complexity. This limits highly-resolved measurement data to be processed at high speeds which would be advantageous for modern production feed lines. In this publication, we present the development and implementation of the RMA on a quantum computer that scales favourably compared to the time complexity of the classical RMA. We compare reconstruction results of simulated and measured data of the classical and quantum RMA. Hereby, the quantum RMA is run on a quantum simulator backend as well as on IBM's Q System One quantum computer. The results show that real world applications and testing tasks may benefit from future quantum computers.

TI d-Mon: A Transmon with Strong Anharmonicity Based on Planar c-Axis
   Tunneling Junction between d-Wave and s-Wave Superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a novel qubit architecture based on a planar c -axis Josephson junction between a thin flake d -wave superconductor, such as a high-Tc cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, and a conventional s -wave superconductor. When operated in the transmon regime the device-that we call "d mon"-becomes insensitive to offset charge fluctuations and, importantly, exhibits at the same time energy level spectrum with strong anharmonicity that is widely tunable through the device geometry and applied magnetic flux. Crucially, unlike previous qubit designs based on d -wave superconductors the proposed device operates in a regime where quasiparticles are fully gapped and can be therefore expected to achieve long coherence times.

TI Quantum state rotation: Circularly transferring quantum states of
   multiple users
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state exchange is a quantum communication task for two users in which the users faithfully exchange their respective parts of an initial state under the asymptotic scenario. In this work, we generalize the quantum state exchange task to a quantum communication task for M users in which the users circularly transfer their respective parts of an initial state. We assume that every pair of users may share entanglement resources, and they use local operations and classical communication in order to perform the task. We call this generalized task the (asymptotic) quantum state rotation. First of all, we formally define the quantum state rotation task and its optimal entanglement cost, which means the least amount of total entanglement required to carry out the task. We then present lower and upper bounds on the optimal entanglement cost, and provide conditions for zero optimal entanglement cost. Based on these results, we find out a difference between the quantum state rotation task for three or more users and the quantum state exchange task.

TI Widely tunable single-photon source with high spectral-purity from
   telecom wavelength to mid-infrared wavelength based on MgO:PPLN*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB By utilizing the extended phase-matching (EPM) method, we investigate the generation of single photons with high spectral-purity in a magnesium-doped periodically-poled lithium niobate (MgO:PPLN) crystal via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process. By adjusting the temperature and pump wavelength, the wavelength of the single photons can be tuned from telecom to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths, for which the spectral-purity can be above 0.95 with high transmission filters. In experiments, we engineer a MgO:PPLN with poling period of 20.35 mu m which emits the EPM photon pair centered at 1496.6 nm and 1644.0 nm and carry out the joint spectral intensity (JSI) and Glauber's second-order self-correlation measurements to characterize the spectral purity. The results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Our work may provide a valuable approach for the generation of spectrally pure single photons at a wide range of wavelengths which is competent for various photonic quantum technologies.

Recently, novel approaches of transmitting and receiving signals using advancement in quantum technology as "information coherent transfer" have been emphasized which overcomes the limitations of superconducting qubits. In the present investigation, a compact-sized circular-ring antenna was designed for a 12 GHz centre frequency. The antenna was topped with Gd(x)-doped YIG (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) thin disks to investigate its tunable operation over the tri-band (C to Ku) frequencies due to the photon-magnon coupling, which enables coherent qubit information transmission from an electromagnetic (EM) carrier to the magnons. The proposed prototype of the antenna is validated using HFSS simulation. To characterize the frequency tunability of the designed antenna, we measured the return loss (S-11) via a vector network analyzer as a function of dc magnetic field. Different concentrations of Gd-doped YIG ferrites (Gd-x-YIG) have been loaded on ring antennas to observe strong anti-crossing phenomena with the application of an external magnetic field. The designed antenna has a tunability of around 300% for a small applied magnetic field up to 3.7 kOe. The maximum gain of dual resonance antenna is 1.4 for higher magnetic field of 3.7 kOe. The highest efficiency and lowest bandwidth of 30% and 14% respectively, for Gd-0.1-YIG disk are observed. The measured normal mode splitting spectrum as a function of bias magnetic field that gives the maximum coupling strength is 153 MHz for a Gd concentration of 0.1. For practical applications, such antennas are suitable for use in tunable tri-band or multi-band applications (C to Ku).(c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Theoretical calculation of fiber cavity coupling silicon carbide
   membrance
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Single spin color centers in solid materials are one of the promising candidates for quantum informationprocessing, and attract a great deal of interest. Nowadays, single spin color centers in silicon carbide, such asdivacancies and silicon vacancies have been developed rapidly, because they not only have similar properties ofthe NV centers in diamond, but also possess infrared fluorescence that is more favorable for transmission inoptical fiber. However, these centers possess week fluorescence with broad spectrum, which prevents some keytechnologies from being put into practical application, such as quantum key distribution, photon-spinentanglement, spin-spin entanglement and quantum sensing. Therefore, optical resonator is very suitable forcoupling centers to filter their spectrum and enhance the fluorescence by Purcell effect. It is very advantageous to use the fiber end face as cavity mirrors, thereby the fiber can provide small cavity volume corresponding to a large enhancement in spin color centers, and collect the fluorescence in cavity simultaneously, which has no extra loss in comparison with other collection methods. In this work, the properties and performance of fiber Fabry-Perot cavity coupling silicon carbide membrane are mainly studied through theoretical calculation. Firstly, some parameters are optimized such as membrane roughness and mirror reflection by calculating the mode of the fiber cavity and enhancing the color centers coupling into the cavity, then analyzing the properties of different modes in cavity, the enhancement effect on cavity coupling color centers, and other relevant factors affecting the cavity coupling color centers. Next, the influences of dominated factor and vibration on the properties of the cavity, the enhancement and outcoupling of centers coupled into the cavity are investigated, and finally the optimal outcoupling efficiency corresponding to different vibration intensities is obtained. These results give direct guidance for the further experimental design and direction for optimization of the fiber cavity coupling color centers

TI Witnessing quantum steering by means of the Fisher information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Capturing specific kinds of quantum correlation is of paramount importance for quantum networking. Dif-ferent routes can be taken to achieve this task, highlighting different aspects of such quantum correlations. Following the recent theoretical results by Yadin, Fadel, and Gessner [Nat. Commun. 12, 2410 (2021)], we demonstrate experimentally how steering manifests in the metrological abilities of a bipartite state. Our results confirm the relevance of this approach, and compare the outcome with already employed alternatives.

TI Violet to Near-Infrared Optical Addressing of Spin Pairs in Hexagonal
   Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Optically addressable solid-state spins are an important platform for practical quantum technologies. Van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising host as it contains a wide variety of optical emitters, but thus far observations of addressable spins have been sparse, and most of them lacked a demonstration of coherent spin control. Here, robust optical readout of spin pairs in hBN is demonstrated with emission wavelengths spanning from violet to the near-infrared. It is found that these broadband spin pairs exist naturally in a variety of hBN samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range. Furthermore, the optimal wavelengths are identified for independent readout of spin pairs and boron vacancy spin defects co-existing in the same sample. These results establish the ubiquity of the optically addressable spin pair system in hBN across a broad parameter space, making it a versatile playground for spin-based quantum technologies.

TI Simulation of space-charge effects using a quantum Schrodinger approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW ACCELERATORS AND BEAMS
AB Space-charge effects play an important role in high intensity and high brightness particle accelerators. These effects were generally studied self-consistently by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations using a particle-in-cell method in the accelerator community. In this paper, we propose an alternative method to simulate the space-charge effects in the accelerator. Instead of solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations, the proposed approach solves the Schrodinger-Poisson equations to study the space-charge effects in accelerators. Using a quantum Schrodinger approach reduces the original problem from six-or four-dimensional phase space down to three or two spatial dimensions. It also provides a possibility to simulate accelerator beam physics on quantum computers by evolving the wave function through quantum gates. Benchmarks of a coasting proton beam through a focusing drift defocusing drift lattice show excellent agreement between the quantum Schrodinger method and the particle-in-cell method.

TI Microwave spectroscopy of Andreev states in InAs nanowire-based hybrid
   junctions using a flip-chip layout
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Josephson junctions, comprised of semiconducting nanowires, can be used to design qubit architectures but for the successful application, it is necessary to study their intrinsic excitation spectrum. Here, the authors adapt a flip-chip method to realize superconducting microwave circuits and perform spectroscopy of Andreev bound states in mesoscopic InAs/Al core/shell nanowire Josephson junctions.
   Josephson junctions based on semiconductor nanowires are potential building blocks for electrically tunable qubit structures, e.g., the gatemon or the Andreev qubit. However, an actual realization requires the thorough investigation of the intrinsic excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of low-loss superconducting microwave circuits that combine high quality factors with a well-controlled gate architecture by utilizing a flip-chip approach. This platform is then used to perform single-tone and two-tone experiments on Andreev states in in-situ grown InAs/Al core/half-shell nanowires with shadow mask defined Josephson junctions. In gate-controlled and flux-biased spectroscopic measurements we find clear signatures of single quasiparticle as well as quasiparticle pair transitions between discrete Andreev bound states mediated by photon-absorption. Our experimental findings are supported by simulations that show that the junction resides in the intermediate channel length regime.

TI Nonlinear down-conversion in a single quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Tailored nanoscale quantum light sources, matching the specific needs of use cases, are crucial building blocks for photonic quantum technologies. Several different approaches to realize solid-state quantum emitters with high performance have been pursued and different concepts for energy tuning have been established. However, the properties of the emitted photons are always defined by the individual quantum emitter and can therefore not be controlled with full flexibility. Here we introduce an all-optical nonlinear method to tailor and control the single photon emission. We demonstrate a laser-controlled down-conversion process from an excited state of a semiconductor quantum three-level system. Based on this concept, we realize energy tuning and polarization control of the single photon emission with a control-laser field. Our results mark an important step towards tailored single photon emission from a photonic quantum system based on quantum optical principles.
   Tailoring the properties of single photon emission is a key requirement in photonic quantum technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate frequency and polarisation control of photons emitted from quantum dots through a laser-controlled down-conversion process.

TI Harnessing quantum emitter rings for efficient energy transport and
   trapping
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Efficient transport and harvesting of excitation energy under low light conditions is an important process in nature and quantum technologies alike. Here we formulate a quantum optics perspective to excitation energy transport in configurations of two-level quantum emitters with a particular emphasis on efficiency and robustness against disorder. We study a periodic geometry of emitter rings with subwavelength spacing, where collective electronic states emerge due to near-field dipole-dipole interactions. The system gives rise to collective subradiant states that are particularly suited to excitation transport and are protected from energy disorder and radiative decoherence. Comparing ring geometries with other configurations shows that the former are more efficient in absorbing, transporting, and trapping incident light. Because our findings are agnostic as to the specific choice of quantum emitters, they indicate general design principles for quantum technologies with superior photon transport properties and may elucidate potential mechanisms resulting in the highly efficient energy transport efficiencies in natural light-harvesting systems.

AB Wavelength-sized microdisk resonators were fabricated on a single crystalline 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI) platform.

Moreover, the demonstrated wavelength-sized microdisk resonators exhibit WGMs whose resonant wavelengths are compatible with the zero-phonon lines of silicon related spin defects in 4H-SiCOI, making them a promising candidate for applications in cavity quantum electrodynamics and integrated quantum photonic circuits.

AB We report on an elementary quantum network of two atomic ions separated by 230 m. The ions are trapped in different buildings and connected with 520(2) m of optical fiber. At each network node, the electronic state of an ion is entangled with the polarization state of a single cavity photon; subsequent to interference of the photons at a beam splitter, photon detection heralds entanglement between the two ions. Fidelities of up to (88.0 + 2.2 - 4.7)% are achieved with respect to a maximally entangled Bell state, with a success probability of 4 x 10-5. We analyze the routes to improve these metrics, paving the way for long-distance networks of entangled quantum processors.

TI High-rate subgigahertz-linewidth bichromatic entanglement source for
   quantum networking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The generation of entangled photon pairs, which are compatible with quantum devices and standard telecommunication channels are critical for the development of long-range fiber quantum networks. Aside from wavelength, bandwidth matching, and high fidelity of produced pairs are necessary for high interfacing efficiency. High-rate, robust entanglement sources that satisfy all these conditions remain an outstanding experimental challenge. In this work, we study an entanglement source based on fourwave mixing in a diamond configuration in a warm rubidium vapor. We theoretically and experimentally investigate an alternative operating regime and demonstrate an entanglement source, which produces highly nondegenerate 795- and 1324-nm photon pairs. With this source we are able to achieve in-fiber pair-generation rates greater than 107/s, orders of magnitude higher than previously reported atomic entanglement sources. Additionally, given our source's native compatibility with telecom infrastructure and atomic systems, it is a step towards scalable quantum networks.

TI Accelerating multipartite entanglement generation in non-Hermitian
   superconducting qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Open quantum systems are susceptible to losses in information, energy, and particles due to their surrounding environment. One novel strategy to mitigate these losses is to transform them into advantages for quantum technologies through tailored non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this work, we theoretically propose a fast generation of multipartite entanglement in non-Hermitian qubits. Our findings reveal that weakly coupled non-Hermitian qubits can accelerate multiparty entanglement generation by thousands of times compared to Hermitian qubits, in particular when approaching the 2n-th order exceptional points of n qubits in the PT- symmetric regime. Furthermore, we show that Hermitian qubits can generate GHZ states with a high fidelity more than 0.9995 in a timescale comparable to that of non-Hermitian qubits, but at the expense of intense driving and large coupling constant. Our approach is scalable to a large number of qubits, presenting a promising pathway for advancing quantum technologies through the non-Hermiticity and higher-order exceptional points in many-body quantum systems.

TI Integration of Through-Sapphire Substrate Machining with Superconducting
   Quantum Processors
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate-scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.

TI Low-fidelity entanglement distillation with FIMAX
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Uncontrolled interactions with the environment introduce errors that remain a significant challenge to the reliability of quantum technologies using entanglement. An essential method to overcome or mitigate these errors is entanglement distillation, the transformation of multiple copies of weakly entangled states into a smaller number of approximately maximally entangled states. We present a comparative analysis of the distillation effectivity for the stabilizer-based two-copy entanglement distillation protocol, FIMAX, against other recurrent two-copy protocols, including ADGJ, DEJMPS, P1-P2 and the generalized BBPSSW protocol. We focus on low-fidelity bipartite quantum states in dimensions d = 2 and d = 3, which are particularly challenging to distill. Our findings demonstrate that FIMAX exhibits superior performance regarding the distillable share for these states. While other protocols struggle with highly noisy states, FIMAX successfully distills entanglement even when the initial state quality is severely compromised. These results highlight the protocol's capability to address the effects of environmental noise, advancing the robustness and scalability of quantum technologies leveraging entanglement distillation.

TI Transport signatures of phase fluctuations in superconducting qubits
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Josephson junctions supply the nonlinear inductance element in superconducting qubits. In the widely used transmon configuration, where the junction is shunted by a large capacitor, the low charging energy minimizes the sensitivity of the qubit to charge noise while maintaining the necessary anharmonicity to qubit states. We report here low-frequency transport measurements on small standalone junctions and identically fabricated capacitively-shunted junctions that show two distinct features normally attributed to small capacitance junctions near zero bias: reduced switching currents and prominent finite resistance associated with phase diffusion in the current-voltage characteristic. Our transport data reveals the existence of phase fluctuations in transmons arising from intrinsic junction capacitance.

TI Tunnel-Coupled Optical Microtraps for Ultracold Atoms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical microtraps with micrometer-scale sizes have emerged as a fundamental, versatile, and powerful platform for quantum sciences and technologies. This platform enables the bottom-up engineering of quantum systems, offering the capability of low-entropy preparation of quantum states with flexible geometry, as well as manipulation and detection at the single-site level. The utilization of ultracold itinerant atoms with tunnel coupling in optical microtraps provides new opportunities for quantum simulation, enabling the exploration of exotic quantum states, phases, and dynamics, which would otherwise be challenging to achieve in conventional optical lattices due to high entropy and limited geometric flexibility. Here, the development of tunnel-coupled optical microtraps for the manipulation of ultracold atomic quantum systems and its recent advances are briefly reviewed.

TI Single Photon Source from a Nanoantenna-Trapped Single Quantum Dot
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Single photon sources with high brightness and subnanosecond lifetimes are key components for quantum technologies. Optical nanoantennas can enhance the emission properties of single quantum emitters, but this approach requires accurate nanoscale positioning of the source at the plasmonic hotspot. Here, we use plasmonic nanoantennas to simultaneously trap single colloidal quantum dots and enhance their photoluminescence. The nano-optical trapping automatically locates the quantum emitter at the nanoantenna hotspot without further processing. Our dedicated nanoantenna design achieves a high trap stiffness of 0.6 (fN/nm)/mW for quantum dot trapping, together with a relatively low trapping power of 2 mW/mu m(2). The emission from the nanoantennatrapped single quantum dot shows 7x increased brightness, 50x reduced blinking, 2x shortened lifetime, and a clear antibunching below 0.5 demonstrating true single photon emission. Combining nano-optical tweezers with plasmonic enhancement is a promising route for quantum technologies and spectroscopy of single nano-objects.

TI Quantum G-coherence factorization law under fully and strictly
   incoherent operations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum coherence plays an important role in quantum resource theory, which is strongly related with entanglement. In order to quantify the full coherence of qudit states, we define G-coherence and convex roof of G-coherence, and prove that the G-coherence is a strong coherence monotone and the convex roof of G-coherence is a coherence measure under fully and strictly incoherent operation (FSIO), respectively. Similar to the entanglement factorization law, we prove a coherence factorization law for arbitrary d-dimensional quantum pure and mixed states under FSIO channels, which generalizes the entanglement factorization law for bipartite pure states. Our results will play an important role in the simplification of dynamical coherence measure.

TI Noise Robustness of Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Relaxation is a common way for dealing with combinatorial optimization problems. Quantum random-access optimization (QRAO) is a quantum-relaxation-based optimizer that uses fewer qubits than the number of bits in the original problem by encoding multiple variables per qubit using quantum random-access code (QRAC). Reducing the number of qubits will alleviate physical noise (typically, decoherence), and as a result, the quality of the binary solution of QRAO may be robust against noise, which is, however, unknown. In this article, we numerically demonstrate that the mean approximation ratio of the (3, 1)-QRAC Hamiltonian, i.e., the Hamiltonian utilizing the encoding of three bits into one qubit by QRAC, is less affected by noise compared with the conventional Ising Hamiltonian used in the quantum annealer and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Based on this observation, we discuss a plausible mechanism behind the robustness of QRAO under depolarizing noise. Finally, we assess the number of shots required to estimate the values of binary variables correctly under depolarizing noise and show that the (3, 1)-QRAC Hamiltonian requires less shots to achieve the same accuracy compared with the Ising Hamiltonian.

TI Effect of double quantum dot asymmetry on electron localization
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In this paper, we study the localization of an electron in a binary quantum system formed by a pair of quantum dots (QDs). The traditional theoretical consideration of such systems is limited to the symmetrical case when QDs in such double quantum dot (DQD) are assumed identical in all respects. In this paper, we model the effects of breaking QD similarities in a DQD by studying two-dimensional (2D) DQDs as a double quantum well (DQW). This is done by solving the Schrodinger equation, with parameters chosen to describe an InAs/GaAs heterostructure. We calculate the energy spectrum of the electron confinement and the spectral distribution of localized/delocalized spatial states. Both symmetric and asymmetric QW shapes are considered and their effects are compared. The effects of symmetry breaking are explained within the framework of the two-level system theory. We delineate the QW weak and strong coupling cases in DQW. In particular, we show that the coherence in ideal DQW is unstable in the case of a weak QW coupling. Within the framework of the proposed approach, a charge qubit realized on a DQD is discussed and, as an example, a qubit based on an almost ideal DQD is proposed.

TI Dynamical phase and quantum heat at fractional frequencies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate a genuine quantum feature of heat: the power emitted by a qubit (quantum two-level system) into a reservoir under continuous driving shows peaks as a function of frequency f. These resonant features appear due to the accumulation of the dynamical phase during the driving. The position of the nth maximum is given by f = fM/n, where fM is the mean frequency of the qubit in the cycle, and their positions are independent of the form of the drive and the number of heat baths attached, and even the presence or absence of spectral filtering. We show that the waveform of the drive determines the intensity of the peaks, differently for odd and even resonances. This quantum heat is expected to play a crucial role in the performance of driven thermal devices such as quantum heat engines and refrigerators. We also show that, by optimizing the cycle protocol, we recover the favorable classical limit in fast driven systems without the use of counterdiabatic drive protocols, and we demonstrate an entropy preserving nonunitary process. We propose that this non-trivial quantum heat can be detected by observing the steady-state power absorbed by a resistor acting as a bolometer attached to a driven superconducting qubit.

TI Quantum core affect. Color-emotion structure of semantic atom
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Psychology suffers from the absence of mathematically-formalized primitives. As a result, conceptual and quantitative studies lack an ontological basis that would situate them in the company of natural sciences. The article addresses this problem by describing a minimal psychic structure, expressed in the algebra of quantum theory. The structure is demarcated into categories of emotion and color, renowned as elementary psychological phenomena. This is achieved by means of quantum-theoretic qubit state space, isomorphic to emotion and color experiences both in meaning and math. In particular, colors are mapped to the qubit states through geometric affinity between the HSL-RGB color solids and the Bloch sphere, widely used in physics. The resulting correspondence aligns with the recent model of subjective experience, producing a unified spherical map of emotions and colors. This structure is identified as a semantic atom of natural thinking-a unit of affectively-colored personal meaning, involved in elementary acts of a binary decision. The model contributes to finding a unified ontology of both inert and living Nature, bridging previously disconnected fields of research. In particular, it enables theory-based coordination of emotion, decision, and cybernetic sciences, needed to achieve new levels of practical impact.

TI Quantum advantages for Pauli channel estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that entangled measurements provide an exponential advantage in sample complexity for Pauli channel estimation, which is both a fundamental problem and a practically important subroutine for benchmarking near-term quantum devices. The specific task we consider is to simultaneously learn all the eigenvalues of an n-qubit Pauli channel to +/-epsilon precision. We give an estimation protocol with an n-qubit ancilla that succeeds with high probability using only O(n/epsilon(2)) copies of the Pauli channel, while proving that any ancilla-free protocol (possibly with adaptive control and channel concatenation) would need at least Omega(2(n)(/3)) rounds of measurement. We further study the advantages provided by a small number of ancillas. For the case that a k-qubit ancilla (k <= n) is available, we obtain a sample complexity lower bound of Omega(2(()(n-k)()/3)) for any nonconcatenating protocol, and a stronger lower bound of Omega(n2(n-k)) for any nonadaptive, nonconcatenating protocol, which is shown to be tight. We also show how to apply the ancilla-assisted estimation protocol to a practical quantum benchmarking task in a noise-resilient and sample-efficient manner, given reasonable noise assumptions. Our results provide a practically interesting example for quantum advantages in learning and also bring insights for quantum benchmarking.

Recently coherence and entanglement are considered as a dynamical resource where the nonclassicality is strongly related to the amount of the static resources which can be generated in a quantum process. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 130401 (2020)], for the first time, the authors study the interconvertability of these two kinds of dynamical resources. Here, we demonstrate this resource conversion in an all optical setup, and successfully observe the dynamical resource conversion. The experimental observation prove the ability of manipulating dynamical resource within current quantum photonic technologies.

Here we show that this regime can be achieved in a triply resonant integrated photonic device made of two coupled ring resonators, in a material platform displaying an intrinsic third-order nonlinearity. By strongly driving one of the three resonances of the system, a weak coherent probe at one of the others results in a strongly suppressed two-photon probability at the output, evidenced by an antibunched second-order correlation function at zerotime delay under continuous wave driving.

TI One-step quantum dialogue
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum dialogue (QD) enables two communication parties to directly exchange secret messages simultaneously. In conventional QD protocols, photons need to transmit in the quantum channel for two rounds. In this paper, we propose a one-step QD protocol based on the hyperentanglement. With the help of the non-local hyperentanglement-assisted Bell state measurement (BSM), the photons only need to transmit in the quantum channel once. We prove that our one-step QD protocol is secure in theory and numerically simulate its secret message capacity under practical experimental condition. Compared with previous QD protocols, the one-step QD protocol can effectively simplify the experiment operations and reduce the message loss caused by the photon transmission loss. Meanwhile, the non-local hyperentanglement-assisted BSM has a success probability of 100% and is feasible with linear optical elements. Moreover, combined with the hyperentanglement heralded amplification and purification, our protocol is possible to realize long-distance one-step QD.

TI QUBO Problem Formulation of Fragment-Based Protein-Ligand Flexible
   Docking
SO ENTROPY
AB Protein-ligand docking plays a significant role in structure-based drug discovery. This methodology aims to estimate the binding mode and binding free energy between the drug-targeted protein and candidate chemical compounds, utilizing protein tertiary structure information. Reformulation of this docking as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem to obtain solutions via quantum annealing has been attempted. However, previous studies did not consider the internal degrees of freedom of the compound that is mandatory and essential. In this study, we formulated fragment-based protein-ligand flexible docking, considering the internal degrees of freedom of the compound by focusing on fragments (rigid chemical substructures of compounds) as a QUBO problem. We introduced four factors essential for fragment-based docking in the Hamiltonian: (1) interaction energy between the target protein and each fragment, (2) clashes between fragments, (3) covalent bonds between fragments, and (4) the constraint that each fragment of the compound is selected for a single placement. We also implemented a proof-of-concept system and conducted redocking for the protein-compound complex structure of Aldose reductase (a drug target protein) using SQBM+, which is a simulated quantum annealer. The predicted binding pose reconstructed from the best solution was near-native (RMSD = 1.26 & Aring;), which can be further improved (RMSD = 0.27 & Aring;) using conventional energy minimization. The results indicate the validity of our QUBO problem formulation.

TI Majorana signatures in charge transport through a topological
   superconducting double-island system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the dynamics of a charge qubit consisting of two Coulomb-blockaded islands hosting Majorana zero modes. The frequency of the qubit is determined by coherent single-electron tunneling between two islands originating from the hybridization of two Majorana zero modes localized at the junction. We calculate the sequential tunneling current I through the double-island device coupled to normal metal leads. We demonstrate that the I-V characteristics in the large-bias regime can be used as a measurement of the coherent Majorana coupling EM. We propose dc and ac transport experiments for measuring EM, and discuss their limitations due to intrinsic dephasing mechanisms such as excited quasiparticles.

TI Minor embedding with Stuart-Landau oscillator networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We theoretically implement a strategy from quantum computation architectures to simulate Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics in all-to-all connected networks, also referred to as complete graphs. The technique builds upon the triad structure minor embedding which expands dense graphs of interconnected elements into sparse ones which can potentially be realized in future on-chip solid-state technologies with tunable edge weights. As a case study, we reveal that the minor embedding procedure allows simulating the XY model on complete graphs, thus bypassing a severe geometric constraint.

TI scqubits: a Python package for superconducting qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB scqubits is an open-source Python package for simulating and analyzing superconducting circuits. It provides convenient routines to obtain energy spectra of common superconducting qubits, such as the transmon, fluxonium, flux, cos(2 phi) and the 0-pi qubit. scqubits also features a number of options for visualizing the computed spectral data, including plots of energy levels as a function of external parameters, display of matrix elements of various operators as well as means to easily plot qubit wavefunctions. Many of these tools are not limited to single qubits, but extend to composite Hilbert spaces consisting of coupled superconducting qubits and harmonic (or weakly anharmonic) modes. The library provides an extensive suite of methods for estimating qubit coherence times due to a variety of commonly considered noise channels. While all functionality of scqubits can be accessed programatically, the package also implements GUI-like widgets that, with a few clicks can help users both create relevant Python objects, as well as explore their properties through various plots. When applicable, the library harnesses the computing power of multiple cores via multiprocessing. scqubits further exposes a direct interface to the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) package, allowing the user to efficiently leverage QuTiP's proven capabilities for simulating time evolution.

TI Nonclassicality of open circuit QED systems in the deep-strong coupling
   regime
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate theoretically how the ground state of a qubit-resonator (Q-R) system in the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime is affected by the coupling to an environment. We employ as a variational ansatz for the ground state of the Q-R-environment system a superposition of coherent states displaced in qubit-state-dependent directions. We show that the reduced density matrix of the Q-R system strongly depends on how the system is coupled to the environment, i.e. capacitive or inductive, because of the broken rotational symmetry of the eigenstates of the DSC system in the resonator phase space. When the resonator couples to the qubit and the environment in different ways (for instance, one is inductive and the other is capacitive), the system is almost unaffected by the resonator-waveguide (R-W) coupling. In contrast, when the two couplings are of the same type (for instance, both are inductive), by increasing the R-W coupling strength, the average number of virtual photons increases and the quantum superposition realized in the Q-R entangled ground state is partially degraded. Since the superposition becomes more fragile with increasing the Q-R coupling, there exists an optimal coupling strength to maximize the nonclassicality of the Q-R system.

TI A simple approach for effective shearing and reliable concentration
   measurement of ultra-high-molecular-weight DNA
SO BIOTECHNIQUES
AB Pipetting and concentration measurement of viscous ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) DNA samples is challenging and often highly imprecise. Effective guidelines for handling UHMW samples are missing in the field. Herein, a simple and low-cost workflow is presented that enables accurate pipetting and reliable concentration measurement. Central to the workflow is the shearing of representative small aliquots of UHMW DNA samples to a fragment size <150 kb by vortexing them for 1 min with a glass bead in a round-bottomed 2-ml tube. Additionally, a solution is provided for accurate quantitation of high-molecular-weight DNA with fluorometric (Qubit [Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA]) methods by using an appropriate genomic DNA standard, resulting in values that match spectrophotometric (Nanodrop [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) optical density readings.
   METHOD SUMMARY This study provides guidance for handling ultra-high-molecular-weight DNA samples. A low-cost shearing approach based on vortexing with a glass bead is introduced that reduces the DNA fragment size of small representative aliquots to <150 kb, enabling reliable pipetting and concentration measurement. Additionally, the importance of using genomic DNA as standard for accurate Qubit fluorometric concentration measurement of high-molecular-weight DNA is demonstrated.

TI External-level assisted cooling by measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum resonator in a thermal-equilibrium state with a high temperature has a large average population and is featured with significant occupation over Fock states with a high excitation number. The resonator could be cooled down via continuous measurements on the ground state of a coupled two-level system (qubit). We find, however, that the measurement-induced cooling might become inefficient in the high-temperature regime. Beyond the conventional strategy, we introduce strong driving between the excited state of the qubit and an external level. It can remarkably broaden the cooling range in regard to the nonvanishing populated Fock states of the resonator. Without any precooling procedure, our strategy allows a significant reduction of the populations over Fock states with a high excitation number, giving rise to nondeterministic ground-state cooling after a sequence of measurements. The driving-induced fast transition constrains the resonator and the ancillary qubit at their ground state upon measurement and then simulates the quantum Zeno effect. Our protocol is applied to cool down a high-temperature magnetic resonator. Additionally, it is generalized to a hybrid cooling protocol by interpolating the methods with and without strong driving, which can accelerate the cooling process and increase the overlap between the final state of the resonator and its ground state.

I work with a solution to the GW equation which is fractional linear in time derivatives. The resulting Hamiltonian is nonlocal and has ghosts, but is free of doublers and has the correct continuum limit. This construction works in general odd spatial dimensions, and I provide an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension.

TI Heralded Multiplexed High-Efficiency Cascaded Source of Dual-Rail
   Entangled Photon Pairs Using Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Deterministic sources of high-fidelity entangled qubit pairs encoded in the dual-rail photonic basis, i.e., presence of a single photon in one of two orthogonal modes, are a key enabling technology of many applications of quantum information processing, including high-rate, high-fidelity quantum communications over long distances. The most popular and mature sources of such photonic entanglement, e.g., those that leverage spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four-wave mixing, generate an entangled (so-called continuous-variable) quantum state that contains contributions from high-order photon terms that lie outside the span of the dual-rail basis, which is detrimental to most applications. One often uses low pump power to mitigate the effects of those high-order terms. However, that reduces the pair generation rate, and the source becomes inherently probabilistic. We investigate a cascaded source that performs a linear-optical entanglement swap between two SPDC sources, to generate a heralded photonic entangled state that has a higher fidelity (to the ideal Bell state) compared to a free-running SPDC source. Furthermore, with the Bell swap providing a heralding trigger, we show how to build a multiplexed source, which despite reasonable switching losses and detector loss and noise, yields a fidelity versus success probability trade-off of a high-efficiency source of high-fidelity dual-rail photonic entanglement. We find, however, that there is a threshold of 1.5 dB of loss per switch, beyond which multiplexing hurts the fidelity versus success probability trade-off.

SO PHOTONICS
AB There are numerous studies on the effects of ocean turbulence on wireless optical communications and on satellite-ground quantum key distribution (QKD); however, there are few studies on the impact of near sea-surface turbulence on ship-based QKD performance. This study investigates the influence of sea-surface atmospheric turbulence on laser beam propagation, atmospheric scintillation, and aiming error. It focuses on the impact of sea-surface turbulence on the performance of satellite-to-ship QKD and ship-to-ship QKD systems. The results show that strong turbulence severely degrades QKD system performance; horizontal transmission distances change from 32 km (weak turbulence) to 3 km (strong turbulence) in ship-to-ship QKD.

AB Theological engagement with quantum physics has, to this day, been dominated by the Copenhagen interpretation. However, philosophers and physicists working in the "quantum foundations" field have largely abandoned the Copenhagen view on account of what is widely seen as its troublesome antirealism. Other metaphysical approaches have come to the fore instead, which often take a strongly realist flavor, such as de Broglie-Bohm, or Everett's "Many-Worlds" interpretation. In the spirit of recent quantum foundations work, this article introduces a collection of studies aimed at taking quantum theology "beyond Copenhagen." The present article advocates a commitment to "quantum fundamentalism," which could resolve some of the enduring ontological problems faced by existing theological work with quantum mechanics, especially in discussions of quantum special divine action. Taking quantum fundamentalism literally would mean a departure from the Copenhagen interpretation, and the article suggests the need for a new research program to lay the groundwork in the natural theology of quantum foundations.

TI The weight hierarchy of decreasing norm-trace codes
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The Generalized Hamming weights and their relative version, which generalize the minimum distance of a linear code, are relevant to numerous applications, including coding on the wire-tap channel of type II, t-resilient functions, bounding the cardinality of the output in list decoding algorithms, ramp secret sharing schemes, and quantum error correction. The generalized Hamming weights have been determined for some families of codes, including Cartesian codes and Hermitian one-point codes. In this paper, we determine the generalized Hamming weights of decreasing norm-trace codes, which are linear codes defined by evaluating sets of monomials that are closed under divisibility on the rational points of the extended norm-trace curve given by x(u)=yqs-1+(y)q(s-2)+& ctdot;+y over the finite field of cardinality q(s), where u is a positive divisor of q(s)-1/q-1. As a particular case, we obtain the weight hierarchy of one-point norm-trace codes and recover the result of Barbero and Munuera (2001) giving the weight hierarchy of one-point Hermitian codes. We also study the relative generalized Hamming weights for these codes and use them to construct impure quantum codes with excellent parameters.

TI In-situ transmission electron microscopy investigation on surface
   oxides thermal stability of niobium
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Niobium is commonly used for superconducting quantum systems as readout resonators, capacitors, and interconnects. Structural defects at the Nb/Si and air/Nb interface may be a major source of two-level systems (TLS), which are detrimental to the device's coherence time. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS in Nb-based devices and their relationship to processing is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. This work studied the structure and thermal stability of surface oxide on physical vapor deposited Nb films on Si wafers, using aberration-corrected (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy. All Nb films exhibit columnar growth with strong [110] textures. After in-situ heating of the heterostructure at 360 ? inside the microscope, the initial amorphous niobium surface oxides decompose into face-centered cubic Nb nanograins in the amorphous Nb-O matrix, which may reduce microwave dissipation. Despite changes in the microstructure and chemistry of the niobium oxide surface layer due to heat treatment, the interface between the Nb and the surface oxide layer remains almost unchanged. Our comprehensive study of the Nb surface oxide decomposition mechanism may guide future superconducting qubit device optimization through interfacial scattering center and TLS minimization.

TI New holographic generalization of entanglement entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a new quantity, called pseudo-entropy, as a generalization of entanglement entropy via postselection. We expect this quantity to provide a new class of order parameters in quantum many-body systems. In the anti-de Sitter space (AdS)/conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence, this quantity is dual to areas of minimal area surfaces in time-dependent Euclidean spaces which are asymptotically AdS. We call this geometric computation of pseudo-entropy via the AdS/CFT the holographic pseudo-entropy. We study its basic properties and classifications in qubit systems. In specific examples, we provide a quantum information theoretic meaning of this new quantity as an averaged number of Bell pairs when the post-selection is performed. We also present properties of the pseudo-entropy for random states. We then calculate the pseudo-entropy in the presence of local operator excitations for both the two dimensional free massless scalar CFT and two dimensional holographic CFTs. We find a general property in CFI's that the pseudo-entropy is highly reduced when the local operators get closer to the boundary of the subsystem. We also compute the holographic pseudo-entropy for a Janus solution, dual to an exactly marginal perturbation of a two dimensional CFI' and find its agreement with a perturbative calculation in the dual CFT We show the linearity property holds for holographic states, where the holographic pseudo-entropy coincides with a weak value of the area operator. Finally, we propose a mixed state generalization of pseudo-entropy and give its gravity dual.

TI Polarization interferometric prism: A versatile tool for generation of
   vector fields, measurement of topological charges, and implementation of
   a spin-orbit controlled-Not gate
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Optical vortex and vector field are two important types of structured optical fields. Due to their wide applications and unique features in many scientific realms, the generation, manipulation, and measurement of such fields have attracted significant interest and become very important topics. However, most ways to generate vector fields have a trade-off among flexibility, efficiency, stability, and simplicity. Meanwhile, an easy and direct way to measure the topological charges, especially for a high order optical vortex, is still a challenge. Here we design and manufacture a prism: a polarization interferometric prism (PIP) as a single-element interferometer, which can conveniently convert an optical vortex to vector fields with high efficiency and be utilized to precisely measure the topological charge (both absolute value and sign) of an arbitrary optical vortex, even with a high order. Experimentally, we generate a variety of vector fields with global fidelity ranging from 0.963 to 0.993 and measure the topological charge of an optical vortex by counting the number of petals uniformly distributed over a ring on the output intensity patterns. As a versatile tool to generate, manipulate, and detect the spin-orbital state of single photons, PIP can also work in the single-photon regime for quantum information processing. In the experiment, the PIP is utilized as a spin-orbit controlled-Not gate on the generated 28 two-qubit states, achieving the state fidelities ranging from 0.966 to 0.995 and demonstrating the feasibility of the PIP for single photons.

The scattering characteristics are discussed detail in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes, and the corresponding conditions for achieving perfect nonreciprocal single-photon transmission are obtained. In the Markovian regime, a frequency-tunable single-photon diode with an ideal transmission contrast ratio can be realized by adjusting the frequency of the cavity mode, the local coupling phase difference, and the accumulated phase between the two coupling points. Furthermore, the influence of the intrinsic energy dissipations on the photon transport is discussed in detail. It is found that the dissipations of the cavity and the giant atom affect discriminatively the nonreciprocal single-photon scattering process. In the non-Markovian regime, the influence of the non-Markovian retarded effect induced by the time delay on the nonreciprocal single-photon scattering is discussed in detail. The results reveal that, although the retarded effect leads to a complex nonreciprocal scattering spectrum, dynamic tunable perfect nonreciprocal transmission with more abundant physical phenomena suitable for photons with different frequencies within a larger range can also be achieved. Such a nonreciprocal single-photon device can be used as an elementary unit for various quantum information processing and may have potential applications in quantum network engineering.

TI Optimal charging of a superconducting quantum battery
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum batteries are miniature energy storage devices and play a very important role in quantum thermodynamics. In recent years, quantum batteries have been extensively studied, but limited in theoretical level. Here we report the experimental realization of a quantum battery based on superconducting qutrit. Our model explores dark and bright states to achieve stable and powerful charging processes, respectively. Our scheme makes use of the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, which allows us to speed up the battery ergotropy injection. Due to the inherent interaction of the system with its surrounding, the battery exhibits a self-discharge, which is shown to be described by a supercapacitor-like self-discharging mechanism. Our results paves the way for proposals of new superconducting circuits able to store extractable work for further usage.

TI Potential Impact of CV-QKD Integration on Classical WDM Network Capacity
SO IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) could allow QKD and classical optical signals physically sharing the same optical fibers in existing networks. However, Raman scattering imposes a limit on the optical power, which in turn impacts the network capacity for classical traffic in presence of CV-QKD. Network-planning simulations indicate that maxing out the CV-QKD capacity in an optical link can adversely impact its classical capacity. Although preliminary, these results show that designing a mixed classical and CV-QKD network will require dedicated planning heuristics and tools that specifically seek a compromise between classical and CV-QKD traffics.

TI Robust and Efficient High-Dimensional Quantum State Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The exponential growth in Hilbert space with increasing size of a quantum system means that accurately characterizing the system becomes significantly harder with system dimension d. We show that self-guided tomography is a practical, efficient, and robust technique of measuring higher-dimensional quantum states. The achieved fidelities are over 99.9% for qutrits (d = 3) and ququints (d = 5), and 99.1% for quvigints (d = 20)-the highest values ever realized for qudit pure states. We also show excellent performance for mixed states, achieving average fidelities of 96.5% for qutrits. We demonstrate robustness against experimental sources of noise, both statistical and environmental. The technique is applicable to any higher-dimensional system, from a collection of qubits through to individual qudits, and any physical realization, be it photonic, superconducting, ionic, or spin.

TI Faking photon number on a transition-edge sensor
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We study potential security vulnerabilities of a single-photon detector based on superconducting transition-edge sensor. In one experiment, we show that an adversary could fake a photon number result at a certain wavelength by sending a larger number of photons at a longer wavelength, which is an expected and known behaviour. In another experiment, we unexpectedly find that the detector can be blinded by bright continuous-wave light and then, a controlled response simulating single-photon detection can be produced by applying a bright light pulse. We model an intercept-and-resend attack on a quantum key distribution system that exploits the latter vulnerability and, under certain assumptions, able to steal the key.

TI Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies
   generators and beyond
SO QUANTUM
AB We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations including syndrome measurements and local feedback one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry defined naturally within our formalism can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.

TI Quantum steering based on cascaded four-wave mixing processes
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Multipartite quantum steering is an important quantum resource and the basis of secure quantum communication network. Multipartite quantum steering can be generated by beam splitter networks, optical frequency comb systems and nonlinear processes. Different types of quantum steering will be produced by different projects. In this paper, we design two different schemes, i.e. series cascaded four-wave mixing and hybrid cascaded four-wave mixing, and based on these two schemes tripartite quantum steering and quinquepartite quantum steering are generated respectively. The steering characters among different users are quantified based on the covariance matrix. In theory, we investigate steering parameters among different modes created by two schemes versus the amplitude gain of four-wave mixing process. We find that one mode can steer the other two modes separately, but the other two modes cannot steer the one mode simultaneously. By comparing the steering characters of joint multimodes to a certain single mode with the individual mode to the single mode respectively, it can be seen that the steerability of the former is stronger than the latter in the whole gain region, and there exists only the steering of joint multimodes to a single mode in the partial gain region. More importantly, the steerability of joint multimodes to a single mode can be enhanced with the quantity of joint multimodes increasing. The results show that multiple types of quantum steering can be realized by using these two schemes, which are helpful in understanding the distribution of quantum steering in multipartite system and have important significance in practical secure quantum communication and quantum secret sharing.

TI Tensor network models of AdS/qCFT
SO QUANTUM
AB The study of critical quantum many-body systems through conformal field theory (CFT) is one of the pil-lars of modern quantum physics. Certain CFTs are also understood to be dual to higher-dimensional the-ories of gravity via the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. To reproduce var-ious features of AdS/CFT, a large number of discrete models based on tensor networks have been proposed. Some recent models, most notably including toy mod-els of holographic quantum error correction, are con-structed on regular time-slice discretizations of AdS. In this work, we show that the symmetries of these models are well suited for approximating CFT states, as their geometry enforces a discrete subgroup of con-formal symmetries. Based on these symmetries, we in-troduce the notion of a quasiperiodic conformal field theory (qCFT), a critical theory less restrictive than a full CFT and with characteristic multi-scale quasiperi-odicity. We discuss holographic code states and their renormalization group flow as specific implementations of a qCFT with fractional central charges and argue that their behavior generalizes to a large class of ex-isting and future models. Beyond approximating CFT properties, we show that these can be best understood as belonging to a paradigm of discrete holography.

TI Towards Equitable Representations of Ageing: Evaluation of Gender,
   Territories, Aids and Artificial Intelligence
SO LAND
AB There are few studies on the representation of older people regarding aids and assistive devices and even fewer that incorporate more inclusive views (gender, emotions, anti-ageist, territorial or land approach) as well as virtual or land ethnography or artificial intelligence. The general objective was to evaluate digital images of aids and assistive aids in the older population, from the perspectives mentioned above. Method. A descriptive and cross-sectional study that searched, observed and analyzed images. An evaluation of intentionally selected images from Freepik, Pixabay, Storyblocks, Splitshire, Gratisography and ArtGPT, included in an original database constructured by several authors of this article, was carried out in the context of the ENCAGEn-CM project (2020-2023, financed by the CAM and FSE). This base was updated and expanded in October and November 2023. In addition, an image generation process was carried out using artificial intelligence, and this was also part of the analysis (ArtGPT). Finally, algorithms were used to solve and retrain with the images. Results. Of the total final images included in the expanded database until November 2023 (n = 427), only a third (28.3%, 121/427) included the aids and assistive aids label. Representations of mixed groups predominated (38.8%) and, to a lesser extent, those of women. A large proportion of the devices were 'glasses' (74.6%) and the 'use of a cane' (14.9%). To a lesser extent, 'wheelchairs' (4.4%) or 'hearing aids' (0.9%) and the presence of more than one device (simultaneously) (5.3%) were noted. The main emotions represented were 'joy' (45.6%) and 'emotion not recognized' (45.6%), with, to a lesser extent, 'sadness' (3.5%), 'surprise' (4.4%) and 'anger' (0.9%). Differences by sex were found in the represented emotions linked to aids and assistive aids. The representation of images of the built environment predominated significantly (70.2%), and it was observed that older women were less represented in natural environments than men. Based on the previous findings, a method is proposed to address stereotypes in images of older individuals. It involves identifying common stereotypical features, like glasses and hospital settings, using deep learning and quantum computing techniques. A convolutional neural network identifies and suppresses these elements, followed by the use of quantum algorithms to manipulate features. This systematic approach aims to mitigate biases and enhance the accuracy in representing older people in digital imagery. Conclusion. A limited proportion of images of assistive devices and older people were observed. Furthermore, among them, the lower representation of images of women in a built environment was confirmed, and the expressions of emotions were limited to only three basic ones (joy, sadness and surprise). In these evaluated digital images, the collective imagination of older people continues to be limited to a few spaces/contexts and emotions and is stereotyped regarding the same variables (sex, age, environment). Technology often overlooks innovative support tools for older adults, and AI struggles in accurately depicting emotions and environments in digital images. There is a pressing need for thorough pretraining analysis and ethical considerations to address these challenges and ensure more accurate and inclusive representations of older persons in digital media.

Such a phenomenon in topological insulator-based Josephson trijunction provides unambiguous evidence for the existence of AJE in the system, and may provide an additional knob for controlling the Majorana bound states in the Fu-Kane scheme of topological quantum computation.

TI Long-Range Ising Interactions Mediated by λφ4 Fields: Probing
   the Renormalization of Sound in Crystals of Trapped Ions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The generating functional of a self-interacting scalar quantum field theory (QFT), which contains all the relevant information about real-time dynamics and scattering experiments, can be mapped onto a collection of multipartite-entangled two-level sensors via an interferometric protocol that exploits a specific set of source functions. Although one typically focuses on impulsive delta-like sources, as these give direct access to n-point Feynman propagators, we show in this work that using always-on harmonic sources can simplify substantially the sensing protocol. In a specific regime, the effective real-time dynamics of the quantum sensors can be described by a quantum Ising model with long-range couplings, the range and strength of which contains all the relevant information about the renormalization of the QFT, which can now be extracted in the absence of multipartite entanglement. We present a detailed analysis of how this sensing protocol can be relevant to characterize the long-wavelength QFT that describes quantized sound waves of trapped-ion crystals in the vicinity of a structural phase transition, opening a new route to characterize the associated renormalization of sound.

TI Nonclassical Mueller polarimetry
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum correlations are non-classical features of quantum systems that can be harnessed in new technologies. Nonlocality, a unique byproduct of the entanglement of more than one particle, can alter the causal sequence that is present in a classical measurement. In this work, we investigate a nonlocal form of Mueller polarimetry. In the classical method, light prepared in an initial state passes through a sample whose polarization properties are unknown, and the light's modified polarization state is subsequently measured. From a series of measurements, the Mueller matrix is obtained, which contains the polarization properties of the sample. In the nonclassical version of the technique presented here, the initial and final parts of this measurement were split into polarization projections on two polarization-entangled photons, but linked through quantum correlations in the post-selection process. We found the results with samples of known and unknown Mueller matrix using this approach to be equivalent to the classical ones. The nonlocal feature of the measurement can invert the causal order of preparation and measurement in the classical method. We present a study of its limitations when the entangled state of the photons is not the ideal one. From this work, we conclude that the technique is very resilient to imperfections in the quantum state of the photons, making it a feasible alternative to the classical method.

These techniques will likely lead to the first proof of principle of fault tolerance in the next 5 yr. In the long run, however, these approaches require a very large number of physical qubits to construct a fault-tolerant quantum circuit that can run interesting algorithms. As an alternative, it is proposed that quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes could serve as an architecture that circumvents this problem. The best candidate class of quantum LDPC codes were discovered by Tillich and Zemor and are called hypergraph product codes. These codes have a constant encoding rate and were recently shown to have a constant fault-tolerant error threshold. With these features, they asymptotically offer a smaller overhead compared to topological codes. Here, we demonstrate how to perform Clifford gates on this class of codes using code deformation. To this end, we introduce wormhole defects on hypergraph product codes. Together with state injection, we can perform a universal set of gates within a single block of the class of hypergraph product codes.

TI Quantum Property Preservation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum property preservation (QPP) is the problem of maintaining a target property of a quantum system for as long as possible. This problem arises naturally in the context of open quantum systems subject to decoherence. Here, we develop a general theory to formalize and analyze QPP. We characterize properties encoded as scalar functions of the system state that can be preserved time-locally via continuous control using smoothly varying, time-dependent control Hamiltonians. The theory offers an intuitive geometric interpretation involving the level sets of the target property and the stable and unstable points related to the noise channel. We present solutions for various noise channels and target properties, which are classified as trivially controllable, uncontrollable, or controllable. In the controllable scenario, we demonstrate the existence of control Hamiltonian singularities and breakdown times, beyond which property preservation fails. QPP via Hamiltonian control is complementary to quantum error correction, as it does not require ancilla qubits or rely on measurement and feedback. It is also complementary to dynamical decoupling, since it uses only smooth Hamiltonians without pulsing and works in the regime of Markovian open-system dynamics. From the perspective of control theory, this work addresses the challenge of tracking control for open quantum systems.

TI Ab initio investigation of the Cr substitutional defect in
   α-quartz for quantum applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Spin defects based on transition metals in wide-bandgap oxides represent compelling building blocks for quantum information technologies because they host highly localized electronic states with spin-dependent optical selection rules. Here, we assess alpha-quartz silicon dioxide (SiO2) as a promising platform for quantum technological applications by substituting an Si atom with Cr (denoted as Cr-Si). For our investigation, we use the r(2)SCAN exchange correlation functional due to its favorable accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio for defect energetics and structure. The r(2)SCAN functional provides a better accuracy than the typical generalized gradient approximation functionals. We also employ multi-reference complete active space self-consistent field to capture the d-electron excited states, particularly the low-spin states that density functional theory cannot accurately describe due to their multi-reference characters. The Cr-Si defect introduces deep, well-localized in-gap states and yields a paramagnetic ground state. These features are desirable for quantum applications because they can enable optical spin control. We calculate the excitation energy and the zero-field splitting for the relevant charge and spin configuration. We find that Cr-Si has an excitation energy between 1.26 and 1.33 eV for the first spin-allowed excitation, while the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters D (axial) and E (rhombic) are approximately 425 and 136 MHz, respectively. Comparison with the beta-quartz host indicates that alpha-quartz allows a lower excitation energy and an appropriately moderate ZFS, making it a promising solid-state qubit platform.

TI Ground state analysis of the spin-1/2 XX chain model with anisotropic
   three-spin interaction
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB In this paper, we investigate the ground state properties of the spin-1/2 XX chain model with anisotropic three-spin interaction using the fermionization technique. By exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we analyze the dispersion relation, ground state energy, and order parameters. Our findings identify two gapless phases, distinguished by a Lifshitz transition line: one exhibiting long-range chiral correlations and the other characterized by chiral-nematic correlations. These correlations do not correspond to conventional symmetry-breaking local order parameters typically associated with gapped one-dimensional phases but instead signify emergent quantum coherence in the gapless regime. Further, we study the ground state phase diagram through the concurrence and quantum discord between nearest-neighbor spins, finding that these measures are maximized at the critical line, with an additional entangled region observed. Finally, we examine the spin squeezing parameter and entanglement entropy, demonstrating that the ground state is squeezed throughout and becomes extremely squeezed at the critical line. Notably, in the gapless chiral-nematic phase, the Heisenberg limit is achieved. By dividing the system into two equal parts, we observe significant entanglement in the gapless chiral phase. The central charge calculation confirms the critical nature of the gapless chiral-nematic phase, while the entanglement entropy follows volume-law scaling in the gapless chiral phase.

TI More on genuine multientropy and holography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB By generalizing the construction of genuine multientropy GM & eth;q & THORN; for genuine multipartite entanglement proposed in the previous paper [Genuine multi-entropy and holography, Phys. Rev. D 112, 026011 (2025).], we give a prescription on how to construct GM & eth;q & THORN; systematically for any q. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number p & eth;a & THORN; of integer a. For general q, GM & eth;q & THORN; contains N & eth;q & THORN; 1/4 p & eth;q & THORN; - p & eth;q - 1 & THORN; - 1 number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give N & eth;q & THORN; & thorn; 1 number of new diagnostics for genuine q-partite entanglement. Especially for q 1/4 4 case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by Balasubramanian et al. [Multiboundary wormholes and holographic entanglement, Classical Quantum Gravity 31, 185015 (2014).], but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these GM & eth;q & THORN; for q 1/4 4, 5 in holography and show that these are of the order of O & eth;1/GN & THORN; both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.

TI Enhanced Exciton Quantum Coherence in Single CsPbBr3
   Perovskite Quantum Dots using Femtosecond Two-Photon Near-Field Scanning
   Optical Microscopy
SO ACS NANO
AB Cesium-halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have gained tremendous interest as quantum emitters in quantum information processing applications due to their optical and photo-physical properties. However, engineering excitonic states in quantum dots requires a deep knowledge of the coherent dynamics of their excitons at a single-particle level. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved two-photon near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) to reveal coherences involving a single cesium lead bromide perovskite QD (CsPbBr3) at room temperature. We show that, compared to other nonperovskite nanoparticles, the electronic coherence on a single perovskite QD has a relatively long lifetime of ca. 150 fs, whereas CdSe QDs have exciton coherence times shorter than 75 fs at room temperature. One possible explanation for the longer coherence time observed for the CsPbBr3 perovskite system is related to the exciton fine structure of these perovskite QDs compared to other nanoparticles. These perovskite QDs exhibit interesting optical properties that differ from those of the traditional QDs including bright triplet exciton states. In fact, due to the small amplitude of the energy gap fluctuations of dipole-allowed triplet states in perovskite QDs, the coherent superposition could be preserved for longer times. Furthermore, single-particle excitation approach implemented in this work allows us to remove effects of heterogeneity that are usually present in ensemble averaging experiments at room temperature. The realization of quantum-mechanical phase-coherence of a charge carrier that can operate at room temperature is an issue of great importance for the potential application of coherent electronic phenomena in electronic and optoelectronic devices. These interesting findings provide further evidence of the great potential of these perovskite QDs as candidates for quantum computing and information processing applications.

TI Investigation of Polarization Division Multiplexed CVQKD Based on
   Coherent Optical Transmission Structure
SO PHOTONICS
AB Employing commercial off-the-shelf coherent optical transmission components and methods to design a continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system is a promising trend of achieving QKD with high security key rate (SKR) and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we explore a CVQKD system based on the widely used polarization division multiplexed (PDM) coherent optical transmission structure and pilot-aided digital signal processing methods. A simplified pilot-aided phase noise compensation scheme based on frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is proposed, which introduces less total excess noise than classical pilot-aided schemes based on time division multiplexing (TDM). In addition, the two schemes of training symbol (TS)-aided equalization are compared to find the optimal strategy for TS insertion, where the scheme based on block insertion strategy can provide the SKR gain of around 29%, 22%, and 15% compared with the scheme based on fine-grained insertion strategy at the transmission distance of 5 km, 25 km, and 50 km, respectively. The joint optimization of pilot-aided and TS-aided methods in this work can provide a reference for achieving a CVQKD system with a high SKR and low complexity in metropolitan-scale applications.

AB We study the time evolution of entanglement entropy in expanding universes with various matters. To describe expanding universes holographically, we take into account a braneworld moving in an asymptotic AdS space involving a uniform p-brane gas. In the braneworld model, an observer living in the braneworld detects the bulk motion of the braneworld as an expanding universe. We show that the entanglement entropy of expanding universes increases by the volume law in the early time and by the area law in the late time. We further consider the cosmological horizon, which is the border of the visible and invisible universe, and then investigate the time-dependent quantum entanglement between them across the cosmological horizon.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI Compound Meta-Optics for Complete and Loss-Less Field Control
SO ACS NANO
AB Optical metasurfaces offer a compact platform for manipulation of the amplitude, phase, and polarization state of light. Independent control over these properties, however, is hindered by the symmetric transmission matrix associated with single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we utilize multilayer birefringent meta-optics to realize high-efficiency, independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization state of light. High-efficiency control is enabled by redistributing the wavefront between cascaded metasurfaces, while end-to-end inverse design is used to realize independent complex-valued functions for orthogonal polarization states. Based on this platform, we demonstrate spatial mode division multiplexing, optical mode conversion, and universal vectorial holograms, all with diffraction efficiencies over 80%. This meta-optic platform expands the design space of flat optics and could lead to advances in optical communications, quantum entanglement, and information encryption.

TI Integrated photon-pair source with monolithic piezoelectric frequency
   tunability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This work demonstrates the capabilities of an entangled photon-pair source at telecom wavelengths, based on a photonic integrated Si3N4 microresonator with monolithically integrated piezoelectric frequency tuning. Previously, frequency tuning of photon pairs generated by microresonators has only been demonstrated using thermal control, however these have limited actuation bandwidth and are not compatible with cryogenic environments. Here, the frequency-tunable photon-pair generation capabilities of a Si3N4 microresonator with a monolithically integrated aluminium nitride layer are shown. Fast-frequency locking of the microresonator to an external laser is demonstrated, with a resulting locking bandwidth orders of magnitude larger than reported previously using thermal locking. These abilities will have direct application in future schemes which interface such sources with quantum memories based on, e.g., trapped-ion or rare-earth-ion schemes.

TI Crafting the dynamical structure of synchronization by harnessing
   bosonic multilevel cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many-body cavity QED experiments are established platforms to tailor and control the collective responses of ensembles of atoms, interacting through one or more common photonic modes. The rich diversity of dynamical phases they can host calls for a unified framework. Here we commence this program by showing that a cavity QED simulator assembled from N-level bosonic atoms can reproduce and extend the possible dynamical responses of collective observables occurring after a quench. Specifically, by initializing the atoms in classical or quantum states, or by leveraging intralevels quantum correlations, we craft on demand the entire synchronization/desynchronization dynamical crossover of an exchange model for SU(N) spins. We quantitatively predict the onset of different dynamical responses by combining the Liouville-Arnold theorem on classical integrability with an ansatz for reducing the collective evolution to an effective few-body dynamics. Among them, we discover a synchronized chaotic phase induced by quantum correlations and associated to a first-order nonequilibrium transition in the Lyapunov exponent of collective atomic dynamics. Our outreach includes extensions to other spin-exchange quantum simulators and a universal conjecture for the dynamical reduction of nonintegrable all-to-all interacting systems.

TI Tight upper bound of the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant
   Bell inequality and its application in randomness certification
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The violation of a Bell inequality implies the existence of nonlocality, making device-independent randomness certification possible. This paper derives a tight upper bound for the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant Bell inequality (EBI) for arbitrary two-qubit states, along with the constraints required to achieve this bound. This method provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for violating the EBI for several quantum states, including pure two-qubit states and the Werner states. The lower bound of certifiable global randomness is analyzed based on the tight upper bound of the EBI for pure two-qubit states, with a comparison to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. The relationship between the noise level and the lower bound of certifiable global randomness with respect to the Werner states is also explored, and the comparisons with both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality are given. The results indicate that when the state approaches a maximally entangled state within specific quantified ranges, the EBI demonstrates advantages over both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality, providing theoretical guidance for experimental device-independent quantum random number generation.

AB One of the teleportation versions is applied to convey an entangled two-qubit system via a class of a two-qubit XYZ Heisenberg chain model. At thermal equilibrium, the exact solution of the XYZ model with an external magnetic field and the Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony interaction (KSEWA-interaction) is proposed in X, and Z direction. The teleported quantum Fisher information is studied, where we estimate the weight parameter theta, temperature and the strength parameter of KSEWAinteraction. It is found that, the strength of the KSEWA-interaction and the magnetic field be of benefit in the case of estimating the weight function. Meanwhile, the temperature decreases the teleported information.

TI Spatial correlations and entanglement in a hybrid system of N
   fermion pairs with harmonic interaction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Using the Moshinsky model, we analyze the spatial correlation and the entanglement of the ground state across different bipartitions of a system composed by N pairs of harmonically confined fermions of two different interacting species. We find that in the strongly attractive regime fermions tend to localize within a confined region, while Pauli exclusion induces a spatial repulsion among identical particles. Conversely, in the strongly repulsive regime, the system exhibits phase separation into two spatially distinct domains. We propose a suitably designed entanglement measure that takes into account the (in)distinguishable nature of the particles, so as to guarantee that only quantum correlations beyond exchange or Slater correlations contribute to the entanglement. Our findings reveal how entanglement varies across different bipartitions, influenced by both the number of pairs and the interaction strength. The obtained entanglement between distinguishable species increases with both N and the interaction strength, whereas the entanglement between subsystems of which at least one contains particles of both species decreases with N, suggesting a screening effect that weakens effective interactions among parties of the same kind. Our results sheds light on the intricate interplay between particle statistics and entanglement dynamics in composite quantum systems, and provides insights into the fundamental quantum correlations in fermionic systems.

SO PHYSICS ESSAYS
AB The object of this article is to present the vacuum energy and the dark energy within the framework of the theory of the dynamic medium of reference and to explain the phenomenal difference between the two energies. The dynamic medium is made up of entities (called gravitons) whose vectorial average of speed determines the speed of the flux of the medium at each point in space. It is shown that inside the horizon of black holes (defined by the Schwarzschild radius), the speed of flux is greater than the speed of light, which means that the gravitons themselves have a higher speed to that of light. The quantum entanglement of two photons which propagate in two opposite directions is due to a connection made by gravitons. It is therefore proposed that the gravitons move at the speed V-G approximate to R-universe/t(Planck) approximate to 2.4 x 10(69) m/s, which makes it possible to guarantee the entanglement of the two photons whatever their position in the Universe and the impossibility to measure the time taken by the influence of a photon to arrive at its twin photon because it is less than the Planck time t(Planck). The expression of the vacuum energy and that of the dark energy within the framework of the theory of the dynamic medium of reference is established. The two expressions E-vacuum and E-dark and the value of the speed of the most distant galaxies V-galaxy make it possible to calculate an approximate value of the speed of the gravitons V-G approximate to V-galaxy root E-vacuum /E-dark approximate to 2.8 x 10(69) m/s. This value of the speed of the graviton is very close to that obtained by the quantum entanglement of two photons, which reinforces the existence of nonmaterial entities going at these phenomenal speeds.

TI Ground-state chiral currents in the synthetic Hall tube
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Hall tube is an important model to simulate the quantum Hall effect. However it hasn't been realized in superconducting circuits which have emerged as a promising platform for macro-controlling quantum effect. Taking advantage of the fine tunability of superconducting circuits, the three-chain superconducting transmon qubits with periodic boundary condition are designed in this paper. For constructing a synthetic Hall tube, ac magnetic fluxes are introduced to drive each transmon qubit. The gauge field emerged in this synthetic Hall tube can be tuned independently by properly choosing the driving phases. Then the ground-state chiral currents are discovered in this synthetic Hall tube, which are Meissner current on xy plane (xy-M), vortex current on xy plane (xy-V), vortex current on xz plane (xz-V), and vortex current on both xy and xz planes (DV). For distinguishing these chiral currents, four order parameters J(C//), J(AB) (J(BC)), and J(CA) are defined. Then the ground-state quantum phase diagrams are mapped out. The emergence of the different quantum phases is due to the competition between the coupling strengths (t) over tilde and t(CA). The Meissner and vortex currents emerging in this synthetic Hall tube also emerge in type II superconductor, which can generate an opposite field to weaken the influence of the applied field. Thus this synthetic Hall tube can be used as a diamagnet. At last we consider the influence of the imperfections in device fabrication. We proof when the strength of the imperfection is not large enough, the quantum phase diagrams shown in this paper remain valid. Moreover, the possible experimental observations of the ground-state chiral currents are addressed. The ground state of this synthetic Hall tube can be generated by applying microwave pulses. Then the corresponding density matrix can be constructed by the quantum state tomography. After constructing the density matrix, the order parameters can be obtained by calculating the trace. These results enrich the quantum currents in Hall tube and provide a new route to explore novel quantum phases.

TI Single-hole physics in GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot system with strong
   spin-orbit interaction
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB There is rapidly expanding interest in exploiting the spin of valence-band holes rather than conduction-band electrons for spin qubit semiconductor circuits composed of coupled quantum dots. The hole platform offers stronger spin-orbit interaction (SOI), large difference between in-dot-plane and out-of-dot-plane g-factors, i.e. g-factor anisotropy, and a significantly reduced hyperfine coupling to nuclei in the host material. These attributes collectively can deliver fast all-electric coherent spin manipulation, efficient spin-flip inter-dot tunneling channels, a voltage tunable effective g-factor, a g-factor adjustable to nearly zero in an appropriately oriented external magnetic field, and long spin relaxation and coherence times. Here, we review our recent work on the physics of heavy holes confined in a planar GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot system with strong SOI. For a single-hole, we have performed resonant tunneling magneto-spectroscopy to extract spin-flip and spin-conserving tunneling strengths, implemented spin-flip Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry, determined the spin relaxation time T-1 as a function of magnetic field using a fast single-shot latched charge technique, electrically tuned the effective g-factor revealed by electric dipole spin resonance, and found signatures of the hyperfine interaction and dynamic nuclear polarization with holes. For two-holes, we have measured the energy spectrum in the presence of strong SOI (and so not limited by Pauli spin blockade), quantified the heavy-hole (HH) g-factor anisotropy on tilting the magnetic field, described a scheme to employ HHs whose g-factor is tunable to nearly zero for an in-plane magnetic field for a coherent photon-to-spin interface, and observed a well-defined LZSM interference pattern at small magnetic fields on pulsing through the singlet-triplet anti-crossing.

TI Entanglement as a Probe of Hadronization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions, which has been experimentally confirmed. In this Letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider, and find a good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of a quantum entanglement framework in an experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to nonperturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.

TI Progress in high-power and high-intensity structured light
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Structured light refers to the ability to tailor light in its many degrees of freedom, from the traditional control in time and space to more exotic multi-dimensional control for new forms of light, including vectorial light, toroidal excitations, spatio-temporal vortices, skyrmions, and optical mobius strips to name but a few. While the toolbox for the creation and detection of structured light has advanced tremendously, this has mostly been in the low power regime. More recently, structured light at high-power and high-intensities has emerged, fuelling new science and applications. In this progress report, we showcase the seminal work that has advanced this field, and indicate the open challenges and opportunities that remain.

TI Quantum deep learning by sampling neural nets with a quantum annealer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate the feasibility of framing a classically learned deep neural network as an energy based model that can be processed on a one-step quantum annealer in order to exploit fast sampling times. We propose approaches to overcome two hurdles for high resolution image classification on a quantum processing unit (QPU): the required number and the binary nature of the model states. With this novel method we successfully transfer a pretrained convolutional neural network to the QPU. By taking advantage of the strengths of quantum annealing, we show the potential for classification speedup of at least one order of magnitude.

TI Omnisolver: An extensible interface to Ising spin-glass and QUBO solvers
SO SOFTWAREX
AB We introduce a new framework for implementing Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) solvers called Omnisolver. The framework provides an out-of-the-box dynamically built command-line interface as well as an input/output system, thus heavily reducing the effort required for implementing new algorithms for solving BQMs. The proposed software should be of benefit for researchers focusing on quantum annealers or discrete optimization algorithms as well as groups utilizing discrete optimization as a part of their daily work. We demonstrate the ease of use of the proposed software by presenting a step-by-step, concise implementation of an example plugin.

TI Probing spin and lifetime correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon
   pairs
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime lifetime-lifetime correlations for A-A pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Ot, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a simple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of nonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement manifests decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal coherence.

TI Krylov complexity of modular Hamiltonian evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the complexity of states and operators evolved with the modular Hamiltonian by using the Krylov basis. In the first part, we formulate the problem for states and analyze different examples, including quantum mechanics, two-dimensional conformal field theories and random modular Hamiltonians, focusing on relations with the entanglement spectrum. We find that the modular Lanczos spectrum provides a different approach to quantum entanglement, opening new avenues in many -body systems and holography. In the second part, we focus on the modular evolution of operators and states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We find that, at late modular time, the spread complexity is universally governed by the modular Lyapunov exponent lambda mod L 1/4 2 pi and is proportional to the local temperature of the modular Hamiltonian. Our analysis provides explicit examples where entanglement entropy is indeed not enough; however the entanglement spectrum is, and encodes the same information as complexity.

TI Experimental realization of quantum walks near synthetic horizons on
   photonic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement plays crucial roles in quantum optics, providing a prerequisite for these recent unprecedented leaps. Nevertheless, the study of quantum entanglement under the influence of relativity, an important ingredient of quantum optics, still needs to be explored. In parallel, integrated photonic chips, particularly those with the aid of transformation optics, have simulated various relativity phenomena including gravitational lensing and Unruh radiation. However, thus far, studying relativistic quantum optics on this type of platform has not yet occurred. Here, we propose and experimentally realize quantum walks of entangled photons near an emulated Rindler horizon. Remarkably, we find that quantum interference near the synthetic horizon leads to a counterintuitive phenomenon of optical escape. Our study paves the way to a tabletop platform for studying quantum phenomena in various relativistic space-time metrics, and may bring an implication for the test of quantum theory in relativity.

TI Quantum tops at the LHC: from entanglement to Bell inequalities
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We present the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in t (t) over bar events at the LHC. We introduce a unique set of observables suitable for both measurements, and then perform the corresponding analyses using simulated events in the dilepton final state, reconstructing up to the unfolded level. We find that entanglement can be established at better than 5 sigma both at threshold as well as at high p(T) already in the LHC Run 2 dataset. On the other hand, only very high-p(T) events are sensitive to a violation of Bell inequalities, making it significantly harder to observe experimentally. By employing a sensitive and robust observable, two different unfolding methods and independent statistical approaches, we conclude that, at variance with previous estimates, testing Bell inequalities will be challenging even in the high luminosity LHC run.

TI Entangled radicals may explain lithium effects on hyperactivity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is known that bipolar disorder and its lithium treatment involve the modulation of oxidative stress. Moreover, it has been observed that lithium's effects are isotope-dependent. Based on these findings, here we propose that lithium exerts its effects by influencing the recombination dynamics of a naturally occurring radical pair involving oxygen. We develop a simple model inspired by the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian magnetoreception and xenon-induced anesthesia. Our model reproduces the observed isotopic dependence in the lithium treatment of hyperactivity in rats. It predicts a magnetic-field dependence of the effectiveness of lithium, which provides one potential experimental test of our hypothesis. Our findings show that Nature might harness quantum entanglement for the brain's cognitive processes.

TI The holographic entanglement pattern of BTZ planar black hole from a
   thread perspective
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we study the holographic quantum entanglement structure in the finite-temperature CFT state/planar BTZ black hole correspondence from the perspective of entanglement threads. Unlike previous studies based on bit threads, these entanglement threads provide a more detailed characterization of the contribution sources to the von Neumann entropy of boundary subregions, in particular by quantitatively deriving the flux function of entanglement threads that traverse the wormhole horizon and connect the two asymptotic boundaries. Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary. We also discuss the close connections of this work with concepts such as bit threads and partial entanglement entropy.

TI Interaction of a four-level atom with a quantized field in the presence
   of a nonlinear Kerr medium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum entanglement and atomic coherence are examined for a system consisting of a four-level atom (FLA) interacted with a nonlinear quantum field. We assume that the FLA-field coupling, Kerr medium and quantified field are all f -deformed with full nonlinear formalism. We consider N- configuration and cascade (C)-configuration of the FLA. We explore the impact of field deformation and Kerr medium on the dynamics of the quantumness measures when the quantized field is initially prepared in a deformed coherent state without and with Kerr medium effect. Moreover, we examine the statistical properties of the radiation field using the second order correlation function. The results indicate how the considered quantumness measures in the FLA-field system can be manipulated and controlled through the parameters of the quantum model.

TI Measurement of charged particle multiplicity distributions in DIS at
   HERA and its implication to entanglement entropy of partons: H1
   Collaboration
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Charged particle multiplicity distributions in positron-proton deep inelastic scattering at a centre-of-mass energy root s=319 GeV are measured. The data are collected with the H1 detector at HERA corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 136 pb-1. Charged particle multiplicities are measured as a function of photon virtuality Q2, inelasticity y and pseudorapidity eta in the laboratory and the hadronic centre-of-mass frames. Predictions from different Monte Carlo models are compared to the data. The first and second moments of the multiplicity distributions are determined and the KNO scaling behaviour is investigated. The multiplicity distributions as a function of Q2 and the Bjorken variable xbj are converted to the hadron entropy Shadron, and predictions from a quantum entanglement model are tested.

TI System of six-level atom interacting with a quantized field in the
   existence of time-varying coupling
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In the present manuscript, we extend the Jaynes-Cummings model in the framework of six-level atom (LA) system in the presence of a quantized field describes by an ordinary coherent state or a superposition state. We investigate the dynamics of the population, coherence and quantum entanglement in terms of the system pa-rameters. We analyze the time variation of the quantifiers in the presence and absence of time-varying coupling of the six-LA-field system and make comparison among the quantifiers. Furthermore, we show how the quan-tifiers can be controlled according to the values of the system parameters. The obtained results illustrate that the proposed system provides interesting values of the quantum coherence and entanglement which can be considered as good candidates for executing quantum optics and information schemes.

TI Designs of the divider and special multiplier optimizing T and CNOT
   gates
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum circuits for multiplication and division are necessary for scientific computing on quantum computers. Clifford + T circuits are widely used in fault-tolerant realizations. T gates are more expensive than other gates in Clifford + T circuits. But neglecting the cost of CNOT gates may lead to a significant underestimation. Moreover, the small number of qubits available in existing quantum devices is another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing T-count, T-depth, CNOT-count, CNOT-depth, and circuit width has become the important optimization goal. We use 3-bit Hermitian gates to design basic arithmetic operations. Then, we present a special multiplier and a divider using basic arithmetic operations, where 'special' means that one of the two operands of multiplication is non-zero. Next, we use new rules to optimize the Clifford + T circuits of the special multiplier and divider in terms of T-count, T-depth, CNOT-count, CNOT-depth, and circuit width. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed multiplier and divider have lower T-count, T-depth, CNOT-count, and CNOT-depth than the current works. For instance, the proposed 32-bit divider achieves improvement ratios of 40.41 percent, 31.64 percent, 45.27 percent, and 65.93 percent in terms of T-count, T-depth, CNOT-count, and CNOT-depth compared to the best current work. Further, the circuit widths of the proposed n-bit multiplier and divider are 3n. I.e., our multiplier and divider reach the minimum width of multipliers and dividers, keeping an operand unchanged.

TI Advances on Solid-State Vortex Laser
SO PHOTONICS
AB Vortex beams (VBs) are structured beams with helical wavefronts carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and they have been widely used in lots of domains, such as optical data-transmission, optical tweezer, quantum entanglement, and super-resolution imaging. The ability to generate vortex beams with favorable performance is of great significance for these advanced applications. Compared with extra-cavity schemes, such as spatial light modulation, mode conversion, and others which transform other modes into vortex modes, solid-state vortex lasers can output vortex beams directly and show advantages including a compact structure, high robustness, easy to integrate, and low cost. In this review, we summarize intra-cavity generation approaches to vortex beams in solid-state lasers. Our work on 1.6 mu m eye-safe vector vortex lasers is also introduced.

TI Gapped magnetic ground state in quantum spin liquid candidate
   κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3
SO SCIENCE
AB Geometrical frustration, quantum entanglement, and disorder may prevent long-range ordering of localized spins with strong exchange interactions, resulting in an exotic state of matter. kappa-(BEDT-TTF)(2)Cu-2(CN)(3) is considered the prime candidate for this elusive quantum spin liquid state, but its ground-state properties remain puzzling. We present a multifrequency electron spin resonance (ESR) study down to millikelvin temperatures, revealing a rapid drop of the spin susceptibility at 6 kelvin. This opening of a spin gap, accompanied by structural modifications, is consistent with the formation of a valence bond solid ground state. We identify an impurity contribution to the ESR response that becomes dominant when the intrinsic spins form singlets. Probing the electrons directly manifests the pivotal role of defects for the low-energy properties of quantum spin systems without magnetic order.

TI Time-Fractional Evolution of Quantum Dense Coding Under Amplitude
   Damping Noise
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB In this paper, we investigate the memory effects introduced by the time-fractional Schr & ouml;dinger equation proposed by Naber on quantum entanglement and quantum dense coding under amplitude damping noise. Two formulations are analyzed: one with fractional operations applied to the imaginary unit and one without. Numerical results show that the formulation without fractional operations on the imaginary unit may be more suitable for describing non-Markovian (power-law) behavior in dissipative environments. This finding provides a more physically meaningful interpretation of the memory effects in time-fractional quantum dynamics and indirectly addresses fundamental concerns regarding the violation of unitarity and probability conservation in such frameworks. Our work offers a new perspective for the application of fractional quantum mechanics to realistic open quantum systems and shows promise in supporting the theoretical modeling of decoherence and information degradation.

TI The Quantum Measurement Problem
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Measurements play a specific role in quantum mechanics; only measurements allow us to catch a glimpse of the eluding physical reality. However, there is something deeply unsatisfactory with this specificity-a measurement is itself a physical process! Several varying modes of coping with this dilemma have been proposed and this article tries to describe how a now-century-long discussion has led to new insights about the transition from the quantum to the classical world. Starting from the pioneer's view of the quantum measurement problem, it follows the development of formalisms, the interest from philosophers for its new aspects on reality and how different interpretations of quantum mechanics have tried to support our classically working brains in understanding quantum phenomena. Decoherence is a main topic and its role in measurement processes exemplified. The question of whether the quantum measurement problem is now solved is left open for the readers' own judgment.

TI Mechanical rotation modifies the manifestation of photon entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Mechanical rotation plays a central role in fundamental physics theories and has profound connections with the theory of general relativity. However, very few experiments have so far aimed to explore the interplay of mechanical rotation with entangled photon states. By adding Sagnac interferometers into the arms of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer that is placed on a mechanically rotating platform, we experimentally observe the modification of the symmetry of an entangled biphoton state due to noninertial motion. As the platform rotation speed is increased, we observe that HOM interference dips transform into HOM interference peaks. This indicates that the photons pass from perfectly indistinguishable (bosonic behavior), to perfectly distinguishable (fermionic behavior). This demonstration is of relevance to global satellite quantum communications and paves the way for further fundamental research that can test the influence of curved space on quantum entanglement.

TI Geometric entanglement in integer quantum Hall states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the quantum entanglement structure of integer quantum Hall states via the reduced density matrix of spatial subregions. In particular, we examine the eigenstates, spectrum, and entanglement entropy (EE) of the density matrix for various ground and excited states, with or without mass anisotropy. We focus on an important class of regions that contain sharp corners or cusps, leading to a geometric angle-dependent contribution to the EE. We unravel surprising relations by comparing this corner term at different fillings. We further find that the corner term, when properly normalized, has nearly the same angle dependence as numerous conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions, which hints at a broader structure. In fact, the Hall corner term is found to obey bounds that were previously obtained for CFTs. In addition, the low-lying entanglement spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions reveal "excitations" localized near corners. Finally, we present an outlook for fractional quantum Hall states.

TI Gaussian entanglement witness and refined Werner-Wolf criterion for
   continuous variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We use matched quantum entanglement witnesses to study the separable criteria of continuous variable states. The witness can be written as an identity operator minus a Gaussian operator. The optimization of the witness then is transformed to an eigenvalue problem of a Gaussian kernel integral equation. It follows a separable criterion not only for symmetric Gaussian quantum states, but also for non-Gaussian states prepared by photon adding to and/or subtracting from symmetric Gaussian states. Based on Fock space numeric calculation, we obtain an entanglement witness for more general two-mode states. A necessary criterion of separability follows for two-mode states and it is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a two-mode squeezed thermal state and the related two-mode non-Gaussian states. We also connect the witness-based criterion with Werner-Wolf criterion and refine the Werner-Wolf criterion.

TI Replica wormholes and holographic entanglement negativity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recent work has shown how to understand the Page curve of an evaporating black hole from replica wormholes. However, more detailed information about the structure of its quantum state is needed to fully understand the dynamics of black hole evaporation. Here we study entanglement negativity, an important measure of quantum entanglement in mixed states, in a couple of toy models of evaporating black holes. We find four phases dominated by different types of geometries: the disconnected, cyclically connected, anti-cyclically connected, and pairwise connected geometries. The last of these geometries are new replica wormholes that break the replica symmetry spontaneously. We also analyze the transitions between these four phases by summing more generic replica geometries using a Schwinger-Dyson equation. In particular, we find enhanced corrections to various negativity measures near the transition between the cyclic and pairwise phase.

TI Quantum mereology: Factorizing Hilbert space into subsystems with
   quasiclassical dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the question of how to decompose Hilbert space into a preferred tensor-product factorization without any preexisting structure other than a Hamiltonian operator, in particular the case of a bipartite decomposition into "system" and "environment." Such a decomposition can be defined by looking for subsystems that exhibit quasiclassical behavior. The correct decomposition is one in which pointer states of the system are relatively robust against environmental monitoring (their entanglement with the environment does not continually and dramatically increase) and remain localized around approximately classical trajectories. We present an in-principle algorithm for finding such a decomposition by minimizing a combination of entanglement growth and internal spreading of the system. Both of these properties are related to locality in different ways. This formalism is relevant to questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics and the emergence of spacetime from quantum entanglement.

In the last few years, several criteria have been proposed to detect this type of correlation in quantum systems. However, there are few approaches presented in order to measure the degree of steerability of a given system. In this work, we are interested in investigating possible ways to quantify quantum steering, where we based our analysis on different criteria presented in the literature.

TI Nonreciprocal Unconventional Photon Blockade with Kerr Magnons
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nonreciprocal devices, allowing to manipulate one-way signals, are crucial to quantum information processing and quantum networks. Here a nonlinear cavity-magnon system is proposed, consisting of a microwave cavity coupled to one or two yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) spheres supporting magnons with Kerr nonlinearity, to investigate nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade. The nonreciprocity originates from the direction-dependent Kerr effect, distinctly different from previous proposals with spinning cavities and dissipative couplings. For a single sphere case, nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be realized by manipulating the nonreciprocal destructive interference between two active paths, via varying the Kerr coefficient from positive to negative, or vice versa. By optimizing the system parameters, the perfect and well-tuned nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be predicted. For the case of two spheres with opposite Kerr effects, only reciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be observed when two cavity-magnon coupling strengths Kerr strengths are symmetric. However, when coupling strengths or Kerr strengths become asymmetric, nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade appears. This implies that two-sphere nonlinear cavity-magnon systems can be used to switch the transition between reciprocal and nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockades. This study offers a potential platform for investigating the nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in nonlinear cavity magnonics.
   This proposal introduces a nonlinear cavity-magnon system with yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) spheres, enabling nonreciprocal photon blockade. This system utilizes the direction-dependent Kerr effect for one-way signal manipulation, distinct from previous spinning cavity models. By manipulating Kerr coefficients, perfect nonreciprocal photon blockade is achievable. Additionally, asymmetry in coupling or Kerr strengths switches between reciprocal and nonreciprocal blockade, promising a versatile platform for nonlinear cavity magnonics research. image

TI Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI-trityl dyads and triads
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Covalently-linked chromophore-radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e. g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore-radical and radical-chromophore-radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin-spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.
   Chromophore-radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high-spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.image

TI Finite complexity of the de Sitter vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Einstein-Rosen = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (ER = EPR) conjecture states that quantum entanglement between boundary degrees of freedom leads to the emergence of bulk spacetime itself. Although this has been tested extensively in string theory for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, its implications for an accelerating universe, such as our own, remain less explored. Assuming a cosmic version of ER = EPR for de Sitter space, we explore computational complexity corresponding to long-range entanglement responsible for bulk states on spacelike hypersurfaces. Rather remarkably, we find that the complexity (per unit volume) of the Euclidean vacuum, as an entangled state over two boundary conformal field theory vacua, is finite both in the UV and the IR, which provides additional evidence for "cosmic ER = EPR." Our result seems to be a universal feature of spacetimes with horizons and, moreover, hints at new features of the thermofield double state for studying thermalization of any quantum system.

TI Entropy Fluctuation Formulas of Fermionic Gaussian States
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We study the statistical behavior of quantum entanglement in bipartite systems over fermionic Gaussian states as measured by von Neumann entropy. The formulas of average von Neumann entropy with and without particle number constraints have been recently obtained, whereas the main results of this work are the exact yet explicit formulas of variances for both cases. For the latter case of no particle number constraint, the results resolve a recent conjecture on the corresponding variance. Different than the existing methods in computing variances over other generic state models, proving the results of this work relies on a new simplification framework. The framework consists of a set of new tools in simplifying finite summations of what we refer to as dummy summation and re-summation techniques. As a by-product, the proposed framework leads to various new transformation formulas of hypergeometric functions.

TI Page entropy of a proton system in deep inelastic scattering at small x
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The partons model reveals the dynamical structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons). Studies related to thermodynamic quantities of nucleons present interesting and topical questions. In this work, for the first time we apply Page's theory of the studies of black holes to investigate the entropy of a proton system. Inspired by the quantum entanglement entropy in black hole information theories, we establish the proton entanglement with the similar way. Based our calculations, the proton entanglement entropy has the approximate form S 1/4 ln m - 1/2, where m represents the partons density of proton (mainly gluon and sea quark contributions) at small Bjorken x. Our calculations using Page's theory are well in agreement with the recent deep inelastic scattering measurements from the H1 Collaboration.

TI Strong single-photon to two-photon bundles emission in spin-1
   Jaynes-Cummings model
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB High-quality special nonclassical states beyond the strong single atom-cavity coupling regime are fundamental elements in quantum information science. Here, we study strong single-photon blockade to two-photon bundles emission in a single spin-1 atom coupled to an optical cavity by constructing a spin-1 Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). By tuning the quadratic Zeeman shift, the energy-spectrum anharmonicity can be significantly enhanced, leading to a remarkable increase in the dressed-state splitting of the well-resolved n-photon resonance. The mechanism, which benefits from the internal degrees of freedom in high-spin systems, compensates for the strong coupling condition required by the multi-photon blockade, thereby facilitating the experimental feasibility of engineering special nonclassical states beyond the strong-coupling limit. It is shown that the photon emission from the spin-1 JCM demonstrates high-quality single photon and two-photon bundles with large steady-state photon numbers in the cavity-driven and atom-pump cases, respectively. In particular, compared to the two-level two-photon JCM, the antibunching amplitude of the three-order correlation function for two-photon bundles in the spin-1 JCM is enhanced by 3 orders of magnitude. More interestingly, a multimode transducer, enabling a transition from strong single-photon blockade to two-photon bundles and super-Poissonian photon emission, is achieved and highly controllable by the light-cavity detuning in the presence of both atom and cavity driven fields. This study based on the high-spin JCM broadens the scope of engineering special nonclassical quantum states beyond the standard two-level JCM. Our proposal not only opens up a new avenue for generating high-quality n-photon sources but also provides versatile applications in quantum networks and metrology.

TI Time crystal embodies chimeralike state in periodically driven quantum
   spin system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-chimeralike state, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.

TI PARADe: A low-cost open-source device for photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) measurements
SO SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
AB In agriculture, proximal in-field information is crucial for a precise management of crop growth. A low-cost, miniaturized and innovative device, named PARADe (PAR Acquisition Device), is designed for in-field photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) acquisition. It combines an affordable PAR line quantum sensor (PAR/LE, SOLEMS) and an open source development platform (microcontroller) based on Arduino Integrated Development Environment. The quality of the measurement of the PARADe acquisition chain has been validated. The calibration is done by comparison (R 2 = 0.99) with a robust acquisition chain composed of a certified PAR sensor (PQS1, Kipp and Zonen) and a data-logger (CR1000 Campbell Scientific). The accuracy of PARADe measurements is evaluated through three indicators, relative error, RMSE and normalized RMSE. They demonstrate that the PARADe system has certain operating limitations especially for low solar angles (sunset and sunrise) due to the choice of a line quantum sensor. This does not affect the accuracy and reliability of the results, but indicates that the PARADe device is specifically adapted to collect daily cumulative PAR values.

TI Witnessing entanglement in quantum magnets using neutron scattering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We demonstrate how quantum entanglement can be directly witnessed in the quasi-1D Heisenberg antiferromagnet KCuF3. We apply three entanglement witnesses-one tangle, two tangle, and quantum Fisher information-to its inelastic neutron spectrum and compare with spectra simulated by finite-temperature density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and classical Monte Carlo methods. We find that each witness provides direct access to entanglement. Of these, quantum Fisher information is the most robust experimentally and indicates the presence of at least bipartite entanglement up to at least 50 K, corresponding to around 10% of the spinon zone-boundary energy. We apply quantum Fisher information to higher spin-S Heisenberg chains and show theoretically that the witnessable entanglement gets suppressed to lower temperatures as the quantum number increases. Finally, we outline how these results can be applied to higher dimensional quantum materials to witness and quantify entanglement.

TI Probing aqueous interfaces with spin defects
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Understanding the physical and chemical properties of aqueous interfaces is important in diverse fields of science, ranging from biology and chemistry to materials science. In spite of crucial progress in surface sensitive spectroscopic techniques over the past decades, the microscopic properties of aqueous interfaces remain difficult to measure. Here, we explore the use of noise spectroscopy to characterize interfacial properties, specifically of quantum sensors hosted in two-dimensional materials in contact with water. We combine molecular dynamics simulations of water interfaced with a model two-dimensional substrate and the calculation of the dynamical properties of a spin defect, representing a quantum sensor, and we investigate the impact of interfacial water and simple ions on the decoherence time of the defect. We show that the Hahn echo coherence time of the quantum sensor is sensitive to motional narrowing and to the hydrogen bonding arrangement and the dynamical properties of water and ions at the interface. We present results as a function of the liquid temperature, strength of the water-surface interaction, and varied monovalent and divalent ions, highlighting the broad applicability of near-surface quantum sensors to gain insight into the properties of aqueous interfaces.

TI Quantum conditional mutual information of W state in non-inertial frames
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI) is a versatile information theoretic measure. It is used to find the amount of correlations between two qubits from the perspective of a third qubit. In this work, we characterise the QCMI of tripartite W-states when some of the qubits are in accelerated motion. Here for our investigations we consider a massless fermionic field in the single-mode approximation. We consider all possible situations with respect to the acceleration of the qubits. From our results, we observe that QCMI can either increase or decrease depending on the role of the qubit being accelerated. Finally we discuss the connection between QCMI and correlations by studying the biseparable and separable states.

TI More on the upper bound of holographic n-partite information
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We show that there exists a huge amount of multipartite entanglement in holography by studying the upper bound for holographic n-partite information In that n - 1 fixed boundary subregions participate. We develop methods to find the n-th region E that makes In reach the upper bound. Through the explicit evaluation, it is shown that In, an IR term without UV divergence, could diverge when the number of intervals or strips in region E approaches infinity. At this upper bound configuration, we could argue that In fully comes from the n-partite global quantum entanglement. Our results indicate: fewer-partite entanglement in holography emerges from more-partite entanglement; n - 1 distant local subregions are highly n-partite entangling. Moreover, the relationship between the convexity of a boundary subregion and the multipartite entanglement it participates, and the difference between multipartite entanglement structure in different dimensions are revealed as well.

TI Some entanglement survives most measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB To prepare quantum states and extract information, it is often assumed that one can perform a perfectly projective measurement. Such measurements can achieve an uncorrelated system and environment state. However, perfectly projective measurements can be difficult or impossible to perform in practice. We investigate the limitations of repeated nonprojective measurements in preparing a quantum system. For an n-qubit system initially entangled with its environment and subsequently prepared with measurements, using a sequence of weak measurements, we show that some entanglement remains unless one of the measurement operators becomes perfectly projective through an extreme limiting process. Removing initial (unentangled) correlations between a system and its environment and the scenario where measurement outcomes are not tracked are also discussed. We present results for n-qubit and n -dimensional input states.

AB In variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), the most common objective is to find the minimum energy eigenstate of a given energy Hamiltonian. In this paper, we consider the general problem of finding a sufficient control Hamiltonian structure that, under a given feedback control law, ensures convergence to the minimum energy eigenstate of a given energy function. By including quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements in the loop, convergence to a pure state can be ensured from an arbitrary mixed initial state. Based on existing results on strict control Lyapunov functions, we formulate a semidefinite optimization problem, whose solution defines a non-unique control Hamiltonian, which is sufficient to ensure almost sure convergence to the minimum energy eigenstate under the given feedback law and the action of QND measurements. A numerical example is provided to showcase the proposed methodology. Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Monolithic silicon carbide metasurfaces for engineering arbitrary 3D
   perfect vector vortex beams
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Perfect vector vortex beams (PVVBs) can precisely control the light's polarization and phase along tailored intensity profiles, offering significant potential for advanced applications such as optical trapping and optical encryption. Extending PVVBs from 2D to 3D configurations would provide an additional spatial control dimension and enhance their information capacity. However, a compact and low-loss solution to generating 3D PVVBs remains unresolved. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of monolithic silicon carbide metasurfaces with polarization-dependent phase-only modulation to engineer arbitrary PVVBs in 3D space. We reconstruct the 3D intensity and polarization distributions of PVVBs along customized trajectories, showing their independence from polarization orders and spherical coordinates on the Poincar & eacute; sphere. Additionally, we demonstrate a monolithic metasurface that encodes parallel-channel 3D PVVBs for information encryption. The 3D PVVBs generated from minimalist metasurfaces hold great promise for multidimensional micromanipulation and laser micromachining, high-security information processing and high-dimensional quantum entanglement.

TI Universal Thermal Entanglement of Multichannel Kondo Effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement between an impurity and its environment is expected to be central in quantum impurity problems. We develop a method to compute the entanglement in spin-1=2 impurity problems, based on the entanglement negativity and the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). Using the method, we study the thermal decay of the entanglement in the multichannel Kondo effects. At zero temperature, the entanglement has the maximal value independent of the number of the screening channels. At low temperature, the entanglement exhibits a power-law thermal decay. The power-law exponent equals two times of the scaling dimension of the BCFT boundary operator describing the impurity spin, and it is attributed to the energy-dependent scaling behavior of the entanglement in energy eigenstates. These agree with numerical renormalization group results, unveiling quantum coherence inside the Kondo screening length.

TI Principal component analysis of diffuse magnetic neutron scattering: a
   theoretical study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We present a theoretical study of the potential of principal component (PC) analysis to analyse magnetic diffuse neutron scattering data on quantum materials. To address this question, we simulate the scattering function S (q) for a model describing a cluster magnet with anisotropic spin- spin interactions under different conditions of applied field and temperature. We find high dimensionality reduction and that the algorithm can be trained with surprisingly small numbers of simulated observations. Subsequently, observations can be projected onto the reduced-dimensionality space defined by the learnt PCs. Constant-field temperature scans correspond to trajectories in this space which show characteristic bifurcations at the critical fields corresponding to ground-state phase boundaries. Such plots allow the ground-state phase diagram to be accurately determined from finite-temperature measurements.

TI Tunable quantum emitters on large-scale foundry silicon photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlling large-scale many-body quantum systems at the level of single photons and single atomic systems is a central goal in quantum information science and technology. Intensive research and development has propelled foundry-based silicon-on-insulator photonic integrated circuits to a leading platform for large-scale optical control with individual mode programmability. However, integrating atomic quantum systems with single-emitter tunability remains an open challenge. Here, we overcome this barrier through the hybrid integration of multiple InAs/InP microchiplets containing high-brightness infrared semiconductor quantum dot single photon emitters into advanced silicon-on-insulator photonic integrated circuits fabricated in a 300 mm foundry process. With this platform, we achieve single-photon emission via resonance fluorescence and scalable emission wavelength tunability. The combined control of photonic and quantum systems opens the door to programmable quantum information processors manufactured in leading semiconductor foundries.
   Integrating tunable quantum emitters with commercial photonic circuits is promising for quantum information applications but remains a challenge. Here the authors report integration of InAs/InP microchiplets containing quantum dot single photon emitters into a large-scale foundry silicon platform.

TI Noise analysis of Grover and phase estimation algorithms implemented as
   quantum singular value transformations for a small number of noisy
   qubits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) algorithm is a general framework to implement most of the known algorithms and provides a way forward for designing new algorithms. In the present work, the impact of noise on the QSVT algorithm is examined for bit flip, phase flip, bit-phase flip, and depolarizing noise models for a small number of qubits. The small number of noisy qubits approximates the currently available noisy quantum computers. For simulation results, the QSVT implementation of the Grover search and quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithms is considered. These algorithms are among the basic quantum algorithms and form the building blocks of various applications of quantum algorithms. The results showed that the QSVT implementation of the Grover search and QPE algorithms has a consistently worse dependence upon noise than the original implementation for all four noise models. The probability of success of the Grover algorithm and phase measured by the QPE algorithm were found to exponentially depend upon the error probability in the noisy channels but only linearly dependent on the number of qubits.

TI Quantum Beats of a Macroscopic Polariton Condensate in Real Space
SO OPTICS
AB We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with nonresonant laser pulses, we control frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wave function dynamics is visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.

TI Quantum Enhancements for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Large Spaces
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum algorithms have been successfully applied to provide computational speed ups to various machine-learning tasks and methods. A notable exception to this has been deep reinforcement learning (RL). Deep RL combines the power of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning, and has provided some of the most impressive recent artificial-intelligence (AI) results including the famous AlphaGo system-yet, no possibilities for quantum advantages have been identified to date. In this work, we show how quantum computers can enhance the performance of deep RL, especially where the action spaces are large. Specifically, we introduce so-called deep energy-based models, inspired by statistical physics, which we show outperform standard deep RL machinery in learning performance. These models are computationally more demanding, but this can be ameliorated by quantum techniques. Specifically, we provide quantum algorithms, some of which can be run on near-term quantum computers, that can be used to speed up deep energy-based RL. This result opens up a new playing field for quantum enhancements in machine learning and AI.

TI Device-independent verification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
SO OPTICA
AB Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, and has been identified as an essential resource for diverse appli-cations in quantum information. If entanglement could be verified without any trust in the devices of observers, i.e., in a device-independent (DI) way, then high security could be guaranteed for various quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a DI protocol to certify the presence of entanglement based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. We first establish the DI verification framework by taking advantage of a measurement-device-independent technique and self-testing, which is able to verify all bipartite EPR-steerable states. In the scenario of three-measurement settings per party, the protocol is robust in tolerance of inefficient mea-surements and imperfect self-testing. Moreover, a four-photon experiment is implemented for verification beyond Bell nonlocal states. Our work enables further insight into quantum physics and could facilitate realistic implementation of secure quantum information processing tasks.

TI Topological state transitions of skyrmionic beams under focusing
   configurations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The recent emerging appearance of optical analogs of magnetic quasiparticles, i.e., optical skyrmions constructed via spin, field, and Stokes vectors, has garnered substantial interest from deep-subwavelength imaging and quantum entanglement. Here, we investigate systematically the topological state transitions of skyrmionic beams constructed by the Stokes vectors in the focusing configuration. We theoretically demonstrated that in the weak focusing, the skyrmion topological number is protected. Whereas, in the tight focusing, a unique topological transformation with skyrmion number variation is exhibited for the optical skyrmion, antiskyrmion, and 2nd-order skyrmion structures. The significant difference between the topological state transitions of these two cases originates from the transformation from the paraxial optical system to the nonparaxial optical system, and the approximate two-dimensional polarization structure to the three-dimensional polarization structure. The results provide new insights into the topological state transitions in topological structures, which promote applications in information processing, data storage, and free-space optical communications.

TI Detection of preexisting quantum entanglements between dipole-photon
   discrete observables
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We performed measurements of laser beam power polarized in different angles as 0., 45 degrees and 90 degrees passing close to a symmetric shielded capacitor with parallel plates and through a polaroid filter configured with angles as 0., 45 degrees and 90.degrees An unusual light power variation was detected during the charging and discharging of the high voltage capacitor even considering the suppression of known electromagnetic interaction between laser beam and capacitor. The light power variation curves also indicated a typical pattern of charge and discharge of capacitors. The combination of the angles of the laser beam polarization and polaroid filter surprisingly indicated the measurement of correlations between the polarizations of photons and electric dipoles of the capacitor dielectric. These novel results can only be explained supposing the preexisting condition of quantum entanglements between discrete observables of electric dipoles and photons.

TI Experimental quantum reading with photon counting
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The final goal of quantum hypothesis testing is to achieve quantum advantage over all possible classical strategies. In the protocol of quantum reading, this is achieved for information retrieval from an optical memory, whose generic cell stores a bit of information in two possible lossy channels. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that quantum advantage is obtained by practical photon-counting measurements combined with a simple maximum-likelihood decision. In particular, we show that this receiver combined with an entangled two-mode squeezed vacuum source is able to outperform any strategy based on statistical mixtures of coherent states for the same mean number of input photons. Our experimental findings demonstrate that quantum entanglement and simple optics are able to enhance the readout of digital data, paving the way to real applications of quantum reading and with potential applications for any other model that is based on the binary discrimination of bosonic loss.

TI Tripartite optomechanical entanglement via optical-dark-mode control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose how to generate a tripartite light-vibration entanglement by controlling an optical dark mode (ODM), which is induced by the coupling of two optical modes to a common vibrational mode. This ODM is decoupled from the vibration, and it can be controlled on demand by employing a synthetic gauge field, which can enable efficient switching between the ODM-unbreaking and ODM-breaking regimes. We find that the tripartite optomechanical entanglement is largely suppressed in the ODM-unbreaking regime, but it is significantly enhanced in the ODM-breaking regime. In particular, the noise robustness of quantum entanglement in the ODM-breaking regime can be more than twice than that in the ODM-unbreaking regime. This study offers a method for protecting and enhancing fragile quantum resources and for constructing noise-tolerant and dark-mode-immune quantum processors and entangled networks.

TI Artificial Coherent States of Light by Multiphoton Interference in a
   Single-Photon Stream
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent optical states consist of a quantum superposition of different photon number (Fock) states, but because they do not form an orthogonal basis, no photon number states can be obtained from it by linear optics. Here we demonstrate the reverse, by manipulating a random continuous single-photon stream using quantum interference in an optical Sagnac loop, we create engineered quantum states of light with tunable photon statistics, including approximate weak coherent states. We demonstrate this experimentally using a true single-photon stream produced by a semiconductor quantum dot in an optical microcavity, and show that we can obtain light with g((2)) (0) -> 1 in agreement with our theory, which can only be explained by quantum interference of at least 3 photons. The produced artificial light states are, however, much more complex than coherent states, containing quantum entanglement of photons, making them a resource for multiphoton entanglement.

TI Scalable Hamiltonian learning for large-scale out-of-equilibrium quantum
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Large-scale quantum devices provide insights beyond the reach of classical simulations. However, for a reliable and verifiable quantum simulation, the building blocks of the quantum device require exquisite bench marking. This benchmarking of large-scale dynamical quantum systems represents a major challenge due to lack of efficient tools for their simulation. Here, we present a scalable algorithm based on neural networks for Hamiltonian tomography in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. We illustrate our approach using a model for a forefront quantum simulation platform: ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Specifically, we show that our algorithm is able to reconstruct the Hamiltonian of an arbitrary sized bosonic ladder system using an accessible amount of experimental measurements. We are able to significantly increase the previously known parameter precision.

TI Probing prethermal nonergodicity through measurement outcomes of
   monitored quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Projective measurements are a key element in quantum physics and enable rich phenomena in monitored quantum dynamics. Here, we show that the measurement outcomes, recorded during monitored dynamics, can provide important information about the properties of the monitored dynamical system with prethermal nonergodicity. We demonstrate this for a Floquet model of many-body localization, where we find that the prethermal many-body localized regime becomes unstable against rare measurements, yielding an unusual enhancement of quantum entanglement. Through an unsupervised learning and mutual information analysis on the classical dataset of measurement outcomes, we find that the information loss in the system, reflected by the increased entanglement, is compensated by an emergent structure in this classical dataset. Our findings highlight the crucial role of measurements and corresponding classical outcomes in capturing prethermal nonergodicity, offering a promising perspective for applications to other monitored quantum dynamics.

TI Macroscopic entanglement of three magnon modes in three cavities via
   optical parametric amplifier
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to generate bipartite and tripartite entanglements of three magnon modes in a three-cavity system using a nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The three magnon modes in three YIG spheres are respectively placed inside three cavities near the maximum magnetic fields of the cavities and coupled to cavity modes via linear magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, linear coupling interaction exists between two cavities. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that OPA can prepare these three magnon modes in a steady-state entangled state, bipartite and tripartite entanglements generally increase with the nonlinear interaction strength of OPA. An alternative approach to enhance quantum entanglement involves multiplexed OPA inputs. By employing individual OPA for each cavity, we observe a significant improvement in entanglement generation. All the entanglements are robust against bath temperature. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Tailoring orbital angular momentum entanglement through inversed design
   based on gradient descent
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement is an important resource for fundamental research and quantum technological application. Recently, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light has received much attention to realize high-dimensional quantum systems, and generating and manipulating the OAM entanglement has become an important topic. Here, we propose an inverse design technique to manipulate the OAM entanglement of the photon pair generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The proposed technique directly tailors the OAM states of entangled photon pairs by shaping the incident pump beam. In particular, we construct a physics-informed model by leveraging the backpropagation algorithm and adhering to the overlap integral relation. Our model automatically optimizes diffractive masks, allowing the structured pump to quantitatively modulate the OAM distribution. The generation of maximally entangled states in different dimensions is demonstrated numerically and experimentally.

TI Wavelength multicasting quantum clock synchronization network
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Quantum clock synchronization (QCS) can measure out the high-precision clock difference among distant users, which breaks through the standard quantum limit by employing the properties of quantum entanglement. Currently, the wavelength division multiplexed QCS network has been demonstrated with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion entangled photon source. In this paper, we propose a more efficient QCS network scheme with the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source, which can decrease at least 25% of wavelength channel consumption under the identical network scale. Afterwards, a four node QCS network is demonstrated, where the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source is utilized with dual-pumped four-wave mixing silicon chip. The experimental results show that the measured time deviation is 3.4 ps with an average time of 640 s via the multiple fiber links of more than 10 km.

TI Bell inequality is violated in B0 → J=ψK*(892)0 decays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The violation of the Bell inequality is one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics and can be used to rule out local deterministic alternative descriptions. We utilize the data analysis published by the LHCb Collaboration on the helicity amplitudes for the decay B degrees -> J=IFK*(892)degrees to compute the entanglement among the polarizations of the final vector mesons and the violation of the Bell inequality that it entails. We find that quantum entanglement can be detected with a significance well above 5u (nominally 84u) and Bell inequality is violated with a significance well above 5u (nominally 36u)-thereby firmly establishing these distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics at high energies in a collider setting and in the presence of strong and weak interactions. Entanglement is also present and the Bell inequality is violated in other decays of the B mesons into vector mesons, but with lesser significance.

TI Simplifying the Quantum World: Demonstrations for Young Learners in an
   Informal Setting
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION
AB A set of modules for the informal learning of quantum science was developed. They include (1) Waves and Bottling Light in Quantum Dots, (2) Quantization of Energy Levels, (3) Particle-Wave Duality, (4) Magnetism and Electron Spin, and (5) Quantum Entanglement. Their teaching objective is to clarify concepts in quantum science, and they have been presented together as part of an hour-long show to similar to 250 adults and school-age children. The learning outcomes of the modules were assessed by pre- and postevent quizzes as well as interactive clicker questions. The results suggest effective learning of all of the assessed concepts. These modules are detailed in a way that makes them deployable, together or in part, in other formal or informal settings to support the dissemination of information about quantum science to the general public.

TI Quantum tomography with τ leptons at the FCC-ee: Entanglement, Bell
   inequality violation, sin θW, and anomalous couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Future Circular Collider (FCC)-in its first incarnation as a lepton collider-will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of r leptons after working for four years at the energy of the Z- boson resonance. The r lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle 8Wand W and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.

TI Chiral metals and entrapped insulators in a one-dimensional topological
   non-Hermitian system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this work, we study many-body "steady states" that arise in the non-Hermitian generalization of the noninteracting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model at a finite density of fermions. We find that the hitherto known phase diagrams for this system, derived from the single-particle gap closings, in fact correspond to distinct nonequilibrium phases, which either carry finite currents or are dynamical insulators where particles are entrapped. Each of these have distinct quasiparticle excitations and steady-state correlations and entanglement properties. Looking at finite-sized systems, we further modulate the boundary to uncover the topological features in such steady states, particularly the emergence of leaky boundary modes. Using a variety of analytical and numerical methods, we develop a theoretical understanding of the various phases and their transitions, and we uncover the rich interplay of nonequilibrium many-body physics, quantum entanglement, and topology in a simple looking yet rich model system.

TI A novel lightweight hybrid cryptographic framework for secure smart card
   operations
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON INFORMATION SECURITY
AB In this digital age, with exponential usage of smart cards for financial transactions are secured with latest and advanced crypto standards which are prone to advanced cyber threats and quantum attacks. Currently, there are many crypto standards techniques that tend to experience challenges regarding computational overhead, energy requirements, and vulnerable towards modern cyber-attacks. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a crucial necessity to secure financial transactions from the future quantum attacks also. The primary objective is to offer strong security, better performance, and energy efficiency while integrating PQC into prevailing financial transactions. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid crypto standard to enhance the security and privacy of the transactions using smart cards, to achieve this we integrate Elliptic Curve Cryptography Curve25519 to generate secure keys, SPECK block cipher for lightweight encipherment with a powerful hash function for message authentication and integrity checks called PHOTON. Our hybrid model is better than the existing crypto models which need more computational overhead in terms of key length, encryption time, decryption time, energy efficiency that are not fit for lightweight smart card transactions. The proposed hybrid crypto standard shows the considerable performance in terms of various key factors as compared to the several existing hybrid crypto standards. Our standard accomplishes the quick key generation time of 8 ms and minimal energy consumption of 0.34 mJ while preserving the encryption speed of 150 Mbps and decryption speed of 160 Mbps with least memory utilization of 164 KB, our standard key generation time is 88% lesser, encryption time is 25% lesser, decryption time is 27% lesser, energy consumption is 43% lesser, memory utilization is 69% lesser as compared to RSA-2048 + AES-128 hybrid model. Likewise, our model performance is superior to ECDH (P-256) + AES-128 hybrid standard in terms key generation time is 47% lesser, encryption time is 23% lesser, decryption time is 25% lesser, energy consumption is 5% lesser. Based on the experimental outcomes, the proposed hybrid crypto standard is well-suited for lightweight and resource constrained environments such as smart card and IoT applications, posing better performance, low energy utilization, and robust post-quantum security.

TI Tripartite Svetlichny test with measurement dependence
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The Bell test, as an important method for detecting nonlocality, is widely used in device-independent quantum information processing tasks. The security of these tasks is based on an assumption called measurement independence. Since this assumption is difficult to be guaranteed in practical Bell tests, it is meaningful to consider the effect of reduced measurement independence (i.e., measurement dependence) on Bell tests. Some research studies have shown that nonlocality can be detected even if measurement dependence exists. However, the relevant results are all based on bipartite Bell tests, and the results for multipartite Bell tests are still missing. In this paper, we explore this problem in the tripartite Svetlichny test. By considering flexible lower and upper bounds on the degree of measurement dependence, we obtain the relation among measurement dependence, guessing probability, and the maximal value of Svetlichny inequality. Our results reveal the case in which genuine nonlocality is nonexistent; at this point, the outcomes of the Bell test cannot be applied in device-independent quantum information processing tasks.

AB In this article, we present a novel approach for implementing pulse-efficient SU(4) gates on cross resonance (CR)-based superconducting quantum devices. Our method introduces a parameterized unitary derived from the CR-Hamiltonian propagator, which accounts for ZZ-interactions. Leveraging the Weyl chamber's geometric structure, we successfully realize a continuous two-qubit basis gate, R-ZZ(theta), as an echo-free pulse schedule on the IBM Quantum device ibm_kawasaki. We evaluate the average fidelity and gate time of various SU(4) gates generated using R-ZZ(theta) to confirm the advantages of our implementation.

   Decoupling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A leading approach to implementing small-scale quantum computers has been to use laser beams, focused to micron spot sizes, to address and entangle trapped ions in a linear crystal. Here we propose a method to implement individually addressed entangling gate interactions, but driven by microwave fields, with a spatial resolution of a few microns, corresponding to 10-5 - 5 microwave wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate the ability to suppress the effect of the state-dependent force using a single ion, and find the required interaction introduces 3.7(4) x 10-4 - 4 error per emulated gate in a single-qubit benchmarking sequence. We model the scheme for a 17-qubit ion crystal, and find that any pair of ions should be addressable with an average crosstalk error of approximately 10-5. - 5 .

TI Cryptanalysis of Group Ring NTRU: The Case of the Dihedral Group
SO SECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB The NTRU cryptosystem is one of the earliest proposed schemes for post-quantum cryptography. With a long history of cryptanalysis and efficient memory and time requirements, NTRU has been standardized by IEEE for public key cryptographic techniques based on hard problems over lattices, and a few NTRU-style cryptosystems progressed to the third round of the NIST standardization process. The design flexibility of NTRU has resulted in many variants. Group ring NTRU (GR-NTRU) offers a general framework for designing various NTRU-like schemes using different groups. Although most schemes in the literature are built over cyclic groups, non-abelian groups can also be used. Non-commutativity has been endorsed as a direction to build NTRU variants that are more resistant to some algebraic attacks. Lattice attacks on the public key of NTRU-like cryptosystems try to retrieve the private key by solving the shortest vector problem (SVP) or its approximation in a lattice of a particular dimension, assuming the knowledge of the public key only. In this work, we analyze the lattice security of GR-NTRU built over the group ring of the dihedral group of order 2N$$ 2N $$. We theoretically and experimentally show that dihedral groups do not guarantee better security against this class of attacks than the standard NTRU over the group ring of the cyclic group of order N$$ N $$. We prove that retrieving the private key is possible by solving the SVP in two lattices with half the dimension of the original lattice generated for GR-NTRU based on dihedral groups, that is, the dimension of the lattices to be attacked can be reduced from 4N$$ 4N $$ to 2N$$ 2N $$ and consequently the problem of finding short vectors becomes much easier. We utilize matrix algebra to provide an explicit dimension reduction of the associated lattices without any structure theorem from the representation theory for finite groups, which makes our technique easier to follow and implement. Additionally, experimental results indicate that the naive method of lattice attacks can successfully retrieve a decryption key for only N <= 67$$ N\le 67 $$, while our technique can retrieve a decryption key up to N <= 131$$ N\le 131 $$, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TI Graviton Physics: A Concise Tutorial on the Quantum Field Theory of
   Gravitons, Graviton Noise, and Gravitational Decoherence
SO UNIVERSE
AB The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 ushered in a new era of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy capable of probing the strong field dynamics of black holes and neutron stars. It has opened up an exciting new window for laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity (GR). In recent years, two interesting proposals have aimed to reveal the quantum nature of perturbative gravity: (1) theoretical predictions on how graviton noise from the early universe, after the vacuum of the gravitational field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; (2) experimental proposals using the quantum entanglement between two masses, each in a superposition (gravitational cat, or gravcat) state. The first proposal focuses on the stochastic properties of quantum fields (QFs), and the second invokes a key concept of quantum information (QI). An equally basic and interesting idea is to ask whether (and how) gravity might be responsible for a quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity is universal, meaning, gravitational interaction is present for all massive objects. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena (MQP), underlining many proposals in alternative quantum theories (AQTs). To fully appreciate or conduct research in these exciting developments requires a working knowledge of classical GR, QF theory, and QI, plus some familiarity with stochastic processes (SPs), namely, noise in quantum fields and decohering environments. Traditionally a new researcher may be conversant in one or two of these four subjects: GR, QFT, QI, and SP, depending on his/her background. This tutorial attempts to provide the necessary connective tissues between them, helping an engaged reader from any one of these four subjects to leapfrog to the frontier of these interdisciplinary research topics. In the present version, we shall address the three topics listed in the title, excluding gravitational entanglement, because, despite the high attention some recent experimental proposals have received, its nature and implications in relation to quantum gravity still contain many controversial elements.

TI Phase reconstruction via metasurface-integrated quantum analog operation
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC ADVANCES
AB Phase reconstruction plays a pivotal role in biology, medical imaging, and wavefront sensing. However, multiple measurements and adjustments are usually required for conventional schemes, which inevitably reduces the quality of phase imaging. Here, based on multi-channel metasurface and quantum entanglement source, a simple and integrated quantum analog operation system is proposed to realize quantitative phase reconstruction with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under a low signal photon level. Without additional measurements and adjustments, four differential images necessary for the phase reconstruction are captured simultaneously. The non-local correlation of entangled photon pairs enables to remotely manipulate working modes of the system. Besides, the consistency of entangled photon pairs in time domain makes it possible to achieve a high SNR imaging by trigger detection. The results may potentially empower the application of metasurfaces in optical chip, wave function reconstruction, and label-free biology imaging.

TI Operator Transpose within Normal Ordering and its Applications for
   Quantifying Entanglement
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Partial transpose is an important operation for quantifying entanglement. In this study, the (partial) transpose of any single (two-mode) operator is investigated. Using the Fock basis expansion, it is found that the transposed operator of an arbitrary operator can be obtained by replacing a(dagger)(a) with a(a(dagger)), rather than the c-number within the normal ordering form. The transpose of the displacement and Wigner operators is also investigated, from which the relation of the Wigner function, characteristics function, and average values such as covariance matrix is constructed between the density operator and transposed density operator. These observations can be further extended to multi-mode cases. As for the application, partial transpose of the two-mode squeezed operator and the entanglement of the two-mode squeezed vacuum through a laser channel is considered.

TI Engineering Dynamically Decoupled Quantum Simulations with Trapped Ions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB An external drive can improve the coherence of a quantum many-body system by averaging out noise sources. It can also be used to realize models that are inaccessible in the static limit, through Floquet Hamiltonian engineering. The full possibilities for combining these tools remain unexplored. We develop the requirements needed for a pulse sequence to decouple a quantum many-body system from an external field without altering the intended dynamics. Demonstrating this technique experimentally in an iontrap platform, we show that it can provide a large improvement to coherence in real-world applications. Finally, we engineer an approximate quantum simulation of the Haldane-Shastry model, an exactly solvable paradigm for long-range interacting spins. Our results expand and unify the quantum simulation toolbox.

TI Generation of entanglement using a short-wavelength seeded free-electron
   laser
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum entanglement between the degrees of freedom encountered in the classical world is challenging to observe due to the surrounding environment. To elucidate this issue, we investigate the entanglement generated over ultrafast timescales in a bipartite quantum system comprising two massive particles: a free-moving photoelectron, which expands to a mesoscopic length scale, and a light-dressed atomic ion, which represents a hybrid state of light and matter. Although the photoelectron spectra are measured classically, the entanglement allows us to reveal information about the dressed-state dynamics of the ion and the femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded free-electron laser. The observed generation of entanglement is interpreted using the time-dependent von Neumann entropy. Our results unveil the potential for using short-wavelength coherent light pulses from free-electron lasers to generate entangled photoelectron and ion systems for studying spooky action at a distance.

TI Creation of quantum coherence with general measurement processes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum measurement not only can destroy coherence but also can create it. Here, we estimate the maximum amount of coherence, one can create under a complete non-selective measurement process. For our analysis, we consider projective as well as POVM measurements. Based on our observations, we characterize the measurement processes into two categories, namely, the measurements with the ability to induce coherence and the ones without this ability. Our findings also suggest that the more POVM elements present in a measurement that acts on the quantum system, the less will be its coherence creating ability. We also introduce the notion of raw coherence in the POVMs that helps to create quantum coherence. Finally, we find a trade-off relation between the coherence creation, entanglement generation between system and apparatus, and the mixedness of the system in a general measurement setup.

TI Quantization of blackjack: Quantum basic strategy and advantage
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers that process information by harnessing the remarkable power of quantum mechanics are increasingly being put to practical use. In the future, their impact will be felt in numerous fields, including in online casino games. This is one of the reasons why quantum gambling theory has garnered considerable attention. Studies have shown that quantum gambling theory often yields nontrivial consequences that classical theory cannot interpret. We have formulated blackjack, one of the most famous card games, as a quantum game and found possible quantum entanglement between strategies. We also devised a quantum circuit reproducing classical blackjack. This circuit can be realized in the near future when quantum computers are commonplace. Furthermore, we showed that the player's expectation increases compared to the classical game using quantum basic strategy, which is a quantum version of the popular basic strategy of blackjack.

TI Detecting Many-Body Bell Nonlocality by Solving Ising Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Bell nonlocality represents the ultimate consequence of quantum entanglement, fundamentally undermining the classical tenet that spatially separated degrees of freedom possess objective attributes independently of the act of their measurement. Despite its importance, probing Bell nonlocality in many-body systems is considered to be a formidable challenge, with a computational cost scaling exponentially with system size. Here we propose and validate an efficient variational scheme, based on the solution of inverse classical lsing problems, which in polynomial time can probe whether an arbitrary set of quantum data is compatible with a local theory; and, if not, it delivers the many-body Bell inequality most strongly violated by the quantum data. We use our approach to unveil new many-body Bell inequalities, violated by suitable measurements on paradigmatic quantum states (the low-energy states of Heisenberg antiferromagnets), paving the way to systematic Bell tests in the many-body realm.

TI Probing quantum phenomena through photoproduction in relativistic
   heavy-ion collisions
SO PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS
AB Photoproduction in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions displays many unique features, often involving quantum mechanical coherence and two-source interference between photon emission from the two ions. We review the recent experimental results from RHIC and the LHC and theoretical studies of coherent vector meson photoproduction, emphasizing the quantum mechanical aspects of the interactions and the entanglement between the final state particles. These studies enrich our understanding of non-local realism, underscore the critical role of the polarization of the photon source, quantum interference and nuclear effect on the gluon distribution. It paves a way for quantitatively probing the quantum nature of these high-energy nuclear collisions.

TI Spin entanglement in neutron-proton scattering
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In this Letter, I work out spin entanglement properties of neutron-proton scattering using the exact S-matrix, considering both S-wave and higher partial wave contributions. The dependence of spin entanglement on relative momentum, scattering angle, and initial spin configuration is investigated for realistic nuclear forces, while low-energy properties of spin entanglement are analyzed within the framework of pionless effective field theory at leading order. New connections are found between spin entanglement and symmetry emergence of strong interactions. These results lead to a more complete understanding of how spin entanglement is generated via neutron-proton interaction. They also lay the theoretical foundation for controllable production of entangled nucleon-nucleon pairs in future experiments. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Perturbative model of noisy quantum signal processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent progress in quantum signal processing (QSP) and its generalization, quantum singular value transformation, has led to a grand unification of quantum algorithms. However, inherent experimental noise in quantum devices severely limits the length of realizable QSP sequences. We consider a model of QSP with generic perturbative noise in the signal processing basis and present a diagrammatic notation useful for analyzing such errors. To demonstrate our technique, we study a specific coherent error, that of under- or overrotation of the signal processing operator parametrized by e << 1. For this coherent error model, it is shown that while Pauli Z errors are not recoverable without additional resources, Pauli X and Y errors can be arbitrarily suppressed by coherently appending a noisy recovery QSP without the use of additional resources or ancillas. Furthermore, through a careful accounting of errors using our diagrammatic tools, we provide an upper and lower bound on the length of this recovery QSP operator. We anticipate that the perturbative technique and the diagrammatic notation proposed here will facilitate future study of generic noise in QSP and quantum algorithms.

TI Special features of the Weyl-Heisenberg Bell basis imply unusual
   entanglement structure of Bell-diagonal states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Bell states are of crucial importance for entanglement based methods in quantum information science. Typically, a standard construction of a complete orthonormal Bell-basis by Weyl-Heisenberg operators is considered. We show that the group structure of these operators has strong implication on error correction schemes and on the entanglement structure within Bell-diagonal states. In particular, it implies an equivalence between a Pauli channel and a twirl channel. Interestingly, other complete orthonormal Bell-bases do break the equivalence and lead to a completely different entanglement structure, for instance in the share of positive partial transposition (PPT)-entangled states. In detail, we find that the standard Bell basis has the highest observed share on PPT-states and PPT-entangled states compared to other Bell bases. In summary, our findings show that the standard Bell basis construction exploits a very special structure with strong implications to quantum information theoretic protocols if a deviation is considered.

TI Numerical evidence against advantage with quantum fidelity kernels on
   classical data
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum machine learning techniques are commonly considered one of the most promising candidates for demonstrating practical quantum advantage. In particular, quantum kernel methods have been demonstrated to be able to learn certain classically intractable functions efficiently if the kernel is well aligned with the target function. In the more general case, quantum kernels are known to suffer from exponential "flattening" of the spectrum as the number of qubits grows, preventing generalization and necessitating the control of the inductive bias by hyperparameters. We show that the general-purpose hyperparameter-tuning techniques proposed to improve the generalization of quantum kernels lead to the kernel becoming well approximated by a classical kernel, removing the possibility of quantum advantage. We provide extensive numerical evidence for this phenomenon utilizing multiple previously studied quantum feature maps and both synthetic and real data. Our results show that unless novel techniques are developed to control the inductive bias of quantum kernels, they are unlikely to provide a quantum advantage on classical data that lacks special structure.

TI Coherence revival under the Unruh effect and its metrological advantage
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the quantum coherence extraction between two accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors, coupling to a scalar field in (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We find that quantum coherence as a nonclassical correlation can be generated through the Markovian evolution of the detector system, just like quantum entanglement. However, with growing Unruh temperature, in contrast to monotonously degrading entanglement, we find that quantum coherence exhibits a striking revival phenomenon. For certain detectors' initial state choices, the coherence measure will reduce to zero at first and then grow to an asymptotic value. We verify such coherence revival by inspecting its metrological advantage on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) enhancement. Since the maximal QFI bounds the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation, we conclude that the extracted coherence can be utilized as a physical resource in quantum metrology.

TI Entanglement-enhanced optical atomic clocks

AB Recent developments in atomic physics have enabled the experimental generation of many-body entangled states to boost the performance of quantum sensors beyond the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). This limit is imposed by the inherent projection noise of a quantum measurement. In this Perspective article, we describe the commonly used experimental methods to create many-body entangled states to operate quantum sensors beyond the SQL. In particular, we focus on the potential of applying quantum entanglement to state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. In addition, we present recently developed time-reversal protocols that make use of complex states with high quantum Fisher information without requiring sub-SQL measurement resolution. We discuss the prospects for reaching near-Heisenberg limited quantum metrology based on such protocols. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI Parameter estimation of gravitational waves with a quantum metropolis

SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB After the first detection of a gravitational wave in 2015, the number of successes achieved by this innovative way of looking through the Universe has not stopped growing. However, the current techniques for analyzing this type of events present a serious bottleneck due to the high computational power they require. In this article we explore how recent techniques based on quantum algorithms could surpass this obstacle. For this purpose, we propose a quantization of the classical algorithms used in the literature for the inference of gravitational wave parameters based on the well-known quantum walks technique applied to a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally, we develop a quantum environment on classical hardware, implementing a metric to compare quantum versus classical algorithms in a fair way. We further test all these developments in the real inference of several sets of parameters of all the events of the first detection period GWTC-1 and we find a polynomial advantage in the quantum algorithms, thus setting a first starting point for future algorithms.

AB Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, o!ering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique "tness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose signi"cant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our "ndings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, o!ering exciting opportunities for future explorations.

AB Loophole-free violations of Bell inequalities imply that at least one of the assumptions behind local hidden-variable theories must fail. Here, we show that, if only one fails, then it has to fail completely, therefore excluding models that partially constrain freedom of choice or allow for partial retrocausal influences, or allow partial instantaneous actions at a distance. Specifically, we show that (i) any hidden-variable theory with outcome independence (OI) and arbitrary joint relaxation of measurement independence (MI) and parameter independence (PI) can be experimentally excluded in a Bell-like experiment with many settings on high-dimensional entangled states, and (ii) any hidden-variable theory with MI, PI and arbitrary relaxation of OI can be excluded in a Bell-like experiment with many settings on qubit-qubit entangled states.

Our approach defines an auxiliary Hermitian coupling matrix describing the network that yields the normal modes of the system and its time evolution in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Our results provide insight on the full quantum state reconstruction time in a general su(2) network of any size and the full quantum transfer time in the J(x) network of size 4n + 1 with n = 1, 2,3,... For any other network sizes, the Fock state probability distribution of the initial state is conserved but the amplitudes suffer a phase shift proportional to pi/2 that results in partial quantum state transfer.

TI Voltage staircase in a current-biased quantum-dot Josephson junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We calculate the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of a Josephson junction containing a resonant level in the weakly coupled regime (resonance width small compared to the superconducting gap). The phase phi across the junction becomes time dependent in response to a DC current bias. Rabi oscillations in the Andreev levels produce a staircase I-V characteristic. The number of voltage steps counts the number of Rabi oscillations per 2 pi increment of phi, providing a way to probe the coherence of the qubit in the absence of any external AC driving. The phenomenology is the same as the Majorana-induced DC Shapiro steps in topological Josephson junctions of Choi et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 140501(R) (2020)]-but now for a nontopological Andreev qubit.

TI Wafer-scale heterogeneous integration of thin film lithium niobate on
   silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits with low loss bonding
   interfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is a versatile waveguide material platform for CMOS foundrybased photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with low loss and high-power handling. The range of applications enabled by this platform is significantly expanded with the addition of a material with large electro-optic and nonlinear coefficients such as lithium niobate. This work examines the heterogeneous integration of thin-film lithium-niobate (TFLN) on silicon-nitride PICs. Bonding approaches are evaluated based on the interface used (SiO2, Al2O3 and direct) to form hybrid waveguide structures. We demonstrate low losses in chip-scale bonded ring resonators of 0.4 dB/cm (intrinsic Q= 8.19 x 105). In addition, we are able to scale the process to demonstrate bonding of full 100-mm TFLN wafers to 200-mm Si3N4 PIC wafers with high layer transfer yield. This will enable future integration with foundry processing and process design kits (PDKs) for applications such as integrated microwave photonics and quantum photonics.

TI Parametrically enhanced interactions and nonreciprocal bath dynamics in
   a photon-pressure Kerr amplifier
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Photon-pressure coupling between two superconducting circuits is a promising platform for investigating radiation-pressure coupling in distinct parameter regimes and for the development of radio-frequency (RF) quantum photonics and quantum-limited RF sensing. Here, we implement photon-pressure coupling between two superconducting circuits, one of which can be operated as a parametric amplifier. We demonstrate a Kerr-based enhancement of the photon-pressure single-photon coupling rate and an increase of the cooperativity by one order of magnitude in the amplifier regime. In addition, we observe that the intracavity amplification reduces the measurement imprecision of RF signal detection. Last, we demonstrate that RF mode sideband cooling is unexpectedly not limited to the effective amplifier mode temperature arising from quantum noise amplification, which we interpret in the context of nonreciprocal heat transfer between the two circuits. Our results demonstrate how Kerr amplification can be used as resource for enhanced photon-pressure systems and Kerr cavity optomechanics.

TI Absorption and birefringence study for reduced optical losses in diamond
   with high nitrogen-vacancy concentration
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The use of diamond colour centres such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre is increasingly enabling quantum sensing and computing applications. Novel concepts like cavity coupling and readout, laser-threshold magnetometry and multi-pass geometries allow significantly improved sensitivity and performance via increased signals and strong light fields. Enabling material properties for these techniques and their further improvements are low optical material losses via optical absorption of signal light and low birefringence. Here, we study systematically the behaviour of absorption around 700 nm and birefringence with increasing nitrogen- and NV-doping, as well as their behaviour during NV creation via diamond growth, electron beam irradiation and annealing treatments. Absorption correlates with increased nitrogen doping yet substitutional nitrogen does not seem to be the direct absorber. Birefringence reduces with increasing nitrogen doping. We identify multiple crystal defect concentrations via absorption spectroscopy and their changes during the material processing steps and thus identify potential causes of absorption and birefringence as well as strategies to fabricate chemical vapour deposition diamonds with high NV density yet low absorption and low birefringence.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Diamond for quantum applications'.

TI QMedShield: a novel quantum chaos-based image encryption scheme for
   secure medical image storage in the cloud
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS
AB In the age of digital technology, medical images play an important role in the healthcare industry, which aids surgeons in making precise decisions and reducing the diagnosis time. However, the storage of large amounts of these images in third-party cloud services raises privacy and security concerns. There are a lot of classical security mechanisms to protect them. Although, the advent of quantum computing entails the development of quantum-based encryption models for healthcare. There is a significant demand for resource-efficient, quantum-secure image encryption mechanisms that leverage existing classical infrastructure. Hence, in this paper, a novel quantum chaos-based encryption scheme for medical images has been introduced. The model utilizes bit-plane scrambling, a 3D quantum logistic map, quantum operations in the diffusion phase, a hybrid chaotic map, and DNA encoding in the confusion phase to transform the plain medical image into a cipher medical image. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using multiple statistical analyses and validated against more attacks such as differential attacks, known and chosen plaintext attacks with three different medical datasets, and theoretically, as well. Hence, the introduced encryption model has proved to be more attack-resistant and robust than other existing image encryption schemes, ensuring the secure storage of medical images in cloud environments.

TI Quantum Clone Elite Genetic Algorithm-Based Evaluation Mechanism for
   Maximizing Network Efficiency in Soil Moisture Wireless Sensor Networks
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB In agriculture, soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) are used to monitor the growth of crops for obtaining higher yields. The purpose of this paper is to improve the network efficiency of SMWSNs. Therefore, we propose a novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism which is suitable for soil moisture sensors and design a sensor target allocation model (STAM) for the actual agricultural situation. After that, a quantum clone elite genetic algorithm (QCEGA) is proposed; then, QCEGA is applied to optimize the STAM for obtaining optimal results. QCEGA uses the parallel mechanism of quantum computing to encode individuals, integrates the quantum revolving gate in quantum computing and the concept of cloning in biology to avoid the algorithm from falling into local optimum, and applies the elite strategy to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared with simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Under the novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism, the simulation results demonstrate that the network efficiency based on QCEGA is higher than that of SA and PSO; what is more, QCEGA has better convergence performance. In comparison with traditional wireless sensor network efficiency evaluation approaches, our methods are more in line with the development of modern agriculture and can effectively improve the efficiency of SMWSNs, thus ensuring that crops can have a better growth condition.

TI A New Semi-Quantum Two-Way Authentication Protocol between Control
   Centers and Neighborhood Gateways in Smart Grids
SO ENTROPY
AB To address the potential threat to the power grid industry posed by quantum computers and ensure the security of bidirectional communication in smart grids, it is imperative to develop quantum-safe authentication protocols. This paper proposes a semi-quantum bidirectional authentication protocol between a control center (CC) and a neighboring gateway (NG). This method uses single photons to facilitate communication between the CC and the NG. Security analysis demonstrates that the protocol can effectively resist common attack methods, including double CNOT attacks, impersonation attacks, interception-measurement-retransmission attacks, and entanglement-measurement attacks. Comparisons with other protocols reveal that this protocol has significant advantages, making it more appealing and practical for real-world applications. Finally, by simulating the protocol on the IBM quantum simulator, this protocol not only validates the theoretical framework but also confirms the practical feasibility of the protocol.

TI Non-Markovian enhancement of nonequilibrium quantum thermometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Accurate measurement at low temperatures is essential for both gaining a fundamental understanding of physical processes and developing technological applications. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for quantum temperature sensing in a composite environment with non-Markovian dynamics. Our suggested system uses a single qubit as a temperature sensor to test its sensitivity in calculating the temperature of a composite environment. We show that the temperature sensor's sensitivity can saturate the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound by measuring the sigma z observable of the probe qubit. Temperature sensing performance is measured using the quantum signal-to-noise ratio. We underline how non-Markovianity can enhance the performance of our thermometers. Furthermore, we emphasize that nonequilibrium conditions do not always result in the best sensitivities in temperature estimation.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We experimentally implement the Sz.-Nagy dilation algorithm to simulate open quantum dynamics on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor. The Sz.-Nagy algorithm enables the simulation of the dynamics of an n-qubit system using n + 1 qubits. We experimentally simulate the action of three nonunitary processes, namely, a phase damping channel acting independently on two qubits, a two-qubit correlated amplitude damping channel, and a magnetic-field-gradient pulse acting on an ensemble of two coupled nuclear spin-21 particles. To evaluate the quality of the experimentally simulated quantum process, we perform convex-optimization-based full quantum process tomography to reconstruct the quantum process from the experimental data and compare it with the target quantum process to be simulated.

TI The Roadmap to 6G Security and Privacy
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Although the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are yet to be fully investigated, the visionaries of the 6th generation (6G) echo systems have already come into the discussion. Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify the security and privacy in 6G networks, we survey how security may impact the envisioned 6G wireless systems, possible challenges with different 6G technologies, and the potential solutions. We provide our vision on 6G security and security key performance indicators (KPIs) with the tentative threat landscape based on the foreseen 6G network architecture. Moreover, we discuss the security and privacy challenges that may encounter with the available 6G requirements and potential 6G applications. We also give the reader some insights into the standardization efforts and research-level projects relevant to 6G security. In particular, we discuss the security considerations with 6G enabling technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), physical layer security, distributed AI/ML, visible light communication (VLC), THz, and quantum computing. All in all, this work intends to provide enlightening guidance for the subsequent research of 6G security and privacy at this initial phase of vision towards reality.

TI Development of Dynamic System Applications Using Distributed
   Quantum-Centric Computing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Many applications of quantum computers require the classical and quantum implementation of dynamic systems (DSs). These applications comprise interacting quantum and classical tasks. While quantum tasks evolve in the quantum domain, classical tasks behave in the classical domain. Besides tackling these kinds of tasks, the computational gap between these domains is covered by the current study. The quantum computing feature All at Once (A@O) executions is appropriate for static systems but less for DSs. The novelty of the proposed approach consists of using Distributed Quantum-Centric Petri Net (DQCPN) models composed of quantum and high-level Petri Nets for specification, design, verification, and implementation of classical-quantum applications. Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are linked to classical components implementing the control and optimization operations in the proposed application. Many practical applications combine quantum and classical computing to address optimization problems. Quantum computers can be built with a combination of qubits and bosonic qumodes, leading to a new paradigm toward quantum computing. The optimizations are performed by some Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). For experiments, an Urban Vehicle Traffic System (UVTS) is used as an open distributed system. The vehicle flows are implemented by discrete qubits, discrete vectors of qubits, or qumodes.

TI Enhanced Metaheuristics-Based Clustering Scheme for Wireless Multimedia
   Sensor Networks
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) comprise of costeffective sensors that can send physical parameters of the target environment to an intended user. With the evolution of technology, multimedia sensor nodes have become the hot research topic since it can continue gatheringmultimedia content and scalar from the target domain. The existence ofmultimedia sensors, integrated with effective signal processing andmultimedia source coding approaches, has led to the increased application of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN). This sort of network has the potential to capture, transmit, and receive multimedia content. Since energy is a major source in WMSN, novel clustering approaches are essential to deal with adaptive topologies of WMSN and prolonged network lifetime. With this motivation, the current study develops an Enhanced Spider Monkey Optimization-based Energy-Aware Clustering Scheme (ESMO-EACS) for WMSN. The proposed ESMO-EACS model derives ESMO algorithm by incorporating the concepts of SMO algorithm and quantum computing. The proposed ESMO-EACS model involves the design of fitness functions using distinct input parameters for effective construction of clusters. A comprehensive experimental analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ESMO-EACS technique in terms of different performance measures. The simulation outcome established the superiority of the proposed ESMO-EACS technique to other methods under various measures.

TI Perturbative Stability and Error-Correction Thresholds of Quantum Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Topologically ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice-gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary-time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error-correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice-gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the low-density parity-check condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low-temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice- gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence for stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and timelike defects in the lattice-gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of spacelike defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of timelike defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.

We introduce a monolithic, chip-scale platform that exploits the chi((2)) nonlinearity of a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) resonator device to efficiently generate squeezed states of light. Our system integrates all essential components-except for the laser and two detectors-on a single chip with an area of one square centimeter, reducing the size, operational complexity, and power consumption associated with conventional setups. Using the balanced homodyne measurement subsystem that we implemented on the same chip, we measure a squeezing of 0.55 decibels and an anti-squeezing of 1.55 decibels. We use 20 milliwatts of input power to generate the parametric oscillator pump field by using second harmonic generation on the same chip. Our work represents a step toward compact and efficient quantum optical systems posed to leverage the rapid advances in integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics.

TI Engineering 3D Floquet Codes by Rewinding
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of noncommuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular, rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological order as the threedimensional (3D) toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of the 3D toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of two copies of the 3D toric code up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round. We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it with two copies of the 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal implementation of the logical non-Clifford controlled-controlled-Z gate. We also show that the coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is finite depth equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to three dimensions, which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the 3D fermionic toric code.

TI Polarization-Sensitive Photoluminescence from Aligned Carbon Chains

AB We synthesize a thin film composed of long carbyne chains terminated by gold clusters and study its optical properties. The presence of gold particles stabilizes longer chains and leads to their alignment. We show that the gold clusters also act as a source of electron doping, thus, changing the intensity of photoluminescence from quadratic dependence on the pumping intensity without gold to linear with gold. We also observe that the excitation of the film at the gold plasmon frequency causes the blue shift of photoluminescence and estimate, on the basis of this effect, the minimum length of the carbyne chains. The high degree of alignment of the gold -terminated carbyne chains results in strongly anisotropic light absorption characterized by a distinctive cosine dependence on the angle between the carbyne molecule and polarization plane of the excitation. This paves the way for a new class of ultimately thin polarization sensitive emitters to be used in future integrated quantum photonics devices.

TI Analysis of quantum fully homomorphic encryption schemes (QFHE) and
   hierarchial memory management for QFHE
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Homomorphic encryption is a recent and fundamental breakthrough in modern cryptography, which allows the performance of operations on encrypted data without unveiling the data. Leveraging quantum mechanics principles, quantum computers can potentially solve certain computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. This immense computational power offers new possibilities for various fields, including cryptography. The rapid evolution of both these fields has led to the development of quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE), which makes the capabilities of classical HE extend into the quantum domain. However, many existing QFHE schemes require significant memory due to complex calculations and fault-tolerance needs. This paper contributes in two ways. First, we provide a comprehensive survey of two specific QFHE schemes, discussing their underlying principles, mathematical frameworks, security aspects, and practical applications. We also explore the challenges posed by quantum computing and how QFHE addresses these to achieve both security and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a new hierarchical memory management system for QFHE, which includes a "quantum cache" (a specialized memory storage for quantum data) and a "reinforcement learning agent" (an intelligent system that learns from experience to optimize decisions). This system dynamically manages data movement between the cache and classical memory, improving memory efficiency and potentially boosting computational performance.

TI Dynamic Modeling and Quantum-Enhanced Forecasting of Multi-Seasonal
   Energy Prices in Simulated Microgrid Environments
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The study address the challenge of forecasting per unit energy prices in a microgrid environment consisting of solar and hydro power resources under multi-seasonal variations. Traditional deep learning techniques such as LSTM, GRU and ESN often struggle with non-linear dependencies and volatility in energy market. To overcome these we propose a hybrid framework incorporating Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) for electricity price forecasting. The proposed AQC model encodes-32 system and market related variables into quantum states and applies adiabatic evolution to derive optimized price prediction. Simulation results using real microgrid data set-up based on HIL shows that AQC reduces forecasting error by 17.03% compared to LSTM, 14.29% to GRU and 13.88% to ESN over 24-hrs and 48-hrs horizons. The enhanced accuracy and robustness of the quantum assisted model demonstrates its potential for next generation energy market forecasting and decisions making tool. The entire framework is tested using a synthetic microgrid dataset designed to emulate real-world seasonal and operational dynamics. While this enables controlled validation of the models, the generalizability of the results to real world deployment requires further empirical evaluations on physical microgrid data set.

TI Industrially microfabricated ion trap with 1 eV trap depth
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Scaling trapped-ion quantum computing will require robust trapping of at least hundreds of ions over long periods, while increasing the complexity and functionality of the trap itself. Symmetric three-dimensional (3D) structures enable high trap depth, but microfabrication techniques are generally better suited to planar structures that produce less ideal conditions for trapping. We present an ion trap fabricated on stacked eight-inch wafers in a large-scale micro-electro-mechanical system microfabrication process that provides reproducible traps at a large volume. Electrodes are patterned on the surfaces of two opposing wafers bonded to a spacer, forming a 3D structure with 2.5 mu m standard deviation in alignment across the stack. We implement a design achieving a trap depth of 1 eV for a Ca-40(+) ion held at 200 mu m from either electrode plane. We characterize traps, achieving measurement agreement with simulations to within +/- 5% for mode frequencies spanning 0.6-3.8 MHz, and evaluate stray electric field across multiple trapping sites. We measure motional heating rates over an extensive range of trap frequencies, and temperatures, observing 40 phonons/s at 1 MHz and 185 K. This fabrication method provides a highly scalable approach for producing a new generation of 3D ion traps.

TI A Quantum Framework for Protein Binding-Site Structure Prediction on
   Utility-Level Quantum Processors
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Accurate prediction of protein active-site structures remains a central challenge in structural biology, especially for short and flexible peptide fragments where conventional and simulation-based methods often fail. Here, we present a quantum computing framework designed for utility-level quantum processors to address this problem. Starting from an amino acid sequence, we cast structure prediction as a ground-state energy minimization task using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Amino acid connectivity is represented on a tetrahedral lattice, and steric, geometric, and chirality constraints are encoded into a problem-specific Hamiltonian expressed as sparse Pauli operators. A two-stage architecture separates energy estimation from measurement decoding, enabling noise mitigation under realistic device conditions. We evaluate the method on 23 real protein fragments from the PDBbind dataset and 7 fragments from therapeutically relevant proteins, executing all experiments on the IBM-Cleveland Clinic quantum processor. Structural predictions are benchmarked against AlphaFold3 (AF3) and classical simulation-based approaches using identical postprocessing and docking procedures. Our quantum framework outperforms both AF3 and classical baselines in Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) and docking efficacy, demonstrating a practical end-to-end pipeline for biologically relevant structure prediction on real quantum hardware and highlighting its engineering feasibility for near-term quantum devices.

TI Codimension-2 defects and higher symmetries in (3+1)D topological phases
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB (3+1)D topological phases of matter can host a broad class of non-trivial topological de-fects of codimension-1, 2, and 3, of which the well-known point charges and flux loops are special cases. The complete algebraic structure of these defects defines a higher cat-egory, and can be viewed as an emergent higher symmetry. This plays a crucial role both in the classification of phases of matter and the possible fault-tolerant logical operations in topological quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we study several examples of such higher codimension defects from distinct perspectives. We mainly study a class of invertible codimension-2 topological defects, which we refer to as twist strings. We provide a number of general constructions for twist strings, in terms of gauging lower dimensional invertible phases, layer constructions, and condensation defects. We study some special examples in the context of Z2 gauge theory with fermionic charges, in Z2 x Z2 gauge theory with bosonic charges, and also in non-Abelian discrete gauge theo-ries based on dihedral (Dn) and alternating (A6) groups. The intersection between twist strings and Abelian flux loops sources Abelian point charges, which defines an H4 coho-mology class that characterizes part of an underlying 3-group symmetry of the topolog-ical order. The equations involving background gauge fields for the 3-group symmetry have been explicitly written down for various cases. We also study examples of twist strings interacting with non-Abelian flux loops (defining part of a non-invertible higher symmetry), examples of non-invertible codimension-2 defects, and examples of the in-terplay of codimension-2 defects with codimension-1 defects. We also find an example of geometric, not fully topological, twist strings in (3+1)D A6 gauge theory.

TI Charge Tunable GaAs Quantum Dots in a Photonic n-i-p Diode
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this submission, we discuss the growth of charge-controllable GaAs quantum dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure, from the perspective of a molecular beam epitaxy grower. The QDs show no blinking and narrow linewidths. We show that the parameters used led to a bimodal growth mode of QDs resulting from low arsenic surface coverage. We identify one of the modes as that showing good properties found in previous work. As the morphology of the fabricated QDs does not hint at outstanding properties, we attribute the good performance of this sample to the low impurity levels in the matrix material and the ability of n- and p-doped contact regions to stabilize the charge state. We present the challenges met in characterizing the sample with ensemble photoluminescence spectroscopy caused by the photonic structure used. We show two straightforward methods to overcome this hurdle and gain insight into QD emission properties.

TI Determination of the number of shots for Grover's search algorithm
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper focuses on Grover's quantum search algorithm, which is of paramount importance as a masterpiece of Quantum Computing software. Given the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum computers, quantum programs based on Grover's algorithm need to be run a number of times in order to generate a histogram of candidate values for solutions, which are then checked to identify the valid ones. In this paper, the distribution of the required number of shots to find all or a fraction of all the solutions to the Grover's search problem is studied. Firstly, considering the similarity of the probability problem with the well-known coupon collector's problem, two formulae are obtained from asymptotic results on the distribution of the required number of shots, as the number of problem solutions grows. These expressions allow to compute the number of shots required to ensure that, with probability p, all or a fraction of all the solutions are found. Secondly, the probability mass function of the required number of shots is derived, which serves as a benchmark to assess the validity of the asymptotic approximations derived previously. A comparison between the two approaches is presented and, as a result, a rule of thumb to decide under which circumstances employ one or the other is proposed.

AB During collective musical performances over the network that are characterized by improvisation, a performer may face the problem of what connected musician to follow most in order to direct his/her own improvisation. This choice may be taken on the basis of different factors related to the state of the network and of the kind of the received musical signal. In this paper we investigate the possibility to adopt the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics to describe some interaction phenomena occurring during improvised networked music performances. We propose a decision-making system, having a quantum circuit in its core, where the approximated decision by performers is modeled with state superposition and probability amplitudes used in quantum computing. The model considers the levels of signal clarity (i.e., audio quality related to packet losses), latency, and musical novelty (e.g., melodic or harmonic variation with respect to a previous musical sequence) as the factors that affect the decision of a performer to select another connected performer to follow. This model may be exploited to regulate the behaviour of an artificial intelligent agent playing the role of a virtual musician in the networked ensemble (via generative music techniques). This allows to create mixed human-artificial ensembles and even fully artificial ensembles in networked contexts.

TI ON A SOLUTION OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL TRUNCATED MOMENT PROBLEM ON
   VERTICES OF THE HYPERCUBE BASED ON BELL INEQUALITIES
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY
AB Motivated by applications in quantum information, we will consider the problem of establishing necessary and sufficient conditions so that linear functionals L : R-n[x(1), ..., x(d)]-+ R with L(1) = 1, where d <= n, have a representing measure on vertices of the hypercube in R-d, i.e., there exists a probability measure mu such that L(p) = integral(d)(R) p(x) d mu(x) := integral ... integral (d)(R) p(x(1), ..., x(d))d mu(x(1), ..., x(d)) for p is an element of R-n[x(1), ..., x(d)] and supp mu subset of K-d where K-d := {(k(1), ..., k(d)) E Rd : k(j) = +/- 1, for j = 1, ..., d}. Taking advantage of the group structure of K-d and some tools from algebraic geometry and functional analysis, we will show that concrete necessary and sufficient conditions can be communicated in terms of certain consistency conditions and also a system of inequalities which are known in the quantum information theory literature as Bell inequalities. A variant of this problem (which is highly relevant to corresponding Bell nonlocality problems in quantum information theory), when L : A -> R, where A subset of R-n[x(1), ..., x(d)] is a subspace, will also be considered. Finally, we will provide a formulation of the aforementioned concrete solution in a finite multiplicative Abelian group setting, which may be of independent interest.

TI EntangleVR plus plus : evaluating the potential of using entanglement in
   an interactive VR scene creation system
SO FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY
AB Interactive digital stories provide a sense of flexibility and freedom to players by allowing them to make choices at key junctions. These choices advance the narrative and determine, to some degree, how the story evolves for that player. As shown in prior work, the ability to control or participate in the construction of the narrative can give the player a high level of agency that results in a stronger sense of immersion in the narrative experience. To support the design of this type of interactive storytelling, our system, EntangleVR++, borrows the idea of entanglement from quantum computing. Our use of entanglement allows creators and storytellers control over which sequences of story events take place in correlation with each other, initiated by the choices a player makes. In this work, we evaluated how well our idea of entanglement enables creators to easily and quickly design interactive Virtual reality narratives. We asked 16 participants to use our system and based on user interviews, analyses of screen recordings, and questionnaire feedback, we extracted four themes. From these themes and the study overall, we derived four authoring strategies for tool designers interested in the design of future visual interface for interactively creating virtual scenes that include relational objects and multiple outcomes driven by player interactions.

AB Stabiliser operations occupy a prominent role in fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are defined operationally: by the use of Clifford gates, Pauli measurements and classical control. These operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, a result which is known as the Gottesman-Knill theorem. However, an additional supply of magic states is enough to promote them to a universal, fault-tolerant model for quantum computing. To quantify the needed resources in terms of magic states, a resource theory of magic has been developed. Stabiliser operations (SO) are considered free within this theory, however they are not the most general class of free operations. From an axiomatic point of view, these are the completely stabiliser-preserving (CSP) channels, defined as those that preserve the convex hull of stabiliser states. It has been an open problem to decide whether these two definitions lead to the same class of operations. In this work, we answer this question in the negative, by constructing an explicit counter-example. This indicates that recently proposed stabiliser-based simulation techniques of CSP maps are strictly more powerful than Gottesman-Knill-like methods. The result is analogous to a well-known fact in entanglement theory, namely that there is a gap between the operationally defined class of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and the axiomatically defined class of separable channels.

TI Vectorial Fluorescence Control with Light-Emitting Metasurfaces for
   Unidirectional Emission and Incoherent Holography
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Ultracompact light emission manipulation is crucial for various applications, including illumination, biosensing, and quantum photonics. Despite significant advancements in lasing manipulation, achieving complex vectorial wavefront control over fluorescence emission is inherently challenging due to its incoherent, omnidirectional, unpolarized, and phase-random emission characteristics. Here, the light-emitting metasurfaces (LEMs), equipped with vectorial manipulation and complex amplitude encoding capabilities, are introduced to realize unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between the LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity of PL unidirectional emission are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM, combined with the enhanced spatial coherence of guided PL, experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside polarization-multiplexed nanoprinting. This versatile LEM platform provides a simplified approach to vectorial PL manipulation, promising multiple potential applications in nanophotonics and light-emitting devices.

TI Improving Strain-localized GaSe Single Photon Emitters with Electrical
   Doping
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Exciton localization through nanoscale strain has been used to create highly efficient single-photon emitters (SPEs) in 2D materials. However, the strong Coulomb interactions between excitons can lead to nonradiative recombination through exciton-exciton annihilation, negatively impacting SPE performance. Here, we investigate the effect of Coulomb interactions on the brightness, single photon purity, and operating temperatures of strain-localized GaSe SPEs by using electrostatic doping. By gating GaSe to the charge neutrality point, the exciton-exciton annihilation nonradiative pathway is suppressed, leading to similar to 60% improvement of emission intensity and an enhancement of the single photon purity g (2)(0) from 0.55 to 0.28. The operating temperature also increased from 4.5 K to 85 K consequently. This research provides insight into many-body interactions in excitons confined by nanoscale strain and lays the groundwork for the optimization of SPEs for optoelectronics and quantum photonics.

TI Investigation of DC and Low-Frequency Noise Performance in GaN-on-Si
   Power MIS-HEMTs Over a Temperature Range of 4 K-420 K
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This study investigates the electrical DC and Low-frequency noise (LFN) characteristics of GaN-on-Si power MIS-HEMTs across an extensive temperature spectrum from 4 K to 420 K to assess their viability for high to cryogenic temperatures. As the temperature drops, improvements are observed in the input DC characteristics, including enhanced transconductance and an increased ON-to-OFF current ratio. Correspondingly, the output DC characteristics affirmed the significant enhancements in drain current and reduced ON-resistance across the same temperature span. These improvements in DC performance are achieved without any evidence of carrier-freeze out throughout the temperature expanse. Furthermore, the LFN characteristics from 10 Hz to 100 KHz reveal a consistent 1/f noise behavior within the measured temperature domain. The trap density inferred from the LFN characteristics increases substantially by two orders of magnitude at deep cryogenic temperatures. Collectively, these experimental outcomes demonstrate that GaN-on-Si power MIS-HEMTs maintain a robust electrical performance over a wide temperature range, providing valuable insights for enhancing their deployment in quantum computing and space-based applications.

TI Cryogenic characteristics of graphene composites-evolution from thermal
   conductors to thermal insulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Graphene composites can serve both as efficient thermal insulators at low temperatures and thermal conductors at high temperatures. Here, the authors report the evolution of thermal conductivity of composites with graphene fillers from cryogenic to room temperature.
   The development of cryogenic semiconductor electronics and superconducting quantum computing requires composite materials that can provide both thermal conduction and thermal insulation. We demonstrated that at cryogenic temperatures, the thermal conductivity of graphene composites can be both higher and lower than that of the reference pristine epoxy, depending on the graphene filler loading and temperature. There exists a well-defined cross-over temperature-above it, the thermal conductivity of composites increases with the addition of graphene; below it, the thermal conductivity decreases with the addition of graphene. The counter-intuitive trend was explained by the specificity of heat conduction at low temperatures: graphene fillers can serve as, both, the scattering centers for phonons in the matrix material and as the conduits of heat. We offer a physical model that explains the experimental trends by the increasing effect of the thermal boundary resistance at cryogenic temperatures and the anomalous thermal percolation threshold, which becomes temperature dependent. The obtained results suggest the possibility of using graphene composites for, both, removing the heat and thermally insulating components at cryogenic temperatures-a capability important for quantum computing and cryogenically cooled conventional electronics.

TI On-Chip Electrostatic Actuation of a Photonic Wire Antenna Embedding
   Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB A photonic wire antenna embedding individual quantum dots (QDs) constitutes a promising platform for both quantum photonics and hybrid nanomechanics. We demonstrate here an integrated device in which on-chip electrodes can apply a static or oscillating bending force to the upper part of the wire. In the static regime, we achieve control over the bending direction and apply at will tensile or compressive mechanical stress on any QD. This results in a blue shift or red shift of their emission, with direct application to the realization of broadly tunable sources of quantum light. As a first illustration of operation in the dynamic regime, we excite the wire fundamental flexural mode and use the QD emission to detect the mechanical vibration. With an estimated operation bandwidth in the GHz range, electrostatic actuation opens appealing perspectives for the exploration of QD-nanowire hybrid mechanics with high-frequency vibrational modes.

TI A Genetic Algorithm with Quantum Random Number Generator for Solving the
   Pollution-Routing Problem in Sustainable Logistics Management
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The increase of greenhouse gases emission, global warming, and even climate change is an ongoing issue. Sustainable logistics and distribution management can help reduce greenhouse gases emission and lighten its influence against our living environment. Quantum computing has become more and more popular in recent years for advancing artificial intelligence into the next generation. Hence, we apply quantum random number generator to provide true random numbers for the genetic algorithm to solve the pollution-routing problems (PRPs) in sustainable logistics management in this paper. The objective of the PRPs is to minimize carbon dioxide emissions, following one of the seventeen sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. We developed a two-phase hybrid model combining a modified k-means algorithm as a clustering method and a genetic algorithm with quantum random number generator as an optimization engine to solve the PRPs aiming to minimize the pollution produced by trucks traveling along delivery routes. We also compared the computation performance with another hybrid model by using a different optimization engine, i.e., the tabu search algorithm. From the experimental results, we found that both hybrid models can provide good solution quality for CO2 emission minimization for 29 PRPs out of a total of 30 instances (30 runs each for all problems).

TI Binary and Multi-Class Classification of Colorectal Polyps Using
   CRP-ViT: A Comparative Study Between CNNs and QNNs
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer mortality on a global scale, with polyps being critical precursors. The accurate classification of colorectal polyps (CRPs) from colonoscopy images is essential for the timely diagnosis and treatment of CRC. Method: This research proposes a novel hybrid model, CRP-ViT, integrating ResNet50 with Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance. This study conducted a comprehensive comparison of the CRP-ViT model against traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and emerging quantum neural networks (QNNs). Experiments were conducted for binary classification to predict the presence of polyps and multi-classification to predict specific polyp types (hyperplastic, adenomatous, and serrated). Results: The results demonstrate that CRPQNN-ViT achieved superior classification performance while maintaining computational efficiency. CRPQNN-ViT achieved an accuracy of 98.18% for training and 97.73% for validation on binary classification and 98.13% during training and 97.92% for validation on multi-classification tasks. In addition to the key metrics, computational parameters were compared, where CRPQNN-ViT excelled in computational time. Conclusions: This comparative analysis reveals the potential of integrating quantum computing into medical image analysis and underscores the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for CRP classification.

TI Improving Quantum Optimization Algorithms by Constraint Relaxation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum optimization is a significant area of quantum computing research with anticipated near-term quantum advantages. Current quantum optimization algorithms, most of which are hybrid variational-Hamiltonian-based algorithms, struggle to present quantum devices due to noise and decoherence. Existing techniques attempt to mitigate these issues through employing different Hamiltonian encodings or Hamiltonian clause pruning, but they often rely on optimistic assumptions rather than a deep analysis of the problem structure. We demonstrate how to formulate the problem Hamiltonian for a quantum approximate optimization algorithm that satisfies all the requirements to correctly describe the considered tactical aircraft deconfliction problem, achieving higher probabilities for finding solutions compared to previous works. Our results indicate that constructing Hamiltonians from an unconventional, quantum-specific perspective with a high degree of entanglement results in a linear instead of exponential number of entanglement gates instead and superior performance compared to standard formulations. Specifically, we achieve a higher probability of finding feasible solutions: finding solutions in nine out of nine instances compared to standard Hamiltonian formulations and quadratic programming formulations known from quantum annealers, which only found solutions in seven out of nine instances. These findings suggest that there is substantial potential for further research in quantum Hamiltonian design and that gate-based approaches may offer superior optimization performance over quantum annealers in the future.

AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center quantum system in diamond has shown great application potentialin the fields of solid-state quantum computing and quantum precision measurement because of its uniqueadvantages such as single-spin addressing and manipulation and long quantum coherence time at roomtemperature. The precise manipulation technology of single spin is particularly important for the developmentof the application of NV center. The common spin manipulation methods used in NV center quantum systemare to drive and manipulate the electron spin by resonant alternating magnetic field. In recent years, theelectrical control of quantum spin has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, using the alternating electricfield to control the electron spin of NV center is studied. The alternating electric field generated by theelectrode successfully drives the Rabi oscillation of the NV center spin between the magnetic-dipoleforbidden energy levels of and . Further studies show that the frequency of the electricallydriven Rabi oscillation is controlled by the power of the driven electric field but independent of the resonantfrequency of the electric field. The combination of spin electric control and magnetic control technology canrealize the full manipulation of the direct transition among the three spin energy levels of NV center, thuspromoting the development of the researches and applications of NV quantum system in the fields of quantumsimulation, quantum computing, precision measurement of electromagnetic field, etc

TI Temporally modulated energy shuffling in highly interconnected
   nanosystems
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Advances in lighting and quantum computing will require new degrees of control over the emission of photons, where localized defects and the quantum confinement of carriers can be utilized. In this contribution, recent developments in the controlled redistribution of energy in rare earth (RE)-doped nanosystems, such as quantum dots or within bulk insulating and semiconducting hosts, will be reviewed. In their trivalent form, RE ions are particularly useful dopants because they retain much of their atomic nature regardless of their environment; however, in systems such as GaN and Si, the electronic states of the RE ions couple strongly to those of the host material by forming nanocomplexes. This coupling facilities fast energy transfer (ET) (<100 ps) and a carrier-mediate energy exchange between the host and the various states of the RE ions, which is mediated by the presence of carriers. A model has been developed using a set of rate equations, which takes into consideration the various ET pathways and the lifetimes of each state within the nanocomplex, which can be used to predict the nature of the emitted photons given an excitation condition. This model will be used to elucidate recent experimental observations in Eu-doped GaN.

TI Heterogeneous integration of a high-speed lithium niobate modulator on
   silicon nitride using micro-transfer printing
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonic systems require fast modulators to keep up with demanding operation speeds and increasing data rates. The silicon nitride integrated photonic platform is of particular interest for applications such as datacom, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), quantum photonics, and computing owing to its low losses and CMOS compatibility. Yet, this platform inherently lacks high-speed modulators. Heterogeneous integration of lithium niobate on silicon nitride waveguides can address this drawback with its strong Pockels effect. We demonstrate the first high-speed lithium niobate modulator heterogeneously integrated on silicon nitride using micro-transfer printing. The device is 2 mm long with a half-wave voltage V-p of 14.8 V. The insertion loss and extinction ratio are 3.3 and 39 dB, respectively. Operation beyond 50 GHz has been demonstrated with the generation of open eye diagrams up to 70 Gb/s. This proof-of-principle demonstration opens up possibilities for more scalable fabrication of these trusted and performant devices.

TI SUPER excitation of quantum emitters is a multi-photon process
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme allows to populate the excited state of a quantum emitter with near-unity fidelity using two red-detuned laser pulses. Its off-resonant yet fully coherent nature has attracted significant interest in quantum photonics as a valuable tool for preparing single-photon sources in their excited state on demand while simultaneously ensuring straightforward spectral filtering of the laser. However, the physical understanding of this mechanism in terms of energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the emitter is still lacking. Here, we present a fully quantized model of the swing-up excitation and demonstrate that it is in fact a multi-photon process, where one of the modes loses two or more photons while the other gains at least one. Our findings provide an unexpected physical interpretation of the SUPER scheme and unveil a new non-linear interaction between single emitters and multiple field modes.

TI Violation of detailed balance in microwave circuits: theory and
   experiment
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB We propose an approach for addressing detailed balance violation in electrical circuits based on the scattering matrix formalism commonly used in microwave electronics. This allows the inclusion of very simple retardation effects, which are paramount at high frequencies. We define the spectral densities of phase space angular momentum, heat transfer and cross power, which can serve as criteria for detailed balance violation. We confirm our theory with measurements in the 4-8 GHz frequency range on several two-port circuits of varying symmetries, in space and time. The restults validate our approach and enable the straightforward treatment of quantum circuits at ultra-low temperatures.

TI Learning with density matrices and random features
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB A density matrix describes the statistical state of a quantum system. It is a powerful formalism to represent both the quantum and classical uncertainty of quantum systems and to express different statistical operations such as measurement, system combination and expectations as linear algebra operations. This paper explores how density matrices can be used as a building block for machine learning models exploiting their ability to straightforwardly combine linear algebra and probability. One of the main results of the paper is to show that density matrices coupled with random Fourier features could approximate arbitrary probability distributions over R-n. Based on this finding the paper builds different models for density estimation, classification and regression. These models are differentiable, so it is possible to integrate them with other differentiable components, such as deep learning architectures and to learn their parameters using gradient-based optimization. In addition, the paper presents optimization-less training strategies based on estimation and model averaging. The models are evaluated in benchmark tasks and the results are reported and discussed.

AB Isogeny-based cryptography is an instance of post-quantum cryptography whose fundamental problem consists of finding an isogeny between two (isogenous) elliptic curves E and E '. This problem is closely related to that of computing the endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve. Therefore, many isogeny-based protocols require the endomorphism ring of at least one of the curves involved to be unknown. In this paper, we explore the design of isogeny based protocols in a scenario where one assumes that the endomorphism ring of all the curves are public. In particular, we identify digital signatures based on proof of isogeny knowledge from SIDH squares as such a candidate. We explore the design choices for such constructions and propose two variants with practical instantiations. We analyze their security according to three lines, the first consists of attacks based on KLPT with both polynomial and superpolynomial adversary, the second consists of attacks derived from the SIDH attacks and finally we study the zero-knowledge property of the underlying proof of knowledge.

TI Capacitance-based fermion parity readout and predicted Rabi oscillations
   in a Majorana nanowire
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent experiments have measured flux-dependent capacitance at radio frequencies, leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work, we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a noninteracting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity-dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this, we study how such a fast capacitance readout can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent interwire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.

TI Spin dynamics in quantum dots on liquid helium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Liquid He-4 is free from magnetic defects, making it an ideal substrate for electrons with long-lived spin states. Such states can serve as qubit states. Here we consider the spin states of electrons electrostatically localized in quantum dots on a helium surface. Efficient gate operations in this system require spin-orbit coupling. It can be created by a nonuniform magnetic field from a current-carrying wire, can be turned on and off, and allows one to obtain large electrodipole moment and comparatively fast coupling of spins in neighboring dots. Of central importance is to understand spin decay due to the spin-orbit coupling. We establish the leading mechanism of such decay and show that the decay is sufficiently slow to enable high-fidelity single-and two-qubit gate operations.

AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is arising as an attractive technology for quantum secure communications in future optical networks, thanks to its higher compatibility with conventional telecommunication systems. In fact, CV-QKD adopts opto-electronic devices of coherent optical systems, enabling the use of commercial off-the-shelf components (COTS) and photonic integrated circuits (PICs). This favors a faster and sustainable adoption of this technology in optical networks. Also, smoother integration within the network infrastructure can be envisioned, in coexistence with classical communications, further facilitated and accelerated by software defined networking (SDN). In this invited contribution, the adoption of CV-QKD in future optical networks is discussed, presenting our recent results.

TI Shannon and Fisher Entropy for a New Class of Single Hyperbolic
   Potentials in Fractional Schrödinger Equation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB We investigate the quantum information entropy for a class of single hyperbolic potentials within the context of the fractional Schr & ouml;dinger equation (FSE). We find that as the derivative variable n$$ n $$ decreases, the position entropy density function rho(x) becomes more localized, and its peak heightens. However, there are differences in the degree of localization between the position entropy density functions for each hyperbolic potential, which can be attributed to the varying sizes of the potentials. Conversely, in momentum space, the momentum entropy density function rho(p) becomes more delocalized, and its peak lowers as the derivative variable n$$ n $$ decreases for both hyperbolic potentials studied. Our analysis also examines the BBM inequality, demonstrating that it is satisfied for different values of the potential depths. Finally, we explore the Fisher entropy and observe that it increases in position space while decreasing in momentum space as the depth of the wells increases. Our findings provide new insights into the behavior of quantum systems governed by hyperbolic potentials within the fractional Schr & ouml;dinger framework. The observed localization effects in position space, delocalization in momentum space, and the validation of the BBM inequality highlight the role of fractional derivatives in modifying quantum entropy measures. These results deepen our understanding of quantum information entropy in non-local quantum systems. They may have implications for fields such as quantum transport in disordered media, semiconductor physics, and the study of anomalous diffusion processes in quantum mechanics.

TI Practical Usage of Radical Isogenies for CSIDH
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recently, a radical isogeny was proposed to boost commutative supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH) implementation. Radical isogenies reduce the generation of a kernel of a small prime order when implementing CSIDH. However, when the size of the base field increases, field exponentiation, a core component of computing radical isogenies, becomes more computationally intensive. As the size of the field inevitably grows to resist a quantum attack, so it is necessary to discuss the practical utilization of the radical CSIDH. This paper presents an optimized implementation of radical isogenies and analyzes its ideal use in CSIDH-based cryptography with a review of quantum analysis. We tailored the formula for transforming Montgomery curves into the Tate normal form and further optimized the radical 2-isogeny formula and projective versions of the radical 5- and 7-isogenies. Except for CSIDH-512, using only the radical 2-isogeny for all parameters improves performance by 6% to 10%.

In this paper, we introduce a method that enables us to recover messages of LWE/LWR-based PKE/KEMs using simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) models trained on a small dataset. The core idea is to extend the attack dataset so that at least one of its traces has the ground truth label to which the models are biased towards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method on the examples of CRYSTALS-Kyber and Saber algorithms implemented in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU on nRF52832 system-on-chip supporting Bluetooth 5.2. We use amplitude-modulated EM emanations which are typically weaker and noisier than power or near-field EM side channels, and thus more difficult to exploit.

TI Dynamic acoustic optimization of pulse tube refrigerators for rapid
   cooldown
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Pulse tube refrigerators are a critical enabling technology for many disciplines that require low temperatures. These refrigerators dominate the total power consumption of most modern cryostats, including those that reach millikelvin temperatures using additional cooling stages. In state-of-the-art commercial pulse tube refrigerators, the acoustic coupling between the driving compressor and the refrigerator is fixed and optimized for operation at base temperature. We show that this optimization is incorrect during the cooldown process, which results in wasted power consumption by the compressor and slow cooldown speed. After developing analytic expressions that demonstrate the need for acoustic tuning as a function of temperature, we dynamically optimize the acoustics of a commercial pulse tube refrigerator and show that the cooldown speed can be increased to 1.7 to 3.5 times the original value. Acoustic power measurements show that loss mechanism(s)-and not the capacity of the compressor-limit the maximum cooling available at high temperatures, suggesting that even faster cooldown speeds can be achieved in the future. This work has implications for the accessibility of cryogenic temperatures and the cadence of research in many disciplines such as quantum computing.
   Pulse tube refrigerators are a critical enabling technology for many disciplines that require low temperatures, including quantum computing. Here, the authors show that dynamically optimizing the acoustic parameters of the refrigerator can improve conventional cooldown speeds up to 3.5 times.

TI Components for an Inexpensive CW-ODMR NV-Based Magnetometer
SO MAGNETISM
AB Quantum sensing based on NV-centers in diamonds has been demonstrated many times in multiple publications. The majority of publications use lasers in free space or lasers with fiber optics, expensive optical components such as dichroic mirrors, or beam splitters with dichroic filters and expensive detectors, such as Avalanche photodiodes or single photon detectors, overall, leading to custom and expensive setups. In order to provide an inexpensive NV-based magnetometer setup for educational use in schools, to teach the three topics, fluorescence, optically detected magnetic resonance, and Zeeman splitting, inexpensive, miniaturized, off-the-shelf components with high reliability have to be used. The cheaper such a setup, the more setups a school can afford. Hence, in this work, we investigated LEDs as light sources, considered different diamonds for our setup, tested different color filters, proposed an inexpensive microwave resonator, and used a cheap photodiode with an appropriate transimpedance amplifier as the basis for our quantum magnetometer. As a result, we identified cheap and functional components and present a setup and show that it can demonstrate the three topics mentioned at a hardware cost <EUR 100.

Quantum-Inspired Neural Radiative Transfer (QINRT) frameworks, combining tensor-network parameterizations and quantum neural operators (QNOs), offer efficient approximation of high-dimensional radiative fields while preserving key physical correlations. This review highlights the advances of QINRT in enhancing spectral fidelity and computational efficiency, enabling energy-efficient, real-time RT inference suitable for satellite constellations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. By integrating physics-informed modeling with scalable neural architectures, QINRT represents a transformative approach for next-generation Earth-system digital twins and autonomous climate intelligence.

TI Dynamic Group Key Exchange Protocol With Lattice Trapdoor and
   Re-Encryption Mechanisms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Post-quantum group key exchange protocols have become an increasingly critical area of research due to the potential threat quantum computers pose to classical cryptographic schemes. Traditional group key exchange protocols, often based on Diffie-Hellman and other number-theoretic assumptions, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel group key exchange protocol that leverages lattice-based cryptography. Specifically, our approach utilizes lattice trapdoors and a re-encryption mechanism based on the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem. This design not only achieves post-quantum security but also enhances efficiency and flexibility in dynamic group settings. A common challenge in most protocols is the computational cost of deriving new keys as group members join and leave. Our approach effectively reduces this cost, making key updates more efficient and practical. Our protocol is proven secure under standard lattice assumptions, providing a promising solution for quantum-resistant group key exchange.

BIKE is a key-encapsulation mechanism, candidate to the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardisation process. We attack by exploiting the rotation function that circularly shifts an array depending on the private key. Chen et al. implemented two versions of this function, one in C and one in assembly. Our attack uses subtraces clustering combined with a combinatorial attack to recover the full private key. We obtained a high clustering accuracy in our experiments, and we provide ways to deal with the errors. We are able to recover all the private keys for the C implementation, and while the assembly version is harder to attack using our technique, we still manage to reduce BIKE Level-1 security from 128 to 65 bits for a significant proportion of the private keys.

TI Torsion point attacks on 'SIDH-like' cryptosystems
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Isogeny-based cryptography is a promising approach for post-quantum cryptography. The best-known protocol following that approach is the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman protocol (SIDH); this protocol was turned into the CCA-secure key encapsulation mechanism SIKE, which was submitted to and remains in the third round of NIST's post-quantum standardisation process as an 'alternate' candidate. Isogeny-based cryptography generally relies on the conjectured hardness of computing an isogeny between two isogenous elliptic curves, and most cryptanalytic work referenced on SIKE's webpage exclusively focusses on that problem. Interestingly, the hardness of this problem is sufficient for neither SIDH nor SIKE. In particular, these protocols reveal additional information on the secret isogeny, in the form of images of specific torsion points through the isogeny. This paper surveys existing cryptanalysis approaches exploiting this often called 'torsion point information', summarises their current impact on SIKE and related algorithms, and suggests some research directions that might lead to further impact.

TI Quantum generative adversarial networks with dual generators
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks like synthetic data generation and detecting anomalies. Recent developments have increasingly integrated traditional machine learning techniques to boost the performance of QGANs. Motivated by this progress, we propose an innovative QGAN architecture that incorporates a classical learning component and employs a dual-generator design. Our approach improves upon the traditional hybrid quantum-classical GAN structure and introduces a redesigned loss function tailored for the new model. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our method surpasses previous techniques in image generation quality, achieving a 1.38% average reduction in Fr & eacute;chet inception distance scores compared to the current state-of-the-art, and improvements of 6.52%, 0.36%, and 0.38% in structural similarity index, cosine similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio metrics, respectively. Additionally, our architecture supports the generation of larger images (up to 78x78), as verified on the CelebA dataset. Simulations conducted in noisy conditions further confirm the robustness and effectiveness of both the proposed architecture and loss function.

This categorical completion encompasses both quantum channels, via Stinespring dilation, and classical computing, via Bennett's method. Moreover, in these two cases, we show how our construction can be essentially 'undone' by a further universal construction. This shows how both mixed quantum theory and classical computation rest on entirely reversible foundations.

TI Fluorescent HPHT nanodiamonds have disk- and rod-like shapes
SO CARBON
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers can be used as nanoscale sensors for temperature and electromagnetic fields and find increasing application in many areas of science and technology from biology to quantum metrology. Decreasing the separation between the NV centers and their sensing target often enhances the measurement sensitivity. FND shape strongly affects this distance from NV centers to the particle surface and therefore properties such as brightness and fluorescence spectrum, and can limit sensor applications. Here, we demonstrate that FNDs made from high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamond have predominantly disk-like shapes. Using single-particle atomic force microscopy in combination with ensemble X-ray and light scattering techniques, we show that a typical FND in the 50-150 nm size range has an aspect ratio of three i.e. is three times thinner (e.g. in z) than it is wide (e.g. in the x-y plane). This high aspect ratio of FNDs is important for many quantum sensing measurements as it will enable enhanced sensitivities compared to spherical or other isotropic particle geometries. We investigate FND shape, fluorescence properties, T1 spin relaxation time and T1 fluorescence contrast as functions of particle size and discuss the implications of FND particle shape on quantum sensing applications.

TI Integrated Micro- and Nano-Grid with Focus on Net-Zero Renewable
   Energy-A Survey Paper
SO ENERGIES
AB An integrated micro- and nano-grid with net-zero renewable energy is a sophisticated energy system framework aimed at attaining optimal efficiency and sustainability. This survey paper examines several contemporary research works in this domain. This document summarizes the latest papers selected for analysis to comprehend the current state-of-the-art, integration process, methodology, and research gaps. The objective of this review is to identify existing trends and ongoing transformations in this domain. At the conclusion of the study, emerging technologies for smart grid integration are offered, emphasizing Transactive Control, Blockchain Technology, and Quantum Cryptography, based on existing research gaps. Microgrids and nano-grids are localized energy systems capable of functioning alone or in tandem with larger power grids, offering resilience and adaptability. By incorporating renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and storage devices, these networks can produce and regulate energy locally, guaranteeing that the generated energy meets or surpasses the energy used. The incorporation of intelligent technology and control systems facilitates optimized energy distribution, real-time monitoring, and load balancing, advancing the objective of net-zero energy use. This strategy not only bolsters energy security but also markedly decreases carbon emissions, rendering it an essential element in the shift towards a sustainable and resilient energy future. The worldwide implementation of interconnected micro- and nano-grids utilizing net-zero renewable energy signifies a pivotal transition towards a sustainable and resilient energy future. These localized energy systems can function independently or in conjunction with conventional power grids, utilizing renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and advanced storage technology. Integrating these resources with intelligent control systems enables micro- and nano-grids to optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption at a detailed level, ensuring that communities and companies globally can attain net-zero energy usage. This method not only diminishes greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also improves energy security and grid stability in various places. These technologies, when implemented globally, provide a scalable answer to the issues of energy access, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation, facilitating a cleaner and more equal energy landscape worldwide.

AB In this paper, we investigate the performances of tunable quantum neural networks in the Quantum Probably Approximately Correct (QPAC) learning framework. Tunable neural networks are quantum circuits made of multi-controlled X gates. By tuning the set of controls these circuits are able to approximate any Boolean functions. This architecture is particularly suited to be used in the QPAClearning framework as it can handle the superposition produced by the oracle. In order to tune the network so that it can approximate a target concept, we have devised and implemented an algorithm based on amplitude amplification. The numerical results show that this approach can efficiently learn concepts from a simple class.

TI A quantum leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neuron and network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum machine learning is in a period of rapid development and discovery, however it still lacks the resources and diversity of computational models of its classical complement. With the growing difficulties of classical models requiring extreme hardware and power solutions, and quantum models being limited by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, there is an emerging opportunity to solve both problems together. Here we introduce a new software model for quantum neuromorphic computing - a quantum leaky integrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuron, implemented as a compact high-fidelity quantum circuit, requiring only 2 rotation gates and no CNOT gates. We use these neurons as building blocks in the construction of a quantum spiking neural network (QSNN), and a quantum spiking convolutional neural network (QSCNN), as the first of their kind. We apply these models to the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and KMNIST datasets for a full comparison with other classical and quantum models. We find that the proposed models perform competitively, with comparative accuracy, with efficient scaling and fast computation in classical simulation as well as on quantum devices.

TI Resource saving via ensemble techniques for quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum neural networks hold significant promise for numerous applications, particularly as they can be executed on the current generation of quantum hardware. However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that these methods enable the construction of large, powerful models even on relatively small quantum devices.

TI Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and
   locality
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB In systems with no symmetry, local operations can combine to make any unitary transformation across a whole quantum system, but if symmetries limit the allowed operations, they cannot all be generated using local transformations.
   According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.

It is charged via the sequential interaction with a collection of identical and independent ancillary two-level systems. By means of a numerical analysis, we show that, in case these ancillas are coherent, this kind of quantum battery can achieve remarkable performances in terms of the control of the stored energy and its extraction in regimes of parameters within reach in nowadays quantum circuits.

CL Hagenberg, AUSTRIA
AB The Heisenberg representation of quantum operators provides a powerful technique for reasoning about quantum circuits, albeit those restricted to the common (non-universal) Clifford set H, S and CNOT. The Gottesman-Knill theorem showed that we can use this representation to efficiently simulate Clifford circuits. We show that Gottesman's semantics for quantum programs can be treated as a type system, allowing us to efficiently characterize a common subset of quantum programs. We also show that it can be extended beyond the Clifford set to partially characterize a broad range of programs. We apply these types to reason about separable states and the superdense coding algorithm.

TI Quantum-Grade Nanodiamonds from a Single-Step, Industrial-Scale Pressure
   and Temperature Process
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Nanodiamonds with nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers are a promising workhorse for myriad applications, from quantum sensing to bioimaging. However, despite two decades of extensive research, their use remains limited by the lack of scalable methods to produce quantum-grade material. While traditional NV-production methods involve multi-step irradiation and annealing processes, a fundamentally different approach is presented here based on a single-step high-temperature plastic deformation. It enables industrial-scale yield of high-quality luminescent nanodiamonds while significantly reducing production time and costs. Utilizing a unique cubic press apparatus capable of reaching higher temperatures and pressures, 50-nm luminescent nanodiamonds with outstanding optical and spin properties are achieved in a single step from non-luminescent material. Compared to electron-irradiated nanodiamonds, i.e., common commercially available material, this method yields NV centers with significantly improved charge stability, T1 relaxation times approaching 1 ms, and a approximate to 5-fold enhancement in optical Rabi contrast. What this streamlined process produces in one week would require more than 40 years by current irradiation and annealing methods. Scalable, quantum-grade nanodiamonds are thus unlocked, providing the missing link for their widespread adoption.

SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB The capability to form a photonic shield by using a unique all-optical transmission scheme incorporating multi-THz coherent spreading, spectral phase encoding (SPE), and negative optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) completely prevents offline deciphering of captured data-in-transit. This photonic shield scheme provides an ultimate solution to the "harvest-now, decrypt later" threat by eliminating unauthorised recording. Thus, no raw data is available for any post-processing, including by quantum computers. Both the full line rate payload and the asymmetric key exchange, are transmitted through the secured channel. This work presents an industry-level demonstration, including real-time client data transmission and seamlessly continuously changing spectral phase encoding (SPE) photonic keys.

TI An elegant scheme of self-testing for multipartite Bell inequalities
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Self-testing is the most accurate form of certification of quantum devices. While self-testing in bipartite Bell scenarios has been thoroughly studied, self-testing in the more complex multipartite Bell scenarios remains largely unexplored. We present a simple and broadly applicable self-testing scheme for N-partite correlation Bell inequalities with two binary outcome observables per party. To showcase the versatility of our proof technique, we obtain self-testing statements for the MABK and WWWZB family of linear Bell inequalities and Uffink's family of quadratic Bell inequalities. In particular, we show that the N-partite MABK and Uffink's quadratic Bell inequalities self-test the GHZ state and anti-commuting observables for each party. While the former uniquely specifies the state, the latter allows for an arbitrary relative phase. To demonstrate the operational relevance of the relative phase, we introduce Uffink's complex-valued N partite Bell expression, whose extremal values self-test the GHZ states and uniquely specify the relative phase.

TI Unlocking quantum SVM potential: optimal feature map generation and
   feature selection
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The study proposes a mechanism to generate effective feature maps with optimal feature selection using the Tabu Search algorithm. It compares the performance of classical support vector machines (SVM), quantum support vector machines (QSVM) with only gate selection, and QSVM with both gate selection and feature selection (QSVM-FS) across various datasets. The results indicate that classical SVMs excel with several benchmark datasets, while QSVMs show superior performance on synthetic datasets with non-linear separability. Notably, QSVM-FS consistently outperforms QSVM without feature selection, highlighting the importance of feature selection in enhancing model accuracy. These findings suggest that while both quantum and classical SVMs have unique advantages, quantum methods offer particular benefits in specific scenarios. In the NISQ era, classical simulations are a primary tool for assessing quantum experiments, though they face challenges such as design impacts, limited scales, and biases. Ultimately, no definitive winner exists between quantum and classical methods, as both have their own strengths.

TI Optimal Tuning of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for
   Multivariate Distribution Loading
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Loading data efficiently from classical memories to quantum computers is a key challenge of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Such a problem can be addressed through quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs), which are noise tolerant and agnostic with respect to data. Tuning a qGAN to balance accuracy and training time is a hard task that becomes paramount when target distributions are multivariate. Thanks to our tuning of the hyper-parameters and of the optimizer, the training of qGAN reduces, on average, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic of 43-64% with respect to the state of the art. The ability to reach optima is non-trivially affected by the starting point of the search algorithm. A gap arises between the optimal and sub-optimal training accuracy. We also point out that the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) optimizer does not achieve the same accuracy as the Adam optimizer in our conditions, thus calling for new advancements to support the scaling capability of qGANs.

TI Improved Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Gauge Theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories for the foreseeable future will be hampered by limited resources. The historical success of improved lattice actions in classical simulations strongly suggests that Hamiltonians with improved discretization errors will reduce quantum resources, i.e., require greater than or similar to 2(d) fewer qubits in quantum simulations for lattices with d-spatial dimensions. In this work, we consider O(a(2))-improved Hamiltonians for pure gauge theories and design the corresponding quantum circuits for its real-time evolution in terms of primitive gates. An explicit demonstration for Z(2) gauge theory is presented including exploratory tests using the ibm_perth device.

We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of the XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then, we obtain the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground-state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into the orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the component following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next, we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in the presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing the transverse Ising model as a working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides us with a very fast computational algorithm, leading to ground-state energy values converging to the best-known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.

TI Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and
   criticality in the spin-boson model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analog of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their nonmonotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a nonperturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Nonmonotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.

TI Photon-resolved Floquet theory. I. Full counting statistics of the
   driving field in Floquet systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Floquet theory and other established semiclassical approaches are widely used methods to predict the state of externally driven quantum systems, yet they do not allow the prediction of the state of the photonic driving field. To overcome this shortcoming, the photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) was developed recently [Phys. Rev. Res. 6 , 013116 (2024)], which deploys concepts from full-counting statistics to predict the statistics of the photon flux between several coherent driving modes. In this paper, we study in detail the scaling properties of the PRFT in the semi-classical regime. We find that there is an ambiguity in the definition of the moment-generating function, such that different versions of this function produce the same photonic probability distribution in the semiclassical limit, and generate the same leading-order terms of the moments and cumulants. Using this ambiguity, we establish a simple expression for the Kraus operators, which describe the decoherence dynamics of the driven quantum system appearing as a consequence of the light-matter interaction. The PRFT will pave the way for improved quantum sensing methods, e.g., for spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols, reflectometry in semiconductor nanostructures, and other applications, where the detailed knowledge of the photonic probability distribution is necessary.

TI Commitment Schemes from OWFs with Applications to Quantum Oblivious
   Transfer
SO ENTROPY
AB Commitment schemes (CSs) are essential to many cryptographic protocols and schemes with applications that include privacy-preserving computation on data, privacy-preserving authentication, and, in particular, oblivious transfer protocols. For quantum oblivious transfer (qOT) protocols, unconditionally binding commitment schemes that do not rely on hardness assumptions from structured mathematical problems are required. These additional constraints severely limit the choice of commitment schemes to random oracle-based constructions or Naor's bit commitment scheme. As these protocols commit to individual bits, the use of such commitment schemes comes at a high bandwidth and computational cost. In this work, we investigate improvements to the efficiency of commitment schemes used in qOT protocols and propose an extension of Naor's commitment scheme requiring the existence of one-way functions (OWFs) to reduce communication complexity for 2-bit strings. Additionally, we provide an interactive string commitment scheme with preprocessing to enable the fast and efficient computation of commitments.

TI Squeezed states generation by nonlinear plasmonic waveguides: a novel
   analysis including loss, phase mismatch and source depletion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this article, a full numerical method to study the squeezing procedure through second harmonic generation process is proposed. The method includes complex nonlinear coupling coefficient, phase mismatch, and pump depletion. Attention has been also paid to the effects of accumulated noises in this work. The final form of the numerical formula seems to be much simpler than the analytical solutions previously reported. The function of this numerical method shows that it works accurately for different mechanisms of squeezed state generations and does not suffer from instabilities usually encountered even for non-uniform, coarse steps. The proposed method is used to examine the squeezing procedure in an engineered nonlinear plasmonic waveguide. The results show that using the nonlinear plasmonic waveguide, it is possible to generate the squeezed states for the pump and the second harmonic modes with high efficiency in a propagation length as short as 2 mm which is much shorter than the needed length for the traditional nonlinear lithium niobate- based optical waveguides being of the order of 100 mm. This new method of squeezed states generation may find applications in optical communication with a noise level well below the standard quantum limit, in quantum teleportation, and in super sensitive interferometry.

TI Generalized Quantum-Assisted Digital Signature
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article introduces generalized quantum-assisted digital signature (GQaDS), an improved version of a recently proposed scheme whose information-theoretic security is inherited by adopting quantum key distribution keys for digital signature purposes. Its security against forging is computed considering a trial-and-error approach taken by the malicious forger, and GQaDS parameters are optimized via an analytical approach balancing between forgery and repudiation probabilities. The hash functions of the previous implementation are replaced with Carter-Wegman message authentication codes, strengthening the scheme security and reducing the signature length. For particular scenarios where the second verifier has a safe reputation, a simplified version of GQaDS, namely deterministic GQaDS, can further reduce the required signature length, keeping the desired security strength.

TI Topological Charge of Propagation-Invariant Laser Beams
SO PHOTONICS
AB If a vortex propagation-invariant beam is given by all its intensity nulls, then its topological charge (TC) can be defined easily: its TC is equal to the sum of topological charges of all optical vortices in these intensity nulls. If, however, a propagation-invariant beam is given as a superposition of several light fields, then determining its TC is a complicated task. Here, we derive the topological charges of four different types of propagation-invariant beams, represented as axial superpositions of Hermite-Gaussian beams with different amplitudes and different phase delays. In particular, topological charges are obtained for such beam families as the Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian (HLG) beams and two-parametric vortex Hermite beams. We show that the TC is a quantity resistant to changing certain beam parameters. For instance, when the parameters theta and alpha of the HLG beams are altered, the beam intensity also changes significantly, but the TC remains unchanged.

TI CONCRETE ANALYSIS OF APPROXIMATE IDEAL-SIVP TO DECISION RING-LWE
   REDUCTION
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB A seminal 2013 paper by Lyubashevsky, Peikert, and Regev proposed basing post-quantum cryptography on ideal lattices and supported this proposal by giving a polynomial-time security reduction from the approximate Shortest Independent Vectors Problem (SIVP) to the Decision Learning With Errors (DLWE) problem in ideal lattices. We give a concrete analysis of this multi-step reduction. We find that the tightness gap in the reduction is so great as to vitiate any meaningful security guarantee, and we find reasons to doubt the feasibility in the foreseeable future of the quantum part of the reduction. In addition, when we make the reduction concrete it appears that the approximation factor in the SIVP problem is far larger than expected, a circumstance that causes the corresponding approximate-SIVP problem most likely not to be hard for proposed cryptosystem parameters. We also discuss implications for systems such as Kyber and SABER that are based on module-DLWE.

TI Physical theory of two-stage thermalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Thermalization time marks the scale at which the subsystem entanglement reaches its thermal value. It was recently shown to exhibit two distinct stages in a generic class of quantum circuits with decay rates r1 and r2 before and after thermalization. The two rates are observed in the Floquet dynamics of the state purity, entanglement spectra, and (local) correlation functions, both in clean and disordered systems. Entanglement membrane theory interprets r1 as domain-wall energy and r2 as either a geometric effect (phantom eigenvalue) or a competition with an emergent magnon mode. In the case when the domain wall dominates, this offers a practical measure for entanglement growth via local correlations.

TI Binding affinity predictions with hybrid quantum-classical convolutional
   neural networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Central in drug design is the identification of biomolecules that uniquely and robustly bind to a target protein, while minimizing their interactions with others. Accordingly, precise binding affinity prediction, enabling the accurate selection of suitable candidates from an extensive pool of potential compounds, can greatly reduce the expenses associated to practical experimental protocols. In this respect, recent advances revealed that deep learning methods show superior performance compared to other traditional computational methods, especially with the advent of large datasets. These methods, however, are complex and very time-intensive, thus representing an important clear bottleneck for their development and practical application. In this context, the emerging realm of quantum machine learning holds promise for enhancing numerous classical machine learning algorithms. In this work, we take one step forward and present a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network, which is able to reduce by 20% the complexity of the classical counterpart while still maintaining optimal performance in the predictions. Additionally, this results in a significant cost and time savings of up to 40% in the training stage, which means a substantial speed-up of the drug design process.

TI Enhancing distributed sensing with imperfect error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement has shown promise in enhancing information processing tasks in a sensor network via dis-tributed quantum sensing protocols. As noise is ubiquitous in sensor networks, error correction schemes based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are required to enhance the performance, as shown in [Q. Zhuang, J. Preskill, and L. Jiang, New J. Phys. 22, 022001 (2020)] assuming homogeneous noise among sensors and perfect GKP states. Here, we extend the analyses of performance enhancement to finite-squeezed GKP states in a heterogeneous noise model. To begin with, we study different concatenation schemes of GKP-two-mode-squeezing codes. While traditional sequential concatenation schemes in previous works do improve the suppression of noise, we propose a balanced concatenation scheme that outperforms the sequential schemes in the presence of finite GKP squeezing. We then apply these results to two specific tasks in distributed quantum sensing (parameter estimation and hypothesis testing) to understand the trade-off between imperfect squeezing and performance. For the first task, we consider an energy-constrained scenario and provide an optimal way to distribute the energy of the finite-squeezed GKP states among the sensors. For the later task, we show that the error probability can still be drastically lowered via concatenation of realistic finite-squeezed GKP codes.

TI Generation of multi-photon Fock states at telecommunication wavelength
   using picosecond pulsed light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multi-photon Fock states have diverse applications such as optical quantum information processing. For the implementation of quantum information processing, Fock states should be generated within the telecommunication wavelength band, particularly in the C-band (1530-1565 nm). This is because mature optical communication technologies can be leveraged for transmission, manipulation, and detection. Additionally, to achieve high-speed quantum information processing, Fock states should be generated in optical pulses with as short a duration as possible, as this allows embedding lots of information in the time domain. In this paper, we successfully generate picosecond pulsed multi-photon Fock states (single-photon and two-photon states) in the C-band with Wigner negativities for the first time, which are verified by pulsed homodyne tomography. In our experimental setup, we utilize a single-pixel superconducting nanostrip photon-number-resolving detector (SNSPD), which is expected to facilitate the high-rate generation of various quantum states. This capability stems from the high temporal resolution of SNSPDs (several tens of picoseconds in our case and also in general) allowing us to increase the repetition frequency of pulsed light from the conventional MHz range to the GHz range, although in this experiment the repetition frequency is limited to 10 MHz due to the bandwidth of the homodyne detector. Consequently, our experimental setup is anticipated to serve as a prototype of a high-speed optical quantum state generator for ultrafast quantum information processing at telecommunication wavelength.

TI Micromotion-based DC sensing using continuously tracked trajectories of
   dipolar coupled nuclear spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We report an experimental approach to excite, stabilize, and continuously track Bloch sphere trajectories of dipolar-coupled nuclear spins in a solid. We demonstrate these capabilities on a model system of hyperpolarized C-13 nuclear spins in diamond. We elucidate a method to drive, and preserve, the motion of spins in complex three-dimensional trajectories for over T '(2)>27s even in the presence of interspin coupling. Indeed, without quantum control, interspin interactions lead to rapid spin decay in T*(2)approximate to 1.5ms. Furthermore, we show that the motion of the spins can be continuously tracked in three dimensions on the Bloch sphere for over 35s. During this time the spins complete >68000 closed precession orbits, exhibiting high stability and robustness against error. Leveraging these long-lived, robust spin trajectories we devise a novel nonequilibrium quantum sensing scheme for DC magnetic fields, based on micromotion dynamics, and without a static counterpart. Sensing here proceeds for the entire T '(2) period, orders of magnitude longer than T*(2), and operates in the dense sensor limit, yielding significant sensitivity improvements. Our results suggest new ways to stabilize and interrogate strongly coupled quantum systems through periodic driving and portend powerful applications of rigid spin orbits in quantum sensing.

TI On Advances of Anonymous Credentials-From Traditional to Post-Quantum
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Anonymous credential (AC) systems are privacy-preserving authentication mech-anisms that allow users to prove that they have valid credentials anonymously. These systems provide a powerful tool for several practical applications, such as anonymous pay-ment systems in e-commerce, preserving robust privacy protection for users. Most existing AC systems are constructed using traditional number-theoretic approaches, making them insecure under quantum attacks. With four decades of research in anonymous credential systems, there is a need for a comprehensive review that identifies the design structures of AC systems, organizes the research trends, and highlights unaddressed gaps for the future development of AC, especially bringing AC to post-quantum cryptography. This work is a complete study describing AC systems, as well as their architecture, components, security, and performance. Additionally, real-world implementations of various applications are identified, analyzed, and compared according to the design structure. Lastly, the challenges hindering the shift toward the quantumly secure lattice-based AC designs are discussed.

TI The Legendre pseudorandom function as a multivariate quadratic
   cryptosystem: security and applications
SO APPLICABLE ALGEBRA IN ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING
AB Sequences of consecutive Legendre and Jacobi symbols as pseudorandom bit generators were proposed for cryptographic use in 1988. Major interest has been shown towards pseudorandom functions (PRF) recently, based on the Legendre and power residue symbols, due to their efficiency in the multi-party setting. The security of these PRFs is not known to be reducible to standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we show that key-recovery attacks against the Legendre PRF are equivalent to solving a specific family of multivariate quadratic (MQ) equation system over a finite prime field. This new perspective sheds some light on the complexity of key-recovery attacks against the Legendre PRF. We conduct algebraic cryptanalysis on the resulting MQ instance. We show that the currently known techniques and attacks fall short in solving these sparse quadratic equation systems. Furthermore, we build novel cryptographic applications of the Legendre PRF, e.g., verifiable random function and (verifiable) oblivious (programmable) PRFs.

AB Small volume nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has recently made considerable progress due to rapid developments in the field of quantum sensing using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. These optically active defects in the diamond lattice have been used to probe unprecedented small volumes in the picoliter range with high spectral resolution. However, the NMR signal size depends strongly on both the diamond sensor's and sample's geometry. Using Monte-Carlo integration of sample spin dipole moments, the magnetic field projection along the orientation of the NV center for different geometries has been analyzed. We show that the NMR signal strongly depends on the NV-center's orientation with respect to the diamond surface. While the signal of currently used planar diamond sensors converges as a function of the sample volume, more optimal geometries lead to a logarithmically diverging signal. Finally, we simulate the expected signal for spherical, cylindrical and nearly-2D sample volumes, covering relevant geometries for interesting applications in NV-NMR such as singlecell biology or NV-based hyperpolarization. The results provide a guideline for NV-NMR spectroscopy of microscopic objects.

TI Adapting hybrid density functionals with machine learning
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Exact exchange contributions significantly affect electronic states, influencing covalent bond formation and breaking. Hybrid density functional approximations, which average exact exchange admixtures empirically, have achieved success but fall short of high-level quantum chemistry accuracy due to delocalization errors. We propose adaptive hybrid functionals, generating optimal exact exchange admixture ratios on the fly using data-efficient quantum machine learning models with negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid density functional (aPBE0) improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in QM9, QM7b, and GMTKN55 benchmark datasets. A model uncertainty-based constraint reduces the method smoothly to PBE0 in extrapolative regimes, ensuring general applicability with limited training. By tuning exact exchange fractions for different spin states, aPBE0 effectively addresses the spin gap problem in open-shell systems such as carbenes. We also present a revised QM9 (revQM9) dataset with more accurate quantum properties, including stronger covalent binding, larger bandgaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole moments.

TI Regression of Concurrence via Local Unitary Invariants
SO ENTROPY
AB Concurrence is a crucial entanglement measure in quantum theory used to describe the degree of entanglement between two or more qubits. Local unitary (LU) invariants can be employed to describe the relevant properties of quantum states. Compared to quantum state tomography, observing LU invariants can save substantial physical resources and reduce errors associated with tomography. In this paper, we use LU invariants as explanatory variables and employ methods such as multiple regression, tree models, and BP neural network models to fit the concurrence of 2-qubit quantum states. For pure states and Werner states, by analyzing the correlation between data, a functional formula for concurrence in terms of LU invariants is obtained. Additionally, for any two-qubit quantum states, the prediction accuracy for concurrence reaches 98.5%.

TI Columnar excitation fluorescence microscope for accurate evaluation of
   quantum properties of color centers in bulk materials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Color centers in wide band-gap semiconductors, which have superior quantum properties even at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, have been actively applied to quantum sensing devices. Characterizing the quantum properties of the color centers in the semiconductor materials and ensuring that these properties are uniform over a wide area are key issues for developing quantum sensing devices based on color centers. In this article, we have developed an optics design protocol optimized for evaluating the quantum properties of color centers and have used this design approach to develop a new microscopy system called columnar excitation fluorescence microscope (CEFM). The essence of this system is to maximize the amount of fluorescence detection of polarized color centers, which is achieved by large-volume and uniform laser excitation along the sample thickness with sufficient laser power density. This laser excitation technique prevents undesirable transitions to undesirable charge states and undesirable light, such as unpolarized color center fluorescence, while significantly increasing the color center fluorescence. This feature enables fast measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio, making it possible to evaluate the spatial distribution of quantum properties across an entire mm-size sample without using a darkroom, which is difficult with typical confocal microscope systems.

TI Autonomous generation of single photon emitting materials
SO NANOSCALE
AB The utilization of machine learning in Materials Science underscores the critical importance of the quality and quantity of data in training models effectively. Unlike fields such as image processing and natural language processing, there is limited availability of atomistic datasets, leading to biases in training data. Particularly in the domain of materials discovery, there exists an issue of continuity in atomistic datasets. Experimental data sourced from literature and patents is usually only available for favorable data, resulting in bias in the training dataset. This study focuses on developing a SMILES-based model for generating synthetic datasets of quantum materials using a variational autoencoder. This study centers on the generation of a synthetic dataset of quantum materials specifically for quantum sensing applications, with a focus on two-level quantum molecules that exhibit a dipole blockade. The proposed technique offers an improved sampling algorithm by incorporating newly generated data into the sampling algorithm to create a more normally distributed dataset. Through this technique, the study was able to generate over 1 000 000 candidate quantum materials from a small dataset of only 8000 materials. The generated dataset identified several iodine-containing molecules as promising single photon emitting materials for potential quantum sensing applications.

AB Lattice-based cryptography relies on generating random bases which are difficult to fully reduce. Given a lattice basis (such as the private basis for a cryptosystem), all other bases are related by multiplication by matrices in GL(n, Z). We compare the strengths of various methods to sample random elements of GL(n, Z), finding some are stronger than others with respect to the problem of recognizing rotations of the Z(n) lattice. In particular, the standard algorithm of multiplying unipotent generators together (as implemented in Magma's RandomSLnZ command) generates instances of this last problem which can be efficiently broken, even in dimensions nearing 1,500. Likewise, we find that the random basis generation method in one of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition submissions (DRS) generates instances which can be efficiently broken, even at its 256-bit security settings. Other random basis generation algorithms (some older, some newer) are described which appear to be much stronger.

TI Enhancing variational quantum classifier performance with meta-heuristic
   feature selection for credit card fraud detection
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB A transformative hybrid approach is proposed, combining Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with both traditional and meta-heuristic feature selection algorithms to overcome the complexities and limitations of conventional credit card fraud detection methods. In this study, advanced data balancing techniques such as SMOTE-ENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique-Edited Nearest Neighbors) and Random Under Sampler (RUS) are employed on the imbalanced European Cardholder Dataset to address class imbalance and enhance model resilience. Core feature selection algorithms-both traditional methods like K-Best and meta-heuristic techniques including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Atom Search Optimization (ASO)-are systematically evaluated, each paired with the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for classification. Remarkably, the PSO+VQC combination achieves an accuracy rate of 94.54%, underscoring the efficacy of integrating meta-heuristic algorithms with VQC to manage complex, high-dimensional data in fraud detection. These findings highlight QML and meta-heuristic algorithms' potential to surpass conventional methods, delivering superior accuracy and efficiency in critical, data-intensive applications such as financial fraud detection.

TI Experimental Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image
   Generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum machine learning is expected to be one of the first practical applications of near-term quantum devices. Pioneer theoretical works suggest that quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) may exhibit a potential exponential advantage over classical GANs, thus attracting widespread attention. However, it remains elusive whether quantum GANs implemented on near-term quantum devices can actually solve real-world learning tasks. Here, we devise a flexible quantum GAN scheme to narrow this knowledge gap. In principle, this scheme has the ability to complete image generation with high-dimensional features and could harness quantum superposition to train multiple examples in parallel. We experimentally achieve the learning and generating of real-world handwritten digit images on a superconducting quantum processor. Moreover, we utilize a gray-scale bar dataset to exhibit competitive performance between quantum GANs and the classical GANs based on multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures, respectively, benchmarked by the Frechet distance score. Our work provides guidance for developing advanced quantum generative models on near-term quantum devices and opens up an avenue for exploring quantum advantages in various GAN-related learning tasks.

TI Slow light topological photonics with counter-propagating waves and its
   active control on a chip
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological slow light exhibits potential to achieve stopped light by virtue of its widely known robust and non-reciprocal behaviours. Conventional approach for achieving topological slow light often involves flat-band engineering without disentangling the underlying physical mechanism. Here, we unveil the presence of counter-propagating waves within valley kink states as the distinctive hallmark of the slow light topological photonic waveguides. These counter-propagating waves, supported by topological vortices along glide-symmetric interface, provide significant flexibility for controlling the slowness of light. We tune the group velocity of light by changing the spatial separation between vortices adjacent to the glide-symmetric interface. We also dynamically control the group delay by introducing a non-Hermitian defect using photoexcitation to adjust the relative strength of the counter-propagating waves. This study introduces active slow light topological photonic device on a silicon chip, opening new horizons for topological photon transport through defects, topological light-matter interactions, nonlinear topological photonics, and topological quantum photonics.

TI Inferring work by quantum superposing forward and time-reversal
   evolutions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The study of thermodynamic fluctuations allows one to relate the free energy difference between two equilibrium states with the work done on a system through processes far from equilibrium. This finding plays a crucial role in the quantum regime, where the definition of work becomes nontrivial. Based on these relations, here we develop a simple interferometric method allowing a direct estimation of the work distribution and the average dissipative work during a driven thermodynamic process by superposing the forward and time-reversal evolutions of the process. We show that our scheme provides useful upper bounds on the average dissipative work even without full control over the thermodynamic process, and we propose methodological variations depending on the possible experimental limitations encountered. Finally, we exemplify its applicability by an experimental proposal for implementing our method on a quantum photonics system, on which the thermodynamic process is performed through polarization rotations induced by liquid crystals acting in a discrete temporal regime.

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Chaotic semiconductor lasers have been widely investigated for high-speed random bit generation, which is applied for the generation of cryptographic keys for classical and quantum cryptography systems. Here, we propose and demonstrate a self-chaotic microlaser with enhanced chaotic bandwidth for high-speed random bit generation. By designing tri-mode interaction in a deformed square microcavity laser, we realize a self-chaotic laser caused by two-mode internal interaction, and achieve an enhanced chaotic standard bandwidth due to the photon-photon resonance effect by introducing the third mode. Moreover, 500Gb/s random bit generation is realized and the randomness is verified by the NIST SP 800-22 statistics test. Our demonstration promises the applications of microlasers in secure communication, chaos radar, and optical reservoir computing, and also provides a platform for the investigations of multimode nonlinear laser dynamics.

This construction, which can be applied to any dagger rig category, is described in three steps, each associated with their own universal property, and draws on results from dilation theory in finite dimension. In this way, we explicitly construct the category that captures hybrid quantum/classical computation with possible nontermination from the category of its reversible foundations. We discuss how this construction can be used in the design and semantics of quantum programming languages.

TI Quantum-state estimation problem via optimal design of experiments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we study the quantum-state estimation problem in the framework of optimal design of experiments. We first find the optimal designs about arbitrary qubit models for popular optimality criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimal designs. We also give the one-parameter family of optimality criteria which includes these criteria. We then extend a classical result in the design problem, the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem, to a qubit system showing the D-optimal design which is equivalent to a certain type of the A-optimal design. We next compare and analyze several optimal designs based on the efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate that an optimal design for a certain criterion can be highly inefficient for other optimality criteria.

TI Defining the zerogap: cracking along the photolithographically defined
   Au-Cu-Au lines with sub-nanometer precision
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Cracks are formed along the photolithographically pre-determined lines with extremely high yield and repeatability, when Cu clusters are introduced between planarized Au thin films sequentially deposited on a PET substrate. These clusters act as nanometer-sized spacers preventing the formation of contiguous metallic bond between the adjacent Au layers which will render prepatterned-cracking impossible. While the effective gap width is initially zero in the optical sense from microwaves all the way to the visible, outer-bending the PET substrate allows the gap width tuning into the 100 nm range, with the stability and controllability in the ranges of 100 s and Angstrom-scale, respectively.

TI An Efficient Post-quantum Identity-Based Signature
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB Digital signature is one of the most important cryptography primitives. Recently, more and more works have been done to construct signatures over lattice problems to keep them secure in the quantum age. Among them, a ring-based signature scheme named Dilithium is the most efficient one and a candidate in the third round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's post-quantum cryptography project. To make those schemes work well in large network, we constructed the first ring-based Identity-based signature (IBS) scheme for light-weight authentication. The construction in this paper relies on the transformations introduced by Bellare et al. in Journal of Cryptology (Vol.22, No.1, pp.1-61, 2009) and its security can be proved under the hardness of ring-learning with errors problem in the random oracle model. Due to better trapdoor and polynomial ring setting, our proposed scheme are much better than the previous ones in terms of both computation and communication complexities.

TI Deterministic formation of carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Forming single-photon emitters (SPEs) in insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has sparked wide interests in the quantum photonics. Despite significant progress, it remains challenging to deterministically create SPEs at precise locations with a specific type of element for creating defects. In this study, we present a straightforward approach to generate site-deterministic carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hBN by harnessing ultrasonic nanoindentation. The obtained SPEs are high-quality and can be scaled up to large arrays in a single fabrication step. Comprehensive experimental analyses reveal that the insertion of carbon atoms into the hBN lattice is the source of the robust quantum emission. Complementary theoretical studies suggest possible candidates for the structural origin of the defects based on our experimental results. This rapid and scalable nanoindentation method provides a new way to create SPE arrays with specific types of atoms, enabling the comprehensive investigation of the origins and mechanics of SPE formations in two-dimensional (2D) materials and beyond.

TI Quantum-limited determination of refractive index difference by means of
   entanglement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Shaping single-mode operation in high-power fibers requires a precise knowledge of the gain-medium optical properties. This requires precise measurements of the refractive index differences (Delta n) between the core and the cladding of the fiber. We exploit a quantum optical method based on low-coherence Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry to perform practical measurements of the refractive index difference using broadband energy-time entangled photons. The precision enhancement reached with this method is benchmarked with a classical method based on single photon interferometry. We show in classical regime an improvement by an order of magnitude of the precision compared to already reported classical methods. Strikingly, in the quantum regime, we demonstrate an extra factor of 4 on the precision enhancement, exhibiting a state-of-the-art Delta n precision of 6 x 10(-7). This work sets the quantum photonics metrology as a powerful characterization tool that should enable a faster and reliable design of materials dedicated to light amplification.

TI Control of spectroscopic features of multiphoton transitions in two
   coupled qubits by driving fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum level population behavior of two coupled flux qubits depending on the external driving field characteristics is studied. Explicit expressions for the multiphoton transition probabilities at an arbitrary control field amplitude are obtained for the case of small tunnel splitting energies. We describe the controllable features of their formation and thereby the creation or destruction of entanglement on the direct interlevel transition and during the transition through intermediate states by system bias tuning. We found a feature of the qubit population inversion that results in the independence of the resonance positions from the qubit coupling strength. Using the Floquet-Markov equation, we numerically demonstrate that the positions of multiphoton resonances are stable to dissipative processes.

TI Approaching the Multiparameter Quantum Crame<acute accent>r-Rao Bound
   via Classical Correlation and Entangling Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multiparameter quantum metrology is essential for a wide range of practical applications. However, simultaneously achieving the ultimate precision for all parameters, as prescribed by the quantum Crame<acute accent>rRao bound (QCRB), remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a scheme termed local operation with entangling measurements (LOEM) strategy, which leverages classically correlated orthogonal pure states combined with entangling measurements to attain the multiparameter QCRB. We experimentally validate this scheme using a quantum photonic system. Additionally, we employ iterative interactions to demonstrate that the LOEM strategy can achieve the precision of Heisenberg scaling. By theoretically and experimentally demonstrating the saturation of the multiparameter QCRB with the LOEM strategy, our work advances the practical applications of quantum metrology in multiparameter estimation.

   dressed modes
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Making analogy with atomic physics is a powerful tool for photonic technology, witnessed by the recent development in topological photonics and non-Hermitian photonics based on parity-time symmetry. The Mollow triplet is a prominent atomic effect with both fundamental and technological importance. Here we demonstrate the analog of the Mollow triplet with quantum photonic systems. Photonic entanglement is generated with spontaneous nonlinear processes in dressed photonic modes, which are introduced through coherent multimode coupling. We further demonstrate the possibility of the photonic system to realize different configurations of dressed states, leading to modification of the Mollow triplet. Our work would enable the investigation of complex atomic processes and the realization of unique quantum functionalities based on photonic systems. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Exponentially Decreasing Critical Detection Efficiency for Any Bell
   Inequality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We address the problem of closing the detection efficiency loophole in Bell experiments, which is crucial for real-world applications. Every Bell inequality has a critical detection efficiency. that must be surpassed to avoid the detection loophole. Here, we propose a general method for reducing the critical detection efficiency of any Bell inequality to arbitrary low values. This is accomplished by entangling two particles in N orthogonal subspaces (e.g., N degrees of freedom) and conducting N Bell tests in parallel. Furthermore, the proposed method is based on the introduction of penalized N-product (PNP) Bell inequalities, for which the so-called simultaneous measurement loophole is closed, and the maximum value for local hidden-variable theories is simply the Nth power of the one of the Bell inequality initially considered. We show that, for the PNP Bell inequalities, the critical detection efficiency decays exponentially with N. The strength of our method is illustrated with a detailed study of the PNP Bell inequalities resulting from the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.

TI RADICAL ISOGENIES AND MODULAR CURVES
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB This article explores the connection between radical isogenies and modular curves. Radical isogenies are formulas designed for the computation of chains of isogenies of fixed small degree N, introduced by Castryck, Decru, and Vercauteren at Asiacrypt 2020. One significant advantage of radical isogeny formulas over other formulas with similar purpose is that they eliminate the need to generate a point of order N that generates the kernel of the isogeny. While radical isogeny formulas were originally developed using elliptic curves in Tate normal form, Onuki and Moriya have proposed radical isogeny formulas of degrees 3 and 4 on Montgomery curves and attempted to obtain a simpler form of radical isogenies using enhanced elliptic and modular curves. In this article, we translate the original setup of radical isogenies in Tate normal form into the language of modular curves. Additionally, we solve an open problem introduced by Onuki and Moriya regarding radical isogeny formulas on X0(N).

AB In this work, we present a high-performance architecture for Discrete Gaussian (DG) sampling used in lattice-based cryptography (LBC) through lookup table (LUT) optimization for the combinational datapath as well as FPGA architecture aware pipelining to reduce resource utilization and decrease latency. The proposed treesplitting technique translates the discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree for Knuth-Yao-based non-uniform sampling into a LUTbased logic with pipelined architecture. This allows a reduction in the area-time product (ATP) compared to the most efficient current state-of-the-art (SotA) designs for DG sampling with standard deviation,.. = 3.19/6.15543/8.5 by 96%/14%/56% on Virtex-7/Virtex6/Artix-7 FPGAs, while running at 709/580/440 MHz, respectively. The simplicity of the translation technique also allows us to automate the design flow, resulting in quick design-space exploration for different DG distributions.

AB The current certificate definition for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication does not support forward compatibility as it does not take migration toward Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into account. As a result, introducing PQC-compatible certificates in V2X can result in similar to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack to both legacy and PQC-ready vehicles. This situation will make the deployment of PQC certificates a stalemate situation. In addition, due to the larger public key and signature sizes in PQC algorithms, V2X message size will significantly increase, causing the channel capacity and effective transmission range to decrease. This situation will negatively impact the operation of V2X communication. In this sense, any unnecessary channel usages need to be avoided. We propose to revise the certificate definitions in IEEE 1609 and ETSI Intelligent Transport System (ITS) standards to address and mitigate these issues and pave the way for the migration toward PQC algorithm.

TI On Advances of Lattice-Based Cryptographic Schemes and Their

SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Lattice-based cryptography is centered around the hardness of problems on lattices. A lattice is a grid of points that stretches to infinity. With the development of quantum computers, existing cryptographic schemes are at risk because the underlying mathematical problems can, in theory, be easily solved by quantum computers. Since lattice-based mathematical problems are hard to be solved even by quantum computers, lattice-based cryptography is a promising foundation for future cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we focus on lattice-based public-key encryption schemes. This survey presents the current status of the lattice-based public-key encryption schemes and discusses the existing implementations. Our main focus is the learning with errors problem (LWE problem) and its implementations. In this paper, the plain lattice implementations and variants with special algebraic structures such as ring-based variants are discussed. Additionally, we describe a class of lattice-based functions called lattice trapdoors and their applications.

TI Enhanced fidelity in nonlinear structured light by virtual light-based

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Tailoring the degrees of freedom (DoF) of light for a desired purpose, so-called structured light, has delivered numerous advances over the past decade, ranging from communications and quantum cryptography to optical trapping and microscopy. The shaping toolkit has traditionally been linear in nature, only recently extended to the nonlinear regime, where input beams overlap in a nonlinear crystal to generate a structured output beam. Here we show how to enhance the fidelity of the structured output by aligning light with light. Using orbital angular momentum modes and difference frequency generation as an example, we demonstrate precise control of the spatial overlap in both the transverse and longitudinal directions using the structure of one mode as a virtual structured (in amplitude and phase) light-based aperture for the other. Our technique can easily be translated to other structured light fields as well as alternative nonlinear processes such as second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation, enabling advancements in communication, imaging, and spectroscopy.

SO PLOS ONE
AB CRYSTALS-Kyber has been standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a quantum-resistant algorithm in the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) competition. The bottleneck in performance of Kyber is the polynomial multiplication based on Number Theoretic transform (NTT). This work presents two parallel architectures adopting Multi-Path Delay Commutator (MDC) approach on target FPGA platform. Resource sharing technique is adopted to perform PWM operations using MDC NTT/INTT architecture. Moreover, we propose various optimizations at architectural level to minimize resource consumption such as FIFO-based memory units for buffering of input output coefficients, LUT-based modular multiplier and distributed-ROM memories for twiddle factor storage. The presented architectures are implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A100T-3 device using Vivado Design Suite 2022.2 and coded using Verilog HDL. Our BRAM and DSP-free designs achieve 68% improved area-time product with a comparable ATP for PWM operations. Additionally, the two-parallel MDC architecture outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, using 29% fewer resources.

TI Brillouin and Kerr nonlinearities of a low-index silicon oxynitride

SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear optical effects including stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and four-wave mixing (FWM) play an important role in microwave photonics, optical frequency combs, and quantum photonics. Harnessing SBS and FWM in a low-loss and versatile integrated platform would open the path to build large-scale Brillouin/Kerr-based photonic integrated circuits. In this letter, we investigate the Brillouin and Kerr properties of a low-index (n = 1.513 @ 1550 nm) silicon oxynitride (SiON) platform. We observed, for the first time, backward Brillouin scattering in SiON waveguides with a Brillouin gain coefficient of 0.3 m(-1) W-1, which can potentially be increased to 0.95 m(-1) W-1 by just tailoring the waveguide cross section. We also performed FWM experiments in SiON rings and obtained the nonlinear parameter ? of 0.02 m(-1) W-1. Our results point to a low-loss and low-index photonic integrated platform that is both Brillouin and Kerr active.

AB In this paper, we propose a practical signature scheme based on the alternating trilinear form equivalence problem. Our scheme is inspired by the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson's zero-knowledge protocol for graph isomorphism, and can be served as an alternative candidate for the NIST's post-quantum digital signatures.
   First, we present theoretical evidences to support its security, especially in the post-quantum cryptography context. The evidences are drawn from several research lines, including hidden subgroup problems, multivariate cryptography, cryptography based on group actions, the quantum random oracle model, and recent advances on isomorphism problems for algebraic structures in algorithms and complexity.
   Second, we demonstrate its potential for practical uses. Based on algorithm studies, we propose concrete parameter choices, and then implement a prototype. One concrete scheme achieves 128 bit security with public key size approximate to 4100 bytes, signature size approximate to 6800 bytes, and running times (key generation, sign, verify) approximate to 0.8ms on a common laptop computer.

TI Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPHOTONICS
AB We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques. In the chemical etching technique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% hydrofluoric acid solutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters of MNFs range from 0.34 to 1.4 mu m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of the pulled MNFs range from 0.48 to 0.53 mu m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.

TI Efficient and tunable blue light generation using lithium niobate
   nonlinear photonics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (LN) has recently emerged as a playground for chip-scale nonlinear optics and leads to efficient frequency conversions from near-infrared to near-visible bands. For many nonlinear and quantum photonics applications, it is desirable to operate deep into the visible band within LN's transparency window. However, the strong material dispersion at short wavelengths makes phase-matching difficult, necessitating sub-micrometer scale control of domain structures for efficient phase-matching. Here, we report the operation of thin film LN in the blue wavelength and high fidelity poling of the thin-film LN waveguide to this regime. As a result, quasi-phase matching is realized between IR (871 nm) and blue (435.5 nm) wavelengths in a straight waveguide and prompts strong blue light generation with a conversion efficiency (1040% & PLUSMN; 140%/W). This blue second harmonic generator exhibits stable temperature tunability, which is important for applications that require precise frequency alignment, such as atomic clocks.

TI Efficient Chromatic-Number-Based Multiqubit Decoherence and Crosstalk
   Suppression
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The performance of quantum computers is hindered by decoherence and crosstalk, which cause errors and limit the ability to perform long computations. Dynamical decoupling is a technique that alleviates these issues by applying carefully timed pulses to individual qubits, effectively suppressing unwanted interactions. However, as quantum devices grow in size, it becomes increasingly important to minimize the time required to implement dynamical decoupling across the entire system. Here, we present "chromatic Hadamard dynamical decoupling" (CHaDD), an approach that efficiently schedules dynamical decoupling pulses for quantum devices with arbitrary qubit connectivity. By leveraging Hadamard matrices, CHaDD achieves a circuit depth that scales linearly with the chromatic number of the connectivity graph for general two-qubit interactions, assuming instantaneous pulses. This includes ZZ crosstalk, which is prevalent in superconducting quantum processing units (QPUs). The scaling of CHaDD represents an exponential improvement over all previous multiqubit decoupling schemes for devices with connectivity graphs the chromatic number of which grows at most polylogarithmically with the number of qubits. For graphs with a constant chromatic number, the scaling of CHaDD is independent of the number of qubits. We report on experiments we have conducted using IBM QPUs that confirm the advantage conferred by CHaDD. Our results suggest that CHaDD can become a useful tool for enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum computers by efficiently suppressing decoherence and crosstalk across large qubit arrays.

TI Design optimization for manufacturing polymer microring lasers: Focus on
   surface scattering losses
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface roughness scattering significantly affects the performance of microcavity lasers by influencing various design parameters. This study focuses on the design and fabrication of polymer-based microcavity lasers to achieve optimal specifications. We employed femtosecond direct laser writing on SU-8 films doped with Rhodamine B dye. Key parameters, including size, quality factor, mode volume, filling factor, and losses (bending and surface scattering), were theoretically analyzed. We specifically investigated the impact of sidewall roughness-induced scattering loss on polymer microring lasers, validating our findings through simulations and experimental characterization. Assuming a surface roughness of less than 10 nm, we designed and fabricated a single-mode double microring laser with radii of 30 mu m and 32 mu m, featuring a waveguide cross-sectional area of 1 x 2 mu m 2 . These high-performance single-mode lasers have potential applications in optical sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photonics.

TI Enhancing Quantum Cryptanalysis of Binary Elliptic Curves Through
   Optimized Out-of-Place Point Addition and ECPM Integration
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Shor's algorithm remains a cornerstone of quantum cryptanalysis, driving active research into reducing quantum resource overheads in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This work presents a dual-optimization framework targeting resource-efficient Shor-based quantum cryptanalysis on binary elliptic curves. Our approach conducts a comprehensive resource assessment across multiple abstraction levels-ranging from finite field arithmetic to elliptic curve group operations. At the low-level layer, we benchmark various quantum arithmetic constructor designs-including GCD-based, FLT-based, FLT-Basic or extended variants, in-place, and out-of-place execution models-analyzing Toffoli gate counts, qubit requirements, and circuit depths. At the group operation layer, we examine point addition and doubling circuits, employing complete iterations of Shor's algorithm with elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM) that require point addition (PA) only (with (2n + 2) PA) and point doubling (PD) utilization (2n PD + 2 PA). We further simulate selected (2n PD +2 PA(outplace)) circuit designs, highlighting the advantages of optimized out-of-place PA circuits and integrated ECPM techniques from prior work. Additionally, we explore decompositions of multi-controlled gates to achieve a practical trade-off between qubit count and overall depth.

TI Self-testing tilted strategies for maximal loophole-free nonlocality
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The degree of experimentally attainable nonlocality, as gauged by the loophole-free or effective violation of Bell inequalities, remains severely limited due to inefficient detectors. We address an experimentally motivated question: Which quantum strategies attain the maximal loophole-free nonlocality in the presence of inefficient detectors? For any Bell inequality and any specification of detection efficiencies, the optimal strategies are those that maximally violate a tilted version of the Bell inequality in ideal conditions. In the simplest scenario, we demonstrate that the quantum strategies that maximally violate the doubly-tilted versions of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality are unique up to local isometries. We utilize a Jordan's lemma and Gr & ouml;bner basis-based proof technique to analytically derive self-testing statements for the entire family of doubly-tilted CHSH inequalities and numerically demonstrate their robustness. These results enable us to reveal the insufficiency of even high levels of the Navascu & eacute;s-Pironio-Ac & iacute;n hierarchy to saturate the maximum quantum violation of these inequalities.

AB The MPC in the Head (MPCitH) paradigm has recently led to significant improvements for signatures in the code-based setting. In this paper we consider some modifications to a recent twist of MPCitH, called Hypercube-MPCitH, that in the code-based setting provides the currently best known signature sizes. By compressing the Hypercube-MPCitH five-round code-based identification scheme into three-rounds we obtain two main benefits. On the one hand, it allows us to further develop recent techniques to provide a tight security proof in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM), avoiding the catastrophic reduction losses incurred using generic QROM-results for Fiat-Shamir. On the other hand, we can reduce the already low-cost online part of the signature even further. In addition, we propose the use of proof-of-work techniques that allow to reduce the signature size. On the technical side, we develop generalizations of several QROM proof techniques and introduce a variant of the recently proposed extractable QROM.

TI Hash-based signature revisited
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The current development toward quantum attack has shocked our confidence on classical digital signature schemes. As one of the mainstreams of post quantum cryptography primitives, hash-based signature has attracted more and more concern in both cryptographic research and application in recent years. The goal of this paper is to present, classify and discuss different solutions for hash-based signature. Firstly, this paper discusses the research progress in the component of hash-based signature, i.e., one-time signature and few-time signature; then classifies the tree-based public key authentication schemes of hash-based signature into limited number and stateful schemes, unlimited number and stateful schemes and unlimited number and stateless schemes. The above discussion aims to analyze the overall design idea of different categories of hash-based signatures, as well as the construction, security reduction and performance efficiency of specific schemes. Finally, the perspectives and possible development directions of hash-based signature are briefly discussed.

TI General quantum secure multiparty computation protocol for simultaneous
   summation and multiplication
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum secure multiparty computation occupies an important place in quantum cryptography. Based on access structure and linear secret sharing, we propose a new general quantum secure multiparty computation protocol for simultaneous summation and multiplication in a high-dimensional quantum system. In our protocol, each participant within any authorized sets only needs to perform local Pauli operation once on the generalized Bell state, then the summation and multiplication results can be output simultaneously, which improves the practicality of the protocol. Moreover, in the privacy computation phase, the decoy particle detection technique as well as the addition of random numbers are applied to blind the privacy information, making our protocol higher privacy protection. Security analysis shows that our protocol is resistant to a series of typical external attacks and dishonest internal participant attacks such as individual attack and collusion attack. Finally, compared with the existing protocols, our protocol not only has higher efficiency but also lower consumption.

Here, we study two-photon interference in multiple transverse-spatial modes along a single beam-path. Besides implementing the analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference using a two-dimensional spatial-mode splitter, we extend the scheme to observe coalescence and anticoalescence in different three- and four-dimensional spatial-mode multiports. The operation within spatial modes, along a single beam path, lifts the requirement for interferometric stability and opens up new pathways of implementing linear optical networks for complex quantum information tasks.

TI Equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states with the repeated
   interaction protocol: relaxation dynamics and energetic cost
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the dynamics of a qubit system interacting with thermalized bath-ancilla spins via a repeated interaction scheme. Considering generic initial conditions for the system and employing a Heisenberg-type interaction between the system and the ancillas, we analytically prove the following: (i) the populations and coherences of the qubit system evolve independently toward a nonequilibrium steady-state solution, which is diagonal in the qubit's energy eigenbasis. The population relaxes to this state geometrically, whereas the coherences decay through a more compound behavior. (ii) In the long time limit, the system approaches a steady state that generally differs from the thermal state of the ancilla. We derive this steady-state solution and show its dependence on the interaction parameters and collision frequency. (iii) We bound the number of interaction steps required to achieve the steady state within a specified error tolerance, and we evaluate the energetic cost associated with the process. Our key finding is that deterministic system-ancilla interactions do not typically result in the system thermalizing to the thermal state of the ancilla. Instead, they generate a distinct nonequilibrium steady state, which we explicitly derive. However, we also identify an operational regime that leads to thermalization with a few long and possibly randomized collisions.

AB A noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) performs the highest-quality amplification allowable under the rules of quantum physics. Unfortunately, these same rules conspire against us via the no-cloning theorem, which constrains NLA operations to the domain of probabilistic processes. Nevertheless, they are useful for a wide variety of quantum protocols, with numerous proposals assuming access to an optimal NLA device that performs with the maximum possible success probability. Here we propose the first linear-optics NLA protocol that asymptotically achieves this success probability bound by modifying the Knill-LaflammeMilburn near-deterministic teleporter into an amplifier.

AB In the context of post-quantum secure algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber, the importance of protecting sensitive polynomial coefficients from side-channel attacks is increasingly recognized. Our research introduces two alternative masking methods to enhance the security of the compression function in Kyber through masking. Prior to this, the topic had been addressed by only one other research study. The "Double and Check" method integrates arithmetic sharing and symmetry adjustments, introducing a layer of obfuscation by determining coefficient values based on modular overflows. In contrast, the Look-Up-Table (LUT) integration method employs arithmetic-to-Boolean conversions, augmented by a pre-computed table for efficient value verifications. Furthermore, by leveraging the alternative prime 7681, we propose a novel masked compression function. This prime, 7681, is also notable as the smallest prime suitable for fast NTT multiplication. While both algorithms prioritize data protection and streamlined processing, they also underscore the inherent challenges of balancing computational speed with the potential vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks.

TI Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for energy transport in a transient
   regime: A model study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We investigate a transient version of the recently discovered thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) which provides a precision-cost trade-off relation for certain out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic observables in terms of net entropy production. We explore this relation in the context of energy transport in a bipartite setting for three exactly solvable toy model systems (two coupled harmonic oscillators, two coupled qubits, and a hybrid coupled oscillator-qubit system) and analyze the role played by the underlying statistics of the transport carriers in the TUR. Interestingly, for all these models, depending on the statistics, the TUR ratio can be expressed as a sum or a difference of a universal term which is always greater than or equal to 2 and a corresponding entropy production term. We find that the generalized version of the TUR, originating from the universal fluctuation symmetry, is always satisfied. However, interestingly, the specialized TUR, a tighter bound, is always satisfied for the coupled harmonic oscillator system obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Whereas, for both the coupled qubit, obeying Fermi-like statistics, and the hybrid qubit-oscillator system with mixed Fermi-Bose statistics, violation of the tighter bound is observed in certain parameter regimes. We have provided conditions for such violations. We also provide a rigorous proof following the nonequilibrium Green's function approach that the tighter bound is always satisfied in the weak-coupling regime for generic bipartite systems.

TI On Multiple Encryption for Public-Key Cryptography
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Using multiple, individual encryption schemes is a well-established method to increase the overall security of encrypted data. These so-called multiple encryption or hybrid schemes have regained traction in the context of public-key cryptography due to the rise of quantum computers, since it allows the combination of well-known classical encryption schemes with novel post-quantum schemes. In this paper, we conduct a survey of the state-of-the-art public-key multiple encryption (M-PKE) schemes. For the first time, we describe the most relevant M-PKE schemes in detail and discuss their security in a unified model, which allows better comparison between the schemes. Hence, we compare the security, efficiency, and complexity of the schemes and offer recommendations for usage based on common use cases. Our survey emphasizes the importance of being deliberate when combining encryption schemes, as small nuances can easily break security.

TI Widely non-degenerate nonlinear frequency conversion in cryogenic
   titanium in-diffused lithium niobate waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The titanium in-diffused lithium niobate waveguide platform is well-established for reliable prototyping and packaging of many quantum photonic components at room temperature. Nevertheless, compatibility with certain quantum light sources and superconducting detectors requires operation under cryogenic conditions. We characterize alterations in phase-matching and mode guiding of a non-degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion process emitting around 1556 nm and 950 nm, under cryogenic conditions. Despite the effects of pyroelectricity and photorefraction, the spectral properties match our theoretical model. Nevertheless, these effects cause small but significant variations within and between cooling cycles. These measurements provide a first benchmark against which other nonlinear photonic integration platforms, such as thin-film lithium niobate, can be compared.

SO SOFTWAREX
AB We introduce PyQBench, an innovative open-source framework for benchmarking gate-based quantum computers. PyQBench can benchmark NISQ devices by verifying their capability of discriminating between two von Neumann measurements. PyQBench offers a simplified, ready-to-use, command line interface (CLI) for running benchmarks using a predefined family of measurements. For more advanced scenarios, PyQBench offers a way of employing user-defined measurements instead of predefined ones.

TI Optimization of In-Situ Growth of Superconducting Al/InAs Hybrid Systems
   on GaAs for the Development of Quantum Electronic Circuits
SO MATERIALS
AB Hybrid systems consisting of highly transparent channels of low-dimensional semiconductors between superconducting elements allow the formation of quantum electronic circuits. Therefore, they are among the novel material platforms that could pave the way for scalable quantum computation. To this aim, InAs two-dimensional electron gases are among the ideal semiconductor systems due to their vanishing Schottky barrier; however, their exploitation is limited by the unavailability of commercial lattice-matched substrates. We show that in situ growth of superconducting aluminum on two-dimensional electron gases forming in metamorphic near-surface InAs quantum wells can be performed by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates with state-of-the-art quality. Adaptation of the metamorphic growth protocol has allowed us to reach low-temperature electron mobilities up to 1.3 x 105 cm2/Vs in Si-doped InAs/In0.81Ga0.19As two-dimensional electron gases placed 10 nm from the surface with charge density up to 1 x 1012/cm2. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations on Hall bar structures show well-developed quantum Hall plateaus, including the Zeeman split features. X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy experiments demonstrate the coexistence of (011) and (111) crystal domains in the Al layers. The resistivity of 10-nm-thick Al films as a function of temperature was comparable to the best Al layers on GaAs, and a superconducting proximity effect was observed in a Josephson junction.

TI Philosophy of Polarization-Path Entanglement in Quantum Optics
SO OPTICS
AB This paper explores the formal structure and philosophical implications of polarization-path entanglement in quantum optics, where different degrees of freedom of a single photon become entangled. We examine the mathematical conditions under which coherence is preserved or lost, emphasizing the role of distinguishability and information flow. The analysis is situated within major interpretational frameworks (including Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, QBism, and Bohmian mechanics) to evaluate whether such entanglement reflects physical reality or epistemic constraints. Finally, we discuss experimental realizations, relevance to quantum information processing, and open conceptual questions regarding the ontological status of single-particle entanglement.

TI Heating of a Trapped Ion Induced by Dielectric Materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electric-field noise due to surfaces disturbs the motion of nearby trapped ions, compromising the fidelity of gate operations that are the basis for quantum computing algorithms. We present a method that predicts the effect of dielectric materials on the ion's motion. Such dielectrics are integral components of ion traps. Quantitative agreement is found between a model with no free parameters and measurements of a trapped ion in proximity to dielectric mirrors. We expect that this approach can be used to optimize the design of ion-trap-based quantum computers and network nodes.

The GAS algorithm has been prove to achieve quadratic acceleration in the Constrained Polynomial Binary Optimization (CPBO) problem. Nevertheless, the acceleration effect of the GAS algorithm can be decreased by the poor threshold selection. This article uses the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to improve the initial threshold selection, thereby accelerating the convergence speed of the original GAS algorithm. The acceleration effect of the improved GAS algorithm is presented by the Max-Cut problem and the CPBO problem.

TI Scalable on-chip multiplexing of silicon single and double quantum dots
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Owing to the maturity of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) microelectronics, qubits realized with spins in silicon quantum dots (QDs) are considered among the most promising technologies for building scalable quantum computers. For this goal, ultra-low-power on-chip cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics for control, read-out, and interfacing of the qubits is an important milestone. We report on-chip interfacing of tunable electron and hole QDs by a 64-channel cryo-CMOS multiplexer with less-than-detectable static power dissipation. We analyze charge noise and measure state-of-the-art addition energies and gate lever arm parameters in the QDs. We correlate low noise in QDs and sharp turn-on characteristics in cryogenic transistors, both fabricated with the same gate stack. Finally, we demonstrate that our hybrid quantum-CMOS technology provides a route to scalable interfacing of a large number of QD devices, enabling, for example, variability analysis and QD qubit geometry optimization, which are prerequisites for building large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.
   The integration of quantum dot spin qubits and classical cryogenic microelectronics is important for scaling up silicon-based quantum computers. The authors show that their silicon technology tailored for low-power electronics and low-noise quantum dots enables the integration of classical multiplexers and quantum dot spin qubit devices on the same chip.

TI A Novel Variant of the Salp Swarm Algorithm for Engineering Optimization
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING RESEARCH
AB There are many design problems need to be optimized in various fields of engineering, and most of them belong to the NP-hard problem. The meta-heuristic algorithm is one kind of optimization method and provides an effective way to solve the NP-hard problem. Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a nature-inspired algorithm that mimics and mathematically models the behavior of slap swarm in nature. However, similar to most of the meta-heuristic algorithms, the traditional SSA has some shortcomings, such as entrapment in local optima. In this paper, the three main strategies are adopted to strengthen the basic SSA, including chaos theory, sine-cosine mechanism and the principle of quantum computation. Therefore, the SSA variant is proposed in this research, namely SCQ-SSA. The representative benchmark functions are employed to test the performances of the algorithms. The SCQ-SSA are compared with the seven algorithms in high-dimensional functions (1000 dimensions), seven SSA variants and six advanced variants on benchmark functions, the experiment reveals that the SCQ-SSA enhances resulting precision and alleviates local optimal problems. Besides, the SCQ-SSA is applied to resolve three classical engineering problems: tubular column design problem, tension/compression spring design problem and pressure vessel design problem. The design results indicate that these engineering problems are optimized with high accuracy and superiority by the improved SSA. The source code is available in the URL: .

TI Electroabsorption in gated GaAs nanophotonic waveguides
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report on the analysis of electroabsorption in thin GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As nanophotonic waveguides with an embedded p-i-n junction. By measuring the transmission through waveguides of different lengths, we derive the propagation loss as a function of electric field, wavelength, and temperature. The results are in good agreement with the Franz-Keldysh model of electroabsorption extending over 200meV below the GaAs bandgap, i.e., in the wavelength range of 910-970nm. We find a pronounced residual absorption in forward bias, which we attribute to Fermi-level pinning at the waveguide surface, producing over 20dB/mm loss at room temperature. These results are essential for understanding the origin of loss in nanophotonic devices operating in the emission range of self-assembled InAs semiconductor quantum dots toward the realization of scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits.

TI Control of chiral orbital currents in a colossal magnetoresistance
   material
SO NATURE
AB Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an extraordinary enhancement of the electrical conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. It is conventionally associated with a field-induced spin polarization that drastically reduces spin scattering and electric resistance. Ferrimagnetic Mn3Si2Te6 is an intriguing exception to this rule: it exhibits a seven-order-of-magnitude reduction in ab plane resistivity that occurs only when a magnetic polarization is avoided(1,2). Here, we report an exotic quantum state that is driven by ab plane chiral orbital currents (COC) flowing along edges of MnTe6 octahedra. The c axis orbital moments of ab plane COC couple to the ferrimagnetic Mn spins to drastically increase the ab plane conductivity (CMR) when an external magnetic field is aligned along the magnetic hard c axis. Consequently, COC-driven CMR is highly susceptible to small direct currents exceeding a critical threshold, and can induce a time-dependent, bistable switching that mimics a first-order 'melting transition' that is a hallmark of the COC state. The demonstrated current-control of COC-enabled CMR offers a new paradigm for quantum technologies.

AB We consider the use of quantum-limited mechanical force sensors to detect ultralight (sub-meV) dark matter (DM) candidates which are weakly coupled to the standard model. We show that mechanical sensors with masses around or below the milligram scale, operating around the standard quantum limit, would enable novel searches for DM with natural frequencies around the kHz scale. This would complement existing strategies based on torsion balances, atom interferometers, and atomic clock systems.

We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications to Hamiltonian downfolding in quantum computing and Heisenberg dynamics.

TI Experimental quantum e-commerce
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB E-commerce, a type of trading that occurs at a high frequency on the internet, requires guaranteeing the integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation of messages through long distance. As current e-commerce schemes are vulnerable to computational attacks, quantum cryptography, ensuring information-theoretic security against adversary's repudiation and forgery, provides a solution to this problem. However, quantum solutions generally have much lower performance compared to classical ones. Besides, when considering imperfect devices, the performance of quantum schemes exhibits a notable decline. Here, we demonstrate the whole e-commerce process of involving the signing of a contract and payment among three parties by proposing a quantum e-commerce scheme, which shows resistance of attacks from imperfect devices. Results show that with a maximum attenuation of 25 dB among participants, our scheme can achieve a signature rate of 0.82 times per second for an agreement size of approximately 0.428 megabit. This proposed scheme presents a promising solution for providing information-theoretic security for e-commerce.

TI Catalytic transformations with finite-size environments: applications to
   cooling and thermometry
SO QUANTUM
AB The laws of thermodynamics are usually formulated under the assumption of infinitely large environments. While this idealization facilitates theoretical treatments, real physical systems are always finite and their interaction range is limited. These constraints have consequences for important tasks such as cooling, not directly captured by the second law of thermodynamics. Here, we study catalytic transformations that cannot be achieved when a system exclusively interacts with a finite environment. Our core result consists of constructive conditions for these transformations, which include the corresponding global unitary operation and the explicit states of all the systems involved. From this result we present various findings regarding the use of catalysts for cooling. First, we show that catalytic cooling is always possible if the dimension of the catalyst is sufficiently large. In particular, the cooling of a qubit using a hot qubit can be maximized with a catalyst as small as a three-level system. We also identify catalytic enhancements for tasks whose implementation is possible without a catalyst. For example, we find that in a multiqubit setup catalytic cooling based on a three-body interaction outperforms standard (non-catalytic) cooling using higher order interactions. Another advantage is illustrated in a thermometry scenario, where a qubit is employed to probe the temperature of the environment. In this case, we show that a catalyst allows to surpass the optimal temperature estimation attained only with the probe.

AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has unavoidable noises, and crosstalk error is a significant error source. When multiple quantum operations are executed simultaneously, the quantum state can be corrupted due to the crosstalk between gates during simultaneous operations, decreasing the circuit fidelity. In this work, we first report on several protocols for characterizing crosstalk. Then, we discuss different crosstalk mitigation methods from the hardware and software perspectives. Finally, we perform crosstalk injection experiments on the IBM quantum device and demonstrate the fidelity improvement with the crosstalk mitigation method.

This highlights a connection between unital and catalytic channels, and some subtleties concerning the conditional work cost of implementing a measurement given that a certain result was obtained. We also consider postselected measurements and show that any nontrivial postselection leads to an unbounded work benefit.

This paper presents a sophisticated analytical model of the MOSFET subthreshold current at cryogenic temperatures, accounting for the thermionic, hopping, source-to-drain tunneling transports, and the Gaussian-distributed interface traps to bridge the gap. Hopping and source-to-drain tunneling transports can co-exist in the subthreshold regime, leading to subthreshold saturation strongly correlated to channel length and drain voltages.

TI DARQ Technology as a Digital Transformation Strategy in Terms of Global
   Crises
SO PROBLEMY ZARZADZANIA-MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AB Purpose: The aim of the paper is (1) to analyze the DARQ (Distributed ledger, Artificial Intelligence, Extended Reality, Quantum Computing) technology in terms of its implementations and (2) to compare these technologies with the SMAC technology (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud). We present the thesis that DARQ technologies can help in building information systems aimed at both predicting and monitoring global crises. We argue that the DARQ technology will support the management of network organizations in the first period of development.
   Design/methodology/approach: The research procedure consists of the following steps: literature analysis, conducting qualitative research and its presentation, obtaining expert opinions and recommendations for further research. Findings: The results of work on the DARQ technology that supports management systems allowed for the evaluation of usability both in terms of the expected effects and the areas of risk of application.
   Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of practical applications of all the elements that make up the DARQ technology, the analysis of such components as Extended Reality (Virtual Reality), Quantum Computing (Virtual Computing Technology) is not complete and requires complementary research and a more complete analysis of its applications. We consider the presented work as an introduction to broader research.
   Originality/value: The thesis has been substantiated that the transition from SMAC to DARQ technology can be done gradually. Both of these technologies are compatible. This may result in gradual and collision-free changes in the quality of the management system. Elements of the new DARQ technology, such as Distributed ledger, Artificial Intelligence, Extended Reality and Quantum computing, allow for abrupt changes in both the management system and the functioning of the organization. Already today, each component of the DARQ technology has a significant impact on various sectors of the economy. However, it should be noted that apart from the positives, the DARQ technology also poses some threats. The article contains conclusions from the research and indicates a recommendation for further work, which concerns extending the application of DARQ technology to predict and monitor disasters and unpredictable events. To this end, we analyze the Black Swan theory (based on the COVID-19 pandemic case study) as the theoretical framework for the use of DARQ technology as a tool to reduce the occurrence of unpredictable events.

We derive these properties analytically and demonstrate them in semiclassical time-domain laser simulations. We then utilize these waveforms to expand other waveforms with high modulation frequencies and demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of complex-frequency coherent absorption at optical frequencies, with efficient energy transduction and cavity loading. This approach has potential applications in quantum computing, photonic circuits, and biomedicine.

TI Optimal strategy to certify quantum nonlocality
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Certification of quantum nonlocality plays a central role in practical applications like device-independent quantum cryptography and random number generation protocols. These applications entail the challenging problem of certifying quantum nonlocality, something that is hard to achieve when the target quantum state is only weakly entangled, or when the source of errors is high, e.g. when photons propagate through the atmosphere or a long optical fiber. Here we introduce a technique to find a Bell inequality with the largest possible gap between the quantum prediction and the classical local hidden variable limit for a given set of measurement frequencies. Our method represents an efficient strategy to certify quantum nonlocal correlations from experimental data without requiring extra measurements, in the sense that there is no Bell inequality with a larger gap than the one provided. Furthermore, we also reduce the photodetector efficiency required to close the detection loophole. We illustrate our technique by improving the detection of quantum nonlocality from experimental data obtained with weakly entangled photons.

TI Large-scale surface hopping simulation of charge transport in hexagonal
   molecular crystals: role of electronic coupling signs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB In large-scale surface hopping simulations with a huge number of electronic states, trivial crossings could easily lead to incorrect long-range charge transfer and induce large numerical errors. We here study the charge transport in two-dimensional hexagonal molecular crystals with a parameter-free full crossing corrected global flux surface hopping method. Fast time-step size convergence and system size independence have been realized in large systems containing thousands of molecular sites. In hexagonal systems, each molecular site has six nearest neighbours. We find that the signs of their electronic couplings have a strong impact on the charge mobility and delocalization strength. In particular, changing the signs of electronic couplings can even lead to a transition from hopping to band-like transport. In comparison, such phenomena cannot be observed in extensively studied two-dimensional square systems. This is attributed to symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian and distribution of the energy levels. Due to its high performance, the proposed approach is promising to be applied to more realistic and complex systems for molecular design.

TI Boosting classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der
   Waals materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Understanding and controlling nonlinear processes is crucial for engineering light-matter interaction and generating non-classical light. A significant challenge in ultra-thin nonlinear materials is the marked diminution of the nonlinear conversion efficiency due to the reduced light-matter interaction length and, in many cases, the centrosymmetric crystalline structures. Here we relax these limitations and report a giant boost of classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials. Specifically, with a metal-nonlinear material heterostructure we enhance classical second-harmonic generation in h-BN flakes by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we have engineered a metal-SiO2-nonlinear material heterostructure resulting in a remarkable two orders of magnitude augmentation of the quantum spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in NbOCl2 flakes. Notably, we demonstrate SPDC in a 16 nm-thick NbOCl2 flake integrated into the proposed structure. These findings simplify on-chip quantum state engineering and accelerate the use of van der Waals materials in nonlinear optoelectronics.

This contribution studies the structure of EWs. Exploiting the very concept of mirrored EWs, increasing the detection power, we show, in contrast to the conjecture in a recent paper (Bera et al. in Sci Rep 13:10733, 2023), there exist pairs of optimal EWs, which are both non-decomposible, i.e. can detect bound/PPT-entangled states in an optimal way. Since we show that the structure also extends to higher dimensions, our results reveal a further structure of entanglement witnesses.

TI Polarization-entangled photon pairs with factorable spectra engineered
   by using an uneven four-stage nonlinear interferometer
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB We report the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs in the 1550 nm band by pumping an uneven nonlinear interferometer loop with two orthogonally polarized counterpropagating pump pulses. The uneven nonlinear interferometer, providing a more ideal interference pattern due to the elimination of secondary maxima, consists of four pieces of dispersion-shifted fibers sandwiched with three pieces of standard single-mode fibers, and the lengths of the nonlinear fibers follow the binomial distribution. The mode number of the photon pairs deduced from the measured joint spectrum is similar to 1.03. The collection efficiency of the photon pairs is found to be similar to 94% (after background noise correction). The directly measured visibility of two-photon interference of the polarization-entangled photon pairs is similar to 92%, while no interference is observed in the direct detection of either the signal or idler photons.

TI Quantum Optics as Applied Quantum Electrodynamics is Back in Town
SO ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A
AB We start this short note by remembering the beginnings of the Warsaw School of Quantum Optics, evidently stimulated by Iwo Bialynicki-Birula at the Warsaw University, and then Centre for Theoretical Physics of Polish Academy of Sciences and Adam Kujawski and Zofia Bialynicka-Birula at the Institute of Physics of Polish Academy of Sciences. In the theoretical approaches of the Warsaw School, quantum field theory was always present, and quantum optics was considered to be applied quantum electrodynamics. All of us who grew up in this fantastic community have carried and are still carrying the gospel to others. In particular, now quantum electrodynamics began her run on the red carpet of super intense laser-matter interactions, attosecond physics, and ultrafast laser physics in general. We will elaborate on the recent progress in this direction and on the open questions for future investigations. This paper celebrates the 90th birthday of Professor Iwo Bialynicki-Birula, our quantum electrodynamics guru!

TI Conceptual Understanding through Efficient Automated Design of Quantum
   Optical Experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially disruptive tool for physics and science in general. One crucial question is how this technology can contribute at a conceptual level to help acquire new scientific understanding. Scientists have used AI techniques to rediscover previously known concepts. So far, no examples of that kind have been reported that are applied to open problems for getting new scientific concepts and ideas. Here, we present THESEUS, an algorithm that can provide new conceptual understanding, and we demonstrate its applications in the field of experimental quantum optics. To do so, we make four crucial contributions. (i) We introduce a graph-based representation of quantum optical experiments that can be interpreted and used algorithmically. (ii) We develop an automated design approach for new quantum experiments, which is orders of magnitude faster than the best previous algorithms at concrete design tasks for experimental configuration. (iii) We solve several crucial open questions in experimental quantum optics which involve practical blueprints of resource states in photonic quantum technology and quantum states and transformations that allow for new foundational quantum experiments. Finally, and most importantly, (iv) the interpretable representation and enormous speed-up allow us to produce solutions that a human scientist can interpret and gain new scientific concepts from outright. We anticipate that THESEUS will become an essential tool in quantum optics for developing new experiments and photonic hardware. It can further be generalized to answer open questions and provide new concepts in a large number of other quantum physical questions beyond quantum optical experiments. THESEUS is a demonstration of explainable AI (XAI) in physics that shows how AI algorithms can contribute to science on a conceptual level.

TI Engineering multipartite coupling in doubly pumped parametric
   down-conversion processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the quantum state generated by optical parametric down-conversion in a chi((2)) medium driven by two noncollinear light modes. The analysis shows the emergence of multimode, namely, three- or four-mode, entangled states in a subset of the spatiotemporal modes generated by the process. These appear as bright spots against the background fluorescence, providing an interesting analogy with the phenomenology recently observed in two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals. We study two realistic setups. (1) Noncritical phase matching in a periodically poled lithium tantalate slab, characterized by a three-mode entangled state. (2) A type I setup in a beta-barium borate crystal, where the spatial walk-off between the two pumps can be exploited to make a transition to a four-mode entangled state. In both cases, we show that the properties of the state can be controlled by modulating the relative intensity of two pump waves, making the device a versatile tool for quantum state engineering.

TI Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated
   errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Error-corrected quantum computers can only work if errors are small and uncorrelated. Here, I show how cosmic rays or stray background radiation affects superconducting qubits by modeling the phonon to electron/quasiparticle down-conversion physics. For present designs, the model predicts about 57% of the radiation energy breaks Cooper pairs into quasiparticles, which then vigorously suppress the qubit energy relaxation time (T-1 similar to 600 ns) over a large area (cm) and for a long time (ms). Such large and correlated decay kills error correction. Using this quantitative model, I show how this energy can be channeled away from the qubit so that this error mechanism can be reduced by many orders of magnitude. I also comment on how this affects other solid-state qubits.

TI Prospects of Nanoscience with Nanocrystals: 2025 Edition
SO ACS NANO
AB Nanocrystals (NCs) of various compositions have made important contributions to science and technology, with their impact recognized by the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery and synthesis of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Over four decades of research into NCs has led to numerous advancements in diverse fields, such as optoelectronics, catalysis, energy, medicine, and recently, quantum information and computing. The last 10 years since the predecessor perspective "Prospect of Nanoscience with Nanocrystals" was published in ACS Nano have seen NC research continuously evolve, yielding critical advances in fundamental understanding and practical applications. Mechanistic insights into NC formation have translated into precision control over NC size, shape, and composition. Emerging synthesis techniques have broadened the landscape of compounds obtainable in colloidal NC form. Sophistication in surface chemistry, jointly bolstered by theoretical models and experimental findings, has facilitated refined control over NC properties and represents a trusted gateway to enhanced NC stability and processability. The assembly of NCs into superlattices, along with two-dimensional (2D) photolithography and three-dimensional (3D) printing, has expanded their utility in creating materials with tailored properties. Applications of NCs are also flourishing, consolidating progress in fields targeted early on, such as optoelectronics and catalysis, and extending into areas ranging from quantum technology to phase-change memories. In this perspective, we review the extensive progress in research on NCs over the past decade and highlight key areas where future research may bring further breakthroughs.

TI A Quantum-Secure Cryptographic Algorithm Integrating Fractals and Prime
   Numbers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The present work introduces a new scheme of data cryptography in the context of emerging trends due to the challenge of defending critical network infrastructure against new exploit systems based on artificial intelligence or defending against quantum threats. In this paper, we will present an innovative cryptographic system composed of keys coming from fractals and prime numbers that are additionally manipulated through mathematical operations using matrices and quantum security. This technique ensures a high level of security, as demonstrated by the NIST p-values calculated on the key. This paper works upon the foundation on the previous work F&NIF (Fractal & Numerical Information Fusion), as we will discuss in the paper. In this work, we take this procedure and expand it with these new added features, using new fractal schemes and, in particular, implementing a novel quantum security procedure. This algorithm creates a security key applicable to cryptography that is resistant to quantum attacks since this procedure is quantum-crypto-agile.

TI Breaking Masked and Shuffled CCA Secure Saber KEM by Power Analysis

   SECURITY, ASHES 2021
CT 5th Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security
CY NOV 19, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB In this paper, we show that a software implementation of CCA secure Saber KEM protected by first-order masking and shuffling can be broken by deep learning-based power analysis. Using an ensemble of deep neural networks created at the profiling stage, we can recover the session key and the long-term secret key from 257 x N and 24x257 x N traces, respectively, where N is the number of repetitions of the same measurement. The value of N depends on the implementation, environmental factors, acquisition noise, etc.; in our experiments N = 10 is enough to succeed. The neural networks are trained on a combination of 80% of traces from the profiling device with a known shuffling order and 20% of traces from the device under attack captured for all-0 and all-1 messages. "Spicing" the training set with traces from the device under attack helps minimize the negative effect of device variability.

TI Scalable and Deterministic Fabrication of Quantum Emitter Arrays from

SO NANO LETTERS
AB We demonstrate the fabrication of large-scale arrays of single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Bottom-up growth of hBN onto nanoscale arrays of dielectric pillars yields corresponding arrays of hBN emitters at the pillar sites. Statistical analysis shows that the pillar diameter is critical for isolating single defects, and diameters of similar to 250 nm produce a near-unity yield of a single emitter at each pillar site. Our results constitute a promising route toward spatially controlled generation of hBN SPEs and provide an effective and efficient method to create large-scale SPE arrays. The results pave the way to scalability and high throughput fabrication of SPEs for advanced quantum photonic applications.

TI Particle track classification using quantum associative memory
SO NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS
   SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
AB Pattern recognition algorithms are commonly employed to simplify the challenging and necessary step of track reconstruction in sub-atomic physics experiments. Aiding in the discrimination of relevant interactions, pattern recognition seeks to accelerate track reconstruction by isolating signals of interest. In high collision rate experiments, such algorithms can be particularly crucial for determining whether to retain or discard information from a given interaction even before the data is transferred to tape. As data rates, detector resolution, noise, and inefficiencies increase, pattern recognition becomes more computationally challenging, motivating the development of higher efficiency algorithms and techniques. Quantum associative memory is an approach that seeks to exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to gain advantage in learning capacity, or the number of patterns that can be stored and accurately recalled. Here, we study quantum associative memory based on quantum annealing and apply it to the particle track classification. We focus on discrimination models based on Ising formulations of quantum associative memory model (QAMM) recall and quantum content-addressable memory (QCAM) recall. We characterize classification performance of these approaches as a function detector resolution, pattern library size, and detector inefficiencies, using the D-Wave 2000Q processor as a testbed. Discrimination criteria is set using both solution-state energy and classification labels embedded in solution states. We find that energy-based QAMM classification performs well in regimes of small pattern density and low detector inefficiency. In contrast, state-based QCAM achieves reasonably high accuracy recall for large pattern density and the greatest recall accuracy robustness to a variety of detector noise sources.

TI Self-excited truncated motional squeezed state in a quasi-2D
   Bose-Einstein condensate
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We demonstrate a self-excitation protocol to generate truncated motional squeezed states in a quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate using intrinsic atom-atom interactions. By abruptly relaxing the transverse trapping potential, interaction energy transforms into kinetic energy, exciting a coherent superposition of motional states. The induced dynamic is beyond conventional collective mode approximation. Limited kinetic energy produces a truncated motional squeezed state with a non-Gaussian density distribution suitable for quantum state engineering. Using single-shot in situ absorption imaging, we develop a variance-based quantum tomography method to reconstruct the quantum state. Our experiment realized a self-excited squeezed state with a squeezing parameter chi=0.66 +/- 0.05, which is expected to give -5.73 +/- 0.4 dB squeezing for full-state. However, truncation reduces the squeezing to -5.03 +/- 0.2 dB due to limited Fock states. Interaction-driven self-excitation combined with single shot variance-based tomography provides a versatile mechanism for generating and characterizing non-Gaussian squeezed states in precision quantum metrology.

TI Enhancing Signal Purity in Josephson Structure Measurements
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Superconducting Josephson structures play a significant role in quantum-state engineering. Achieving high-fidelity quantum state measurements in superconducting Josephson structures requires ultra-low noise environments and robust signal purification techniques. Here, the advanced low-noise signal measurement system designed for dilution refrigerators is presented, integrating multi-stage cryogenic filtering and electromagnetic shielding strategies to suppress noise sources across a broad frequency spectrum. The effectiveness of low-pass RC filters is demonstrated, silver-epoxy microwave absorbers, and optimized ground isolation to achieve an unprecedented noise reduction, enabling sub-nanoampere switching current distribution measurements superior to commerical systems at mK temperatures. The system is optimized for precision studies of superconductor-insulator-superconductor, superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor, and superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions with low critical currents. This approach establishes a reliable framework for next-generation quantum electronic experiments, ensuring that observed switching phenomena are governed by intrinsic device physics rather than environmental perturbations.

TI Building ground states of the Hubbard model by time-ordered bound-pair
   injection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB According to energy band theory, ground states of a normal conductor and insulator can be obtained by filling electrons individually into energy levels, without any restrictions. It fails when the electron-electron correlation is taken into account. In this work, we investigate the dynamic process of building ground states of a Hubbard model. It is based on time-ordered quantum quenches for unidirectional hopping across a central and an auxiliary Hubbard model. We find that there exists a set of optimal parameters (chemical potentials and pair binding energy) for the auxiliary system, which takes the role of electron-pair reservoir. The exceptional point dynamics in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics allows the perfect transfer of electron pair from the reservoir to the central system, obtaining its ground states at different fillings. The dynamics of time-ordered pair filling not only provides a method for correlated quantum state engineering, but also reveals the feature of the ground state in an alternative way.

TI Sensing with quantum light: a perspective
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB I present my perspective on sensing with quantum light. I summarise the motivations and methodology for identifying quantum enhancements in sensing over a classical sensor. In the real world, this enhancement will be a constant factor and not increase with the size of the quantum probe as is often advertised. I use a limited survey of interferometry, microscopy and spectroscopy to extract the vital challenges that must be faced to realise tangible enhancements in sensing with quantum light.

TI Quantum imaginary time evolution steered by reinforcement learning
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum imaginary time evolution - a common technique in theoretical studies to prepare ground states of quantum systems - comes with the uneasy requirement to implement non-unitary time evolution in the lab, and while recent solution has been proposed it carries leftover errors. The present work implements reinforcement learning to mitigate such errors in a physics-informed way, demonstrating the efficiency of AI-enhanced algorithms on a quantum computer.
   The quantum imaginary time evolution is a powerful algorithm for preparing the ground and thermal states on near-term quantum devices. However, algorithmic errors induced by Trotterization and local approximation severely hinder its performance. Here we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method to steer the evolution and mitigate these errors. In our scheme, the well-trained agent can find the subtle evolution path where most algorithmic errors cancel out, enhancing the fidelity significantly. We verified the method's validity with the transverse-field Ising model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Numerical calculations and experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer illustrate the efficacy. The philosophy of our method, eliminating errors with errors, sheds light on error reduction on near-term quantum devices.

TI QUBO Formulation Using Sequence Pair With Search Space Restriction for
   Rectangle Packing Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The development of quantum annealing has stimulated interest in solving NP-hard problems, including various industrial problems, such as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), with specialized solvers. This study focuses on the rectangle packing problem (RPP), which is an NP-hard problem applicable to industrial applications. The objective of this problem is to place given items in a minimum area without overlap. Naive QUBO representations, such as a direct binary encoding of locations, could require a large number of bits, which limits the problem size, hindering the acquisition of the optimal solution. To circumvent this difficulty, we employ the concept of sequence pairs to efficiently represent the locations of items. We also propose a strategy that uses multiple sampling solutions obtained with a QUBO solver, where we employ new constraints on the number of the rectangles contributing to the placement area for restricting the search space to smoothly bridge the QUBO formulation of the sequence pair and the minimization of area of rectangle placement. We estimate an approximate curve for the optimum number of rectangles contributing to the placement area. Then, we add the penalty term concerning the deviation from the estimated optimal value on the objective function. In numerical experiments with instances with 4 to 10 rectangles, we demonstrate that the proposed sampling-based strategy can efficiently find feasible solutions. This strategy would be useful for dealing with more complex problems, such as rectangle orientation and three-dimensional problems, with a relatively small number of bits using sequence pairs.

TI Phase transitions and virtual exceptional points in quantum emitters
   coupled to dissipative baths
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e., qualitative changes in spontaneous-emission decay as system parameters are varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin, providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation-whether uniform losses, staggered losses, or dephasing-can profoundly impact emitter relaxation, pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum technologies.

TI Arbitrary azimuthal optical field manipulation by dual-spiral arrays
SO CHINESE OPTICS
AB Optical field manipulation, an emerging frontier in photonics, demonstrates significant potential in biomedical microscopy, quantum state engineering, and micro-nano fabrication. To address the critical limitations of current optical modulation technologies in achieving full-parameter precision control, we proposed a novel approach for dynamic azimuthal optical field modulation based on dual-spiral arrays. By designing spatially interleaved spiral structures with different initial radii while maintaining identical periodic parameters, we achieved continuous optical modulation spanning the full 0-2 pi range in azimuthal field distribution. Through rigorous numerical simulations, we systematically established a quantitative correlation between the structural parameters and azimuthal optical field patterns, revealing, for the first time, a quasi-linear relationship between the radius difference and the resultant optical distribution. This theoretical framework advances our fundamental understanding of structured optical field manipulation as well as provides a new paradigm for programmable photonic device design, with distinct technical advantages in super-resolution imaging and optical tweezer systems.

Here we explore surface magnon polaritons in low-loss ferrimagnetic semiconductors, with a focus on their topological phases. We propose several surface magnon polariton devices, including microwave resonators that can strongly enhance magnetic fields and low-loss interconnects joining waveguides with vastly different impedances.

TI Tuning colour centres at a twisted hexagonal boron nitride interface
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB The colour centre platform holds promise for quantum technologies, and hexagonal boron nitride has attracted attention due to the high brightness and stability, optically addressable spin states and wide wavelength coverage discovered in its emitters. However, its application is hindered by the typically random defect distribution and complex mesoscopic environment. Here, employing cathodoluminescence, we demonstrate on-demand activation and control of colour centre emission at the twisted interface of two hexagonal boron nitride flakes. Further, we show that colour centre emission brightness can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by tuning the twist angle. Additionally, by applying an external voltage, nearly 100% brightness modulation is achieved. Our ab initio GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations suggest that the emission is correlated to nitrogen vacancies and that a twist-induced moire potential facilitates electron-hole recombination. This mechanism is further exploited to draw nanoscale colour centre patterns using electron beams.
   Colour centre emission from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise for quantum technologies but activation and tuning are challenging. Here, the authors show twist-angle emission brightness tuning and external voltage brightness modulation at the twisted interface of hBN flakes.

TI Quartic Quantum Speedups for Planted Inference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We describe a quantum algorithm for the Planted Noisy kXOR Problem (also known as Sparse Learning Parity with Noise) that achieves a nearly quartic (fourth-power) speedup over the best known classical algorithm while using exponentially less space. Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings [Quantum 4, 237 (2020)], by building on his quantum algorithm for the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the guided sparse Hamiltonian problem. Since the Planted Noisy kXOR Problem has been used as a component of certain cryptographic constructions, our work suggests that some of these are susceptible to superquadratic quantum attacks.

TI Time-Dependent Dephasing and Quantum Transport
SO ENTROPY
AB The investigation of the phenomenon of dephasing assisted quantum transport, which happens when the presence of dephasing benefits the efficiency of this process, has been mainly focused on Markovian scenarios associated with constant and positive dephasing rates in their respective Lindblad master equations. What happens if we consider a more general framework, where time-dependent dephasing rates are allowed, thereby, permitting the possibility of non-Markovian scenarios? Does dephasing-assisted transport still manifest for non-Markovian dephasing? Here, we address these open questions in a setup of coupled two-level systems. Our results show that the manifestation of non-Markovian dephasing-assisted transport depends on the way in which the incoherent energy sources are locally coupled to the chain. This is illustrated with two different configurations, namely non-symmetric and symmetric. Specifically, we verify that non-Markovian dephasing-assisted transport manifested only in the non-symmetric configuration. This allows us to draw a parallel with the conditions in which time-independent Markovian dephasing-assisted transport manifests. Finally, we find similar results by considering a controllable and experimentally implementable system, which highlights the significance of our findings for quantum technologies.

TI Strain-Controlled Quantum Dot Fine Structure for Entangled Photon
   Generation at 1550 nm
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Entangled photon generation at 1550 nm in the telecom C-band is of critical importance as it enables the realization of quantum communication protocols over long distance using deployed telecommunication infrastructure. InAs epitaxial quantum dots have recently enabled on-demand generation of entangled photons in this wavelength range. However, time-dependent state evolution, caused by the fine-structure splitting, currently limits the fidelity to a specific entangled state. Here, we show fine-structure suppression for InAs quantum dots using micromachined piezoelectric actuators and demonstrate generation of highly entangled photons at 1550 nm. At the lowest fine-structure setting, we obtain a maximum fidelity of 90.0 +/- 2.7% (concurrence of 87.5 +/- 3.1%). The concurrence remains high also for moderate (weak) temporal filtering, with values close to 80% (50%), corresponding to 30% (80%) of collected photons, respectively. The presented fine-structure control opens the way for exploiting entangled photons from quantum dots in fiber-based quantum communication protocols.

TI Communication Cost for Non-Markovianity of Tripartite Quantum States: A
   Resource Theoretic Approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB To quantify non-Markovianity of tripartite quantum states from an operational viewpoint, we introduce a class Omega* of operations performed by three distant parties. A tripartite quantum state is a free state under Omega* if and only if it is a quantum Markov chain. We introduce a function of tripartite quantum states that we call the non-Markovianity of formation, and prove that it is a faithful measure of non-Markovianity, which is continuous and monotonically nonincreasing under a subclass Omega of Omega*. We consider a task in which the three parties generate a non-Markov state from scratch by operations in Omega, assisted with quantum communication from the third party to the others, which does not belong to Omega. We prove that the minimum cost of quantum communication required therein is asymptotically equal to the regularized non-Markovianity of formation. Based on this result, we provide a direct operational meaning to a measure of bipartite entanglement called the c-squashed entanglement.

TI APPLICATION OF BIG DATA ANALYSIS AND INTELLIGENT ALGORITHM IN POWER
   SYSTEM OPERATION OPTIMIZATION
SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB The power communication system provides powerful technical support for realizing the intelligent operation and information management of the power grid and improving the operation efficiency and power supply quality of the power grid. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is considered one of the most promising technologies for commercialization. QKD uses a single photon to encrypt data to produce a more secure and reliable password. This paper intends to study the hierarchical, centralized control architecture of power dispatching based on quantum essential supply (QKD). The performance indexes of MDI-QKD under symmetric and asymmetric conditions were studied by local optimization. The optimal key formation rate of the algorithm is analyzed. From the perspective of quantum critical utilization, a quantum key utilization scheme for grid backbone dispatching service is proposed. The dynamic adjustment test of multi -node time slot and service key update rate is carried out. Experiments show that the MDI scheme can effectively improve the effectiveness of a multi -node QKD system. Thus, the security of data transmission of the core business of power dispatching data networks can be ensured to the greatest extent. AMDI can effectively reduce the transmission timeout of low -priority data streams because the delay of high -priority data streams reaches the proportion. It can be an excellent solution to the power system and the password requirements.

TI Entanglement versus Bell nonlocality of quantum nonequilibrium steady
   states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We study the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of a coupled two-qubit system, in which each qubit is coupled with one individual environment. We study how the nonequilibrium environments (with different temperatures or chemical potentials) influence the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. The nonequilibrium environments can have constructive effects on the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. Nonequilibrium thermodynamic cost can sustain the thermal energy or particle current and enhance the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. However, the nonequilibrium conditions (characterized by the temperature differences or the thermodynamic cost quantified by the entropy production rates) which give the maximal violation of the Bell inequalities are different from the nonequilibrium conditions which give the maximal entanglement. When the Bell inequality has asymmetric observables (between Alice and Bob), for example the I-3322 inequality, such asymmetry can also be reflected from the effects under the nonequilibrium environments. The spatial asymmetric two-qubit system coupled with nonequilibrium bosonic environments shows the thermal rectification effect, which can be witnessed by the Bell nonlocality. Different spatial asymmetric factors can be linearly cancelled with each other in the thermal rectification effect, which is also reflected on the changes of the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. Our study demonstrates that the nonequilibrium environments are both valuable for the entanglement and Bell nonlocality resources, based on different optimal nonequilibrium conditions though.

TI Experimental investigation of geometric quantum speed limits in an open
   quantum system
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The quantum speed limit (QSL) is a fundamental lower bound on the evolution time for quantum systems, and its tightness has been observed to be dependent on the properties of the physical process. However, experimental studies exploring the QSL in open quantum systems are still missing. Here, we studied geometric quantum speed limits of a qubit subject to decoherence in an ensemble of chloroform molecules in a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment. We controlled the system-reservoir interaction and the spin relaxation rates by adding a paramagnetic salt, allowing the observation of both Markovian and non-Markovian open system dynamics for the qubit. We used two distinguishability measures of quantum states to assess the speed of the qubit evolution: the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WY). For non-Markovianity and low salt concentrations, we found crossovers between QSLs related to those metrics. The WY metric sets the tighter QSL for high concentrations and Markovian dynamics. We also show that QSLs are sensitive even to small fluctuations in spin magnetization.
   Quantum Speed Limit (QSL) is a lower bound on the time evolution for quantum systems. Still, experimental studies for open systems are few due to the lack of control over their environment's interaction. The authors control the qubitreservoir interaction in an ensemble of chloroform molecules, observing crossovers between different QSLs.

TI Surface-Acoustic-Wave Computing of the Grover Quantum Search Algorithm
   with Metasurfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Wave-based computing has attracted extensive attention recently due to the benefits of parallel processing. In particular, several acoustic wave computing devices have been demonstrated to carry out classical algorithms and mathematical operations. Here, we extend acoustic wave computing to simulate a quantum algorithm, by proposing an integrated acoustic gradient metasurface system supporting spoof surface acoustic waves to implement the Grover quantum search algorithm. We show that this integrated metadevice can achieve a designed subdiffraction and transmission phase, which can be used to simulate operations used in a quantum algorithm, such as the Hadamard transformation and the inverse about the average. Numerical simulations demonstrate promising searching abilities of this device, including a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms and subwavelength searching accuracy. We anticipate that our results will inspire alternative design schemes for on-chip integrated metadevices for more quantum-inspired acoustic analog computations.

TI Amplification of cascaded down-conversion by reusing photons with a
   switchable cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability to efficiently produce and manipulate nonclassical states of light is a critical requirement for the development of quantum optical technologies. In recent years, experiments have demonstrated that cascaded spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a promising approach to implement photon precertification, provid-ing a way to overcome photon transmission losses for quantum communication, as well as to directly produce entangled three-photon states and heralded Bell pairs. However, the low efficiency of this process has so far limited its applicability beyond basic experiments. Here, we propose a scheme to amplify triplet production rates by using a fast switch and a delay loop to reuse photons that fail to convert on the first pass through the cascade's second nonlinear crystal. We construct a theoretical model to predict amplification rates and verify them in an experimental implementation. Our proof-of-concept device increases the rate of detected photon triplets as predicted, demonstrating that the method has the potential to dramatically improve the usefulness of cascaded down-conversion for device-independent quantum communication and entangled state generation.

TI Non-Abelian monopoles in the multiterminal Josephson effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this Letter we present a detailed theoretical analysis for the spectral properties of Andreev bound states in the multiterminal Josephson junctions by employing a symmetry-constrained scattering matrix approach. We find that in the synthetic multidimensional space of superconducting phases, crossings of Andreev bands may support non-Abelian SU(2) monopoles with a topological charge characterized by the second class Chern number. We propose that these topological defects can be detected via a nonlinear response measurement of the current autocorrelations. In addition, multiterminal Josephson junction devices can be tested as a hardware platform for realizing holonomic quantum computation.

TI Low charge noise quantum dots with industrial CMOS manufacturing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Silicon spin qubits are promising candidates for scalable quantum computers, due to their coherence and compatibility with CMOS technology. Advanced industrial processes ensure wafer-scale uniformity and high device yield, but traditional transistor processes cannot be directly transferred to qubit structures. To leverage the micro-electronics industry expertise, we customize a 300 mm wafer fabrication line for silicon MOS qubit integration. With careful optimization of the gate stack, we report uniform quantum dot operation at the Si/SiO2 interface at mK temperature. We measure a record-low average noise with a value of 0.61 mu eVHz-0.5\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\rm{\mu }}{\rm{eVH}}{{\rm{z}}}<^>{-0.5}$$\end{document} at 1 Hz and even below 0.1 mu eVHz-0.5\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\rm{\mu }}{\rm{eVH}}{{\rm{z}}}<^>{-0.5}$$\end{document} for some operating conditions. Statistical analysis of the charge noise measurements show that the noise source can be described by a two-level fluctuator model. This reproducible low noise level, in combination with uniform operation of our quantum dots, marks CMOS manufactured spin qubits as a mature platform towards scalable high-fidelity qubits.

TI Coalescence of non-Markovian dissipation, quantum Zeno effect, and
   non-Hermitian physics in a simple realistic quantum system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian describing an open quantum system is the usual method of tracking its exceptional points (EPs). Although such a method is successful for tracking EPs in Markovian systems, it may be problematic in non-Markovian systems where a closed expression of the effective Hamiltonian describing the open system may not exist. In this work we provide an alternative method of tracking EPs in open quantum systems, using an experimentally measurable quantity, namely, the effective decay rate of a qubit. The quantum system under consideration consists of two nonidentical interacting qubits, one of which is coupled to an external environment. We develop a theoretical framework in terms of the time-dependent Schrodinger equations of motion, which provides analytical closed-form solutions of the Laplace transforms of the qubit amplitudes, enabling the study of various cases of environmental spectral densities. The link between the peaked structure of the effective decay rate of the qubit that interacts indirectly with the environment and the onset of the quantum Zeno effect is investigated, revealing the connections between the latter and the presence of exceptional points. Our treatment and results in addition reveal an intricate interplay between non-Markovian dynamics, the quantum Zeno effect, and non-Hermitian physics.

TI Statistical evaluation and optimization of entanglement purification
   protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantitative characterization of two-qubit entanglement purification protocols is introduced. Our approach is based on the concurrence and the hit-and-run algorithm applied to the convex set of all two-qubit states. We demonstrate that pioneering protocols are unable to improve the estimated initial average concurrence of almost uniformly sampled density matrices; however, as it is known, they still generate pairs of qubits in a state that is close to a Bell state. We also develop a more efficient protocol and investigate it numerically together with a recent proposal based on an entangling rank-2 projector. Furthermore, we present a class of variational purification protocols with continuous parameters and optimize their output concurrence. These optimized algorithms turn out to surpass former proposals and our protocol by means of not wasting too many entangled states.

TI Towards tunable graphene phononic crystals
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Phononic crystals (PnCs) are artificially patterned media exhibiting bands of allowed and forbidden zones for phonons-in analogy to the electronic band structure of crystalline solids arising from the periodic arrangement of atoms. Many emerging applications of PnCs from solid-state simulators to quantum memories could benefit from the on-demand tunability of the phononic band structure. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of suspended graphene PnCs in which the phononic band structure is controlled by mechanical tension applied electrostatically. We show signatures of a mechanically tunable phononic band gap. The experimental data supported by simulation suggests a phononic band gap at 28-33 MHz in equilibrium, which upshifts by 9 MHz under a mechanical tension of 3.1 N m(-1). This is an essential step towards tunable phononics paving the way for more experiments on phononic systems based on 2D materials.

TI Hybrid III-V diamond photonic platform for quantum nodes based on
   neutral silicon vacancy centers in diamond
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrating atomic quantum memories based on color centers in diamond with on-chip photonic devices would enable entanglement distribution over long distances. However, efforts towards integration have been challenging because color centers can be highly sensitive to their environment, and their properties degrade in nanofabricated structures. Here, we describe a heterogeneously integrated, on-chip, III-V diamond platform designed for neutral silicon vacancy (SiV0) centers in diamond that circumvents the need for etching the diamond substrate. Through evanescent coupling to SiV0 centers near the surface of diamond, the platform will enable Purcell enhancement of SiV0 emission and efficient frequency conversion to the telecommunication C-band. The proposed structures can be realized with readily available fabrication techniques. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Efficient Sampling of Noisy Shallow Circuits Via Monitored Unraveling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a classical algorithm for sampling the output of shallow, noisy random circuits on two-dimensional qubit arrays. The algorithm builds on the recently proposed "space-evolving block decimation" (SEBD) [Napp et al, Phys. Rev. X 12, 021021 (2022)] and extends it to the case of noisy circuits. SEBD is based on a mapping of two-dimensional unitary circuits to one-dimensional monitored ones, which feature measurements alongside unitary gates; it exploits the presence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition to achieve efficient (approximate) sampling below a finite critical depth Tc. Our noisy-SEBD algorithm unravels the action of noise into measurements, further lowering entanglement and enabling efficient classical sampling up to larger circuit depths. We analyze a class of physically relevant noise models (unital qubit channels) within a two-replica statistical mechanics treatment, finding weak measurements to be the optimal (i.e., most disentangling) unraveling. We then locate the noisySEBD complexity transition as a function of circuit depth and noise strength in realistic circuit models. As an illustrative example, we show that circuits on heavy-hexagon qubit arrays with noise rates of approximately equal to 2% per CNOT, based on IBM Quantum processors, can be efficiently sampled up to a depth of five iSWAP (or ten CNOT) gate layers. Our results help sharpen the requirements for practical hardness of simulation of noisy hardware.

TI A quantum simulator based on locally controlled logical systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In a digital quantum simulator, basic two-qubit interactions are manipulated by means of fast local control operations to establish a desired target Hamiltonian. Here we consider a quantum simulator based on logical systems, i.e. where several physical qubits are used to represent a single logical two-level system to obtain enhanced and simple control over effective interactions between logical systems. Fixed, distance-dependent pairwise interactions between the physical qubits lead to effective interactions between the logical systems, which can be fully controlled solely by the choice of their internal state. This allows one to directly manipulate the topology and strength of effective interactions between logical systems. We show how to choose and generate the required states of logical systems for any desired interaction pattern and topology, how to perform arbitrary logical measurements, and how to obtain full control over single logical systems using only the intrinsic two-body interactions and control of individual physical qubits. This leads to a universal quantum simulator based on logical systems. We discuss the advantages of such a logical quantum simulator over standard ones, including the possibility to reach target topologies that are only accessible with large overheads otherwise. We provide several examples of how to obtain different target interaction patterns and topologies from initial long-ranged or short-ranged qubit-qubit interactions with a specific distance dependence.

TI Entangled states shaping with CV states of definite parity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a new method to entangle continuous variable (CV) states of certain parity and photonic states for the purpose of generating optical hybrid cluster (HC) states. To do it we introduce two families of the CV states of definite parity which stems from single mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state. Potential to apply the CV states of certain parity is high. We report on the generation of the even/odd Schrodinger cat state like (SCS-like) states whose fidelities with even/odd SCS of amplitude of 4.2 are more of 0.99, when 30,31 photons are detected in auxiliary mode of input SMSV state initially mixed with single photon. We show that the quantum efficiency of a photon number resolving (PNR) detector is crucial to maintaining the success rate of even/odd SCSs generator at an acceptable level. The scheme with delocalized photon implements deterministic imperfect entanglement operation between macro and micro states. We show that the beam splitter implements the two-qubits operation control - Z (CZ) for input CV states of definite parity and photonic states, provided that certain result is detected in measurement mode. An extension of the entangling operation for two entangled delocalized photons (TEDP) allows one to realize three-qubit HC state. Seven-qubit HC state is the result of conjunction of two three-qubit HC states through TEDP state.

TI Recovering Marcus Theory Rates and Beyond without the Need for
   Decoherence Corrections: The Mapping Approach to Surface Hopping
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB It is well-known that fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) fails to correctly capture the quadratic scaling of rate constants with diabatic coupling in the weak-coupling limit, as expected from Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory. To address this deficiency, the most widely used approach is to introduce a "decoherence correction", which removes the inconsistency between the wave function coefficients and the active state. Here we investigate the behavior of a new nonadiabatic trajectory method, called the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), on systems that exhibit an incoherent rate behavior. Unlike FSSH, MASH hops between active surfaces deterministically and can never have an inconsistency between the wave function coefficients and the active state. We show that MASH not only can describe rates for intermediate and strong diabatic coupling but also can accurately reproduce the results of Marcus theory in the golden-rule limit, without the need for a decoherence correction. MASH is therefore a significant improvement over FSSH in the simulation of nonadiabatic reactions.

TI Zeeman optical pumping of 87Rb atoms in a hollow-core photonic crystal
   fiber
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Preparation of an atomic ensemble in a particular Zeeman state is a critical step of many protocols for implementing quantum sensors and quantum memories. These devices can also benefit from optical fiber integration. In this work we describe experimental results supported by a theoretical model of single-beam optical pumping of 87Rb atoms within a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The observed 50% population increase in the pumped F = 2, mF = 2 Zeeman substate along with the depopulation of remaining Zeeman substates enabled us to achieve a threefold improvement in the relative population of the mF = 2 substate within the F = 2 manifold, with 60% of the F = 2 population residing in the mF = 2 dark sublevel. Based on theoretical model, we propose methods to further improve the pumping efficiency in alkali-filled hollow-core fibers. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI High-frequency traveling-wave phononic cavity with sub-micron wavelength
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Thin-film gallium nitride (GaN) is a promising platform for phononic integrated circuits that hold great potential for scalable information processing processors. Here, an unsuspended traveling phononic resonator based on a high-acoustic-index-contrast mechanism is realized in GaN-on-Sapphire with a frequency up to 5 GHz, which matches the typical superconducting qubit frequency. A sixfold increment in quality factor is found when temperature decreases from room temperature (Q = 5000) to 7 K (Q = 30 000), and thus, a frequency-quality factor product of 1.5 x 10(14) is obtained. Higher quality factors should be available when the fabrication process is further optimized. Our system shows great potential in hybrid quantum devices via the so-called circuit quantum acoustodynamics.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Surface Electrons on Solid Quantum Substrates: A Brief Review
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB In this work an overview is given on experiments with surface electrons above the quantum solids hydrogen and neon. While two-dimensional ensembles of surface electrons on the quantum liquid superfluid helium have been studied already in great detail, investigations of electrons on quantum solids are rather sparse. Since recently electron-on-neon qubits have been shown to exhibit very long coherence times, there is a demand for understanding the conditions for a successful growth of thin solid neon films as a qubit substrate. Therefore, in this review also the triple point wetting phenomenon of the hydrogen isotopes and neon is discussed, which dominates the growth of solid films of these materials.

TI A note on "On validity of quantum partial adiabatic search"
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this note, we clarify a small problem concerning our recent work "On validity of quantum partial adiabatic search". The conclusion here is that, the success probability of the quantum partial adiabatic search algorithm in the paper indeed can be bounded by the same quantity as that of early work of Kay's, even though the Hamiltonian settings in those works are different. This fact is not mentioned in our prior paper, so the purpose here is to explicitly point it out for clarity.

TI Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A ring of capacitively coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as "Levitons." Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubit sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable "scattering experiment" in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.

TI Generating grating in cavity magnomechanics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the phenomenon of magnomechanically induced grating (MMIG) within a cavity magnomechanical system, comprising magnons (spins in a ferromagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet), cavity microwave photons, and phonons (Li et al 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 203601). By applying an external standing wave control, we observe modifications in the transmission profile of a probe light beam, signifying the presence of MMIG. Through numerical analysis, we explore the diffraction intensities of the probe field, examining the impact of interactions between cavity magnons, magnon-phonon interactions, standing wave field strength, and interaction length. MMIG systems leverage the unique properties of magnons, and collective spin excitations with attributes like long coherence times and spin-wave propagation. These distinctive features can be harnessed in MMIG systems for innovative applications in information storage, retrieval, and quantum memories, offering various orders of diffraction grating.

TI High-Fidelity Indirect Readout of Trapped-Ion Hyperfine Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose and demonstrate a protocol for high-fidelity indirect readout of trapped ion hyperfine qubits, where the state of a Be-9(+) qubit ion is mapped to a Mg-25(+) readout ion using laser-driven Raman transitions. By partitioning the Be-9(+) ground-state hyperfine manifold into two subspaces representing the two qubit states and choosing appropriate laser parameters, the protocol can be made robust to spontaneous photon scattering errors on the Raman transitions, enabling repetition for increased readout fidelity. We demonstrate combined readout and back-action errors for the two subspaces of 1.2(-0.6)(+1.1) X 10-(4 ) and 0(-0)(+1.9) x 10(-5) with 68% confidence while avoiding decoherence of spectator qubits due to stray resonant light that is inherent to direct fluorescence detection.

TI Alternative experimental ways to access entropy production
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We theoretically derive and experimentally compare several different ways to access entropy production in a quantum process under feedback control. We focus on a bipartite quantum system realizing an autonomous Maxwell's demon scheme reported by Najera-Santos et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 2, 032025(R) (2020)], where information encoded in a demon is consumed to transfer heat from a cold qubit to a hot cavity. By measuring individual quantum trajectories of the joint demon-cavity-qubit system, we compute the entropy production with six distinct expressions derived from different approaches to the system description and its evolution. Each method uses a specific set of trajectories and data processing. Our results provide a unified view of the various meanings of irreversibility in quantum systems and pave the way for the measurement of entropy production beyond thermal frameworks.

TI Schrodinger-Cat States in Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana
   Interferometry: A Multiple Davydov Ansatz Approach
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Employing the time-dependent variational principle combined with the multiple Davydov D-2 Ansatz, we investigate Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions in a qubit coupled to a photon mode with various initial photon states at zero temperature. Thanks to the multiple Davydov trial states, exact photonic dynamics taking place in the course of the LZ transition is also studied efficiently. With the qubit driven by a linear external field and the photon mode initialized with Schrodinger-cat states, asymptotic behavior of the transition probability beyond the rotating-wave approximation is uncovered for a variety of initial states. Using a sinusoidal external driving field, we also explore the photon-assisted dynamics of Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Transition pathways involving multiple energy levels are unveiled by analyzing the photon dynamics.

TI Engineered entropic forces allow ultrastrong dynamical backaction
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB When confined within an optical cavity light can exert strong radiation pressure forces. Combined with dynamical backaction, this enables important processes, such as laser cooling, and applications ranging from precision sensors to quantum memories and interfaces. However, the magnitude of radiation pressure forces is constrained by the energy mismatch between photons and phonons. Here, we overcome this barrier using entropic forces arising from the absorption of light. We show that entropic forces can exceed the radiation pressure force by eight orders of magnitude and demonstrate this using a superfluid helium third-sound resonator. We develop a framework to engineer the dynamical backaction from entropic forces, applying it to achieve phonon lasing with a threshold three orders of magnitude lower than previous work. Our results present a pathway to exploit entropic forces in quantum devices and to study nonlinear fluid phenomena such as turbulence and solitons.

TI Robust microwave-optical photon conversion using cavity modes strongly
   hybridized with a color center ensemble
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A microwave-optical converter with high efficiency (>50%) and low added noise (<< 1 photon) could enable the creation of scalable optical quantum networks. However, integrated converters demonstrated to date are too lossy or weakly non-linear to provide this performance. Here we develop a theory of microwave-optical conversion employing an ensemble of spin-bearing color centers strongly coupled to a photonic resonator and/or a superconducting microwave resonator. We find a counterintuitive operating point where microwave and optical photons are tuned to bare center/cavity resonances, which, compared to the weak-coupling limit, has much stronger non-linearity, offering high efficiency with reduced pump- and center-induced losses, and that is robust to inhomogeneous broadening. Taking color center and optical pump-induced losses into account, we predict similar to 95% efficiency and added noise << 1 quanta at low (mu W) pump powers for both Er- and T-centers in Si. Our results open new pathways to build quantum networks.

This gives a TQFT construction of Squier's Hermitian form on the Burau representation with possibly mixed signature. We prove that the image of the braid group in the space of possibly indefinite unitary representations is dense. We also argue for the potential applications of non-semisimple TQFTs toward topological quantum computation.

TI Scalable Surface-Code Decoders with Parallelization in Time
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fast classical processing is essential for most quantum fault-tolerance architectures. We introduce a parallelism. Our scheme divides the syndromes in space-time into overlapping windows along the time direction, which can be decoded in parallel with any inner decoder. With this parallelism, our scheme can solve the backlog problem as the code scales up, even if the inner decoder is slow. When using minimumweight perfect matching and union find as the inner decoders, we observe circuit-level thresholds of 0.68% and 0.55%, respectively, which are almost identical to those for the batch decoding.

AB Photon detection at microwave frequency is of great interest due to its application in quantum computation information science and technology. Herein are results from studying microwave response in a topological superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) realized in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. The temperature dependence and microwave power dependence of the SQUID junction resistance are studied, from which we obtain an effective temperature at each microwave power level. It is observed the effective temperature increases with the microwave power. This observation of large microwave response may pave the way for single photon detection at the microwave frequency in topological quantum materials.

TI Properties of quantum emitters in different hBN sample types

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Single photon emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising solid-state quantum emitters for photonic applications and quantum networks. Despite their favorable properties, much is still unknown about their characteristics and their atomic origin. We focus on two different kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with nanophotonic devices, a layer-engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition and multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase exfoliation. We investigate their inherent defects and fit computationally simulated optical properties of likely carbon-related defects to their measured emission profiles. Thereby we compare and elucidate the properties in different sample types particularly suited for photonic quantum networks and narrow down the origin of emitters found in these samples. Our work is thus an important step towards harnessing the full potential of single photon emitters in hBN.

We establish the relationship between an arbitrary target Floquet Hamiltonian in phase space and the periodic driving potential in real space. We obtain analytical expressions for the driving potentials in real space that can generate novel Hamiltonians in phase space, e.g., rotational lattices and sharp -boundary wells. Our protocol can be realized in a range of experimental platforms for nonclassical state generation and bosonic quantum computation.

TI Dilution of Error in Digital Hamiltonian Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We provide analytic, numerical, and experimental evidence that the amount of noise in digital quantum simulation of local observables can be independent of system size in a number of situations. We provide a microscopic explanation of this dilution of errors based on the "relevant string length" of operators, which is the length of Pauli strings in the operator at time s that belong to the exponentially small subspace of strings that can give a nonzero expectation value at time t. We show that this explanation can predict when dilution of errors occurs and when it does not. We propose an error-mitigation method the efficiency of which relies on this mechanism. Our findings imply that digital quantum simulation with noisy devices is in appropriate cases scalable in the sense that gate errors do not need to be reduced linearly to simulate larger systems.

AB Understanding the best known parameters, performance, and systematic behavior of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) remain open research questions, even as the algorithm gains popularity. We introduce QAOAKit, a Python toolkit for the QAOA built for exploratory research. QAOAKit is a unified repository of preoptimized QAOA parameters and circuit generators for common quantum simulation frameworks. We combine, standardize, and cross-validate previously known parameters for the MaxCut problem, and incorporate this into QAOAKit. We also build conversion tools to use these parameters as inputs in several quantum simulation frameworks that can be used to reproduce, compare, and extend known results from various sources in the literature. We describe QAOAKit and provide examples of how it can be used to reproduce research results and tackle open problems in quantum optimization.

TI Quantum and complex-valued hybrid networks for multi-principal element
   alloys phase prediction
SO ISCIENCE
AB This study introduces a hybrid network model for phase classification, integrating quantum networks and complex-valued neural networks. This architecture uses elemental composition as its only input, eliminating complex feature engineering. Parameterized quantum networks handle sparse elemental data and convert data from real to complex domains, increasing information dimensionality. Complex-valued neural networks process data in the complex domain, significantly reducing information loss during transitions. The experimental results show that the hybrid model achieves a phase classification accuracy of 94.93%, outperforming the best machine learning model by 2.27% and the quantum model by 8.67%. Precision, recall, and F1- score are also excellent at 0.9494, 0.9493, and 0.9500, respectively. Additional tests on phase transitions in AlxCoCrFeNi alloys confirm the model's robust generalization, identifying transition thresholds at 0.46 and 0.88, closely matching the 0.45 and 0.88 reported in related studies.

TI Surface-electrode Ion Trap Development
SO JETP LETTERS
AB We present a segmented linear surface electrode ion trap design that can be used for various applications in optical clocks and quantum computation based on trapped Yb-171(+) ions. Our simulations show that calculated trap depth can reach up to several eV and that the pseudopotential minimum of the trap is located above the trap surface at a distance greater than 80 & mu;m. The described pseudopotential simulations and calculations of different trap parameters can be used to design the planar trap with required parameters. This design could be scaled to store a long chain of ions and used for quantum logic applications as well.

SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A topological superconductor exhibits chiral p-wave pairing symmetry and hosts Majorana fermions. The predicted emergent phenomena in such a system and its application for topological quantum computation make it a pivotal focus of research. Stoichiometric non-centrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe2 has emerged as a strong candidate material due to possible parity mixing in bulk superconductivity and superconducting topological surface state (TSS). In this review, we summarize recent progress on the study of PbTaSe2, including bulk superconductivity, topological band structure, superconducting TSS and the elusive Majorana bound state within.

TI Compatibility of braiding and fusion on wire networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Exchanging particles on graphs, or more concretely on networks of quantum wires, has been proposed as a means to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. This was inspired by braiding of anyons in planar systems. However, exchanges on a graph are not governed by the usual braid group but instead by a graph braid group. By imposing compatibility of graph braiding with fusion of topological charges, we obtain generalized hexagon equations. We find the usual planar anyon solutions but also more general braid actions. We illustrate this with Abelian, Fibonacci, and Ising fusion rules.

TI Valley-Mediated Singlet- and Triplet-Polaron Interactions and Quantum
   Dynamics in a Doped WSe2 Monolayer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe2, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons- singlet and triplet-where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on subpicosecond timescales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.

TI Low-loss millimeter-wave resonators with an improved coupling structure
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Millimeter-wave superconducting resonators are a useful tool for studying quantum device coherence in a new frequency domain. However, improving resonators is difficult without a robust and reliable method for coupling millimeter-wave signals to 2D structures. We develop and characterize a tapered transition structure coupling a rectangular waveguide to a planar slotline waveguide with better than 0.5 dB efficiency over 14 GHz, and use it to measure ground-shielded resonators in the W band (75-110 GHz). Having decoupled the resonators from radiative losses, we consistently achieve single-photon quality factors above 105, with a two-level-system loss limit above 106, and verify the effectiveness of oxide removal treatments to reduce loss. These values are 4-5 times higher than those previously reported in the W band, and much closer to typical planar microwave resonators. The improved losses demonstrated by these on-chip millimeter-wave devices shed new light on quantum decoherence in a different frequency regime, offer increased selectivity for high-frequency detectors, and enables new possibilities for hybrid quantum experiments integrating millimeter-wave frequencies.

TI Searching for optimal experimental parameters with D-Wave quantum
   annealer for fabrication of Au atomic junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Feedback-controlled electromigration (FCE) is employed to control metal nanowires with quantized conductance and create atomic junctions. The FCE scheme is commonly implemented using many experimental parameters, and determining the optimal FCE parameters can be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem. The D-Wave quantum annealer has attracted attention for its hardware implementation of quantum annealing (QA), which is a heuristic algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This study developed a QA approach for optimizing the FCE parameters and executed it on a quantum annealer. The results and performance were compared with those of a classical solver.

TI Semi-device-independent randomness certification using Mermin's proof of
   Kochen-Specker contextuality
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Randomness is a potential resource for cryptography, simulations and algorithms. Non-local correlations violating Bell's inequality certify the generation of bit strings whose randomness is guaranteed in a device-independent manner. We provide interesting semi-device-independent randomness certification protocols by Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality. For this, we first cast the Mermin's magic-square proof of KS contextuality for two-qubit system as a semi-device-independent communication game in prepare-measure scenario. This provides a semi-device-independent certification of two-bit of randomness. Further, by using Mermin's magic-star proof of KS theorem involving three-qubit system, we certify three bit of randomness. We conjecture that our proposals can be extended to certify any arbitrary bit of randomness through a suitable KS proof of contextuality valid for higher-dimensional system.

TI Entanglement and quantum Fisher information of two qutrits interacting
   with a single field in a cavity
SO JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN LASER RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we introduce a quantum model of a two-qutrit (TQ) system interacting with a deformed field mode, initially prepared in a nonlinear coherent state. We analyze the quantum dynamics of TQs in a Lambda-type configuration, both with and without the time-dependent coupling (TDC) effect, within the framework of the Schrodinger equation. This will help us to investigate the time evolution of intriguing phenomena such as entanglement, quantum coherence, and the precision of parameter estimation in relation to the deformation parameter and TDC effect. Specifically, we consider the quantum dynamics of negativity, von Neumann entropy, the norm of coherence, and Fisher information. Finally, we explore the interrelationships among these quantum measures, providing insights into the underlying quantum phenomena of the system.

TI Fast biological imaging with quantum-enhanced Raman microscopy
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging technique that probes the vibrational response of chemicals with high specificity and sensitivity. High-power, quantum-enhanced SRS microscopes have been recently demonstrated and applied to polymers and biological samples. Quantum correlations, in the form of squeezed light, enable the microscopes to operate below the shot noise limit, enhancing their performance without increasing the illumination intensity. This addresses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speed constraints introduced by photodamage in shot noise-limited microscopes. Previous microscopes have either used single-beam squeezing, but with insufficient brightness to reach the optimal ratio of pump-to-Stokes intensity for maximum SNR, or have used twin-beam squeezing and suffered a 3 dB noise penalty. Here we report a quantum-enhanced Raman microscope that uses a bright squeezed single-beam, enabling operation at the optimal efficiency of the SRS process. The increase in brightness leads to multimode effects that degrade the squeezing level, which we partially overcome using spatial filtering. We apply our quantum-enhanced SRS microscope to biological samples and demonstrate quantum-enhanced multispectral imaging of living cells. The imaging speed of 100x100 x 100 pixels in 18 seconds allows the dynamics of cell organelles to be resolved. The SNR achieved is compatible with video-rate imaging, with the quantum correlations yielding a 20% improvement in imaging speed compared to shot noise-limited operation.

TI Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate
   ground state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We develop an approach for characterizing nonlocal quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behavior of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates. By the example of solving a simple Ising model it is shown that digital quantum simulations performed with quantum computers can provide accurate description of the entanglement of the degenerate systems even in the presence of noise. We also discuss the ground-state properties of degenerate fermionic and bosonic models, which can be useful for theoretical analysis of the experiments with ultracold atoms.

TI Tomographic Universality of the Discrete Wigner Function
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We observe that the discrete Wigner functions (DWFs) of n-partite systems with odd local dimensions are tomographically universal, as reflected in the delta function form of the DWF for any stabilizer. However, in the n-qubit case, this property does not hold due to the non-factorization of the mapping kernel, the explicit form of which depends on a particular partition of the discrete phase space. Nonetheless, it turns out that the DWF for some specific stabilizers, not included in the set used for the construction of the Wigner map, takes on the form of a delta function. This implies that the possibility of classical simulations of Pauli measurements in a given stabilizer state for qubit systems is closely tied to the experimental setup.

AB We consider the problem of learning N identical copies of an unknown n-qubit quantum graph state with product measurements. These graph states have corresponding graphs where every vertex has exactly d neighboring vertices. Here, we detail an explicit algorithm that uses product measurements on multiple identical copies of such graph states to learn them. When n >> d and N = O(d log(1/epsilon)+d(2) log n), this algorithm correctly learns the graph state with probability at least 1 - epsilon. From channel coding theory, we find that for arbitrary joint measurements on graph states, any learning algorithm achieving this accuracy requires at least Omega(log(1/epsilon) + d log n) copies when d = o(root n). We also supply bounds on N when every graph state encounters identical and independent depolarizing errors on each qubit.

TI Multipartite Correlations in Quantum Collision Models
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum collision models have proved to be useful for a clear and concise description of many physical phenomena in the field of open quantum systems: thermalization, decoherence, homogenization, nonequilibrium steady state, entanglement generation, simulation of many-body dynamics, and quantum thermometry. A challenge in the standard collision model, where the system and many ancillas are all initially uncorrelated, is how to describe quantum correlations among ancillas induced by successive system-ancilla interactions. Another challenge is how to deal with initially correlated ancillas. Here we develop a tensor network formalism to address both challenges. We show that the induced correlations in the standard collision model are well captured by a matrix product state (a matrix product density operator) if the colliding particles are in pure (mixed) states. In the case of the initially correlated ancillas, we construct a general tensor diagram for the system dynamics and derive a memory-kernel master equation. Analyzing the perturbation series for the memory kernel, we go beyond the recent results concerning the leading role of two-point correlations and consider multipoint correlations (Waldenfelds cumulants) that become relevant in the higher-order stroboscopic limits. These results open an avenue for the further analysis of memory effects in collisional quantum dynamics.

TI Topological magnon-photon interaction for cavity magnonics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The study of cavity magnonics and topological insulators has made significant advances over the past decade, however the possibility of combining the two fields is still unexplored. Here, we explore such connection by investigating hybrid cavity systems that incorporate both a ferromagnet and a topological insulator. We find that electrons in the topological surface state efficiently mediate the effective electric dipole coupling between the spin of the ferromagnet and the electric field of the cavity, in contrast with the conventional cavity magnonics theory based on magnetic dipole coupling. We refer to this coupling as topological magnon-photon interaction, estimating it one order of magnitude stronger than the conventional magnon-photon coupling, and showing that its sign can be manipulated. We discuss the potential of our proposed device to allow for scaling down and controlling the cavity system using electronics. Our results provide solid ground for exploring the functionalities enabled by merging cavity magnonics with topological insulators.
   Reaching the strong coupling regime in cavity magnonics is impaired by quantum decoherence effects introduced by a large size of magnet required. By mediating it via a topological insulator, the authors propose an indirect coupling mechanism to enhance the magnon-photon interaction strength.

TI Ehrenfest dynamics with spontaneous localization
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We propose Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization (SLED), a decoherence-corrected extension of Ehrenfest dynamics based on the Gisin-Percival quantum-state diffusion equation. In SLED, the electronic wave function evolves stochastically in the adiabatic energy basis, producing trajectory-level localization. The trajectory ensemble reproduces a Lindblad-type propagation of the reduced electronic density matrix. This approach ensures linearity, trace preservation, and complete positivity, providing a physically consistent alternative to ad hoc decoherence corrections commonly adopted in mixed quantum-classical methods. Benchmark simulations on one-dimensional Tully models and multidimensional spin-boson Hamiltonians demonstrate that SLED reproduces electronic populations and captures the essential features of coherence decay. The tests, however, also reveal that accurate treatment will require generalizing the localization kernel controlling the electron-nucleus coupling strength from a constant into a function of time and phase space coordinates. SLED is implemented in the newly developed Skitten program and will be integrated into Newton-X. While the present study serves as a proof of concept, SLED establishes a rigorous and extensible framework that bridges mixed quantum-classical dynamics with open quantum system theory.

TI Low-energy physics and finite-size effects in nonuniform parafermion
   chains
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The nonuniform Z(2 )symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform Z(2) chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of Z(n) chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both Z(2) and Z(3) chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.

TI Feedback and compensation scheme to suppress the thermal effects from a
   dipole trap beam for the optical fiber microcavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) with neutral atoms is a promising platform for quantum information processing and optical fiber Fabry-Perot microcavity with small mode volume is an important integrant for the large light-matter coupling strength. To transport cold atoms to the microcavity, a high-power optical dipole trap (ODT) beam perpendicular to the cavity axis is commonly used. However, the overlap between the ODT beam and the cavity mirrors causes thermal effects inducing a large cavity shift at the locking wavelength and a differential cavity shift at the probe wavelength which disturbs the cavity resonance. Here, we develop a feedback and compensation scheme to maintain the optical fiber microcavity resonant with the lasers at the locking and probe wavelengths simultaneously. The large cavity shift of 210 times the cavity linewidth, which makes the conventional PID scheme ineffective can be suppressed actively by a PIID feedback scheme with an additional I parameter. Differential cavity shift at the probe wavelength can be understood from the photothermal refraction and thermal expansion effects on the mirror coatings and be passively compensated by changing the frequency of the locking laser. A further normal-mode splitting measurement demonstrates the strong coupling between 85Rb atoms and cavity mode after the thermal effects are suppressed, which also confirms successful delivery and trapping of atoms into the optical cavity. This scheme can solve the thermal effects of the high-power ODT beam and will be helpful to cavity QED experimental research.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Multistage entanglement swapping using superconducting qubits in the
   absence and presence of dissipative environment without Bell state
   measurement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent decades the entangled state generation is of great importance in the quantum information processing and technologies. In this paper, producing the distributed entangled state of superconducting (SC) qubits is considered using an entanglement swapping protocol in three successive stages. The SC qubit pairs (i, i + 1 with i = 1, 3, 5, 7), where each pair of the qubits has been placed on a separate chip, are initially prepared in maximally entangled states. The external magnetic fields on capacitively coupled pairs (2, 3) and (6, 7) are implemented for modulating the frequency of qubits. Then, the SC qubits (1, 4) and (5, 8) are converted into entangled states via operating proper measurements instead of Bell state measurement (which is generally a hard task). Finally, the distributed entangled state of target SC qubits (1, 8) can be obtained by applying external magnetic fields on qubits (4, 5) and via operating suitable measurements. This process is studied in the absence and presence of thermal decoherence effects. The concurrence, as a measure of entanglement between two target qubits, success probability of the distributed entangled states and the corresponding fidelities are evaluated, by which we find that the state of target SC qubits (1, 8) is converted to Bell state with maximum entanglement at some moments of time. Under appropriate conditions the maximum of success probability of the obtained states in each stage approaches 1. However, the maxima of concurrence and success probability gradually decrease due to the thermal noise as time goes on. Moreover, compelling amounts of fidelity, success probability and entanglement can be obtained for the achieved entangled states.

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the sharing of secret cryptographic keys between two distant users, whose intrinsic security is guaranteed by the laws of nature. Nowadays, the most promising technique for the integration of QKD in already deployed long-haul telecommunication fiber networks is the Twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) protocol, but it requires that the communication channel is stable in terms of phase oscillations and it is free from background light, that reduces the transmission key-rate. Recently, we presented a solution [1] to the phase stabilization problem, derived from atomic clocks comparison technology, demonstrating advantages in performances of real word TF-QKD. Here we quantify and characterize the background photons, analyzing in details their effects on the transmission and the practicalities to reduce their contribution to a negligible level.

TI Fast High-Fidelity Gates for Galvanically-Coupled Fluxonium Qubits Using
   Strong Flux Modulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Long coherence times, large anharmonicity, and robust charge-noise insensitivity render fluxonium qubits an interesting alternative to transmons. Recent experiments have demonstrated record coherence times for low-frequency fluxonium qubits. Here, we propose a galvanic coupling scheme with flux-tunable XX coupling. To implement a high-fidelity entangling root iSWAP gate, we modulate the strength of this coupling and devise variable-time identity gates to synchronize required single-qubit operations. Both types of gates are implemented using strong ac flux drives, lasting for only a few drive periods. We employ a theoretical framework capable of capturing qubit dynamics beyond the rotating-wave approximation as required for such strong drives. We predict an open-system fidelity of F > 0.999 for the root iSWAP gate under realistic conditions.

TI Automatic depth optimization for a quantum approximate optimization
   algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid algorithm whose control parameters are classically optimized. In addition to the variational parameters, the right choice of hyperparameter is crucial for improving the performance of any optimization model. Control depth, or the number of variational parameters, is considered as the most important hyperparameter for QAOA. In this paper we investigate the control depth selection with an automatic algorithm based on proximal gradient descent. The performances of the automatic algorithm are demonstrated on seven-node and ten-node max-cut problems, which show that the control depth can be significantly reduced during the iteration whereas achieving an sufficient level of optimization accuracy. With theoretical convergence guarantee, the proposed algorithm can be used as an efficient tool for choosing the appropriate control depth as a replacement of random search or empirical rules. Moreover, the reduction of control depth will induce a significant reduction in the number of quantum gates in circuit, which improves the applicability of QAOA on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Magnetic field effects in biology from the perspective of the radical
   pair mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Hundreds of studies have found that weak magnetic fields can significantly influence various biological systems. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain elusive. Remarkably, the magnetic energies implicated in these effects are much smaller than thermal energies. Here, we review these observations, and we suggest an explanation based on the radical pair mechanism, which involves the quantum dynamics of the electron and nuclear spins of transient radical molecules. While the radical pair mechanism has been studied in detail in the context of avian magnetoreception, the studies reviewed here show that magnetosensitivity is widespread throughout biology. We review magnetic field effects on various physiological functions, discussing static, hypomagnetic and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as isotope effects. We then review the radical pair mechanism as a potential unifying model for the described magnetic field effects, and we discuss plausible candidate molecules for the radical pairs. We review recent studies proposing that the radical pair mechanism provides explanations for isotope effects in xenon anaesthesia and lithium treatment of hyperactivity, magnetic field effects on the circadian clock, and hypomagnetic field effects on neurogenesis and microtubule assembly. We conclude by discussing future lines of investigation in this exciting new area of quantum biology.

TI Non-Hermitian Generalization of Renyi Entropy
SO ENTROPY
AB From their conception to present times, different concepts and definitions of entropy take key roles in a variety of areas from thermodynamics to information science, and they can be applied to both classical and quantum systems. Among them is the Renyi entropy. It is able to characterize various properties of classical information with a unified concise form. We focus on the quantum counterpart, which unifies the von Neumann entropy, max- and min-entropy, collision entropy, etc. It can only be directly applied to Hermitian systems because it usually requires that the density matrices is normalized. For a non-Hermitian system, the evolved density matrix may not be normalized; i.e., the trace can be larger or less than one as the time evolution. However, it is not well-defined for the Renyi entropy with a non-normalized probability distribution relevant to the density matrix of a non-Hermitian system, especially when the trace of the non-normalized density matrix is larger than one. In this work, we investigate how to describe the Renyi entropy for non-Hermitian systems more appropriately. We obtain a concisely and generalized form of alpha-Renyi entropy, which we extend the unified order-alpha from finite positive real numbers to zero and infinity. Our generalized alpha-Renyi entropy can be directly calculated using both of the normalized and non-normalized density matrices so that it is able to describe non-Hermitian entropy dynamics. We illustrate the necessity of our generalization by showing the differences between ours and the conventional Renyi entropy for non-Hermitian detuning two-level systems.

However, NNI can not approximate the long time evolution in such systems. We consider the system with the intensity of the spin-spin interaction -1/r alpha, alpha > 3, and find the low boundary alpha c of applicability of the NNI to the evolution of an arbitrary one-excitation initial quantum state in the homogeneous spin chain governed by the XX-Hamiltonian. We obtain the logarithmic dependence of alpha c on the chain length.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Self-Heating Effects in RF Region of FDSOI MOSFETs at Cryogenic

SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB Radio-frequency (RF) circuits are crucial to qubit manipulation, for which transistor self-heating effects may influence performance and possibly change the quantum state. This paper presents an analytical RF model of FDSOI MOSFETs considering dynamic self-heating effects down to 3.3 K for the first time. Parameter extraction involves analytical calculation and optimization using the iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRLS) and Monte Carlo methods. The temperature rise is estimated by capturing the correlation between thermal resistance and device temperature. This work provides a method for modeling FDSOI RF performance and for analyzing dynamic self-heating effects at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Enhancement of radiation detection performance with reduction of
   EH6/7 deep levels in n-type 4H-SiC through thermal oxidation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report the effect of EH6/7 electron trap centers alone on the performance of high-resolution radiation detectors fabricated on n-type 4H-SiC epitaxial layers. A Schottky barrier detector (SBD) and a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor detector fabricated using two sister samples derived from the same 50 mu m 4H-SiC parent wafer exhibited widely different energy resolutions of 0.4% and 0.9% for 5486 keV alpha particles. An equivalent noise charge model analysis ruled out the effect of the detector capacitance and the leakage current on the resolution of the detectors. Deep level transient spectroscopic studies revealed the presence of two trapping centers in each detector within the temperature scan range 240-800 K. The Z(1/2) center, a potential electron trap, was detected in both the detectors in equal concentration, which suggested that the observed difference in the energy resolution is due to the presence of the other defect, the EH6/7 center, in the SBD. The capture cross section of the EH6/7 center was calculated to be three orders of magnitude higher than the second defect [a carbon antisite vacancy (CAV) center] observed in the MOS detector with an activation energy of 1.10 eV, which accounted for the enhanced electronic trapping in the SBD leading to its poor energy resolution. It has been proposed that the EH6/7 centers in the SBD have likely been reconfigured to CAV pairs during the thermal growth of the silicon dioxide layer in the MOS detector. The proposed formation mechanism of CAV, a stable qubit state for quantum information processing, addresses the outstanding questions related to the role of defect dynamics in their formation.

TI Hybrid Integrated Silicon Photonics Based on Nanomaterials
SO PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonic platforms have rapidly emerged as highly promising and extensively investigated systems for advancing classical and quantum information technologies, since their ability to seamlessly integrate photonic components within the telecommunication band with existing silicon-based industrial processes offers significant advantages. However, despite this integration facilitating the development of novel devices, fostering fast and reliable communication protocols and the manipulation of quantum information, traditional integrated silicon photonics faces inherent physical limitations that necessitate a challenging trade-off between device efficiency and spatial footprint. To address this issue, researchers are focusing on the integration of nanoscale materials into photonic platforms, offering a novel approach to enhance device performance while reducing spatial requirements. These developments are of paramount importance in both classical and quantum information technologies, potentially revolutionizing the industry. In this review, we explore the latest endeavors in hybrid photonic platforms leveraging the combination of integrated silicon photonic platforms and nanoscale materials, allowing for the unlocking of increased device efficiency and compact form factors. Finally, we provide insights into future developments and the evolving landscape of hybrid integrated photonic nanomaterial platforms.

TI Precision is not limited by the second law of thermodynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Physical devices operating out of equilibrium are affected by thermal fluctuations, limiting their operational precision. This issue is particularly pronounced at microscopic and quantum scales, where its mitigation requires additional entropy dissipation. Understanding this constraint is important for both fundamental physics and technological design. Clocks, for example, need a thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium to measure time, resulting in a minimum entropy dissipation per clock tick. Although classical and quantum models often show a linear relationship between precision and dissipation, the ultimate bounds on this relationship remain unclear. Here we present an autonomous quantum many-body clock model that achieves clock precision that scales exponentially with entropy dissipation. This is enabled by coherent transport in a spin chain with tailored couplings, where dissipation is confined to a single link. The result demonstrates that coherent quantum dynamics can surpass the traditional thermodynamic precision limits, potentially guiding the development of future high-precision, low-dissipation quantum devices.

AB Dynamic quantum circuits enable adaptive operations through intermediate measurements and classical feedback. Current transpilation toolchains, such as Qiskit and T|ket., however, fail to fully exploit branch-specific simplifications. In this work, we propose recursive branch expansion as a novel technique which systematically expands and refines conditional branches. Our method complements existing transpilers by creating additional opportunities for branch-specific simplifications without altering the overall circuit functionality. Using randomly generated circuits with varying patterns and scales, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the depth and gate count of execution paths of dynamic circuits. We also showcase the potential of our method to enable optimizations on error-corrected circuits.

AB We give a finite presentation by generators and relations for the group O-n(Z[1/2])of n-dimensional orthogonal matrices with entries in Z[1/2]. We then obtain a similar presentation for the group of n-dimensional orthogonal matrices of the form M/v2(k), where k is a nonnegative integer and M is an integer matrix. Both groups arise in the study of quantum circuits. In particular, when the dimension is a power of 2, the elements of the latter group are precisely the unitary matrices that can be represented by a quantum circuit over the universal gate set consisting of the Toffoli gate, the Hadamard gate, and the computational ancilla.

TI Asynchronism and nonequilibrium phase transitions in (1+1)-dimensional
   quantum cellular automata
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Probabilistic cellular automata provide a simple framework for exploring classical nonequilibrium processes. Recently, quantum cellular automata have been proposed that rely on the propagation of a one-dimensional quantum state along a fictitious discrete time dimension via the sequential application of quantum gates. The resulting (1 + 1)-dimensional space-time structure makes these automata special cases of recurrent quantum neural networks which can implement broad classes of classical nonequilibrium processes. Here, we present a general prescription by which these models can be extended into genuinely quantum nonequilibrium models via the systematic inclusion of asynchronism. This is illustrated for the classical contact process, where the resulting model is closely linked to the quantum contact process (QCP), developed in the framework of open quantum systems. Studying the mean-field behavior of the model, we find evidence of an "asynchronism transition, " i.e., a sudden qualitative change in the phase transition behavior once a certain degree of asynchronicity is surpassed, a phenomenon we link to observations in the QCP.

TI Spatiotemporal spread of Fermi-edge singularity as time-delayed
   interaction and impact on time-dependent RKKY-type coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fermi-edge singularity and Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe are paradigmatic examples of non-equilibrium many-body physics in conductors, appearing after a quench is created by the sudden change of a localized potential. We investigate if the signal carried by the quench can be used to transmit a long ranged interaction, reminiscent of the RKKY interaction, but with the inclusion of the full many-body propagation over space and time. We calculate the response of a conductor to two quenches induced by localized states at different times and locations. We show that building up and maintaining coherence between the localized states is possible only with finely tuned interaction between the localized states and the conductor. This puts bounds to the use of time controlled RKKY type interactions and may limit the speed at which some quantum gates could operate.

TI Unidirectional transmission of funnel-shaped waveguide with complete
   bandgap
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB It will be a future trend to apply quantum photonic technology to communication technology and information processing. One of major developing directions of quantum photonic technology is the miniaturization and on-chip integration. Like the diodes in integrated electric circuitry, optical unidirectional transmitter devices (UTDs) play an important role in processing the quantum information and also represent the main components of integrated optical devices. Thus, the design of UTDs has become one of the research hotspots. With photonic bandgap and localization characteristics, as well as easy micro-nano scaled integration, the photonic crystals (PCs) are often preferred when used to develop micro-nano integrated optical devices. At present, the common methods of achieving UTD with photonic crystals include directional bandgap mismatch, asymmetrical coupling by a micro-cavity, odd-even mode conversion, total reflection of photonic crystals with grating and photonic crystal heterostructure, etc. However, these optical unidirectional transmitters gained through the above methods generally have a low forward transmission, narrow working band, complex structure, etc. In the paper a novel method of UTD is put forward based on photonic crystal and a UTD of funnel-shaped waveguide is designed. The design of the device is divided into two parts: optimal funnel waveguide design and optimal point defect design. The band structure of TE polarized photonic crystal is calculated by R-soft. A triangular lattice circular air hole photonic crystal with complete photonic band gap is used as the initial structure and line defects are introduced to form a funnel-shaped waveguide structure (FSWS). The FSWS consists of the first waveguide W1, the second waveguide W2 and a funnel cavity. The funnel cavity is shaped like a funnel and located at the coupling between W1 and W2. Owing to the unique characteristics of the waveguide, the light wave transmission will be localized in the waveguide, which is conducive to improving the forward transmission. The influence of width variation of W2 with forward and backward incident light are analyzed by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and W2 is selected as a waveguide formed by removing 11 rows of air holes. The FSWS achieves the initial asymmetric transmission, while the backward transmission remains high. Further studies are conducted to introduce four types of point defects to suppress the backward transmittance. The point defects refer to moving one or two air holes. In the work the FDTD is also used to calculate four kinds of point defect backward transmittance spectra and optimize the positions of point defects. Finally, it is found that when the optimal point defect mode is type I and d = 5a, the forward transmission (Tf) and transmission contrast (C) at 1550 nm are 0.716 and 0.929, respectively. Working bandwidth (B) can be increased up to 111 nm (1501-1612 nm). By mode analysis, it is found that the point defect introduces mode mismatch between W1 and W2, by converting the fundamental mode in W2 into high-order modes. Thus, the back-propagating light waves in W2 cannot effectively couple into W1, resulting in complete blockage of backward propagation. In addition, the structure is made of silicon based air hole photonic crystal. The 2D air-hole PC slab is mature and even compatible with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing. The designed UTD is easy to implement, and has the advantages of simplicity and high unidirectional transmission characteristics.
   Therefore, it can provide a new solution for UTDs with higher requirements for integrated optical path at present.

TI Dynamical properties of quantum Fisher information of a two-level atoms
   interacting with two-mode superposition coherent state
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A quantum cavity filled with a nonlinear medium (Kerr like medium) and contains a 2 mode field interacting with time dependence of 2-qubit is investigated. Part of the two qubits interact in the form of an amplifier, while the other is in the form of a ladder. The constants of motion are calculated by using the Heisenberg differential equation. Moreover, the analytical solution is calculated by solving the Schrodinger differential equations. Some statistical quantities are calculated to identify the features of the proposed model. The effective of the nonlinear term on the phenomena of collapse and revival are discussed through atomic population. The amount of entanglement between the quantum subsystem, whether it is between the 2-qubit and the cavity field, or between the 2-qubit together are calculated using the linear entropy and the concurrence. The results indicated that there is a superstructure between the atomic population and the linear entropy, concurrence. The intensity of oscillations decreases for the entanglement between the field and the two qubits when the Kerr like medium of the Hamiltonian system is included. The nonclassical distribution of the quantum system decreases after taking Kerr like medium into account. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TI Spin squeezing from bilinear spin-spin interactions: Two simple theorems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We prove two simple theorems about squeezing induced by bilinear spin-spin interactions that conserve spin parity-including a vast majority of quantum spin models implemented by state-of-the-art quantum simulators. In particular we show that squeezing captures the first form of quantum correlations which are produced (1) at equilibrium, by adiabatically turning on the spin-spin interactions starting from a factorized state aligned with an external, arbitrary field; and (2) away from equilibrium, by evolving unitarily the same state with the interacting Hamiltonian.

TI Work extraction from coupled qubits in equilibrium and nonequilibrium
   thermal reservoirs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a two-qubit quantum system, where each qubit is coupled to an independent thermal reservoir, either bosonic or fermionic. Using a master equation approach, we analyze both steady-state and time-dependent ergotropy to understand how different reservoir statistics affect work extraction. In bosonic environments, ergotropy consistently declines with increasing temperature due to thermal noise. In contrast, fermionic reservoirs exhibit more complex behavior, with ergotropy enhanced by particle transport under non-equilibrium conditions. Our results reveal a threshold-like sensitivity to the chemical potential configuration, leading to qualitatively distinct regimes of energy storage performance. Time-resolved analyses show that the system's approach to steady state varies depending on the type of reservoir and the coupling strength between qubits. These insights highlight how carefully engineered reservoir properties and non-equilibrium driving can be leveraged to optimize quantum battery performance.

TI Modeling realistic multilayer devices for superconducting quantum
   electronic circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current-phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits, it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Robustness of the projected squeezed state protocol
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Projected squeezed (PS) states are multipartite entangled states generated by unitary spin squeezing, followed by a collective quantum measurement and postselection. They can lead to an appreciable decrease in the state preparation time of the maximally entangled N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state when compared to deterministic preparation by unitary transformations in physical systems where spin squeezing can be realized, such as ion, neutral atom, and superconducting qubits. Here we simulate the generation of PS states in nonideal experimental conditions with relevant decoherence channels. By employing the Kraus operator method and quantum trajectory method to reduce the computational complexity, we assess the quantum Fisher information and overlap fidelity with an ideal GHZ state. Our findings highlight PS states as useful metrological resources, demonstrating a robustness against environmental effects with increasing qubit number N.

TI Weighted monogamy and polygamy relations
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB This research offers a comprehensive approach to strengthening both monogamous and polygamous relationships within the context of quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems. We present the most stringent bounds for both monogamy and polygamy in multipartite systems compared to recently established relations. We show that whenever a bound is given (named it monogamy or polygamy), our bound indexed by some parameter s will always be stronger than the given bound. The study includes detailed examples, highlighting that our findings exhibit greater strength across all existing cases in comparison.

TI Computational tools for the simulation and analysis of spin-polarized
   EPR spectra
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE
AB The EPR spectra of paramagnetic species induced by photoexcitation typically exhibit enhanced absorp-tive and emissive features resulting from sublevel populations that differ from thermal equilibrium. The populations and the resulting spin polarization of the spectra are dictated by the selectivity of the pho-tophysical process generating the observed state. Simulation of the spin-polarized EPR spectra is crucial in the characterization of both the dynamics of formation of the photoexcited state as well as its elec-tronic and structural properties. EasySpin, the simulation toolbox for EPR spectroscopy, now includes extended support for the simulation of the EPR spectra of spin-polarized states of arbitrary spin multi-plicity and formed by a variety of different mechanisms, including photoexcited triplet states populated by intersystem crossing, charge recombination or spin polarization transfer, spin-correlated radical pairs created by photoinduced electron transfer, triplet pairs formed by singlet fission and multiplet states arising from photoexcitation in systems containing chromophores and stable radicals. In this paper, we highlight EasySpin's capabilities for the simulation of spin-polarized EPR spectra on the basis of illustra-tive examples from the literature in a variety of fields ranging across chemistry, biology, material science and quantum information science.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI Measurement outcomes that do not occur and their role in entanglement
   transformations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The characterization of transformations among entangled pure states via local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) is a crucial problem in quantum information theory for both theoretical and practical reasons. As LOCC has a highly intricate structure, sometimes the larger set of separable (SEP) maps is considered, which has a mathematically much simpler description. In the literature, mainly SEP maps consisting of invertible Kraus operators have been taken into account. In this paper we show that the consideration of those maps is not sufficient when deciding whether a state can be mapped to another via general SEP transformations. This is done by providing explicit examples of transformations among pure three- and five-qubit states, which are feasible via SEP maps containing singular Kraus operators, however, not possible via SEP maps containing solely regular Kraus operators. The key point that allows to construct the SEP maps is to introduce projective measurements that occur with probability zero on the input state. The fact that it is not sufficient to consider SEP maps composed out of regular Kraus operators even in the case of pure state transformations, also affects the results on LOCC transformations among pure states. However, we show that non-invertible Kraus operators do not help in state transformations under LOCC with finitely many rounds of classical communication, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SEP transformations with invertible Kraus operators is still a necessary condition for convertibility under finite-round LOCC. Moreover, we show that the results on transformations via SEP that are not possible with LOCC (including infinitely many rounds of classical communication) presented in Hebenstreit et al 2016 Phys. Rev. A 93, 012339 are not affected.

TI Bound Entangled States Are Useful in Prepare-and-Measure Scenarios
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show that bipartite bound entangled states make possible violations of correlation inequalities in the prepare-and-measure scenario. These inequalities are satisfied by all classical models as well as by all quantum models that do not feature entanglement. In contrast to the known Bell inequality violations from bound entangled states, we find that the violations in the prepare-and-measure scenario are sizeable and significantly noise-tolerant. Furthermore, we show that significantly stronger quantum correlations are made possible by considering bound entanglement with a larger dimension.

TI Operational Detection of Entanglement via Quantum Designs
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB From an operational point of view, several new entanglement detection criteria are proposed using quantum designs. These criteria are constructed by considering the correlations defined with quantum designs. Counter-intuitively, the criteria with more settings are exactly equivalent to the corresponding ones with the minimal number of settings, namely the symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC POVMs). Fundamentally, this observation highlights the potentially unique role played by SIC POVMs in quantum information processing. Experimentally, this provides the minimal number of settings that one should choose for detecting entanglement. Furthermore, it is found that nonlinear criteria are not always better than linear ones for the task of entanglement detection.

TI Effect of relativistic acceleration on tripartite entanglement of
   Gaussian states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
AB The performance of quantum information protocols can be impacted by the noninertial motion of parties such as in a gravitational field. Previous studies have primarily focused on the degradation of entanglement for global modes, revealing that bipartite entanglement vanishes in the limit of large acceleration, whereas tripartite entanglement does not. In this study, we examine the impact of acceleration on tripartite Gaussian resource states encoded in spatially localized wave packets. Contrarily to prior findings, we observe that genuine tripartite entanglement (GTE) vanishes in the limit of large acceleration for various initial states and observer trajectories.

TI Noise-Aware Variational Eigensolvers: A Dissipative Route for Lattice
   Gauge Theories
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a novel variational ansatz for the ground-state preparation of the Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) in quantum simulators. It combines dissipative and unitary operations in a completely deterministic scheme with a circuit depth that does not scale with the size of the considered lattice. We find that, with very few variational parameters, the ansatz can achieve >99% precision in energy in both the confined and deconfined phase of the Z(2) LGT. We benchmark our proposal against the unitary Hamiltonian variational ansatz showing a reduction in the required number of variational layers to achieve a target precision. After performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we show that our dissipative variational ansatz can predict accurate critical exponents without requiring a number of layers that scales with the system size, which is the standard situation for unitary ansatze. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of this variational eigensolver subject to circuit-level noise, determining variational error thresholds that fix the error rate below which it would be beneficial to increase the number of layers. In light of these quantities and for typical gate errors p in current quantum processors, we provide a detailed assessment of the prospects of our scheme to explore the Z(2) LGT on near-term devices.

TI Ground-state microwave-stimulated Raman transitions and adiabatic spin
   transfer in the 15N nitrogen vacancy center
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Microwave pulse sequences are the basis of coherent manipulation of the electronic spin ground state in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. In this work we demonstrate stimulated Raman transitions (SRTs) and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), two ways to drive the dipole-forbidden transition between two spin sublevels in the electronic triplet ground state of the NV center. This driving is achieved by a two-photon Raman microwave pulse which simultaneously drives two detuned transitions via a virtual level for SRTs or via two adiabatic and partially overlapping resonant microwave pulses for STIRAP. We lay the theoretical framework of SRT and STIRAP dynamics and verify experimentally the theoretical predictions of population inversion by observing the dipole-forbidden transition in the ground state of a single NV center. A comparison of the two schemes showed better robustness and success of the spin swap for STIRAP compared to SRT.

TI Control optimization for parametric Hamiltonians by pulse reconstruction
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB Optimal control techniques provide a means to tailor the control pulses required to generate customized quantum gates, which helps to improve the resilience of quantum simulations to gate errors and device noise. However, the significant amount of (classical) computation required to generate customized gates can quickly undermine the effectiveness of this approach, especially when pulse optimization needs to be iterated. We propose a method to reduce the computational time required to generate the control pulse for a Hamiltonian that is parametrically dependent on a time-varying quantity. We use simple interpolation schemes to accurately reconstruct the control pulses from a set of pulses obtained in advance for a discrete set of predetermined parameter values. We obtain a reconstruction with very high fidelity and a significant reduction in computational effort. We report the results of the application of the proposed method to device-level quantum simulations of the unitary (real) time evolution of two interacting neutrons based on superconducting qubits.

TI Automation of the Photobioreactor Lighting System to Manage Light
   Distribution in Microalgae Cultures
SO ENERGIES
AB Automation of the lighting system for phototrophiccultures in photobioreactors is a process of automation and control of lighting inside. Photosynthetic microorganisms, in order to develop and grow, require a species-specific type of visible light radiation. The automation of the lighting system was based on the industrial PLC Modicon TM221C24T controller according to the submitted and received patent No. 242154. The system was integrated with a quantum sensor, which allows for setting the colour of light and controlling the intensity and exposure time based on protocols set by the operator. The data obtained from the PAR photosynthetically active radiation sensor make it possible to adjust the distribution of light to the actual needs of the culture's radiant energy. The unit also allows for remote control of multiculture farms. It allows you to simulate sunrise and sunset using the astronomical clock function set for a given species of microalgae. Ultimately, the work was undertaken on the implementation and use of a system for measuring the light spectrum at each point of the bioreactor using a fibre-optic immersion probe.

Here we show how topologically distinct local integrals of motion, variationally parametrized by quantum circuits, can be used to numerically demonstrate the topological inequivalence of MBL phases. We illustrate our approach on a fermionic chain where both topologically distinct MBL phases and benchmark comparisons to order parameters are possible. We also use our approach, augmented by the excited state density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, to extract high-energy topological doublets. We describe applying our methods to higher dimensions to identify MBL topological order and topological multiplets hidden by the dense many-body spectrum.

TI Exactly solvable model of light-scattering errors in quantum simulations

AB We analytically solve a model for light scattering in Ising dynamics of metastable atomic qubits, generalizing the approach of Foss-Feig et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87 , 042101 (2013)] to include leakage outside the qubit manifold. We analyze the influence of these fundamental errors in simulations of proposed experiments with metastable levels of 40 Ca + ions in a Penning trap. We find that "effective magnetic fields" generated by leaked qubits have significant impacts on spin-spin correlation functions for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation or for quantum simulations with strong coupling, while spin squeezing uses a much weaker coupling and is largely insensitive to the simulated leakage errors, even with a few hundred ions. Our theory and results are expected to be useful in modeling a variety of metastable qubit experiments in the future.

TI Quantum-resistance in blockchain networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The advent of quantum computing threatens blockchain protocols and networks because they utilize non-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms. When quantum computers become robust enough to run Shor's algorithm on a large scale, the most used asymmetric algorithms, utilized for digital signatures and message encryption, such as RSA, (EC)DSA, and (EC)DH, will be no longer secure. Quantum computers will be able to break them within a short period of time. Similarly, Grover's algorithm concedes a quadratic advantage for mining blocks in certain consensus protocols such as proof of work. Today, there are hundreds of billions of dollars denominated in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that rely on blockchain ledgers as well as thousands of blockchain-based applications storing value in blockchain networks. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications require solutions that guarantee quantum resistance in order to preserve the integrity of data and assets in these public and immutable ledgers. The quantum threat and some potential solutions are well understood and presented in the literature. However, most proposals are theoretical, require large QKD networks, or propose new quantum-resistant blockchain networks to be built from scratch. Our work, which is presented in this paper, is pioneer in proposing an end-to-end framework for post-quantum blockchain networks that can be applied to existing blockchain to achieve quantum-resistance. We have developed an open-source implementation in an Ethereum-based (i.e., EVM compatible) network that can be extended to other existing blockchains. For the implementation we have (i) used quantum entropy to generate post-quantum key pairs, (ii) established post-quantum TLS connections and X.509 certificates to secure the exchange of information between blockchain nodes over the internet without needing a large QKD network, (iii) introduced a post-quantum second signature in transactions using Falcon-512 post-quantum keys, and (iv) developed the first on-chain verification of post-quantum signatures using three different mechanisms that are compared and analyzed: Solidity smart-contracts run by the validators for each transaction, modified EVM Opcode, and precompiled smart contracts.

TI Simultaneous cooling by measuring one ancillary system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a simultaneous-cooling protocol for a double-resonator system via projective measurements on an ancillary V-type qutrit. Through repeated measurements on the ground state of the ancillary system, the two resonators can be cooled down to their respective ground states from thermal states. With respect to the measurement-based cooling, an optimized measurement interval topt is analytically obtained, which is inversely proportional to the collective thermal Rabi frequency Oth as a function of the resonators??? average population of the last round. Under about only 20 optimized measurements, the average population of the target resonators can be reduced by six orders in magnitude. Our simultaneous or collective cooling protocol is scalable to the systems with more numbers of resonators and robust to the fluctuation in the resonator frequency. Also we discuss the robustness of our cooling protocol against the thermal environment and the measurement error.

TI Area operator and fixed area states in conformal field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The fixed area states are previously discussed in the quantum error-correction codes interpretation of AdS/CFT. The dual bulk geometry is constructed by gravitational path integrals. In this paper we show the fixed area states correspondence in conformal field theories (CFTs), which are associated with the spectrum decomposition of reduced density matrix rho(A) for a subsystem A. For two-dimensional CFTs we directly build the bulk metric, which is consistent with the expected geometry of the fixed area states. For arbitrary pure state vertical bar psi > with a geometric dual in the bulk we also find the consistency by using the gravity dual of Renyi entropy. We also obtain the parameters relation between the bulk geometry and boundary state. The pure state l psi > can be expanded as a superposition of the fixed area states. Motivated by this, we propose an area operator (A) over cap (psi). The fixed area state is the eigenstate of (A) over cap (psi), the associated eigenvalue is related to the Renyi entropy of subsystem A in this state. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula can be expressed as the expectation value (psi vertical bar(A) over cap (psi)vertical bar psi) divided by 4G, where G is the Newton constant. We further show the fluctuation of the area operator in the geometric state l psi > is suppressed in the semiclassical limit G -> 0.

TI Quantum scrambling and DNA based multilayer image encryption with QTRNG
   and 6D hyperchaotic keys
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Secure data communication is in growing demand in today's 6G era. Cryptographic schemes must be employed to protect the data over the air and facilitate secure communication. This paper proposes a novel quantum image encryption algorithm with Quantum True Random Number Generation (QTRNG) and an image-dependent 6D hyperchaotic system to enhance security. RX and RZ quantum gates generated Quantum True Random key sequences by introducing an exponential phase shift to the input. The encryption process integrates multistage DNA encoding and QTRNG to develop the initial encrypted image, which is represented by Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR). The encrypted image is hashed using SHA-384 to generate 6D keys, followed by Quantum Fibonacci and bit-level scrambling to perform further quantum encryption. This process is repeated over three stages, each employing different hyperchaotic keys, DNA rules, and operations. The encryption metrics confirm the algorithm's reliability and robustness regarding security.

TI Optimized Quantum Phase Estimation for Simulating Electronic States in
   Various Energy Regimes
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB While quantum algorithms for simulations exhibit better asymptotic scaling than their classical counterparts, they currently cannot be accurately implemented on real-world devices. Instead, chemists and computer scientists rely on costly classical simulations of these quantum algorithms. In particular, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is among several approaches that has attracted much attention in recent years due to its genuine quantum character. However, it is memory-intensive to simulate and intractable for moderate system sizes. This paper discusses the performance and applicability of QPESIM, a new simulation of the QPE algorithm designed to take advantage of modest computational resources. In particular, we demonstrate the versatility of QPESIM in simulating various electronic states by examining the ground and core-level states of H2O. For these states, we also discuss the effect of the active-space size on the quality of the calculated energies. For the high-energy core-level states, we demonstrate that new QPE simulations for active spaces defined by 15 active orbitals significantly reduce the errors in core-level excitation energies compared to earlier QPE simulations using smaller active spaces.

TI Intelligent Generative Models for Quantum Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The potential of quantum neural networks (QNN) for applications in several fields has been widely demonstrated, but hyperparameter selection remains a technical challenge. The complexity of combinatorial optimization rises dramatically as the dimensionality of the hyperparameter space increases, making hyperparameter selection exceptionally complex. Traditional manual trial-and-error methods are both time-consuming and expensive. To break through this bottleneck, the Ansatz structure set is proposed and the Hyperband algorithm is utilized to combine the structure set with the stacking number and algorithmic hyperparameters to propose the Hyperband-QNN model. The model can intelligently generate QNN according to the actual data features, and in practical applications in many fields such as medicine and agriculture, it performs well compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the quantum algorithms QSVM and QKNN, and when it is used to deal with the large-scale data, the efficiency advantage becomes more obvious with the increase of the number of samples. This not only proves the advantages of Hyperband-QNN model in practical applications but also provides useful exploration and reference for the integration of traditional algorithms and quantum algorithms in practical problems and the play of their respective advantages.

TI Three classes of propagation rules for generalized Reed-Solomon codes
   and their applications to EAQECCs
SO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we study the Hermitian hulls of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes over finite fields. For a given class of GRS codes, by extending the length, increasing the dimension, and extending the length and increasing the dimension at the same time, we obtain three classes of GRS codes with Hermitian hulls of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, based on some known q 2-ary Hermitian self-orthogonal GRS codes with dimension q - 1, we obtain several classes of q 2-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with Hermitian hulls of arbitrary dimensions. It is worth noting that the dimension of these MDS codes can be taken from q to n 2 , and the parameters of these MDS codes can be more flexible by propagation rules. As an application, we derive three new propagation rules for MDS entanglement-assisted quantum error correction codes (EAQECCs) constructed from GRS codes. Then, from the presently known GRS codes with Hermitian hulls, we can directly obtain many MDS EAQECCs with more flexible parameters. Finally, we present several new classes of (MDS) EAQECCs with flexible parameters, and the distance of these codes can be taken from q + 1 to n + 2 2 . (c) 2025 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Bulk-to-boundary anyon fusion from microscopic models
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Topological quantum error correction based on the manipulation of the anyonic defects constitutes one of the most promising frameworks towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum devices. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these defects interact with external defects such as boundaries or domain walls. Motivated by this line of thought, in this work, we study the fusion events between anyons in the bulk and at the boundary in fixed-point models of 2 + 1-dimensional non-chiral topological order defined by arbitrary fusion categories. Our construction uses generalized tube algebra techniques to construct a bi-representation of bulk and boundary defects. We explicitly derive a formula to calculate the fusion multiplicities of a bulk-to-boundary fusion event for twisted quantum double models and calculate some exemplary fusion events for Abelian models and the (twisted) quantum double model of S-3, the simplest non-Abelian group-theoretical model. Moreover, we use the folding trick to study the anyonic behavior at non-trivial domain walls between twisted S-3 and twisted Z(2) as well as Z(3) models. A recurring theme in our construction is an isomorphism relating twisted cohomology groups to untwisted ones. The results of this work can directly be applied to study logical operators in two-dimensional topological error correcting codes with boundaries described by a twisted gauge theory of a finite group.
