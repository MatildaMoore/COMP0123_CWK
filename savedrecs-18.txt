TI Engineering quantum reservoirs through Krylov complexity, expressivity,
   and observability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This study employs Krylov-based information measures to understand task performance in quantum reservoir computing, a subfield of quantum machine learning. In our study, we show that fidelity and spread complexity can only explain the task performance for short time evolutions of the quantum systems. We then discuss two measures, Krylov expressivity and Krylov observability, and compare them to task performance and the information processing capacity. Our results show that Krylov observability exhibits almost identical behavior to information processing capacity, while being three orders of magnitudes faster to compute. In the case when the system is undersampled, Krylov observability best captures the behavior of the task performance.

TI A Quantum Formulation for Clustering Edge Topologies

AB Edge topologies usually comprise many different computational nodes, each with limited resources. Moreover, they manage varying workloads that can access the system from different entry points. These key characteristics make the problem of selecting the nodes dedicated to a specific workload quite heavy. In this context, clustering, that is, organizing nodes into smaller, more manageable groups, is a critical first step to support effective decision making.
   This paper introduces Min-Distance Based Clustering (M-DBC), a novel quantum-based model for clustering edge topologies that utilizes quantum annealing. By recasting the clustering task as a quantum optimization problem, we can easily identify the appropriate clusters of edge nodes and nearby demand sources in a spatially aware manner. Our approach enables fast, periodic clustering executions, allowing the edge topology to adapt quickly to continuously changing conditions. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method and demonstrate clear gains in scalability and execution times while maintaining almost optimal solution quality.

TI A Comprehensive Survey on Pre Versus Post Quantum Security Schemes for
   5G-Enabled IoT Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The proliferation of 5th generation (5G) technology has catalyzed significant advancements in various application of Internet of Things (IoT) such as Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Energy, Industrial IoT (IIoT), Digital Twins, Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Smart Health. However, with the upcoming advent of quantum computing, conventional security methods are encountering new and significant challenges, requiring the revaluation of pre and post-quantum security measures. This study provides an in-depth analysis of security measures before and after the advent of quantum computing for intelligent IoT applications enabled by 5G-connected network. The survey thoroughly analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of conventional public key cryptography methods such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Secret Sharing, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which are susceptible to quantum risks, and postquantum cryptographic methods such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate based techniques, which may provide protection against quantum attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the suitability of these strategies in the context of 5G-enabled IoT deployments, taking into account the distinct requirements and obstacles presented by interconnected IoT devices. Although pre quantum public key cryptographic algorithms are still in use, but active research is going on to design and implement PQC algorithms to secure 5G IoT, while hybrid schemes have shown great promise being backward compatible with traditional cryptographic approaches at the same time bring quantum resistance. The survey offers significant insights into the latest pre and post-quantum security solutions for 5G-enabled IoT Applications. It helps in making educated decisions and implementing strong security measures in preparation for the quantum computing age.

TI Gravitational effects in macroscopic quantum systems: a first-principles
   analysis
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We analyze the weak-field limit of general relativity with matter and its possible quantisations. This analysis aims toward a predictive quantum theory to provide a first-principles description of gravitational effects in macroscopic quantum systems. This includes recently proposed experiments on the generation of (Newtonian) gravitational forces from quantum distributions of matter, and phenomena like gravity-induced entanglement, gravitational cat states, gravity-induced Rabi oscillations, and quantum causal orderings of events. Our main results include: (i) the demonstration that these phenomena do not involve true gravitational degrees of freedom. (ii) We show that, unlike full general relativity, weak gravity with matter is a parameterised field theory, i.e., a theory obtained by promoting spacetime coordinates to 'dynamical' variables. (iii) Quantisation via gauge-fixing leads to an effective field theory that account for some phenomena, but at the price of gauge dependence that manifests more strongly on spacetime observables. This ambiguity is a manifestation of the problem of time that persists even in weak gravity. (iv) A consistent quantisation of parameterised field theories is essential for a predictive and spacetime covariant theory of weak gravity that describes gravitational effects in macroscopic quantum systems. We also discuss the implication of our results to gravitational decoherence theories, the notion of locality in gravity vis-a-vis quantum information theory, and the intriguing possibility that proposed solutions to the problem of time can be tested in weak-gravity quantum experiments.

TI Optimally Generating su(2N) Using Pauli Strings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Any quantum computation consists of a sequence of unitary evolutions described by a finite set of Hamiltonians. When this set is taken to consist of only products of Pauli operators, we show that the minimal such set generating su(2(N)) contains 2N + 1 elements. We provide a number of examples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for producing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation, which is shown to have optimal complexity. We also observe that certain sets generate su(2(N)) at a faster rate than others, and we show how this rate can be optimized by tuning the fraction of anticommuting pairs of generators. Finally, we briefly comment on implications for measurement-based and trapped ion quantum computation as well as the construction of fault-tolerant gate sets.

TI Q-Learning for Resource-Aware and Adaptive Routing in Trusted-Relay QKD
   Network
SO PHOTONICS
AB Efficient and scalable quantum key scheduling remains a critical challenge in trusted-relay Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks due to imbalanced key resource utilization, dynamic key consumption, and topology-induced congestion. This paper presents a Q-learning-based adaptive routing framework designed to optimize quantum key delivery in dynamic QKD networks. The model formulates routing as a Markov Decision Process, with a compact state representation that combines the current node, destination node, and discretized key occupancy levels. The reward function is designed to jointly penalize resource imbalance and rapid key depletion while promoting traversal through links with sustainable key generation, guiding the agent toward balanced and congestion-aware decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the Q-learning scheduler outperforms non-adaptive baseline algorithms, achieving an average distribution time of approximately 100 s compared with 170-590 s for the baseline algorithms, a throughput of 61 keys/s compared with 32-55 keys/s, and a failure ratio limited to 0-0.1, demonstrating superior scalability, congestion resilience, and resource-efficient decision-making in dynamic QKD networks.

TI Delta-Adjust: Minimum Distance Interpolation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We present Delta-Adjust, a novel interpolation method that extends local neighborhood interpolation techniques by introducing per-feature neighbor selection and feature-vector difference bias adjustment. Unlike conventional prediction models, Delta-Adjust operates without explicit training phases. It leverages the structure of information entangled within the dataset to interpolate across a domain using small, local adjustments. This mechanism enables Delta-Adjust to infer a valid global representation of data only from local relationships. This formulation applies indifferently to both regression and classification problems, and potentially to broader predictive tasks. Though not a machine learning model in the conventional sense, Delta-Adjust can be used for predictive modeling due to its structure-preserving nature. Our experiments demonstrate strong performance across standard benchmarks (Iris: F1=0.94; Breast Cancer: F1=0.86; California Housing: MSE=0.29), while offering competitive interpolation accuracy across synthetic surfaces with discontinuities, curvature, and high-frequency patterns (e.g. Circular Ridges). As a general-purpose interpolation technique intended for ML applications, Delta-Adjust holds potential as a computational primitive for AI pipelines. Its framework, based on local propagation of deltas, naturally accommodates a wide range of predictive tasks and may support future applications in geospatial modeling, computer graphics, sensor networks, and representation learning. This work proposes a new direction for information-aware computation in data-driven systems-relying on local interpolations that cooperatively induce a global model of feature-output relationships. Delta-Adjust achieves this independently of the underlying data distribution, without any training steps, and without requiring explicit assumptions about global model structure.

TI Uncertainties and coherence in DQC1
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Correlations have been identified as a necessary ingredient for the speedup of certain mixed-state quantum computation. In this work, we analyze the model of deterministic quantum computation with one bit (DQC1) and study its information-theoretic aspects involving state-channel interaction. This state-channel interaction provides a new perspective for investigating DQC1. More specifically, by calculating some important information-theoretic quantities related to the state-channel interaction, such as uncertainties, coherence of quantum states as measured with respect to channels, etc., we reveal some basic features of quantum resources for the quantum speedup in this model. Moreover, since the state-channel framework is general enough to encompass all computational models, the studies performed here can be similarly applied to analyze other computational models from the perspective of quantum resources.

AB Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a c(3) locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.

TI Subregion-subalgebra duality: Emergence of space and time in holography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In holographic duality, a higher dimensional quantum gravity system emerges from a lower dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with a large number of degrees of freedom. We propose a formulation of duality for a general causally complete bulk spacetime region, called subregion-subalgebra duality, which provides a framework to describe how geometric notions in the gravity system, such as spacetime subregions, different notions of times, and causal structure, emerge from the dual CFT. Subregionsubalgebra duality generalizes and brings new insights into subregion-subregion duality (or equivalently entanglement wedge reconstruction). It provides a mathematically precise definition of subregionsubregion duality and gives an independent definition of entanglement wedges without using entropy. Geometric properties of entanglement wedges, including those that play a crucial role in interpreting the bulk as a quantum error correcting code, can be understood from the duality as the geometrization of the superadditivity of certain algebras. Using general boundary subalgebras rather than those associated with geometric subregions makes it possible to find duals for general bulk spacetime regions, including those not touching the boundary. Applying subregion-subalgebra duality to a boundary state describing a singlesided black hole also provides a precise way to define mirror operators.

TI Exciton-polariton dynamics of the single site-controlled quantum
   dot-nanocavity in the coexisting strong-weak coupling regime
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Deterministic positioning single site-controlled high symmetric InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) in (111)B-oriented GaAs photonic crystal cavities with nanometer-scale accuracy provides an idea component for building integrated quantum photonic circuits. However, it has been a long-standing challenge of improving cavity Q-factors in such systems. Here, by optimizing the trade-off between the cavity loss and QD spectral quality, we demonstrate our site-controlled QD-nanocavity system operating in the intermediate coupling regime mediated by phonon scattering, with the dynamic coexistence of strong and weak coupling. The cavity-exciton detuning-dependent micro-photoluminescence spectrum reveals concurrence of a trend of exciton-polariton mode avoided crossing, as a signature of Rabi doublet of the strongly coupled system. Meanwhile, a trend of keeping constant or slight blue shift of coupled exciton-cavity mode(CM) energy across zero-detuning is ascribed to the formation of collective states mediated by phonon-assisted coupling, and their rare partial out-of-synchronization linewidth-narrowing is linked to their coexisting strong-weak coupling regime. We further reveal the pump power-dependent anti-bunching photon statistical dynamics of this coexisting strong-weak coupled system and the optical features of strongly confined exciton-polaritons, and dark-exciton-like states. These observations demonstrate the potential capabilities of site-controlled QD-cavity systems as deterministic quantum nodes for on-chip quantum information processing and provide guidelines for future device optimization for achieving the strong coupling regime.

TI Topological protection of coherence in disordered open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider topological protection mechanisms in dissipative quantum systems in the presence of quenched disorder, with the intent to prolong the coherence time of a fiducial qubit. The qubit is part of a network of other qubits and dissipative cavities whose coupling parameters are tunable, such that topological edge states can be stabilized. The evolution of the fiducial qubit is entirely determined by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which thus emerges from a bona fide physical process. Even in the presence of disorder, a winding number W can be defined and evaluated in real space, as long as certain symmetries are preserved. Hence we can construct the topological phase diagrams of noisy open quantum models, such as the non-Hermitian disordered Su-Schrieffer-Heeger dimer model and a trimer model that includes longer-range couplings. For finite-size systems we find that there are precisely W modes localized at one end of the chain. In such topological phases the qubit's coherence lifetime is exponentially large in the system size. In the presence of competing disorder parameters, interesting reentrance phenomena of topologically nontrivial sectors are observed. This means that in certain parameter regions, increasing disorder drastically increases the coherence time of the fiducial qubit.

TI Topologically ordered time crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Time crystals are a dynamical phase of periodically driven quantum many-body systems where discrete time-translation symmetry is broken spontaneously. Time-crystallinity however subtly requires also spatial order, ordinarily related to further symmetries, such as spin-flip symmetry when the spatial order is ferromagnetic. Here we define topologically ordered time crystals, a time-crystalline phase borne out of intrinsic topological order-a particularly robust form of spatial order that requires no symmetry. We show that many-body localization can stabilize this phase against generic perturbations and establish some of its key features and signatures, including a dynamical, time-crystal form of the perimeter law for topological order. We link topologically ordered and ordinary time crystals through three complementary perspectives: higher-form symmetries, quantum error-correcting codes, and a holographic correspondence. Topologically ordered time crystals may be realized in programmable quantum devices, as we illustrate for the Google Sycamore processor.
   The concept of a time crystal is well established, but its interplay with topological order is less explored. Wahl et al. show that time crystals may arise from topological order and that such states make the gauge theoretic perimeter law dynamic, offering a key feature to seek with quantum computers.

TI A complete hierarchy for the pure state marginal problem in quantum
   mechanics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Clarifying the relation between the whole and its parts is crucial for many problems in science. In quantum mechanics, this question manifests itself in the quantum marginal problem, which asks whether there is a global pure quantum state for some given marginals. This problem arises in many contexts, ranging from quantum chemistry to entanglement theory and quantum error correcting codes. In this paper, we prove a correspondence of the marginal problem to the separability problem. Based on this, we describe a sequence of semidefinite programs which can decide whether some given marginals are compatible with some pure global quantum state. As an application, we prove that the existence of multiparticle absolutely maximally entangled states for a given dimension is equivalent to the separability of an explicitly given two-party quantum state. Finally, we show that the existence of quantum codes with given parameters can also be interpreted as a marginal problem, hence, our complete hierarchy can also be used. The quantum marginal problem interrogates the existence of a global pure quantum state with some given marginals. Here, the authors reformulate it as an optimisation problem, and specifically as the existence of a two-party separable state with additional semidefinite constraints.

TI Perfect quantum-state synchronization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the most general mechanisms that lead to perfect synchronization of the quantum states of all subsystems of an open quantum system starting from an arbitrary initial state. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for such "quantum-state synchronization," prove tight lower bounds on the dimension of the ancilla's Hilbert space in two main classes of quantum-state synchronizers, and give an analytical solution for their construction. The functioning of the found quantum-state synchronizer of two qubits is demonstrated experimentally on an IBM quantum computer and we show that the remaining asynchronicity is a sensitive measure of the quantum computer's imperfection.

TI Dynamical Coulomb blockade under a temperature bias
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We observe and comprehend the dynamical Coulomb blockade suppression of the electrical conductance across an electronic quantum channel subjected to a temperature difference. A broadly tunable, spin-polarized Ga(A1)As quantum channel is connected on-chip, through a micron-scale metallic node, to a linear RC circuit. The latter is made up of the node's geometrical capacitance C in parallel with an adjustable resistance R E {1/2, 1/3, 1/4} x hle2 formed by 2-4 quantum Hall channels. The system is characterized by three temperatures: Temperatures of the electrons in the large electrodes (T) and in the node (LAO, and a temperature of the electromagnetic modes of the RC circuit (T-env). The temperature in the node is selectively increased by local Joule dissipation, and characterized from current fluctuations. For a quantum channel in the tunnel regime, a close match is found between conductance measurements and tunnel dynamical Coulomb blockade theory. In the opposite near ballistic regime, we develop a theory that accounts for different electronic and electromagnetic bath temperatures, again in very good agreement with experimental data. Beyond these regimes, for an arbitrary quantum channel set in the far out-of-equilibrium situation where the temperature in the node significantly exceeds the one in the large electrodes, the equilibrium (uniform temperature) prediction for the conductance is recovered, albeit at a rescaled temperature a alpha T-node.

TI Perturbing finite temperature multicomponent DFT 1D Kohn-Sham systems:
   Peierls gap & Kohn anomaly
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB One of the greatest challenges when designing new technologies that make use of non-trivial quantum materials is the difficulty associated with predicting material-specific properties, such as critical temperature, gap parameter, etc. There is naturally a great amount of interest in these types of condensed matter systems because of their application to quantum sensing, quantum electronics, and quantum computation; however, they are exceedingly difficult to address from first principles because of the famous many-body problem. For this reason, a full electron-nuclear quantum calculation will likely remain completely out of reach for the foreseeable future. A practical alternative is provided by finite temperature, multi component density functional theory, which is a formally exact method of computing the equilibrium state energy of a many-body quantum system. In this work, we use this construction alongside a perturbative scheme to demonstrate that the phenomena Peierls effect and Kohn anomaly are both natural features of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations without additional structure needed. We find the temperature dependent ionic density for a simple 1D lattice which is then used to derive the ionic densities temperature dependent affect on the electronic band structure. This is accomplished by Fourier transforming the ionic density term found within this KS electronic equation. Using the Peierls effect phonon distortion gap openings in relation to the Fermi level, we then perturb the KS ionic equation with a conduction electron density, deriving the Kohn anomaly. This provides a workable predictive strategy for interesting electro-phonon related material properties which could be extended to 2D and 3D real materials while retaining the otherwise complicated temperature dependence.

TI Generating and detecting entangled cat states in dissipatively coupled
   degenerate optical parametric oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Gaussian continuous-variable states play a central role both in the foundations of quantum theory and for emergent quantum technologies. In particular, "cat states," i.e., two-component macroscopic quantum superpositions, embody quantum coherence in an accessible way and can be harnessed for fundamental tests and quantum information tasks alike. Degenerate optical parametric oscillators can naturally produce single-mode cat states and thus represent a promising platform for their realization and harnessing. We show that a dissipative coupling between degenerate optical parametric oscillators extends this to two-mode entangled cat states, i.e., two-mode entangled cat states are naturally produced under such dissipative coupling. While overcoming single-photon loss still represents a major challenge towards the realization of sufficiently pure single-mode cat states in degenerate optical parametric oscillators, we show that the generation of two-mode entangled cat states under such dissipative coupling can then be achieved without additional hurdles. We numerically explore the parameter regime for the successful generation of transient two-mode entangled cat states in two dissipatively coupled degenerate optical parametric oscillators. To certify the cat-state entanglement, we employ a tailored, variance-based entanglement criterion, which can robustly detect cat-state entanglement under realistic conditions.

   walks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the emerging properties of quantum walks with temporal disorder engineered from a binary Markov chain with tailored correlation, C, and disorder strength, r. We show that when the disorder is weak-r << 1-the introduction of negative correlation leads to a counter-intuitive higher production of spin-lattice entanglement entropy, Se, than the setting with positive correlation, that is Se(-|C|)>Se(|C|). These results show that negatively correlated disorder plays a more important role in quantum entanglement than it has been assumed in the literature.

TI Spin decoherence in molecular crystals: Nuclear vs electronic spin baths
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The loss of information about the relative phase between two quantum states, known as decoherence, strongly limits resolution in electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and hampers the use of molecules for quantum information processing. At low temperatures, the decoherence of an electronic molecular spin can be driven by its interaction with either other electron spins or nuclear spins. Many experimental techniques have been used to prolong the coherence time of molecular qubits, but these efforts have been hampered by the uncertainty about which of the two mechanisms is effectively limiting coherence in different experimental conditions. Here, we use the cluster-correlation expansion to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular qubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading source of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below similar to 1 mM. Moreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully spin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of similar to 0.1 ms for an electron spin concentration of similar to 0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular crystals with electron spin concentrations below 1 mM can still achieve coherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.

TI Multifunction integrated lithium niobate photonic chip for photon pairs
   generation and manipulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report on a unique photonic quantum source chip highly integrating four -stage photonic elements in a lithium niobate (LN) waveguide circuit platform, where an aperiodically poled LN (APPLN) electro-optic (EO) polarization mode converter (PMC) is sandwiched between two identical type -0 PPLN spontaneous parametric down -converters (SPDCs), followed by an EO phase controller (PC). These core nonlinear optic and EO building blocks on the chip are systematically characterized stage by stage to show its high performance as an integrated quantum source. The APPLN EO PMC, optimally constructed by a genetic algorithm, is characterized to have a broad bandwidth (>13 nm), benefiting an efficient control of broadband type -0 SPDC photon pairs featuring a short correlation time. We demonstrate an efficient conversion of the |VV> photon -pair state generated from the first PPLN SPDC stage to the |HH> state through the APPLN EO PMC stage over its operating bandwidth, a broadband or broadly tunable polarization -entangled state can thus be possibly produced via the superposition of the |VV> state generated from the other PPLN SPDC on the third stage of the chip. Such a state can be further manipulated into two of the Bell states if the relative phases between the two polarization states can be properly modulated through the EO PC on the fourth stage of the chip. Such a multifunction integrated quantum photonic source chip can be of high value to developing a compact, efficient, and high-speed quantum information processor.

TI Two-photon spectral modulation via temporal manipulation: Quantum
   optical synthesis of spectral modes from temporal square waves
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Precise manipulation of the time-frequency modes of entangled photons is crucial for future quantum science and technologies. Recently, the frequency-domain-quantum-optical-synthesis (FD-QOS) method was demonstrated by creating a superposition of different joint temporal amplitudes: those temporal distributions can be controlled by manipulating the joint spectral amplitude in 2D frequency space via a Fourier optical relation. This FD-QOS method provides an efficient, flexible, and easy-to-control way to precisely modulate the temporal distributions of the entangled photon in an ultrafast region. However, manipulation of only the temporal modes is not sufficient for various applications in quantum information, since spectral modulations are also needed on many occasions. Here, we present a proof-of-concept experiment of two-photon spectral modulation via temporal manipulation of a biphoton wave packet. This protocol, called time-domain-quantum-optical-synthesis (TD-QOS), is achieved by adjusting the relative phases between two joint temporal distributions. In addition, the two-photon joint spectral distributions are characterized by measuring the joint spectral intensities and Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences. The combination of FD-QOS and TD-QOS enables complete control over the biphoton states. Our work would further develop quantum technologies that rely on the time-frequency modes of entangled photons.

TI Tailoring the superradiant and subradiant nature of two coherently
   coupled quantum emitters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The control and manipulation of quantum-entangled states is crucial for the development of quantum technologies. A promising route is to couple solid-state quantum emitters through their optical dipole-dipole interactions. Entanglement in itself is challenging, as it requires both nanometric distances between emitters and nearly degenerate electronic transitions. Here we implement hyperspectral imaging to identify pairs of coupled dibenzanthanthrene molecules, and find distinctive spectral signatures of maximally entangled superradiant and subradiant electronic states by tuning the molecular optical resonances with Stark effect. We demonstrate far-field selective excitation of the long-lived subradiant delocalized state with a laser field tailored in amplitude and phase. Optical nanoscopy of the coupled molecules unveils spatial signatures that result from quantum interferences in their excitation pathways and reveal the location of each emitter. Controlled electronic-states superposition will help deciphering more complex physical or biological mechanisms governed by the coherent coupling and developing quantum information schemes.
   Coherent control of quantum states of a system is important for quantum applications. Here the authors demonstrate manipulation of the degree of superposition of coherently coupled solid-state quantum emitters by using Stark shifts of their optical resonances.

AB Fluctuation theorems are fundamental extensions of the second law of thermodynamics for small systems. Their general validity arbitrarily far from equilibrium makes them invaluable in nonequilibrium physics. So far, experimental studies of quantum fluctuation relations do not account for quantum correlations and quantum coherence, two essential quantum properties. We here apply a novel dynamic Bayesian network approach to experimentally test detailed and integral fully quantum fluctuation theorems for heat exchange between two quantum-correlated thermal spins-1/2 in a nuclear magnetic resonance setup. We concretely verify individual integral fluctuation relations for quantum correlations and quantum coherence, as well as for the sum of all quantum contributions. We further investigate the thermodynamic cost of creating correlations and coherence.

TI Biased degenerate ground-state sampling of small Ising models with
   converged quantum approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The quantum alternating operator ansatz, a generalization of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the transverse field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in nonuniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study, we numerically examine the fair sampling properties of the transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA), which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to a large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high-quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles, which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground states is quantified using the Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown, which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.

TI Superexchange coupling of donor qubits in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Atomic engineering in a solid-state material has the potential to functionalize the host with novel phenomena. STM-based lithographic techniques have enabled the placement of individual phosphorus atoms at selective lattice sites of silicon with atomic precision. Here we show that by placing four phosphorus donors spaced 10-15 nm apart from their neighbors in a linear chain, one can realize coherent spin coupling between the end dopants of the chain, analogous to the superexchange interaction in magnetic materials. Since phosphorus atoms are a promising building block of a silicon quantum computer, this enables spin coupling between their bound electrons beyond nearest neighbors, allowing the qubits to be separated by 30-45 nm. The added flexibility in architecture brought about by this long-range coupling not only reduces gate densities but can also reduce correlated noise between qubits from local noise sources that are detrimental to error-correction codes. We base our calculations on a full-configuration-interaction technique in the atomistic tight-binding basis, solving the four-electron problem exactly, over a domain of a million silicon atoms. Our calculations show that superexchange can be tuned electrically through gate voltages where it is less sensitive to charge noise and donor-placement errors.

TI Ultrafast chirality-dependent dynamics from helicity-resolved transient
   absorption spectroscopy
SO NANOSCALE
AB Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.

TI Rydberg atoms in D dimensions: entanglement, entropy and
   complexity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Rydberg atoms and excitons are composed so that they have a hydrogenic energy level structure governed by the Rydberg formula. They are relevant per se and for their numerous applications, e.g. facilitating the creation of novel quantum devices in quantum technologies which are inherently robust, miniature, and scalable (basically because they exist in solid-state platforms) and the realization of synthetic dimensions in numerous quantum-mechanical systems, giving rise to quantum matter which can behave as if it were in dimensions other than three. However the quantification of their internal disorder is scarcely known. Here we show and review the knowledge of dispersion, entanglement, physical entropies (Renyi, Shannon) and complexity-like measures of D-dimensional Rydberg systems with D >= 2 in both position and momentum spaces. These uncertainty quantifiers are expressed in terms of D, the potential strength and the hyperquantum numbers of the Rydberg states. This has been possible because of the fine asymptotics of algebraic functionals the Laguerre and Gegenbauer polynomials which, together with the hyperspherical harmonics, control the Rydberg wavefunctions.

TI A persistent concealed non-Kekulé nanographene: synthesis and in
   situ characterization
SO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Concealed non-Kekul & eacute; (CNK) nanographenes have recently gained attention as promising non-Kekul & eacute; model systems due to their distinctive antiferromagnetic electronic spins, which offer potential applications in spintronics and quantum information science. However, synthesizing CNK nanographenes in solution remains a significant challenge because of their strong biradical character and high reactivity. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of a novel CNK nanographene with two phenalene units fused in a cis configuration to perylene (c-CNK), which exhibits persistent stability under ambient conditions, with a half-life (t1/2) of 59 minutes. The formation of c-CNK is confirmed using in situ UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The open-shell character of c-CNK is supported by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by observing an isotropic signal with a g-value of 2.0026. Quantum chemical simulations reveal a high biradical character (y0 = 0.97) and a singlet open-shell ground state with a small singlet-triplet energy gap (Delta ES-T) of 0.4 kcal mol-1. This work presents a solution synthesis of a next-generation concealed non-Kekul & eacute; nanographene with intrinsic antiferromagnetic electronic spins, highlighting its potential as a promising material for future quantum technologies.

TI Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy
   defect from ab initio simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at similar to 75% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density-functional-theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyperdeep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.

TI Characterization of the multimode nature of single-photon sources based
   on spontaneous parametric down-conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Single-photon sources are necessary components for many prospective quantum technologies. One candidate for a single-photon source is spontaneous parametric down-conversion combined with a heralding photon detection. The heralded light pulse from such a source is typically treated as single mode; this treatment, however, is incomplete. We develop a full multimode description based on the exact Bogoliubov treatment of the down-conversion process. We then provide a perturbative and effective treatment, which illustrates the most important physical mechanisms and permits analytical estimates of the success probability and purity of single-photon states under practical heralding conditions, both without relying on the precise detection time of the heralding photon and when accepting photons only in a narrow window around the time of the detection. This permits us to characterize the emitted light under three different assumptions for the pump pulse. For spontaneous parametric down-conversion with a very short pump pulse, we find the single-mode description to be accurate, while for longer pump pulses and continuous pumping, a multimode description is necessary. Our findings can be used to guide the design of quantum information protocols based on heralded single-photon sources, as their performance may depend on the multimode nature of the sources.

TI Effect of Core Geometry on Frequency Correlations and Channel Capacity
   of a Multimode Optical Fiber
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Photons are the fundamental carriers of classical and quantum information across long distances via optical fibers. Multimode fibers with many transverse optical modes can support high-capacity communication through space-division multiplexing. While spatial correlations in light transmission via fibers have been investigated for counteracting mode mixing, less is known about frequency correlations, which are critical for high-capacity communication using ultrashort pulses. This study uses complex wavefront shaping methods to investigate how core geometry affects the frequency correlation bandwidth of structured wavefronts in circular and rectilinear-core fibers. Measurements reveal that rectilinear-core fibers exhibit up to a 40% increase in frequency correlation bandwidth compared to circular core fibers, particularly when focusing light away from the fiber center-common in spatially multiplexed optical communication. This enhanced bandwidth results in a 20% boost in optical communication channel capacity, highlighting the potential of rectilinear core fibers. Furthermore, this observation of novel spatiotemporal wave correlations could be exploited for application of rectilinear core fibers in chip-to-chip interconnects for photonic quantum processors, contributing to scale up of photonic quantum technologies.

AB Disruptive innovation is a cornerstone of various disciplines, particularly in the business world, where paradigm-altering approaches are often lauded. As a construct, disruptive psychiatry can be considered to embody such an approach by the pursuit of innovations within the field which test boundaries and shake up the status quo. Given the importance of addressing the current mental health pandemic, and the deficit of highly effective pharmacological treatments for various conditions, innovative disruptive thinking is required. Significant promise exists via the provision of potentially more effective innovative therapeutic options, including digital interventions, psychedelic medicines, microbiome-altering treatments, brain stimulation technology, and nanotechnology-based delivery systems. These approaches may be further advanced by individualization of the treatments using computational technology (including quantum computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence) and genomics.

TI Cavity-enhanced single-shot readout of a quantum dot spin within 3
   nanoseconds
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Rapid, high-fidelity single-shot readout of quantum states is a ubiquitous requirement in quantum information technologies. For emitters with a spin-preserving optical transition, spin readout can be achieved by driving the transition with a laser and detecting the emitted photons. The speed and fidelity of this approach is typically limited by low photon collection rates and measurement back-action. Here we use an open microcavity to enhance the optical readout signal from a semiconductor quantum dot spin state, largely overcoming these limitations. We achieve single-shot readout of an electron spin in only 3 nanoseconds with a fidelity of (95.2 & PLUSMN; 0.7)%, and observe quantum jumps using repeated single-shot measurements. Owing to the speed of our readout, errors resulting from measurement-induced back-action have minimal impact. Our work reduces the spin readout-time well below both the achievable spin relaxation and dephasing times in semiconductor quantum dots, opening up new possibilities for their use in quantum technologies.
   Single-shot readout of optically active spin qubits is typically limited by low photon collection rates and measurement back-action. Here the authors overcome these limitations by using an open cavity approach for single-shot readout of a semiconductor quantum dot and demonstrate record readout time of a few ns.

TI Coherence and entanglement in a non-commutative spacetime
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the l1-norm of coherence, quantum mutual information and local quantum Fisher information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.

TI Generating optical cat states via quantum interference of multi-path
   free-electron-photons interactions
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The novel quantum effects induced by the free-electron-photons interaction have attracted increasing interest due to their potential applications in ultrafast quantum information processing. Here, we propose a scheme to generate optical cat states based on the quantum interference of multi-path freeelectron-photons interactions that take place simultaneously with strong coupling strength. By performing a projection measurement on the electron, the state of light changes significantly from a coherent state into a non-Gaussian state with either Wigner negativity or squeezing property, both possess metrological power to achieve quantum advantage. More importantly, we show that the Wigner negativity oscillates with the coupling strength, and the optical cat states are successfully generated with high fidelity at all the oscillation peaks. This oscillation reveals the quantum interference effect of the multiple quantum pathways in the interaction of the electron with photons, by that various nonclassical states of light are promising to be fast prepared and manipulated. These findings inspire further exploration of emergent quantum phenomena and advanced quantum technologies with free electrons.& COPY; 2023 Science China Press.

TI Noncollinear first-principles studies of the spin-electric coupling in
   frustrated triangular molecular magnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Frustrated triangular molecular magnets (MMs) with antiferromagnetic ground states (GSs) are an important class of magnetic systems with potential applications in quantum information processing. The twofold degenerate GS of these molecules, characterized by spin chirality, can be utilized to encode qubits for quantum computing. Furthermore, because of the lack of inversion symmetry in these molecules, an electric field couples directly states of opposite chirality, allowing a very efficient and fast control of the qubits. In this paper we present a theoretical method to calculate the spin-electric coupling for triangular MMs with effective local spins s larger than 1/2, which is amenable to a first-principles implementation based on density functional theory (DFT). In contrast to MMs where the net magnetization at the magnetic atoms is mu(B)/2 (mu(B) is the Bohr magneton), the DFT treatment of frustrated triangular MMs with larger local magnetizations requires a fully noncollinear approach, which we have implemented in the NRLMOL DFT code. As an example, we have used these methods to evaluate the spin-electric coupling for a spin s = 5/2 {Fe-3} triangular MM, where this effect has been observed experimentally for the first time quite recently. Our theoretical and computational methods will help elucidate and further guide ongoing experimental work in the field of quantum molecular spintronics.

TI Optimization and implementation of a surface-electrode ion trap junction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We describe the design of a surface-electrode ion trap junction, which is a key element for large-scale ion trap arrays. A bi-objective optimization method is used for designing the electrodes, which maintains the total pseudo-potential curvature while minimizing the axial pseudo-potential gradient along the ion transport path. To facilitate the laser beam delivery for parallel operations in multiple trap zones, we implemented integrated optics on each arm of this X-junction trap. The layout of the trap chip for commercial foundry fabrication is presented. This work suggests routes to improving ion trap junction performance in scalable implementations. Together with integrated optical addressing, this contributes to modular trapped-ion quantum computing in interconnected two-dimensional arrays.

TI No Bipartite-Nonlocal Causal Theory Can Explain Nature's Correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show that some tripartite quantum correlations are inexplicable by any causal theory involving bipartite nonclassical common causes and unlimited shared randomness. This constitutes a device independent proof that nature's nonlocality is fundamentally at least tripartite in every conceivable physical theory-no matter how exotic. To formalize this claim, we are compelled to substitute Svetlichny's historical definition of genuine tripartite nonlocality with a novel theory-agnostic definition tied to the framework of local operations and shared randomness. A companion article by Coiteux-Roy et al. generalizes these concepts to any N >= 3 number of parties, providing experimentally amenable device independent inequality constraints along with quantum correlations violating them, thereby certifying that nature's nonlocality must be boundlessly multipartite.

TI Creation of silicon vacancy color centers with a narrow emission line in
   nanodiamonds by ion implantation
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Nanodiamonds containing silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers with high brightness, high photo-stability, and a narrow zero phonon line (ZPL) have attracted attention for bioimaging, nanoscale thermometry, and quantum technologies. One method to create such nanodiamonds is the milling of diamond films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, this requires post-processing such as acid treatment and centrifugation after the milling process. Therefore, the number of SiV center-containing nanodiamonds made from an initial CVD diamond is small. An alternative method without these problems is the implantation of Si ions into preselected nanodiamonds. This method, however, has an issue regarding the ZPL linewidths, which are more than twice as broad as those in nanodiamonds synthesized by CVD. In order to reduce the linewidth, we employed annealing treatment at high temperatures (up to 1100 degrees C) and high vacuum after the implantation. For an ion fluence of 10(13) ions/cm(2), a ZPL with a linewidth of about 7 nm at room temperature was observed for a nanodiamond with a median size of 29.9 +/- 16.0 nm. This was close to the linewidth for nanodiamonds created by CVD. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Burst error-correcting quantum stabilizer codes designed from
   idempotents
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Certain classical codes can be viewed isomorphically as ideals of group algebras, while studying their algebraic structures help extracting the code properties. Research has shown that this was remarkably efficient in the case when the code generators are idempotents. In quantum error correction, the theory of stabilizer formalism requires classical self-orthogonal additive codes over the finite field GF(4), which, via the lens of group algebras, are essentially F2-submodules over GF(4). Therefore, this paper provides a classification on idempotents in commutative group algebra G F(4)G, followed by a criterion that allows idempotents to generate stabilizer subgroups. Later, the construction of quantum stabilizer codes is done in the case when G is a cyclic group Cn, for n = 2(m) - 1 and n = 2(m) + 1. Quantum bounds on their burst error minimum distance are subsequently determined.

However, while existing work primarily focuses on effectiveness and efficiency, However, it often neglects the inherent noise and probabilistic nature of quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a method based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to estimate the number of quantum executions (shots) needed to reliably obtain high-quality solutions-comparable to or better than classical baselines. Experiments on both simulators and two physical quantum devices demonstrate that our method effectively estimates the number of required runs to obtain satisfactory solutions on two widely used benchmark datasets.

TI Process Parameter Optimisation for Endohedral Metallofullerene Synthesis
   via the Arc-Discharge Method
SO INORGANICS
AB Fullerenes have a unique structure, capable of both encapsulating other molecules and reacting with those on the exterior surface. Fullerene derivatives have also been found to have enormous potential to address the challenges of the renewable energy sector and current environmental issues, such as in the production of n-type materials in bulk heterojunction solar cells, as antimicrobial agents, in photocatalytic water treatment processes, and in sensor technologies. Endohedral metallofullerenes, in particular, can possess unpaired electron spins, driven by the enclosed metal atom or cluster, which yield valuable magnetic properties. These properties have significant potential for applications in molecular magnets, spin probes, quantum computing, and devices such as quantum information processing,, atomic clocks, and molecular magnets. However, the intrinsically low yield of endohedral fullerenes remains a huge obstacle, impeding not only their industrial utilization but also the synthesis and characterization essential for exploring novel applications. The low yield and difficulty in separation of different types of endohedral fullerenes results in the usage of a large amount of solvents and energy, which is detrimental to the environment. In this paper, we analyse the methodologies proposed by various researchers and identify the critical synthesis parameters that play a role in increasing the yields of fullerenes.

TI Photon-phonon spin-orbit interaction in optical fibers
SO OPTICA
AB Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a striking physical phenomenon in which spin and orbital features of a particle or a wave field affect each other. Recently, there has been significant interest in the SOI of light as it accompanies a number of fundamental light-matter interaction processes, enabling intriguing applications. We demonstrate the spin-orbit coupling between photons and phonons, in contrast to recently reported studies dealing with a "single-field" SOI. We show that the spin angular momentum of phonons can be transformed into the orbital angular momentum of photons, and vice versa, during the fiber acousto-optic interaction. This results in the acoustic-spin-dependent, dynamically tunable generation of topologically charged optical vortex beams directly from a Gauss-like mode. This type of optical mode conversion can be useful in such vortex-based photonics applications as micromechanics, classical and quantum information technologies, and simulation of quantum computing. This particular example of a "two-field SOI" shows that the concept of spin-orbit coupling can be generalized to describe the interaction between elementary excitations of different physical nature. Our findings indicate that SOI-assisted effects might be found in physical systems with photon-phonon, magnon-phonon, electron-phonon, and other interactions, enabling tailored topologically charged multiparticle states in photonics, spintronics, plasmonics, etc. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Feature-Empowered Deep Classification for Fast Mangrove Mapping
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB A mangrove mapping (MM) algorithm is an essential classification tool for environmental monitoring. The recent literature shows that compared with other index-based MM methods that treat pixels as spatially independent, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for leveraging spatial continuity information, leading to improved classification performance. In this work, we go a step further to show that quantum features provide radically new information for CNN to further upgrade the classification results. Simply speaking, CNN computes affine-mapping features, while quantum neural network (QNN) offers unitary-computing features, thereby offering a fresh perspective in the final decision-making (classification). To address the challenging MM problem, we design an entangled spatial-spectral quantum feature extraction module. Notably, to ensure that the quantum features contribute genuinely novel information (unaffected by traditional CNN features), we design a separate network track consisting solely of quantum neurons with built-in interpretability. The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with traditional feature information to jointly make the final decision. The proposed quantum-empowered deep network (QEDNet) is very lightweight, so the improvement does come from the cooperation between CNN and QNN (rather than parameter augmentation). Extensive experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the superiority of QEDNet.

We study amalgam presentations for PU2(Z[zeta(n), 1/2]) and PSU2(Z[zeta(n), 1/2]) with the Clifford-cyclotomic group in quantum computing as a subgroup.

TI Generic Construction of Forward-Secure Revocable Identity-Based
   Signature and Lattice-Based Instantiations
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Forward-secure revocation is a powerful cryptographic technique to alleviate key exposure attacks on identity-based cryptosystems. In recent years, quantum computers have made some breakthroughs, so in the foreseeable future, existing cryptographic systems will be subject to quantum attacks. However, known forward-secure revocable identity-based signature (FS-RIBS) schemes were designed over bilinear pairing groups and may suffer from quantum computing attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a generic method to construct FS-RIBS schemes, taking (hierarchical) IBS schemes as a basic component. By instantiating it with some post-quantum (hierarchical) IBS schemes, e.g., lattice-based (hierarchical) IBS, we immediately obtain six FS-RIBS schemes under the hardness of the small integer solution problem, which is secure against quantum computing attacks.

TI Quantum heat transport in nonequilibrium anisotropic Dicke model
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Nonequilibrium heat transport and quantum thermodynamics in quantum light-matter interacting systems have received increasing attention. Consequently, quantum thermal devices, such as heat valve and head diode, have been realized. Recently, it has been discovered that the anisotropic light-matter interactions can greatly modify the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of hybrid quantum systems, leading to nontrivial quantum phase transitions, quantum metrology, and nonclassicality of photons. To explore the influences of anisotropic light-matter interactions on quantum transport, we investigate heat flow in the nonequilibrium anisotropic Dicke model. In this model, an ensemble of qubits collectively interacts with an anisotropic photon field. Moreover, each component interacts with bosonic thermal reservoirs. The quantum dressed master equation (DME) is included to properly study dissipative dynamics of the anisotropic Dicke model. Within the eigenbasis of the reduced anisotropic Dicke system, the strong qubit-photon couplings can be properly handled. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic qubit-photon interactions are crucial for modulating steady-state heat flow. In particular, it is found that under strong coupling the heat flow is dramatically suppressed by a large anisotropic qubit-photon factor. While under moderate coupling, the anisotropic qubit-photon interactions enhance the heat flow. Moreover, the increase in the number of qubits amplifies the flow characteristics, with the peaks increasing and the valleys decreasing. Besides, we derive two analytical expressions of heat flows in the thermodynamic limit approximation with limiting anisotropic factors. These heat currents exhibit the cotunneling heat transport pictures. They also serve as the upper boundaries for the heat flows in the anisotropic Dicke model with finite qubit numbers. We also analyze the thermal rectification effect in the anisotropic Dicke model. It is found that a large temperature bias, a large anisotropic qubit-photon factor, and nonweak qubit-photon coupling are helpful in achieving the giant thermal rectification factor. We hope that these results can deepen the understanding of quantum heat transport in the anisotropic quantum light-matter interacting systems.

TI Coherent-Error Threshold for Surface Codes from Majorana Delocalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Statistical mechanics mappings provide key insights on quantum error correction. However, existing mappings assume incoherent noise, thus ignoring coherent errors due to, e.g., spurious gate rotations. We map the surface code with coherent errors, taken as X or Z rotations (replacing bit or phase flips), to a twodimensional (2D) Ising model with complex couplings, and further to a 2D Majorana scattering network. Our mappings reveal both commonalities and qualitative differences in correcting coherent and incoherent errors. For both, the error-correcting phase maps, as we explicitly show by linking 2D networks to 1D fermions, to a 7L2-nontrivial 2D insulator. However, beyond a rotation angle 0th, instead of a 7L2-trivial insulator as for incoherent errors, coherent errors map to a Majorana metal. This 0th is the theoretically achievable storage threshold. We numerically find 0th 0.14x. The corresponding bit-flip rate sin2(0th) 0.18 exceeds the known incoherent threshold pth 0.11.

TI Quantum Randomness is Chimeric
SO ENTROPY
AB If quantum mechanics is taken for granted, the randomness derived from it may be vacuous or even delusional, yet sufficient for many practical purposes. "Random" quantum events are intimately related to the emergence of both space-time as well as the identification of physical properties through which so-called objects are aggregated. We also present a brief review of the metaphysics of indeterminism.

TI Quantum approaches for inference and decision-making in quantum
   multi-agent frameworks
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB In multi-agent systems, Bayesian networks are pivotal for inference and decision-making under uncertainty, yet they face significant challenges, such as high computational complexity and slow decision speed. Quantum computing, leveraging superposition and entanglement, offers potential advantages for solving certain complex problems. Therefore, exploring Bayesian networks within the quantum multi-agent framework promises enhanced inference and decision-making capabilities. While quantum Bayesian networks for inference have been extensively studied, quantum dynamic Bayesian networks for inference and quantum decision networks for decision-making remain underexplored. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum computers struggle to process the long-term temporal structures of dynamic Bayesian networks due to limited resources. To address this, we propose a recursive quantum-classical hybrid Bayesian network inference method, which decomposes dynamic Bayesian networks into smaller subnetworks along the time series. Each subnetwork is represented by a reduced-scale quantum circuit, and the forward and backward operators are computed recursively, enabling efficient filtering and smoothing inference. In addition, we propose an optimal decision-making method based on quantum decision networks, which maps utility values to quantum probabilities and identifies the optimal action by determining the quantum state corresponding to the maximum expected probability. We validate the effectiveness of these algorithms using the IonQ quantum simulator and compare their performance with classical methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed quantum algorithms can effectively perform inference and decision-making tasks well on NISQ devices. The proposed methods provide a foundation for collaborative inference and decision-making within the quantum multi-agent framework.

TI CRYSTALS-Dilithium post-quantum cyber-secure SoC for wired
   communications in critical systems☆
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB Critical systems in the energy industry and aerospace are the backbone of modern society and national defense. These systems are becoming heterogeneous computing and networking infrastructures composed of Edge located, Fog, and Cloud control devices. Strict coordination and reliable networking are required to orchestrate the tasks and actions controlled by multiple devices. The well-known Ethernet standard for inter and intra sub-system networking is evolving to Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Regarding the security at the link level in this networking, the industry has selected MACsec as the technology to protect hard-real time traffic, in general and TSN, in particular. The extensive application of TSN will intersect with the post-quantum attack landscape in the future. As a result, it becomes imperative to conduct research on security solutions capable of effectively addressing these emerging threats. A quantum attack represents a novel and significant threat to network security. And, to operate MACsec in a post-quantum scenario, it is necessary to analyze the cipher suites for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography and used in MACsec (standard IEEE 802.1AE) and MKA (IEEE 802.1X). In the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process, The National Institute of Standards and Technology has selected for public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithm CRYSTALS-KYBER. Additionally, the selected digital signature algorithms for standardization include CRYSTALS-Dilithium. This work contributes with a novel concept-proof semiconductor implementation that fulfill the requirements in terms of power-consumption, resources utilization and PQC security level for Industrial IoT applications. The presented research analyzes the resources required by a high-performance CRYSTALS-Dilithium implementation on IIoT SoC devices. Firstly, the architecture and implementation of RTL-based CRYSTALS-Dilithium IP are presented and discussed. Secondly, a System-on-Chip semiconductor device composed of a RISC-V CPU subsystem and the CRYSTALS-Dilithium IP is developed in the scope of this research as a concept-prof to evaluate the viability of integrating PQC on resource-constrained devices for IIoT.

TI m-ADIC RESIDUE CODES OVER THE RING
   Fq[v]/(vs - v) AND
   THEIR APPLICATIONS TO QUANTUM CODES
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Due to their rich algebraic structure, cyclic codes have a great deal of significance amongst linear codes. Duadic codes are the generalization of the quadratic residue codes, a special case of cyclic codes. The m-adic residue codes are the generalization of the duadic codes. The aim of this paper is to study the structure of the m-adic residue codes over the quotient ring F-q[v]/< v(s)-v >. We determine the idempotent generators of the m-adic residue codes over F-q[v]/< v(s)-v >. We obtain some parameters of optimal m-adic residue codes over F-q[v]/< v(s)-v > with respect to Griesmer bound for rings. Furthermore, we derive a condition for m-adic residue codes over F-q [v]/< v(s)-v > to contain their dual. By making use of a preserving-orthogonality Gray map, we construct a family of quantum error correcting codes from the Gray images of dual-containing m-adic residue codes over F-q[v]/< v(s)-v > and give some examples to illustrate our findings.

TI Study of the Decoherence Correction Derived from the Exact Factorization
   Approach for Nonadiabatic Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present a detailed study of the decoherence correction to surface hopping that was recently derived from the exact factorization approach. Ab initio multiple spawning calculations that use the same initial conditions and the same electronic structure method are used as a reference for three molecules: ethylene, the methaniminium cation, and fulvene, for which nonadiabatic dynamics follows a photoexcitation. A comparison with the Granucci-Persico energy-based decoherence correction and the augmented fewest-switches surface-hopping scheme shows that the three decoherence-corrected methods operate on individual trajectories in a qualitatively different way, but the results averaged over trajectories are similar for these systems.

TI Performance Comparison of the Two Reconstruction Methods for
   Stabilizer-Based Quantum Secret Sharing
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Stabilizer -based quantum secret sharing has two methods to reconstruct a quantum secret: The erasure correcting procedure and the unitary procedure. It is known that the unitary procedure has a smaller circuit width. On the other hand, it is unknown which method has smaller depth and fewer circuit gates. In this letter, it is shown that the unitary procedure has smaller depth and fewer circuit gates than the erasure correcting procedure which follows a standard framework performing measurements and unitary operators according to the measurements outcomes, when the circuits are designed for quantum secret sharing using the [[ 5 , 1 , 3 ]] binary stabilizer code. The evaluation can be reversed if one discovers a better circuit for the erasure correcting procedure which does not follow the standard framework.

TI Real-time scattering processes with continuous-variable quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on (1 + 1)-dimensional c4scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the c4Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.

SO APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
AB Negative probabilities arise primarily in physics, statistical quantum mechanics, and quantum computing. Negative probabilities arise as mixing distributions of unobserved latent variables in Bayesian modeling. Our goal is to provide a link between these two viewpoints. Bartlett provides a definition of negative probabilities based on extraordinary random variables and properties of their characteristic function. A version of the Bayes rule is given with negative mixing weights. The classic half-coin distribution and Polya-Gamma mixing are discussed. Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty and the duality of scale mixtures of Normals is also discussed. A number of examples of dual densities with negative mixing measures are provided including the Linnik and Wigner distributions. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.

TI Quantum Speedup of the Dispersion and Codebook Design Problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose new formulations of max-sum and max-min dispersion problems that enable solutions via the Grover adaptive search (GAS) quantum algorithm, offering quadratic speedup. Dispersion problems are combinatorial optimization problems classified as NP-hard, which appear often in coding theory and wireless communications applications involving optimal codebook design. In turn, GAS is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm that can be used to implement full-fledged maximum-likelihood optimal solutions. In conventional naive formulations, however, it is typical to rely on a binary vector spaces, resulting in search space sizes prohibitive even for GAS. To circumvent this challenge, we instead formulate the search of optimal dispersion problem over Dicke states, an equal superposition of binary vectors with equal Hamming weights, which significantly reduces the search space leading to a simplification of the quantum circuit via the elimination of penalty terms. In addition, we propose a method to replace distance coefficients with their ranks, contributing to the reduction of the number of qubits. Our analysis demonstrates that as a result of the proposed techniques, a reduction in query complexity compared to the conventional GAS using the Hadamard transform is achieved, enhancing the feasibility of the quantum-based solution of the dispersion problem.

   Search
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this article, we introduce an innovative hybrid quantum search algorithm, the Robust Non-oracle Quantum Search (RNQS), which is specifically designed to efficiently identify the minimum value within a large set of random numbers. Distinct from the Grover's algorithm, the proposed RNQS algorithm circumvents the need for an oracle function that describes the true solution state, a feature often impractical for data science applications. Building on existing non-oracular quantum search algorithms, RNQS enhances robustness while substantially reducing running time. The superior properties of RNQS have been demonstrated through careful analysis and extensive empirical experiments. Our findings underscore the potential of the RNQS algorithm as an effective and efficient solution to combinatorial optimization problems in the realm of quantum computing.

TI Page curve under final state projection

AB The black hole singularity plays a crucial role in formulating Hawking???s information paradox. The global spacetime analysis may be reconciled with unitarity by imposing a final state boundary condition on the spacelike singularity. Motivated by the final state proposal, we explore the effect of final state projection in two dimensional conformal field theories. We calculate the time evolution under postselection by employing the real part of pseudoentropy to estimate the amount of quantum entanglement averaged over histories between the initial and final states. We find that this quantity possesses a Page -curve-like behavior.

TI Shallow-circuit variational quantum eigensolver based on
   symmetry-inspired Hilbert space partitioning for quantum chemical
   calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Development of resource-friendly quantum algorithms remains highly desirable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing. Based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with unitary coupled-cluster Ansatz, we demonstrate that partitioning of the Hilbert space made possible by the point-group symmetry of the molecular systems greatly reduces the number of variational operators by confining the variational search within a subspace. In addition, we found that instead of including all subterms for each excitation operator, a single-term representation suffices to reach required accuracy for various molecules tested, resulting in an additional shortening of the quantum circuit by a factor of 4-8. With these strategies, VQE calculations on a noise-free quantum simulator achieve energies within a few meVs of those obtained with the full unitary coupled-cluster Ansatz with single and double excitations for the H-4-square, H-4-chain, and H-6-hexagon molecules, while the number of CNOT gates, a measure of the quantum-circuit depth, is reduced by a factor of as large as 35. Furthermore, we introduced an efficient "score" parameter to rank the excitation operators, so that the operators causing larger energy reduction can be applied first. Using the H-4 square and H-4 chain as examples, We demonstrated on noisy quantum simulators that the first few variational operators can bring the energy within the chemical accuracy, while additional operators do not improve the energy since the accumulative noise outweighs the gain from the expansion of the variational Ansatz.

TI Single-Shot Decoding of Good Quantum LDPC Codes
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum Tanner codes constitute a family of quantum low-density parity-check codes with good parameters, i.e., constant encoding rate and relative distance. In this article, we prove that quantum Tanner codes also facilitate single-shot quantum error correction (QEC) of adversarial noise, where one measurement round (consisting of constant-weight parity checks) suffices to perform reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We establish this result for both the sequential and parallel decoding algorithms introduced by Leverrier and Zemor. Furthermore, we show that in order to suppress errors over multiple repeated rounds of QEC, it suffices to run the parallel decoding algorithm for constant time in each round. Combined with good code parameters, the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols.

TI Revolutionizing heart disease prediction with quantum-enhanced machine
   learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The recent developments in quantum technology have opened up new opportunities for machine learning algorithms to assist the healthcare industry in diagnosing complex health disorders, such as heart disease. In this work, we summarize the effectiveness of QuEML in heart disease prediction. To evaluate the performance of QuEML against traditional machine learning algorithms, the Kaggle heart disease dataset was used which contains 1190 samples out of which 53% of samples are labeled as positive samples and rest 47% samples are labeled as negative samples. The performance of QuEML was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and training time against traditional machine learning algorithms. From the experimental results, it has been observed that proposed quantum approaches predicted around 50.03% of positive samples as positive and an average of 44.65% of negative samples are predicted as negative whereas traditional machine learning approaches could predict around 49.78% of positive samples as positive and 44.31% of negative samples as negative. Furthermore, the computational complexity of QuEML was measured which consumed average of 670 mu s for its training whereas traditional machine learning algorithms could consume an average 862.5 mu s for training. Hence, QuEL was found to be a promising approach in heart disease prediction with an accuracy rate of 0.6% higher and training time of 192.5 mu s faster than that of traditional machine learning approaches.

TI Metaheuristics on quantum computers: Inspiration, simulation and real
   execution
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum-inspired metaheuristics are solvers that incorporate principles inspired from quantum mechanics into classical-approximate algorithms using non-quantum machines. Due to the uniqueness of quantum principles, the inspiration of quantum phenomena and the way it is done in fundamentally different non-quantum systems rather than real or simulated quantum computers raise important questions about these algorithms' design and the reproducibility of their results in real or simulated quantum devices. Thus, this work's contribution stands in a first step towards answering those questions as an attempt to identify key findings in the existing literature that should be considered or adapted in order to build hybrid or fully-quantum algorithms that can be used in quantum machines. This is done by proposing and studying four inspired, simulated and real quantum cellular genetic algorithms that, as far as the authors' knowledge, are the first quantum structured metaheuristics studied in the three quantum realms using a quantum simulator with 32 quantum bits and a real quantum machine employing 15 superconducting quantum bits. The users' mobility management in cellular networks is taken as a validation problem using 13 real-world instances. The comparisons have been made against 6 diverse algorithms using 9 comparison metrics. Thorough statistical tests and parameters' sensitivity analysis have been also conducted. The experiments allowed answering several questions, including how quantum hardware influences the studied-algorithms' search process. They also enabled opening new perspectives in quantum metaheuristics' design. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Pixelated non-volatile programmable photonic integrated circuits with
   20-level intermediate states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXTREME MANUFACTURING
AB Multi-level programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and optical metasurfaces have gained widespread attention in many fields, such as neuromorphic photonics, optical communications, and quantum information. In this paper, we propose pixelated programmable Si3N4 PICs with record-high 20-level intermediate states at 785 nm wavelength. Such flexibility in phase or amplitude modulation is achieved by a programmable Sb2S3 matrix, the footprint of whose elements can be as small as 1.2 mu m, limited only by the optical diffraction limit of an in-house developed pulsed laser writing system. We believe our work lays the foundation for laser-writing ultra-high-level (20 levels and even more) programmable photonic systems and metasurfaces based on phase change materials, which could catalyze diverse applications such as programmable neuromorphic photonics, biosensing, optical computing, photonic quantum computing, and reconfigurable metasurfaces.
   Pixelated non-volatile programmable photonic integrated circuits are proposed.A record-high 20-level intermediate state of Sb2S3 with a minimal 1.2 mu m spot size is realized using an in-house developed multi-level pulsed-laser writing system.Pixelated programmable multi-level Mach-Zehnder interferometer and multimode interferometer based on Sb2S3 matrix are realized.Very large-scale photonic linear processors based on pixelated Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh are realized in simulation.

TI Understanding the Frauchiger-Renner Argument
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB In 2018, Daniela Frauchiger and Renato Renner published an article in Nature Communications entitled 'Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself.' The argument has been attacked as flawed from a variety of interpretational perspectives. I clarify the significance of the result as a sequence of actions and inferences by agents modeled as quantum systems evolving unitarily at all times. At no point does the argument appeal to a 'collapse' of the quantum state following a measurement.

TI Signatures of the quantum nature of gravity in the differential motion
   of two masses
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We show that a signature of the quantum nature of gravity is the quantum mechanical squeezing of the differential motion of two identical masses with respect to their common mode. This is because the gravitational interaction depends solely on the relative position of the two masses. In principle, this squeezing is equivalent to quantum entanglement between the masses. In practice, detecting the squeezing is more feasible than detecting the entanglement. To that end, we propose an optical interferometric scheme to falsify hypothetical models of gravity.

TI Holographic Relative Entropy in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We reformulate entanglement wedge reconstruction in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction with infinite-dimensional physical and code Hilbert spaces. Von Neumann algebras are used to characterize observables in a boundary subregion and its entanglement wedge. Assuming that the infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebras associated with an entanglement wedge and its complement may both be reconstructed in their corresponding boundary subregions, we prove that the relative entropies measured with respect to the bulk and boundary observables are equal. We also prove the converse: when the relative entropies measured in an entanglement wedge and its complement equal the relative entropies measured in their respective boundary subregions, entanglement wedge reconstruction is possible. Along the way, we show that the bulk and boundary modular operators act on the code subspace in the same way. For holographic theories with a well-defined entanglement wedge, this result provides a well-defined notion of holographic relative entropy.

TI Correlated noise can be beneficial to quantum transducers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum systems are inherently susceptible to noise-a notorious factor that induces decoherence and limits the performance of quantum applications. To mitigate its detrimental effects, various techniques have been developed, including cryogenic cooling, bath engineering, and quantum error correction. In this Letter, we demonstrate that by exploiting noise correlations in coupled quantum systems, the overall impact of noise can be significantly suppressed. Specifically, in a piezo-optomechanical-based microwave-optical quantum transducer, correlations between the noise affecting the acoustic and electrical modes can lead to substantial noise reduction, thereby enhancing the performance of quantum transduction. This reduction is primarily governed by the phase of the piezomechanical coupling and is also influenced by system parameters such as the coupling ratio and mode cooperativity. Since these parameters simultaneously affect the signal transmissivity, they must be optimized to achieve the transducer's optimal performance. Our work provides a systematic framework for this optimization, offering a guidance for practical designs.

TI Quantum Modular Adder over GF(2n-1) without
   Saving the Final Carry
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Addition is the most basic operation of computing based on a bit system. There are various addition algorithms considering multiple number systems and hardware, and studies for a more efficient addition are still ongoing. Quantum computing based on qubits as the information unit asks for the design of a new addition because it is, physically, wholly different from the existing frequency-based computing in which the minimum information unit is a bit. In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum circuit of modular addition, which reduces the number of gates and the depth. The proposed modular addition is for the Galois Field GF(2(n) - 1), which is important as a finite field basis in various domains, such as cryptography. Its design principle was from the ripple carry addition (RCA) algorithm, which is the most widely used in existing computers. However, unlike conventional RCA, the storage of the final carry is not needed due to modifying existing diminished - 1 modulo 2(n) - 1 adders. Our proposed adder can produce modulo sum within the range 0,2(n) - 2 by fewer qubits and less depth. For comparison, we analyzed the proposed quantum addition circuit over GF(2(n) - 1) and the previous quantum modular addition circuit for the performance of the number of qubits, the number of gates, and the depth, and simulated it with IBM's simulator ProjectQ.

TI Bulk locality in the AdS/CFT correspondence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we study the bulk local states in the AdS/CFT correspondence in the large N limit using the formula explicitly relating the bulk local operators and the conformal field theory (CFT) local operators. We identify the bulk local state in terms of CFT local states and find that the bulk local state corresponds to a CFT state supported in the whole space, which means a version of the subregion duality is not valid. On the other hand, CFT states supported in a space region are expressed in terms of the bulk states supported in a certain region. We find that the quantum error correction proposal is not realized although the puzzles of the radial locality which motivated the proposal are resolved in our analysis. For the understating of the bulk local states, an explicit realization of an analog of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem plays an important role.

TI Information scrambling -A quantum thermodynamic perspective
SO EPL
AB - Recent advances in quantum information science have shed light on the intricate dynamics of quantum many-body systems, for which quantum information scrambling is a perfect example. Motivated by considerations of the thermodynamics of quantum information, this perspective aims at synthesizing key findings from several pivotal studies and exploring various aspects of quantum scrambling. We consider quantifiers such as the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and the quantum mutual information, their connections to thermodynamics, and their role in understanding chaotic vs. integrable quantum systems. With a focus on representative examples, we cover a range of topics, including the thermodynamics of quantum information scrambling, and the scrambling dynamics in quantum gravity models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Examining these diverse approaches enables us to highlight the multifaceted nature of quantum information scrambling and its significance in understanding the fundamental aspects of quantum many-body dynamics at the intersection of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

TI On the properties of the asymptotic incompatibility measure in
   multiparameter quantum estimation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We address the use of asymptotic incompatibility (AI) to assess the quantumness of a multiparameter quantum statistical model. AI is a recently introduced measure which quantifies the difference between the Holevo and the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) scalar bounds, and can be evaluated using only the SLD operators of the model. At first, we evaluate analytically the AI of the most general quantum statistical models involving two-level (qubit) and single-mode Gaussian continuous-variable quantum systems, and prove that AI is a simple monotonous function of the state purity. Then, we numerically investigate the same problem for qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems, with 2 < d <= 4), showing that, while in general AI is not in general a function of purity, we have enough numerical evidence to conclude that the maximum amount of AI is attainable only for quantum statistical models characterized by a purity larger than mu(min)=1/(d-1) <i . In addition, by parametrizing qudit states as thermal (Gibbs) states, numerical results suggest that, once the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is fixed, the AI measure is in one-to-one correspondence with the fictitious temperature parameter beta characterizing the family of density operators. Finally, by studying in detail the definition and properties of the AI measure we find that: (i) given a quantum statistical model, one can readily identify the maximum number of asymptotically compatible parameters; (ii) the AI of a quantum statistical model bounds from above the AI of any sub-model that can be defined by fixing one or more of the original unknown parameters (or functions thereof), leading to possibly useful bounds on the AI of models involving noisy quantum dynamics.

TI Inductively shunted transmons exhibit noise insensitive plasmon states
   and a fluxon decay exceeding 3 hours
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Currently available quantum processors are dominated by noise, which severely limits their applicability and motivates the search for new physical qubit encodings. In this work, we introduce the inductively shunted transmon, a weakly flux-tunable superconducting qubit that offers charge offset protection for all levels and a 20-fold reduction in flux dispersion compared to the state-of-the-art resulting in a constant coherence over a full flux quantum. The parabolic confinement provided by the inductive shunt as well as the linearity of the geometric superinductor facilitates a high-power readout that resolves quantum jumps with a fidelity and QND-ness of >90% and without the need for a Josephson parametric amplifier. Moreover, the device reveals quantum tunneling physics between the two prepared fluxon ground states with a measured average decay time of up to 3.5 h. In the future, fast time-domain control of the transition matrix elements could offer a new path forward to also achieve full qubit control in the decay-protected fluxon basis.
   Alternative superconducting qubit designs with improved performance are attracting attention. Here the authors introduce an inductively shunted transmon qubit that offers protection against flux noise and measures quantum tunneling between fluxon states that are shown to be stable for hours.

TI QuOCS: The quantum optimal control suite
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum optimal control includes a family of pulse-shaping algorithms that aim to unlock the full potential of a variety of quantum technologies. The Quantum Optimal Control Suite (QuOCS) unites experimental focus and model-based approaches in a unified framework. Easy usage and installation presented here and the availability of various combinable optimization strategies is designed to improve the performance of many quantum technology platforms, such as color defects in diamond, superconducting qubits, atom-or ion-based quantum computers. It can also be applied to the study of more general phenomena in physics. In this paper, we describe the software and the toolbox of gradient -free and gradient-based algorithms. We then show how the user can connect it to their experiment. In addition, we provide illustrative examples where our optimization suite solves typical quantum optimal control problems, in both open-and closed-loop settings. Integration into existing experimental control software is already provided for the experiment control software Qudi (Binder et al., 2017 [41]), and further extensions are investigated and highly encouraged. QuOCS is available from GitHub, under Apache License 2.0, and can be found on the PyPI repository. Program summary Program Title: QuOCS -Quantum Optimal Control Suite CPC Library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /wjjch757fk.1 Developer's repository link: https://github .com /Quantum -OCS /QuOCS Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: Python External routines: NumPy [1], SciPy [1], JAX [2] Nature of problem: Quantum systems are typically controlled by time-dependent electromagnetic fields to perform a certain set of quantum operations. Those operations may in turn provide building blocks for various quantum information processing tasks such as quantum computation, communication, simulation, sensing, and metrology. Numerous control strategies exist to design and improve such operations [3]. While some strategies are constructed to target a rather specific problem with high efficiency, others are more general to solve a wide range of applications [4,5]. To access the different algorithms, one has to download different optimization suites with different input and output parameters, making them hard to compare and combine. To benefit from the variety of algorithms, we have devised a customizable and intuitive optimization suite that simultaneously provides access to some of the most popular quantum optimal control algorithms.Solution method: We combine, in a unified framework, some of the frequently used optimal control algorithms which are the dressed Chopped Random Basis method (dCRAB) [6], and Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) [7], with an extension to make use of Automatic Differentiation (AD) [8]. The software is able to connect to both models of quantum dynamics in simulations and real-time quantum experiments to perform open-and closed-loop optimization, respectively. With minimal knowledge of optimal control theory, the user can manage to run optimizations of quantum processes using a variety of additional features such as stopping criteria and drift compensation. Logging and data management of the optimization progress and results are also handled by the suite. Its modular structure allows for extensions that accommodate customized algorithms and can be implemented by the user straightforwardly.
   Additional comments including unusual features: The connection to the experiments is performed by an extension that enables a direct integration to a laboratory control software Qudi [9].References[1] T.E.

TI Non-unitarity maximizing unraveling of open quantum dynamics
SO JMIR CARDIO
AB The dynamics of many-body quantum states in open systems is commonly numerically simulated by unraveling the density matrix into pure-state trajectories. In this work, we introduce a new unraveling strategy that can adaptively minimize the averaged entanglement in the trajectory states. This enables a more efficient classical representation of trajectories using matrix product decompositions. Our new approach is denoted nonunitarity maximizing unraveling (NUMU). It relies on the idea that adaptively maximizing the averaged non-unitarity of a set of Kraus operators leads to a more efficient trajectory entanglement destruction. Compared to other adaptive entanglement lowering algorithms, NUMU is computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate its utility in largescale simulations with random quantum circuits. NUMU lowers runtimes in practical calculations, and it also provides new insight on the question of classical simulability of quantum dynamics. We show that for the quantum circuits considered here, unraveling methods are much less efficient than full matrix product density operator simulations, hinting to a still large potential for finding more advanced adaptive unraveling schemes.

TI Probing Postmeasurement Entanglement without Postselection
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the problem of observing quantum collective phenomena emerging from large numbers of measurements. These phenomena are difficult to observe in conventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of measurement from dephasing, it is necessary to postselect on sets of measurement outcomes with Born probabilities that are exponentially small in the number of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this exponential "postselection problem", is to construct cross-correlations between experimental data and the results of simulations on classical computers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite relation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate classical shadows into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of quantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify cross-correlations that both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged von Neumann entanglement entropy, as well as cross-correlations that lower bound the measurement-averaged purity and entanglement negativity. These bounds show that experiments can be performed to constrain postmeasurement entanglement without the need for postselection. To illustrate our technique, we consider how it could be used to observe the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum circuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum simulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory, we construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension. Our results reveal a signature of measurement-induced criticality that can be observed using a quantum simulator in polynomial time and with polynomial classical memory.

TI Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced
   transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in nonmonitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1D measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine three-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data are consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The four-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.

TI Lattice-Based Key-Value Commitment Scheme
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB A blockchain is an important component in the design of secure distributed file systems, such as cryptocurrencies. One of the key components of the blockchain is the key-value commitment scheme, which constructs a commitment value from two inputs: a key and a value. In a conventional commitment scheme, a single user constructs a commitment value from an input value, whereas in a key-value commitment scheme, multiple users construct a commitment value from their keys and values. Both conventional and key-value commitment schemes must satisfy binding and hiding properties. The key-binding and key-hiding properties guarantee that neither the sender nor the verifier can act maliciously. The concept of a key-value commitment scheme was first proposed by Agrawal et al. in 2020 using a strong RSA assumption. Their scheme satisfies the key-binding but not key-hiding properties. In this paper, we propose two lattice-based key-value commitment schemes, Insert-KVCm/2,n,q,beta and KVCm,n,q,beta , that satisfy both the key-binding and the key-hiding properties. The key-binding property of both Insert-KVCm/2,n,q,beta and KVCm,n,q,beta are proven under the short integer solution ( SIS infinity n,m,q,beta ) problem. The key-hiding property of both Insert-KVCm/2,n,q,beta and KVCm,n,q,beta are proven under the Decisional- SISn,m,q,beta infinity -form problem, which is newly defined in this paper. We demonstrate the difficulty of the Decisional- SISn,m,q,beta infinity -form problem by showing that the Decisional- SISn,m,q,beta infinity -form problem is secure when the SISn,m,q,beta infinity problem is secure. Finally, we analyze the computational costs of Insert-KVCm/2,n,q,beta and KVCm,n,q,beta . Our method is the first lattice-based key-value commitment scheme with proven the key-binding and the key-hiding properties.

TI A Quantum Moving Target Segmentation Algorithm for Grayscale Video
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The moving target segmentation (MTS) aims to segment out moving targets in the video, however, the classical algorithm faces the huge challenge of real-time processing in the current video era. Some scholars have successfully demonstrated the quantum advantages in some video processing tasks, but not concerning moving target segmentation. In this paper, a quantum moving target segmentation algorithm for grayscale video is proposed, which can use quantum mechanism to simultaneously calculate the difference of all pixels in all adjacent frames and then quickly segment out the moving target. In addition, a feasible quantum comparator is designed to distinguish the grayscale values with the threshold. Then several quantum circuit units are designed in detail to construct the complete quantum circuits for segmenting the moving target. For a quantum video with 2m frames (every frame is a 2(n) x 2(n)$ image with q grayscale levels), the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to O(n(2) + q). Compared with the classic counterpart, it is an exponential speedup, while its complexity is also superior to the existing quantum algorithms. Finally, the experiment is conducted on IBM Quantum Experience (IBM Q) to show the feasibility of our algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.
   In this paper, a quantum moving target segmentation algorithm for grayscale video is proposed, which can use quantum mechanisms to simultaneously process all pixels in the video and segment out the moving target. In addition, a quantum comparator with lower quantum cost and a complete circuit for quantum video segmentation is designed. The circuit complexity and experiment analysis demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of the algorithm.image

TI Semi-Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident
   Direction-Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi-transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk-heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space-charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near-infrared light by the chiral non-fullerene acceptor. The space-charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

TI Learning time-varying Gaussian quantum lossy channels
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.

TI Hyperentanglement teleportation through external momenta states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The conventional teleportation protocol requires a state entangled in only one degree of freedom (DOF), while hyperteleportation requires more than single DOF to complete the task. The hyperteleportation schematics are demonstrated only for the photonic systems, where in the present paper we extend the idea to a hyperteleportation protocol involving the atomic internal and external states. The protocol is deterministically engineered through resonant and off-resonant atomic Bragg diffraction involving two-level neutral atoms under standard cavity-QED working environment. Moreover, the longer interaction time Bragg's regime with well separated transverse momenta states as an output of the neutral atoms guarantees the high enough engineering fidelities with reduced decoherence rates. The experimental parameters for the demonstration of the proposed scheme are also elucidated briefly describing the optimistic feasibility for the experimental execution of the proposed schematics.

TI Improved Quantization Method of Coupled Circuits in Charge Discrete
   Space
SO MATHEMATICS
AB A quantum theory of mesoscopic circuits, based on the discreteness of electric charges, was recently proposed. However, it is not applied widely, mainly because of the difficulty of the mathematical solution to the finite-difference Schr & ouml;dinger equation. In this paper, we propose an improved perturbation method to calculate Schr & ouml;dinger equations of the inductance and capacity coupling mesoscopic circuit. With a unitary transformation, the finite differential Schr & ouml;dinger equation of the system is divided into two equations in generalized momentum representation. The concrete value of the parameter in circuits is important to solving the equation. Both the perturbation method suitable case and the improved perturbation method suitable case, the wave functions, and energy level of the system are achieved. As an application, the current fluctuations are calculated and discussed. The improved mathematical method would be helpful for the popularization of the quantum circuits theory.

TI Connecting Ansatz Expressibility to Gradient Magnitudes and Barren
   Plateaus
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Parametrized quantum circuits serve as ansatze for solving variational problems and provide a flexible paradigm for the programming of near-term quantum computers. Ideally, such ansatze should be highly expressive, so that a close approximation of the desired solution can be accessed. On the other hand, the ansatz must also have sufficiently large gradients to allow for training. Here, we derive a fundamental relationship between these two essential properties: expressibility and trainability. This is done by extending the well-established barren plateau phenomenon, which holds for ansatze that form exact 2-designs, to arbitrary ansatze. Specifically, we calculate the variance in the cost gradient in terms of the expressibility of the ansatz, as measured by its distance from being a 2-design. Our resulting bounds indicate that highly expressive ansatze exhibit flatter cost landscapes and therefore will be harder to train. Furthermore, we provide numerics illustrating the effect of expressibility on gradient scalings and we discuss the implications for designing strategies to avoid barren plateaus.

TI Experimental study of modified Tavis-Cummings model with
   directly-coupled superconducting artificial atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The Tavis-Cummings model is intensively investigated in quantum optics and has important applications in generation of multi-atom entanglement. Here, we employ a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamic system to study a modified Tavis-Cummings model with directly-coupled atoms. In our device, three superconducting artificial atoms are arranged in a chain with direct coupling through fixed capacitors and strongly coupled to a transmission line resonator. By performing transmission spectrum measurements, we observe different anticrossing structures when one or two qubits are resonantly coupled to the resonator. In the case of the two-qubit Tavis-Cummings model without qubit-qubit interaction, we observe two dips at the resonance point of the anticrossing. The splitting of these dips is determined by Delta lambda = 2 root g(1)(2) + g(3)(2), where g(1) and g(3) are the coupling strengths between Qubit 1 and the resonator, and Qubit 3 and the resonator, respectively. The direct coupling J(12) between the two qubits results in three dressed states in the two-qubit Tavis-Cummings model at the frequency resonance point, leading to three dips in the transmission spectrum. In this case, the distance between the two farthest and asymmetrical dips, arising from the energy level splitting, is larger than in the previous case. The frequency interval between these two dips is determined by the difference in eigenvalues ( increment Delta lambda = epsilon(1+) - epsilon(1-)), obtained through numerical calculations. What we believe as novel and intriguing experimental results may potentially advance quantum optics experiments, providing valuable insights for future research.

This allows us to engineer the dispersive shift of the readout resonator independent of the qubit and resonator capacitances. We validate the pure kinetic coupling concept and demonstrate various generalized flux qubit regimes from plasmon to fluxon, with dispersive shifts ranging from 60 kHz to 2 MHz at the half-flux quantum sweet spot. We achieve readout performances comparable to conventional architectures with quantum state preparation fidelities of 99.7% and 92.7% for the ground and excited states, respectively, and below 0.1% leakage to non-computational states.

TI The Floquet Baxterisation
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum integrability has proven to be a useful tool to study quantum many -body systems out of equilibrium. In this paper we construct a generic framework for integrable quantum circuits through the procedure of Floquet Baxterisation. The integrability is guaranteed by establishing a connection between Floquet evolution operators and inhomogeneous transfer matrices obtained from the Yang-Baxter relations. This allows us to construct integrable Floquet evolution operators with arbitrary depths and various boundary conditions. Furthermore, we focus on the example related to the staggered 6 -vertex model. In the scaling limit we establish a connection of this Floquet protocol with a non -rational conformal field theory. Employing the properties of the underlying affine Temperley-Lieb algebraic structure, we demonstrate the dynamical anti -unitary symmetry breaking in the easy -plane regime. We also give an overview of integrability -related quantum circuits, highlighting future research directions.

TI Experimental computations of atomic properties on a superconducting
   quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We experimentally compute relativistic and correlation effects in the atomic properties by using a superconducting qubit processor. Specifically, we compute the relativistic ground-state energies and magnetic-dipole hyperfine structure constants for four Li-like atomic systems ranging from very light to moderately heavy to very heavy in terms of nuclear charge. A symmetry-conserving Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is used to reduce the original six-qubit problem to a four-qubit problem, which is experimentally contrived by reducing the hardware requirement by employing a virtual two-qubit gate. It enables the simulation of four-qubit circuits using two physical qubits with additional circuit evaluations. The ground-state wave functions, required for computing atomic properties, are obtained by using quantum state tomography. Our results show that the averaged relative errors for the ground-state energies are approximate to 0.3 +/- 1%. However, for the hyperfine structure constants, the mean values of the relative errors are less than 15%, with their estimated upper bound of relative errors of approximate to +/- 10% (with the exception of 7.2 +/- 47% for neutral 7Li). Notably, our results for the hyperfine structure constants exhibit higher sensitivity to errors as compared to energies; a trend which we also confirm through additional numerical simulations.

TI Microscopic Study of Optically Stable Coherent Color Centers in Diamond
   Generated by High-Temperature Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Single color centers in solid have emerged as promising physical platforms for quantum information science. Creating these centers with excellent quantum properties is a key foundation for further techno-logical developments. In particular, the microscopic understanding of the spin-bath environments is the key to engineer color centers for quantum control. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a distinct high-temperature annealing (HTA) approach for creating high-quality nitrogen vacancy (N -V) centers in implantation-free diamonds. Simultaneously using the created N -V centers as probes for their local envi-ronment we verify that no damage is microscopically induced by the HTA. Nearly all single N -V centers created in ultralow-nitrogen-concentration membranes possess stable and Fourier-transform-limited opti-cal spectra. Furthermore, HTA strongly reduces noise sources naturally grown in ensemble samples, and leads to more than threefold improvements of decoherence time and sensitivity. We also verify that the vacancy activation and defect reformation, especially H3 and P1 centers, can explain the reconfiguration between spin baths and color centers. This distinct approach will become a powerful tool in vacancy-based quantum technology.

AB Erbium-implanted silicon is promising for both photonic and quantum-technology platforms, since it possesses both telecommunications and integrated-circuit processing compatibility. However, several different Er centers are generated during the implantation and annealing process, the presence of which could hinder the development of these applications. When Si is coimplanted with 10(17) cm(-3) Er and 10(20) cm(-3) O ions, and the appropriate annealing process is used, one of these centers, which is present at higher Er concentrations, can be eliminated. Characterization of samples with Er concentrations of <10 17 cm(-3) is limited by the sensitivity of standard electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instruments. The collective coupling strength between a superconducting (SC) NbN lumped-element resonator and a 10(17) cm(-3) Er-implanted Si sample at 20 mK is measured to be about 1 MHz, which provides a basis for the characterization of low-concentration Er-implanted Si and for future networks of hybrid quantum systems that exchange quantum information over the telecommunication network. Of six known Er-related EPR centers, only one trigonal center couples to the SC resonator.

TI Effect of hydrophilicity-imparting substituents on exciton
   delocalization in squaraine dye aggregates covalently templated to DNA
   Holliday junctions
SO NANOSCALE
AB Molecular aggregates exhibit emergent properties, including the collective sharing of electronic excitation energy known as exciton delocalization, that can be leveraged in applications such as quantum computing, optical information processing, and light harvesting. In a previous study, we found unexpectedly large excitonic interactions (quantified by the excitonic hopping parameter Jm,n) in DNA-templated aggregates of squaraine (SQ) dyes with hydrophilic-imparting sulfo and butylsulfo substituents. Here, we characterize DNA Holliday junction (DNA-HJ) templated aggregates of an expanded set of SQs and evaluate their optical properties in the context of structural heterogeneity. Specifically, we characterized the orientation of and Jm,n between dyes in dimer aggregates of non-chlorinated and chlorinated SQs. Three new chlorinated SQs that feature a varying number of butylsulfo substituents were synthesized and attached to a DNA-HJ via a covalent linker to form adjacent and transverse dimers. Various characteristics of the dye, including its hydrophilicity (in terms of log Po/w) and surface area, and of the substituents, including their local bulkiness and electron withdrawing capacity, were quantified computationally. The orientation of and Jm,n between the dyes were estimated using a model based on Kuhn-Renger-May theory to fit the absorption and circular dichroism spectra. The results suggested that adjacent dimer aggregates of all the non-chlorinated and of the most hydrophilic chlorinated SQ dyes exhibit heterogeneity; that is, they form a mixture of dimers subpopulations. A key finding of this work is that dyes with a higher hydrophilicity (lower log Po/w) formed dimers with smaller Jm,n and large center-to-center dye distance (Rm,n). Also, the results revealed that the position of the dye in the DNA-HJ template, that is, adjacent or transverse, impacted Jm,n. Lastly, we found that Jm,n between symmetrically substituted dyes was reduced by increasing the local bulkiness of the substituent. This work provides insights into how to maintain strong excitonic coupling and identifies challenges associated with heterogeneity, which will help to improve control of these dye aggregates and move forward their potential application as quantum information systems.
   Molecular aggregates exhibit collective sharing of electronic excitation energy known as exciton delocalization, that can be leveraged in applications such as quantum computing, optical information processing, and light harvesting.

TI Measurement and control of a superconducting quantum processor with a
   fully integrated radio-frequency system on a chip
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We describe a digital microwave platform called Presto, designed for measurement and control of multiple quantum bits (qubits) and based on the third-generation radio-frequency system on a chip. Presto uses direct digital synthesis to create signals up to 9 GHz on 16 synchronous output ports, while synchronously analyzing responses on 16 input ports. Presto has 16 DC-bias outputs, four inputs and four outputs for digital triggers or markers, and two continuous-wave outputs for synthesizing frequencies up to 15 GHz. Scaling to a large number of qubits is enabled through deterministic synchronization of multiple Presto units. A Python application programming interface configures a firmware for synthesis and analysis of pulses, coordinated by an event sequencer. The analysis integrates template matching (matched filtering) and low-latency (184-254 ns) feedback to enable a wide range of multi-qubit experiments. We demonstrate Presto's capabilities with experiments on a sample consisting of two superconducting qubits connected via a flux-tunable coupler. We show single-shot readout and active reset of a single qubit; randomized benchmarking of single-qubit gates showing 99.972% fidelity, limited by the coherence time of the qubit; and calibration of a two-qubit iSWAP gate.

TI Anti-Hong-Ou-Mandel interference by coherent perfect absorption of
   entangled photons
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Two-photon interference, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, has colossal implications for quantum technology. It was observed in 1987 with two photodetectors monitoring outputs of the beamsplitter illuminated by photon pairs: the coincidence rate of the detectors drops to zero when detected photons overlap in time. More broadly, bosons (e.g. photons) coalesce while fermions (e.g. electrons) anti-coalesce when interfering on a lossless beamsplitter. Quantum interference of bosons and fermions can be tested in a single-photonics platform, where bosonic and fermionic states are artificially created as pairs of entangled photons with symmetric and anti-symmetric spatial wavefunctions. We observed that interference on a lossy beamsplitter of a subwavelength thickness, or a coherent perfect absorber, reverses quantum interference in such a way that bosonic states anti-coalesce while fermionic states exhibit coalescent-like behavior. The ability to generate states of light with different statistics and manipulate their interference offers important opportunities for quantum information and metrology.

TI Harvesting a Wide Spectral Range of Electronic Coherences with
   Disordered Quasi-Homo Dimeric Assemblies at Room Temperature
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A wide variety of photoinduced electronic coherences are shown to be robust with respect to dephasing in ensembles of quasi-homodimers assembled with sub-nm ligands from colloidal 3 nm CdSe quantum dots (QDs) with controlled 9% size dispersion, both in solution and in solid-state. Coherence periods ranging from 40 to 300 fs are consistently characterized by multidimensional electronic spectroscopy in the Vis range in solution and solid-state samples. A theoretical model that includes size dispersion, spin orbit coupling, and crystal field splitting supports the assignment of electronic coherences. Further, this model provides a guide for optimizing the coherences by tuning the interplay between dimer electronic delocalization, optical activity, and size dispersion. The experimental persistence of many QD electronic coherences at the level of the size dispersed ensemble in the solid-state and in solution opens the way for building versatile bottom-up materials well suited to quantum technology applications.

TI Quantum phases of matter on a 256-atom programmable quantum simulator
SO NATURE
AB Motivated by far-reaching applications ranging from quantum simulations of complex processes in physics and chemistry to quantum information processing(1), a broad effort is currently underway to build large-scale programmable quantum systems. Such systems provide insights into strongly correlated quantum matter(2-6), while at the same time enabling new methods for computation(7-10) and metrology(11). Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states(12). Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an (sing quantum phase transition in (2 +1) dimensions(13). We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation(14), experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.

TI Engineering, Control, and Longitudinal Readout of Floquet Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Properties of time-periodic Hamiltonians can be exploited to increase the dephasing time of qubits and to design protected one- and two-qubit gates. Recently, Huang et al. [Phys. Rev. Applied 15, 034065 (2021)] have shown that Floquet states offer a manifold of working points with dynamical protection larger than the few, usual, static sweet spots. Here, we show how Floquet theory, often used on systems with a single drive tone, can be used to describe approaches to robustly control Floquet qubits in the presence of multiple commensurate drive tones. Using this formulation, we introduce a longitudinal readout protocol to measure the Floquet qubit without the need of first adiabatically mapping the Floquet states back to the static qubit states, resulting in a significant speedup in the measurement time of the Floquet qubit. The analytical approach developed here can be applied to any Hamiltonian involving a small number of distinct drive tones, typical in the study of standard parametric gates for qubits outside of the rotating-wave approximation.

TI Measuring Trotter error and its application to precision-guaranteed
   Hamiltonian simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Trotterization is the most common and convenient approximation method for Hamiltonian simulations on digital quantum computers, but estimating its error accurately is computationally difficult for large quantum systems. Here, we develop a method for measuring the Trotter error without ancillary qubits on quantum circuits by combining the mth- and nth-order (m < n) Trotterizations rather than consulting with mathematical error bounds. Using this method, we make Trotterization precision guaranteed, developing an algorithm named Trotter(m, n), in which the Trotter error at each time step is within an error tolerance epsilon preset for our purpose. Trotter(m, n) is applicable to both time-independent and -dependent Hamiltonians, and it adaptively chooses almost the largest step size delta t, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest, within the error tolerance. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we find the adaptively chosen delta t to be about 10 times larger than that inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors.

AB In this paper, we deal with the stability of the improved quantum coding method based on Markovian dissipative dynamics that is robust against thermal noise. This coding method was proposed by Nishino et al. and the suppression of the effect of thermal noise was demonstrated by numerical simulations, however the mathematical proof was not given. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the thermal noise in this method and mathematically prove that the quantum states converge to a neighborhood around the target code words. The bound of the neighborhood set is also given strictly. We also demonstrate numerical simulations, which confirm the theoretical results. Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, efficient quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.
   This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based on execution time estimations.
   Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by over 40% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers.

TI AI for next generation computing: Emerging trends and future directions
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB Autonomic computing investigates how systems can achieve (user) specified "control" outcomes on their own, without the intervention of a human operator. Autonomic computing fundamentals have been substantially influenced by those of control theory for closed and open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems may exhibit a number of concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge. The integration of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and self-management of systems can be achieved at different levels of granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop automation. In this article, leading academics, researchers, practitioners, engineers, and scientists in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum computing join to discuss current research and potential future directions for these fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing environments.

TI Ab initio molecular dynamics on quantum computers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a valuable technique for studying molecules and materials at finite temperatures where the nuclei evolve on potential energy surfaces obtained from accurate electronic structure calculations. In this work, we present an approach to running AIMD simulations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)-era quantum computers. The electronic energies are calculated on a quantum computer using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. Algorithms for computation of analytical gradients entirely on a quantum computer require quantum fault-tolerant hardware, which is beyond NISQ-era. Therefore, we compute the energy gradients numerically using finite differences, the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, and a correlated sampling technique. This method only requires additional classical calculations of electron integrals for each degree of freedom without any additional computations on a quantum computer beyond the initial VQE run. As a proof of concept, AIMD simulations are demonstrated for the H-2 molecule on IBM quantum devices. In addition, we demonstrate the validity of the method for larger molecules using full configuration interaction wave functions. As quantum hardware and noise mitigation techniques continue to improve, the method can be utilized for studying larger molecular systems.

TI Shaping Quantum Noise through Cascaded Nonlinear Processes in a
   Dissipation-Engineered Multimode Cavity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Multimode quantum light is enticing for several applications, spanning imaging, spectroscopy, communication, and more. Parametric nonlinear processes have been vital in realizing squeezed and other quantum states of light. However, most work exploiting these processes has focused on generating multi- mode squeezed vacua and squeezing in mode superpositions (supermodes). Bright squeezing in multiple discrete frequency modes, if realized, could unlock novel applications in quantum-enhanced spectroscopy and optical quantum computing. Here, we show how dissipation engineering of a multimode nonlinear cavity with cascaded three-wave-mixing processes allows us to shape above-threshold frequency combs that feature strong single-mode output amplitude noise squeezing over 10 dB below the shot-noise limit, tunable across the comb. In addition, we demonstrate squeezing for multiple discrete frequency modes above threshold. This bright squeezing arises from enhancement of the (noiseless) nonlinear rate relative to decay rates in the system due to the cascaded generation of photons in a single idler "bath" mode. A natural consequence of the strong nonlinear coupling in our system is the creation of an effective cavity in the synthetic frequency dimension that sustains Bloch oscillations in the modal energy distribution. Bloch mode engineering could provide an opportunity to better control nonlinear energy flow in the synthetic frequency dimension, with exciting applications in quantum random walks and topological photonics. Lastly, we show evidence of long-range correlations in amplitude noise between discrete frequency modes, enabling long-range entanglement in a synthetic frequency dimension and providing a new resource for quantum communication.

TI Simultaneous Brillouin and piezoelectric coupling to a high-frequency
   bulk acoustic resonator
SO OPTICA
AB Bulk acoustic resonators support robust, long-lived mechanical modes, capable of coupling to various quantum systems. In separate works, such devices have achieved strong coupling to both superconducting qubits, via piezoelectricity, and optical cavities, via Brillouin interactions. In this work, we present a hybrid microwave-optical platform capable of cou-pling to bulk acoustic waves through cavity-enhanced piezoelectric and photoelastic interactions. The modular, tunable system achieves fully resonant and well-mode-matched interactions among a 3D microwave cavity, a high-frequency bulk acoustic resonator, and a Fabry-Perot cavity. We realize this piezo-Brillouin interaction in x-cut quartz, demon-strating the potential for strong optomechanical interactions and high cooperativity using optical cavity enhancement. We further show how this device functions as a bidirectional electro-opto-mechanical transducer, with transduction efficiency exceeding 10-8, and a feasible path towards unity conversion efficiency. The high optical sensitivity and ability to apply a large resonant microwave field in this system also offers a tool for probing anomalous electromechani-cal couplings, which we demonstrate by investigating (nominally centrosymmetric) CaF2 and revealing a parasitic piezoelectricity of 83 am/V. Such studies are an important topic for emerging quantum technologies, and highlight the versatility of this hybrid platform.

TI Billiard Quantum Chaos: A Pioneering Image Encryption Scheme in the
   Post-Quantum Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In an era marked by escalating data breaches and the emergence of quantum computing, ensuring robust data security is paramount. This study introduces an innovative image encryption scheme that employs billiard quantum chaos in conjunction with the Fibonacci sequence to reinforce data integrity against quantum threats. The proposed approach exploits the unpredictable behavior inherent in quantum particles, thereby augmenting the level of randomness in image data. For distributed keys, the Fibonacci sequence operates on the least significant bits, while the sequence generated through billiard quantum chaos affects the most significant bits of the image. This dual-layered approach adds complexity and resilience against advanced persistent threats. The uniform distribution of least and most significant bits is contingent on the key length, and the proposed model ensures adaptability to diverse security requirements. A comprehensive analysis on the ciphered image substantiates the effectiveness of the methodology in achieving security objectives. Comparative assessments validate its applicability in real-world scenarios, underscoring its robustness against quantum attacks. Through the integration of state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques, this scheme presents a formidable response to the challenges posed by quantum computing, positioning a solid foundation for secure image encryption in the post-quantum era.

TI Non-Abelian operation through scattering between chiral Dirac edge modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We theoretically demonstrate that the non-Abelian braiding operation can be realized through the scattering between chiral Dirac edge modes (CDEMs) in quantum anomalous Hall insulators by analytically deriving its S matrix. Based on the analytical model, we propose a viable device for the experimental realization and detection of the non-Abelian braiding operations. Through investigating the tunneling conductance in a discretized lattice model, the non-Abelian properties of CDEMs could also be verified in a numerical way. Our proposal for CDEMbased braiding provides an avenue for realizing topologically protected quantum gates.

TI Strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces for resonant coupling and
   single-photon routing
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We report on the design and simulation of strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces aimed at improving resonant coupling and photon routing efficiency. In our design, the guided mode is confined within a plane by a high-index thin film and is loosely confined laterally by a lower index strip. Using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) strip, titanium dioxide core, and silicon dioxide substrate, we optimise the waveguide dimensions for maximum lateral confinement of light. Specifically, we propose a polymer-based Bragg grating cavity and ring resonator that achieve near-optimal mode volumes and high Q-factors. These may be further developed to achieve the even higher Q-factors demanded by quantum technologies. Our calculations suggest that a quantum dot embedded in a cavity with a mode volume of V e f f similar to 7.0 lambda / n 3 and a Q-factor of 7,000 can produce photons with 97% indistinguishability at 4K. Additionally, we investigate directional couplers for efficient photon routing, comparing photonic and plasmonic material structures. While pure photonic structures demonstrate lower loss and improved quality factors, they face practical limitations in terms of bending radius. Conversely, plasmonic structures offer shorter bending radii but higher propagation losses. This research lays the groundwork for future nanophotonic designs, aiming to enhance photon generation and routing capabilities for quantum optical applications.

TI Hydrogenic spin-valley states of the bromine donor in
   2H-MoTe2
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In semiconductors, the identification of doping atomic elements allowing to encode a qubit within spin states is of intense interest for quantum technologies. In transition metal dichalcogenides semiconductors, the strong spin-orbit coupling produces locked spin-valley states with expected long coherence time. Here we study the substitutional Bromine Br-Te dopant in 2H-MoTe2. Electron spin resonance measurements show that this dopant carries a spin with long-lived nanoseconds coherence time. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we find that the hydrogenic wavefunctions associated with the dopant levels have characteristics spatial modulations that result from their hybridization to the Q-valleys of the conduction band. From a Fourier analysis of the conductance maps, we find that the amplitude and phase of the Fourier components change with energy according to the different irreducible representations of the impurity-site point-group symmetry. These results demonstrate that a dopant can inherit the locked spin-valley properties of the semiconductor and so exhibit long spin-coherence time.
   Doping 2D materials is an effective way to engineer a wide range of properties of interest from catalysis to quantum bits. Here, the authors investigate Br-doped 2H-MoTe2 using electron spin resonance and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, demonstrating that the dopant-orbitals hybridise to the Q-valleys of the conduction band and produce long-lived spin states protected by spin-valley locking.

We also introduce the concept of operator ordering and the description of a system by means of the p-ordered characteristic functions. Then we focus on the quasi-probability distributions and, in particular, on the relation between the marginals of the Wigner function and the outcomes of the quadrature operator measurement. Finally, we introduce the balanced homodyne detection to measure the quadrature operator and the homodyne tomography as a tool for characterizing quantum optical states also in the presence of non-unit quantum efficiency.

TI New schemes for creating large optical Schrodinger cat states using
   strong laser fields
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS
AB Recently, using conditioning approaches on the high-harmonic generation process induced by intense laser-atom interactions, we have developed a new method for the generation of optical Schrodinger cat states (Lewenstein et al. in Nat Phys, 17 1104-1108, 2021. https://doi/10.1038/s41567-021-01317-w). These quantum optical states have been proven to be very manageable as, by modifying the conditions under which harmonics are generated, one can interplay between kitten and genuine cat states. Here, we demonstrate that this method can also be used for the development of new schemes towards the creation of optical Schrodinger cat states, consisting of the superposition of three distinct coherent states. Apart from the interest these kind of states have on their own, we additionally propose a scheme for using them towards the generation of large cat states involving the sum of two different coherent states. The quantum properties of the obtained superpositions aim to significantly increase the applicability of optical Schrodinger cat states for quantum technology and quantum information processing.

TI Atomic excitation trapping in dissimilar chirally coupled atomic arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An atomic array coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide allows photon-mediated dipole -dipole interactions and nonreciprocal decay channels. Such an array possesses many intriguing quantum phenomena due to its distinctive and emergent quantum correlations. In this atom-waveguide quantum system, we theoretically investigate the atomic excitation dynamics and its transport property, specifically at an interface of dissimilar atomic arrays with different interparticle distances. We find that the atomic excitation dynamics is highly dependent on the interparticle distances of dissimilar arrays and the directionality of nonreciprocal couplings. By tuning these parameters, a dominant excitation reflection can be achieved at the interface of the arrays in the single excitation case. We further study two effects on the transport property-of external drive and of single excitation delocalization over multiple atoms-where we manifest a rich interplay between multisite excitation and the relative phase in determining the transport properties. Finally, we present an intriguing trapping effect of atomic excitation by designing multiple zones of dissimilar arrays. Similar to the single excitations, multiple excitations are reflected from the array interfaces and trapped as well, although complete trapping of many excitations together is relatively challenging at long time due to a faster combined decay rate. Our results can provide insights into nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in dissimilar arrays, and they can shed light on confining and controlling quantum registers useful for quantum information processing.

TI A complexity efficient penta-diagonal quantum smoothing filter for
   bio-medical signal denoising: a study on ECG
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Extracting information-bearing signal from a noisy environment has been a practical challenge in both classical and quantum computing formalism, especially in critical signal processing applications. To filter out the effect of noise, we propose a quantum smoothing filter built upon quantum formalism-based circuits applied for electrocardiogram signal denoising. The proposed quantum filter is a conceptually novel framework with an advantage in computational complexity as compared to the existing classical filters, such as discrete wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition, whereas it achieves similar performance metrics for the accuracy of the filter. Further, we exploit the penta-diagonal Toeplitz structure of the smoothing filter, which gives approximately 48 % gate cost reduction for 10 qubit circuit compared to the standard Hamiltonian simulation without structure. The run-time complexity using the quantum matrix inversion technique for the structured matrix is given by O (kappa(2)poly(log N)/epsilon(P)) for condition number kappa of the N x N filter matrix within precision epsilon(P) . Embedding fixed sparsity of the banded matrix, the quantum filter shows potentially better run-time complexity than classical filtering techniques. For the quantifiable research results of our work, we have shown several performance metrics, such as mean-square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio analysis, with a bound of error due to observation noise, simulation error and quantum measurement uncertainty.

TI Quantum Long Short-Term Memory-Assisted Optimization for Efficient
   Vehicle Platooning in Connected and Autonomous Systems
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY
AB Vehicle platooning, especially when dedicated to carrying goods, represents a forward-looking approach to optimizing logistics and freight transportation using autonomous vehicles. In this study, we propose to employ Quantum Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM) models to predict the vehicle dynamics of a leading vehicle of the platoon. This predictive capability allows the following vehicles to adjust their behaviours dynamically. By doing so, we aim to optimize control strategies and maintain string stability within vehicle platoons. This approach leverages the unique computational advantages of quantum computing, particularly in processing complex temporal data, potentially leading to more accurate and efficient dynamic systems in vehicular platoon infrastructure. The simulation results indicate that the QLSTM model is highly efficient by learning more information in fewer epochs compared to traditional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. This efficiency contributes to minimizing control errors, enhancing the precision and reliability of vehicle dynamics in the context of autonomous vehicle platooning. This research not only enhances the predictability of autonomous vehicle platoons but also opens pathways for research into how quantum computing can be integrated into real-time dynamic systems analysis and control.

TI Advanced CMOS manufacturing of superconducting qubits on 300 mm wafers
SO NATURE
AB The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers1,2. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical3. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, at present, these industrial processes are not optimized to produce high-coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the approaches commonly used to make superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 mu s. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics of coherence, yield, variability and ageing that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, which uses only optical lithography and reactive-ion etching, has a performance and yield in line with conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation and electron-beam writing4. Moreover, it offers the potential for further upscaling through three-dimensional integration5 and more process optimization. This result marks the advent of an alternative and new, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication method for superconducting quantum computing processors.

TI Metal-Dielectric Nanopillar Antenna-Resonators for Efficient Collected
   Photon Rate from Silicon Carbide Color Centers
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB A yet unresolved challenge in developing quantum technologies based on color centres in high refractive index semiconductors is the efficient fluorescence enhancement of point defects in bulk materials. Optical resonators and antennas have been designed to provide directional emission, spontaneous emission rate enhancement and collection efficiency enhancement at the same time. While collection efficiency enhancement can be achieved by individual nanopillars or nanowires, fluorescent emission enhancement is achieved using nanoresonators or nanoantennas. In this work, we optimise the design of a metal-dielectric nanopillar-based antenna/resonator fabricated in a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate with integrated quantum emitters. Here we consider various color centres known in SiC such as silicon mono-vacancy and the carbon antisite vacancy pair, that show single photon emission and quantum sensing functionalities with optical electron spin read-out, respectively. We model the dipole emission fluorescence rate of these color centres into the metal-dielectric nanopillar hybrid antenna resonator using multi-polar electromagnetic scattering resonances and near-field plasmonic field enhancement and confinement. We calculate the fluorescence collected photon rate enhancement for these solid state vacancy-centers in SiC in these metal-dielectric nanopillar resonators, showing a trade-off effect between the collection efficiency and radiative Purcell factor enhancement. We obtained a collected photon rate enhancement from a silicon monovacancy vacancy center embedded in an optimised hybrid antenna-resonator two orders of magnitude larger compared to the case of the color centres in bulk material.

TI Coherent Dynamics of a Single Mn-Doped Quantum Dot Revealed by Four-Wave
   Mixing Spectroscopy
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB For future quantum technologies, the combination of a long quantum state lifetime and an efficient interface with an external optical excitation is required. In solids, the former is, for example, achieved by individual spins, while the latter is found in semiconducting artificial atoms combined with modern photonic structures. One possible combination of the two aspects is reached by doping a single quantum dot, providing a strong excitonic dipole with a magnetic ion that incorporates a characteristic spin texture. Here, we perform four-wave mixing spectroscopy to study the system's quantum coherence properties. We characterize the optical properties of the undoped CdTe quantum dot and find a strong photon echo formation that demonstrates a significant inhomogeneous spectral broadening. Incorporating the Mn2+ ion introduces its spin-5/2 texture to the optical spectra via the exchange interaction, manifesting as six individual spectral lines in the coherent response. The random flips of the Mn-spin result in a special type of spectral wandering between the six transition energies, which is fundamentally different from the quasi-continuous spectral wandering that results in the Gaussian inhomogeneous broadening. Here, the discrete spin-ensemble manifests in additional dephasing and oscillation dynamics.

AB Feature selection is of great importance in Machine Learning, where it can be used to reduce the dimensionality of classification, ranking and prediction problems. The removal of redundant and noisy features can improve both the accuracy and scalability of the trained models. However, feature selection is a computationally expensive task with a solution space that grows combinatorically. In this work, we consider in particular a quadratic feature selection problem that can be tackled with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), already employed in combinatorial optimization. First we represent the feature selection problem with the QUBO formulation, which is then mapped to an Ising spin Hamiltonian. Then we apply QAOA with the goal of finding the ground state of this Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the optimal selection of features. In our experiments, we consider seven different real-world datasets with dimensionality up to 21 and run QAOA on both a quantum simulator and, for small datasets, the 7-qubit IBM (ibm-perth) quantum computer. We use the set of selected features to train a classification model and evaluate its accuracy. Our analysis shows that it is possible to tackle the feature selection problem with QAOA and that currently available quantum devices can be used effectively. Future studies could test a wider range of classification models as well as improve the effectiveness of QAOA by exploring better performing optimizers for its classical step.

TI Predicting the Excitation Dynamics in Lanthanide Nanoparticles
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB With their dipole-forbidden 4f transitions, lanthanides doped in nanoparticles promise high excited state lifetimes and quantum yields that are required for applications such as composite lasers or nanoscale quantum memories. Quenching at the nanoparticle surface, however, severely reduces the lifetime and quantum yield and requires resource-consuming experimental optimization that could not be replaced by simulations due to the limitations of existing approaches until now. Here, a versatile approach is presented that fully accounts for spatiotemporal dynamics and reliably predicts the lifetimes and quantum yields of lanthanide nanoparticles. LiYF4:Pr3+ nanoparticles are synthesized as a model system, and the lifetimes of a concentration series (similar to 10 nm, 0.7-1.47 at%) are used to match the model parameters to the experimental conditions. Employing these parameters, the lifetimes and quantum yields of a size series (similar to 5 at%, 12-21 nm) are predicted with a maximum uncertainty of 12.6%. To demonstrate the potential of the model, a neutral shell is added around the core particles in the model which extends the lifetime by up to 44%. Furthermore, spatiotemporal analysis of single nanoparticles points toward a new type of energy trapping in lanthanide nanoparticles. Consequently, the numerical optimization brings applications such as efficient nanoparticle lasers or quantum memories within reach.

TI A Multi-Objective Quantum-Inspired Seagull Optimization Algorithm Based
   on Decomposition for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Path Planning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The traditional seagull optimization algorithm cannot handle multi-objective optimization problems, so a multi-objective quantum-inspired seagull optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MOQSOA/D) is proposed. Multi-objective computing and quantum computing are introduced into MOQSOA/D. MOQSOA/D transforms the multi-objective problem into multiple scalar optimization sub-problems, and establishes a dynamic archive and a leadership archive at the same time. The Pareto solution of each sub-problem is stored in a dynamic archive, and the non-dominated Pareto solution is stored in the leader archive. While processing each sub-problem, each seagull is represented by a string of qubits, which is used to calculate the current seagull direction of flight, and a variable angular-distance rotation (VAR) gate is used to change the probability amplitude of the qubits, thereby updating the direction of flight. Penalty-based boundary intersection approach is introduced to determine whether the generated Pareto solution is retained. The proposed algorithm and six different algorithms were tested on 69 indicators, and the results show that the algorithm achieved better results in 40 indicators. In addition, a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning model in three-dimensional environment is designed to test the utility of MOQSOA/D, and the algorithm is compared with the other algorithm to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB In multi-domain Software Defined Networking (SDN) environments, inter-controller communication is essential for coordinated decision-making and consistent operation across administrative boundaries. These exchanges involve sensitive control-plane data requiring strong guarantees of authenticity and confidentiality. However, traditional cryptographic mechanisms such as RSA and ECC are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks, threatening the long-term security of SDN systems. Recent advances in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offer promising alternatives, with CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber emerging as leading candidates for digital signatures and encryption, respectively. In parallel, permissioned blockchain technologies have gained traction as decentralized, tamper-proof ledgers for enforcing trust in SDN environments. Yet, the integration of PQC and blockchain for secure SDN communication remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, a novel system is proposed that combines PQC and blockchain to enable secure and verifiable communication between SDN controllers. Each controller uses a Dilithium-based signature keypair for authentication and a Kyber-based encryption keypair for confidentiality, with public keys stored on-chain to establish decentralized trust. SDN controller messages are encrypted using Kyber, signed with Dilithium, and recorded on the blockchain in an encrypted format. Key innovations of the design include the execution of Dilithium signature verification directly on-chain through smart contract logic, enabling decentralized and auditable validation, and a blockchain-based mechanism for securely distributing Kyber public keys, eliminating reliance on external key exchange infrastructure. The feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated, demonstrating its potential for implementation in SDN deployments facing quantum-era threats.

CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB Nonlocality is a quintessential signature of nonclassical behaviour and a resource for quantum advantages in communication and computation. The paradoxical correlations witnessed by strong non-locality undergird the standard probabilistic form of nonlocality and provide optimal advantages in numerous informational tasks. Three-qubit systems are the simplest ones that admit strong nonlocality. Abramsky et al. (TQC, 2017) established the existence of an infinite family of three-qubit paradoxes, beyond the well-known GHZ paradox, which exhibited a novel conditional structure. In this work, we introduce several new infinite families of three-qubit paradoxes and articulate a detailed roadmap towards the complete classification of all three-qubit nonlocality paradoxes. In particular, we prove that our paradoxes exhaust all those satisfying reasonable regularity conditions. We give an example of a highly exotic paradox and place constraints on the search for new exotic paradoxes. We conjecture that all paradoxes must involve states from a one-parameter family and provide significant evidence in support of this conjecture.

AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, mid-circuit measurement and reset operations facilitate novel circuit optimization strategies by reducing a circuit's qubit count in a method called resizing. This paper introduces two such algorithms. The first one leverages gate-dependency rules to reduce qubit count by 61.6% or 45.3% when optimizing depth as well. Based on numerical instantiation and synthesis, the second algorithm finds resizing opportunities in previously unresizable circuits via dependency rules and other state-of-the-art tools. This resizing algorithm, implemented in BQSKit, reduces qubit count by 20.7% on average for these previously impossible-to-resize circuits.

AB Although entanglement is a basic resource for reaching quantum advantage in many computation and information protocols, we lack a universal recipe for detecting it, with analytical results obtained for low-dimensional systems and few special cases of higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm, the support vector machine with polynomial kernel, to classify separable and entangled states. We apply it to two-qubit and three-qubit systems, and we show that, after training, the support vector machine is able to recognize if a random state is entangled with an accuracy up to 92% for the two-qubit system and up to 98% for the three-qubit system. We also describe why and in what regime the support vector machine algorithm is able to implement the evaluation of an entanglement witness operator applied to many copies of the state, and we describe how we can translate this procedure into a quantum circuit.

TI Compilation and scaling strategies for a silicon quantum processor with
   sparse two-dimensional connectivity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Inspired by the challenge of scaling-up existing silicon quantum hardware, we propose a 2d spin-qubit architecture with low compilation overhead. The architecture is based on silicon nanowire split-gate transistors which form 1d chains of spin-qubits and allow the execution of two-qubit operations among neighbors. We introduce a silicon junction which can couple four nanowires into 2d arrangements via spin shuttling and Swap operations. We then propose a modular sparse 2d spin-qubit architecture with unit cells of diagonally-oriented squares with nanowires along the edges and junctions on the corners. Targeting noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) demonstrators, we show that the proposed architecture allows for compilation strategies which outperform methods for 1d chains, and exhibits favorable scaling properties which enable trading-off compilation overhead and colocation of control electronics within each square by adjusting the nanowire length. An appealing feature of the proposed architecture is its manufacturability using complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes.

TI Quantum-Walk-Inspired Dynamic Adiabatic Local Search
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the irreconcilability issue that arises when translating the search algorithm from the Continuous Time Quantum Walk (CTQW) framework to the Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) framework. For the AQC formulation to evolve along the same path as the CTQW, it requires a constant energy gap in the Hamiltonian throughout the AQC schedule. To resolve the constant gap issue, we modify the CTQW-inspired AQC catalyst Hamiltonian from an XZ operator to a Z oracle operator. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the total running time for the proposed approach for AQC with the modified catalyst Hamiltonian remains optimal as CTQW. Inspired by this solution, we further investigate adaptive scheduling for the catalyst Hamiltonian and its coefficient function in the adiabatic path of Grover-inspired AQC to improve the adiabatic local search.

Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have proven to be experimentally versatile platforms for the creation of topological superconductivity by custom-designing the complex structure of their magnetic layer. Here, we demonstrate that higher order topological superconductivity (HOTSC) can be realized in two-dimensional MSH systems by using stacked magnetic structures. We show that the sensitivity of the HOTSC to the particular magnetic stacking opens an intriguing ability to tune the system between trivial and topological phases using atomic manipulation techniques. We propose that the realization of HOTSC in MSH systems, and in particular the existence of the characteristic Majorana corner modes, allows for the implementation of a measurement-based protocols for topological quantum computing.

TI Computational study of oxide stoichiometry and variability in the
   Al/AlOx/Al tunnel junction
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Aluminium tunnel junctions are key components of a wide variety of electronic devices. These superconducting tunnel junctions, known as Josephson Junctions (JJ's) are one of the main components of superconducting qubits, a favourite qubit technology in the race for working quantum computers. In this simulation study our JJ configurations are modelled as two aluminium electrodes which are separated by a thin layer of amorphous aluminium oxide. There is limited understanding of how the structure of the amorphous oxide barrier affects the performance and shortcomings of JJ systems. In this paper we present a computational study which combines molecular dynamics, atomistic semi-empirical methods (Density Functional Tight Binding) and non-equilibrium Green's function to study the electronic structure and current flow of these junction devices. Our results suggest that the atomic nature of the amorphous barrier linked to aluminum-oxygen coordination sensitively affects the current-voltage (IV) characteristics, resistance and critical current. Oxide stoichiometry is an important parameter that can lead to variation in resistance and critical currents of several orders of magnitude. The simulations further illustrate the variability that arises due to small differences in atomic structure across amorphous barriers with the same stoichiometry, density and barrier length. Our results also confirm that the charge transport through the barrier is dominated by metallic conduction pathways.

This allows for an efficient simulation of sizable plaquette ladders with a small number of qubits, well suited for the capabilities of present NISQ devices. We illustrate the procedure for ladders with simulation of up to 8 plaquettes in an IBM-Q machine, employing scaled quantum gates.

AB Atom interferometry-based sensors have demonstrated remarkable precision, making them attractive for diverse applications compared to traditional sensors. However, practical experiments inevitably encounter noise, which limits precision. We investigate the performance of two commonly used methods, ellipse fitting (EF) and fringe fitting (FF), for differential phase estimation in a dual atom interferometer under various noise conditions. We comprehensively analyze the efficacy of these methods for each type of Gaussian noise, including phase noise, amplitude noise, and offset noise. Using a colored noise model, we investigate the Allan deviation results. Our investigations will offer valuable insights for future quantum sensing based on dual interferometers.

TI Quantum search for scaled hash function preimages
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We present the implementation of Grover's algorithm in a quantum simulator to perform a quantum search for preimages of two scaled hash functions, whose design only uses modular addition, word rotation and bitwise exclusive or. Our implementation provides the means to assess with precision the scaling of the number of gates and depth of a full-fledged quantum circuit designed to find the preimages of a given hash digest. The detailed construction of the quantum oracle shows that the presence of AND gates, OR gates, shifts of bits and the reuse of the initial state along the computation require extra quantum resources as compared with other hash functions based on modular additions, XOR gates and rotations. We also track the entanglement entropy present in the quantum register at every step along the computation, showing that it becomes maximal at the inner core of the first action of the quantum oracle, which implies that no classical simulation based on tensor networks would be of relevance. Finally, we show that strategies that suggest a shortcut based on sampling the quantum register after a few steps of Grover's algorithm can only provide some marginal practical advantage in terms of error mitigation.

TI High-dimensional encryption in optical fibers using spatial modes of
   light and machine learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The ability to engineer the spatial wavefunction of photons has enabled a variety of quantum protocols for communication, sensing, and information processing. These protocols exploit the high dimensionality of structured light enabling the encoding of multiple bits of information in a single photon, the measurement of small physical parameters, and the achievement of unprecedented levels of security in schemes for cryptography. Unfortunately, the potential of structured light has been restrained to free-space platforms in which the spatial profile of photons is preserved. Here, we make an important step forward to using structured light for fiber optical communication. We introduce a classical encryption protocol in which the propagation of high-dimensional spatial modes in multimode fibers is used as a natural mechanism for encryption. This provides a secure communication channel for data transmission. The information encoded in spatial modes is retrieved using artificial neural networks, which are trained from the intensity distributions of experimentally detected spatial modes. Our on-fiber communication platform allows us to use single spatial modes for information encoding as well as the high-dimensional superposition modes for bit-by-bit and byte-by-byte encoding respectively. This protocol enables one to recover messages and images with almost perfect accuracy. Our classical smart protocol for high-dimensional encryption in optical fibers provides a platform that can be adapted to address increased per-photon information capacity at the quantum level, while maintaining the fidelity of information transfer. This is key for quantum technologies relying on structured fields of light, particularly those that are challenged by free-space propagation.

TI Superconducting nanowire single photon detector under AC-bias with
   self-differential readout
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) has been widely used in many fields such as quantum computing, quantum key distribution and laser radar, due to its high detection efficiency, low dark count rate, high counting rate, and low timing jitter. In most cases, the SNSPD works under the DC-bias mode that can detect single photons arrived at any time. In some cases such as satellite laser ranging and single-photon laser radar where the light pulses arrive regularly, the AC-bias mode enables the SNSPD to work with higher counting rates and lower background dark counts, which however requires complicated readout due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the photon response. In this work, we report on an AC-biased SNSPD system with a self-differential readout circuit. The system includes a 2-pixel SNSPD consisting of two parallel nanowires, which are biased with 100 MHz sinusoidal current. The output signals of these two nanowires are amplified and combined for the differential readout of the photon response. The resulting response pulse possesses a signal-to-noise ratio ten times higher than that extracted before self-differential readout. In addition, the dark counts are reduced by a factor of 4, and the count rates are increased by a factor of 1.5, in comparison with those under the DC-bias mode. This work provides a specific method to read out the AC-biased SNSPD.

TI Observing the Poisson Distribution of a Coherent Microwave Field With a
   Parametric Photon Detector
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Single-photon detectors are essential for implementing optical quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution, and for enhancing optical imaging systems such as lidar, while also playing a crucial role in studying the statistical properties of light. In this work, we show how the underlying photon statistics can be revealed by using a threshold detector, implemented as a Josephson parametric amplifier operating near a first-order phase transition. We describe the detection protocol, which utilizes a series of pumping pulses followed by the observation of activated switching events. The acquired data are analyzed using two binomial tests, and the results are compared to a theoretical model that takes into account the photon statistics of the microwave field, with additional validation provided by computer simulations. We show that these tests provide conclusive evidence for the Poissonian statistics in the case of a coherent state, in agreement with the experimental data. In addition, this method enables us to distinguish between different statistics of the incoming probe field. Our approach is broadly applicable to standard non-photon-number-resolving detectors, offering a practical pathway to characterize photon statistics in quantum microwave and optical systems.

TI Holographic entanglement in spin network states: A focused review
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB In the long-standing quest to reconcile gravity with quantum mechanics, profound connections have been unveiled between concepts traditionally pertaining to a quantum information theory, such as entanglement, and constitutive features of gravity, like holography. Developing and promoting these connections from the conceptual to the operational level unlock access to a powerful set of tools which can be pivotal toward the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Here, we review recent progress on the role and applications of quantum informational methods, in particular tensor networks, for quantum gravity models. We focus on spin network states dual to finite regions of space, represented as entanglement graphs in the group field theory approach to quantum gravity, and illustrate how techniques from random tensor networks can be exploited to investigate their holographic properties. In particular, spin network states can be interpreted as maps from bulk to boundary, whose holographic behavior increases with the inhomogeneity of their geometric data (up to becoming proper quantum channels). The entanglement entropy of boundary states, which are obtained by feeding such maps with suitable bulk states, is then proved to follow a bulk area law with corrections due to the entanglement of the bulk state. We further review how exceeding a certain threshold of bulk entanglement leads to the emergence of a black hole-like region, revealing intriguing perspectives for quantum cosmology.

TI Integration of buried nanomagnet and silicon spin qubits in a
   one-dimensional fin structure
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We adopt a buried nanomagnet (BNM) technology on a one-dimensional (1D) array of silicon spin qubits, and its availability was investigated using numerical simulations. The qubit array is formed in the center of the Si fin and the nanomagnet is buried in the lower lateral part of the qubits. The nanomagnet placed near the qubit generates a strong slanting magnetic field in the qubit, enabling X-gate operation approximately 15 times faster than in conventional cases. Furthermore, the formation of a BNM using a self-aligned process suppresses the dimensional variation of the nanomagnet caused by process variation, thereby mitigating the slanting field fluctuation and fidelity degradation. In addition, even for multiple qubits formed in the Si fin, the BNM with excess length generated a uniform slanting field, mitigating fidelity degradation and enabling all qubits to operate using a single-frequency microwave. Therefore, the proposed structure is useful for 1D integrated structures.

TI Longitudinal and transverse electric field manipulation of hole
   spin-orbit qubits in one-dimensional channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Holes confined in semiconductor nanostructures realize qubits where the quantum-mechanical spin is strongly mixed with the quantum orbital angular momentum. The remarkable spin-orbit coupling allows for fast all electrical manipulation of such qubits. We study an idealization of a cmos device where the hole is strongly confined in one direction (thin film geometry), while it is allowed to move more extensively along a one-dimensional channel. Static electric bias and ac electrical driving are applied by metallic gates arranged along the channel. In quantum devices based on materials with a bulk inversion symmetry, such as silicon or germanium, there exist different possible spin-orbit coupling based mechanisms for qubit manipulation. One of them, the g-tensor magnetic resonance, relies on the dependence of the effective g-factors on the electrical confinement. In this configuration, the hole is driven by an ac field parallel to the static electric field and perpendicular to the channel (transverse driving). Another mechanism, which we refer to here as iso-Zeeman electric dipole spin resonance, is due to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling that leads to an effective time-dependent magnetic field experienced by the pseudospin oscillating along the quantum channel (longitudinal driving). We compare these two modes of operation, and we describe the conditions in which the magnitudes of the Rabi frequencies are the largest. Different regimes can be attained by electrical tuning where the coupling to the ac electric field is made either weak or strong. Spin-orbit coupling can also be tuned by strains, with, in particular, a transition from a mostly heavy- to a mostly light-hole ground state for in-plane tensile strains. Although large strains always reduce the Rabi frequency, they may increase the qubit lifetimes even faster, which calls for a careful optimization of strains and electric fields in the devices. We also discuss the choice of channel material and orientation. The study is relevant to the interpretation of the current experiments on the manipulation of hole qubits and as a guide to the development of quantum devices based on silicon and germanium.

TI Entanglement dynamics in monitored Kitaev circuits: Loop models,
   symmetry classification, and quantum Lifshitz scaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for simulating digital quantum dynamics and uncovering novel states of nonequilibrium quantum matter. One principal example are measurement-induced phase transitions arising from nonunitary dynamics in monitored circuits, which employ midcircuit measurements as an essential building block next to standard unitary gates. Although a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in generic circuits is still evolving, we contend that monitored quantum circuits give rise to robust phases of dynamic matter, which-akin to Hamiltonian ground-state phases-yield emergent universal behavior, which can be categorized based on circuit symmetries and spatial dimensionality. To illustrate this concept, we focus on measurement-only quantum circuits within symmetry classes BDI and D, which are measurement-only circuit adaptations of the paradigmatic Kitaev and Yao-Kivelson models, embodying particle-hole-symmetric Majorana fermions with or without time reversal. We establish a general framework (Majorana loop models) for both symmetry classes (in arbitrary spatial dimensions) to provide access to the phenomenology of the entanglement dynamics in these circuits, displaying both an area-law phase of localized Majorana loops and a delocalized, highly entangled Majorana liquid phase. The two phases are separated by a continuous transition displaying quantum Lifshitz scaling, albeit with critical exponents of two distinct, non-Hamiltonian universality classes. The loop model framework provides not only analytical understanding of these universality classes in terms of nonlinear sigma models but also allows for highly efficient numerical techniques capable of simulating excessively large circuits with up to 108 qubits. We utilize this framework to accurately determine universal probes that distinguish both the entangled phases and the critical points of the two symmetry classes. Our work thereby further solidifies the concept of emergent circuit phases and their phase transitions.

TI Information geometric aspects of probability paths with minimum entropy
   production for quantum state evolution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
AB We present an information geometric analysis of both entropic speeds and entropy production rates arising from geodesic evolution on manifolds parametrized by pure quantum states. In particular, we employ pure states that emerge as outputs of suitably chosen su(2; C) time-dependent Hamiltonian operators that characterize analog quantum search algorithms of specific types. The su(2; C) Hamiltonian models under consideration are specified by external time-dependent magnetic fields within which spin-1/2 test particles are immersed. The positive definite Riemannian metrization of the parameter manifold is furnished by the Fisher information function. The Fisher information function is evaluated along parametrized squared probability amplitudes obtained from the temporal evolution of these spin-1/2 test particles. A minimum action approach is then utilized to induce the transfer of the quantum system from its initial state to its final state on the parameter manifold over a finite temporal interval. We demonstrate in an explicit manner that the minimal (that is, optimum) path corresponds to the shortest (that is, geodesic) path between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show that the minimal path serves also to minimize the total entropy production occurring during the transfer of states. Finally, upon evaluating the entropic speed as well as the total entropy production along optimal transfer paths within several scenarios of physical interest in analog quantum searching algorithms, we demonstrate in a transparent quantitative manner a correspondence between a faster transfer and a higher rate of entropy production. We therefore conclude that higher entropic speed is associated with lower entropic efficiency within the context of quantum state transfer.

TI Topological router induced via long-range hopping in a
   Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show how to implement the various kinds of topological routers via introducing the specific long-range hopping in the one-dimensional modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain. We find that the long-range hopping with hopping amplitudes identical to those of the intercell hopping between the first site and other odd sites holds a distinctive topological channel (gap state), by which the particle initially prepared at the last site can appear at the first site and all of the even sites with approximately equal probabilities. This extraordinary performance indicates that, from the perspective of treating the last site as the input port and treating the first site and other even sites as output ports, the present system can be naturally equivalent to a distribution device with multiple output ports, i.e., the topological router. We show that the number of the output ports for the present topological router can be flexibly tuned via reducing the long-range hopping terms. Especially, the system experiences a phase transition with the increasing of the long-range hopping amplitudes, in which the original gap state becomes a topological channel to implement the topological router with the output ports only at all even sites. We stress that both the two kinds of topological routers are protected by the energy gap and hence are robust to the mild disorder added into the system. Moreover, together with the construction of the topological interface, we find that the topological routers can own the output ports in a symmetrical way about the interface site. The topological routers may play the pivotal role in the large-scale entanglement distributions, which significantly expands and supplies the potential applications of the topological materials in quantum information processing.

TI Optimizing one-axis twists for variational Bayesian quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum metrology and sensing seek advantages in estimating an unknown parameter of some quantum state or channel, using entanglement such as spin squeezing produced by one-axis twists or other quantum resources. In particular, qubit phase estimation, or rotation sensing, appears as a ubiquitous problem with applications to electric field sensing, magnetometry, atomic clocks, and gyroscopes. By adopting the Bayesian formalism to the phase estimation problem to account for limited initial knowledge about the value of the phase, we formulate variational metrology and treat the state preparation (or encoding) and measurement (or decoding) procedures as parameterized quantum circuits. It is important to understand how effective various parametrized protocols are as well as how robust they are to the effects of complex noise such as spatially correlated noise. First, we propose a family of parametrized encoding and decoding protocols called arbitrary-axis twist ansatzes, and show that it can lead to a substantial reduction in the number of one-axis twists needed to achieve a target estimation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimation error associated with these strategies decreases with system size in a faster manner than classical (or no-twist) protocols, even in the less-explored regimes where the prior information is limited. Last, using a polynomial-sized tensor network algorithm, we numerically analyze practical variational metrology beyond the symmetric subspace of a collective spin and find that quantum advantage persists for the arbitrary-axis twist ansatzes with a few one-axis twists and smaller total twisting angles for practically relevant noise levels.

TI Two-step quantum dialogue protocols against collective noises
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB By designing two-step transmissions, this paper presents two quantum dialogue (QD) protocols that can resist different types of collective noise in the quantum channel. The message carrier of the proposed scheme utilizes decoherence-free subspaces to remain invariant under the impact of collective noise. We employ combinations of these quantum states to form decoy photon pairs, ensuring secure transmission and preventing message distortion. Based on the principle that a single photon in an EPR pair reveals no information about its actual state, an EPR pair requires only one photon for protection during transmission. This property effectively reduces the number of decoy photons needed to ensure the security of quantum transmission, which can also be applied to the logical EPR pair consisting of logical qubits. A quantum logic circuit is also designed to demonstrate the practical implementation of shuffling the logical qubits within each logical EPR pair. Therefore, the proposed two-step QD protocols require only half as many decoy photons to achieve the same security level as other state-of-the-art QD schemes. The significant reduction in the utilization of decoy photons improves the qubit efficiency of the proposed QD protocols compared to other existing works in the field. Additionally, the security analysis of the proposed QD schemes ensures the absence of information leakage and resistance to common quantum attacks.

TI Properties of multi-moded phase-randomized coherent states
SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB Phase-randomized coherent states are widely used in various applications of quantum optics. They are best known to be the core part of decoy-state quantum key distribution protocols with phase-coding. From the perspective of future development of quantum protocol architecture, it is important to determine whether phase randomization can be applied at an arbitrary stage of an optical scheme without affecting the informational properties of the quantum system. In this paper, using the superoperator formalism, we have shown that phase randomization of a two-mode coherent state commutes with linear optical transformations. This implies that phase randomization can be applied virtually at any point within the optical setup. We further demonstrate that the Holevo bound for such a state coincides with that of regular coherent states, bearing in mind that the Holevo bound quantifies only the maximum amount of information accessible to an eavesdropper. Advantages of phase-randomized coherent states compare to regular ones in particular cases of eavesdropper's strategies should be considered separately. Also, these findings indicate that phase randomization can be directly applied to a subcarrier wave quantum key distribution type of systems, opening prospects for its future development.

TI Sixth Generation Enabling Technologies and Machine Learning
   Intersection: A Performance Optimization Perspective
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication is in its finalization stage and has received favorable reception in many nations. However, research is now geared towards the anticipated sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. The new 6G promises even more severe performance criteria than the current 5G generation. New sophisticated technologies and paradigms are expected to be incorporated into the 6G network designs and procedures to meet the ever-dynamic user needs and standards. These 6G-enabling technologies include digital twin (DT), intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), visible light communication (VLC), quantum computing (QC), blockchain, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), among others. Optimal network performance requires that machine learning (ML) techniques be integrated over the 6G wireless network to provide solutions to highly complex networking problems, massive users, high overhead, and computational complexity. Consequently, we have provided a state-of-the-art overview of wireless network generations leading to the future 6G, and huge emphases have been laid on ML's role in optimization applications for different enabling 6G technologies. Several key performance indicators for the different application scenarios have been highlighted. ML has proved to significantly improve the performance of the existing 6G-enabling technologies, and choosing the appropriate approach can ultimately yield optimal results.

TI Low-weight high-distance error-correcting fermionic encodings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We perform an extended numerical search for practical fermion-to-qubit encodings with error-correcting properties. Ideally, encodings should strike a balance between a number of the seemingly incompatible attributes, such as having a high minimum distance, low-weight fermionic logical operators, a small qubit to fermionic mode ratio and a simple qubit connectivity graph including ancilla qubits for the measurement of stabilizers. Our strategy consists of a three-step procedure in which we: First generate encodings with code distances up to d 4 by a brute-force enumeration technique; subsequently, we use these encodings as starting points and apply Clifford deformations to them which allows us to identify higher-distance codes with d 7; finally, we optimize the hardware connectivity graphs of resulting encodings in terms of the graph thickness and the number of connections per qubit. We report multiple promising high-distance encodings which significantly improve the weights of stabilizers and logical operators compared to previously reported alternatives.

TI Correlations in Perturbed Dual-Unitary Circuits: Efficient Path-Integral
   Formula
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Interacting many-body systems with explicitly accessible spatiotemporal correlation functions are extremely rare, especially in the absence of Bethe-ansatz or Yang-Baxter integrability. Recently, we identified a remarkable class of such systems and termed them dual-unitary quantum circuits. These are brickwork-type local quantum circuits whose dynamics are unitary in both time and space. The spatiotemporal correlation functions of these systems turn out to be nontrivial only at the edge of the causal light cone and can be computed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. Dual unitarity, however, requires fine-tuning, and the degree of generality of the observed dynamical features remains unclear. Here, we address this question by studying perturbed dual-unitary quantum circuits. Considering arbitrary perturbations of the local gates, we prove that for a particular class of unperturbed elementary dual-unitary gates the correlation functions are still expressed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. These matrices, however, are now contracted over generic paths connecting the origin to a fixed end point inside the causal light cone. The correlation function is given as a sum over all such paths. Our statement is rigorous in the "dilute limit," where only a small fraction of the gates is perturbed, and in the presence of random longitudinal fields, but we provide theoretical arguments and stringent numerical checks supporting its validity even in the clean case (no randomness) and when all gates are perturbed. As a by-product of our analysis, in the case of random longitudinal fields-which turns out to be equivalent to certain classical Markov chains-we find four types of non-dual-unitary (and nonintegrable) interacting many-body systems where the correlation functions are exactly solvable and given-without approximations-by the path-sum formula.

TI High-Resolution Optical Imaging and Sensing Using Quantum Emitters in

SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Super-resolution microscopy has allowed optical imaging to reach resolutions well beyond the limit imposed by the diffraction of light. The advancement of super-resolution techniques is often an application-driven endeavor. However, progress in material science plays a central role too, as it allows for the synthesis and engineering of nanomaterials with the unique chemical and physical properties required to realize super-resolution imaging strategies. This aspect is the focus of this review. We show that quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride are proving to be excellent candidate systems for the realization of advanced high-resolution imaging techniques, and spin-based quantum sensing applications.

TI Search and state transfer between hubs by quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Search and state transfer between hubs, i.e., fully connected vertices, on otherwise arbitrary connected graph is investigated. Motivated by a recent result of Razzoli et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55, 265303 (2022)] on the universality of hubs in continuous-time quantum walks and spatial search, we extend the investigation to state transfer and also to the discrete-time case. We show that the continuous-time quantum walk allows for perfect state transfer between multiple hubs if the numbers of senders and receivers are close. Turning to the discrete-time case, we show that the search for hubs is successful provided that the initial state is locally modified to account for a degree of each individual vertex. Concerning state transfer using discrete-time quantum walk, it is shown that between a single sender and a single receiver one can transfer two orthogonal states in the same run time. Hence, it is possible to transfer an arbitrary quantum state of a qubit between two hubs. In addition, if the sender and the receiver know each other location, another linearly independent state can be transferred, allowing for exchange of a qutrit state. Finally, we consider the case of transfer between multiple senders and receivers. In this case we cannot transfer specific quantum states. Nevertheless, quantum walker can be transferred with high probability in two regimes-either when there is a similar number of senders and receivers, which is the same as for the continuous-time quantum walk, or when the number of receivers is considerably larger than the number of senders. Our investigation is based on dimensional reduction utilizing the invariant subspaces of the respective evolutions and the fact that for the appropriate choice of the loop weights the problem can be reduced to the complete graph with loops.

TI Pixel super-resolution with spatially entangled photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Pixelation is common in quantum imaging systems and limit the image spatial resolution. Here, the authors introduce a pixel super-resolution approach based on measuring the full spatially-resolved joint probability distribution of spatially-entangled photons, and improve pixel resolution by a factor two.
   Pixelation occurs in many imaging systems and limits the spatial resolution of the acquired images. This effect is notably present in quantum imaging experiments with correlated photons in which the number of pixels used to detect coincidences is often limited by the sensor technology or the acquisition speed. Here, we introduce a pixel super-resolution technique based on measuring the full spatially-resolved joint probability distribution (JPD) of spatially-entangled photons. Without shifting optical elements or using prior information, our technique increases the pixel resolution of the imaging system by a factor two and enables retrieval of spatial information lost due to undersampling. We demonstrate its use in various quantum imaging protocols using photon pairs, including quantum illumination, entanglement-enabled quantum holography, and in a full-field version of N00N-state quantum holography. The JPD pixel super-resolution technique can benefit any full-field imaging system limited by the sensor spatial resolution, including all already established and future photon-correlation-based quantum imaging schemes, bringing these techniques closer to real-world applications.

TI Fast Flux Entangling Gate for Fluxonium Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We analyze a high-fidelity two-qubit gate using fast flux pulses on superconducting fluxonium qubits. The gate is realized by temporarily detuning the magnetic flux through the fluxonium loop away from the half flux quantum sweet spot. We simulate dynamics of two capacitively coupled fluxoniums during the flux pulses and optimize the pulse parameters to obtain a highly accurate root iSWAP-like entangling gate. We also evaluate the effect of the flux noise and qubit relaxation on the gate fidelity. Our results demonstrate that the gate error remains below 10(-4) for a currently achievable magnitude of the flux noise and qubit relaxation time.

TI Enhanced phase sensitive amplification towards improving noise immunity
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum states are essential resource for quantum-enhanced applications. Loss incurred in the distribution channel, however, dissipates the high signal-to-noise ratio advantage enjoyed by the squeezed state. Here, we first demonstrate noise immunity enhancement by using phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) with measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier (MB-NLA). We explore the signal transfer capability with the amplifier in a noisy channel. The MB-NLA enhanced PSA has obvious suppression effect on channel noises, especially it has improvement for the noise contaminated signal. Better performance can be achieved by flexibly adjusting amplifier parameters. With the amplifier, it is promising to overcome the entanglement-distribution loss and show its superiority in squeezing based quantum sensing.

TI Complementarity of which-path information in induced and stimulated
   coherences via four-wave mixing process from warm Rb atomic ensemble
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Complementarity, a fundamental tenet of quantum optics, is indispensable for elucidating the fundamental principles of quantum physics and advancing quantum information processing applications. In the context wave-particle duality, induced-coherence experiments were understood through the lens of which-path information. Conversely, the stimulated-coherence experiments were explained by using the indistinguishability of the photon statistics of conjugate photons as a means of realizing complementarity. Here, we report a systematic approach for establishing a complementary relationship between the interference visibility, concurrence, and predictability in the crossing of induced and stimulated coherences of two-mode squeezed coherent states. This achieved using a double-path interferometer involving two independent four-wave mixing (FWM) atomic samples generated via spontaneous and stimulated FWM processes from a warm atomic ensemble of 87Rb. We demonstrate that the transition from quantum to classical behavior can be characterized by the induced coherence effect, distinguishing between the two-mode squeezed vacuum and coherent states. Moreover, our experimental scheme, employing two FWM atomic ensembles with long-coherent photons, provides valuable insights into the complementarity of which-path information in induced and stimulated coherences.

TI Exploring photon-number-encoded high-dimensional entanglement from a
   sequentially excited quantum three-level system
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The sequential resonant excitation of a two-level quantum system results in the emission of a state of light showing time-entanglement encoded in the photon-number basis: notions that can be extended to three-level quantum systems as discussed in a recent proposal [Opt. Lett. 48, 6332 (2023)]. Here, we report the experimental implementation of a sequential two-photon resonant excitation process of a solid-state three-level system, constituted by the biexciton, exciton, and ground states of a semiconductor quantum dot. The resulting light state exhibits entanglement in time and energy, encoded in the photon-number basis, which could be used in quantum information applications, e.g., dense information encoding or quantum communication protocols. By performing energy-and time-resolved correlation experiments in combination with extensive theoretical modeling, we are able to partially retrieve the entanglement structure of the generated state and extract an upper bound for the fidelity to the entangled target state of F <= 70% before loss.

TI Quantum process randomness
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We argue that the optimization of a quantum process based on the customarily used fidelity between the actual and the expected outputs may not be sufficient. We introduce a quantity namely the "quantum process randomness", which is the standard deviation of the distribution of Born probabilities corresponding to the orthonormal measurement that projects the expected output onto the eigenstates of the actual output, and obtain a trade-off between fidelity and randomness for an arbitrary quantum process. We consider approximate quantum cloning and teleportation processes to illustrate the concept. We find that the optimal approximate universal and state-dependent quantum cloning machines obtained by maximizing the fidelity is the same as that obtained by optimizing the difference between randomness and fidelity.

TI Detecting and Preserving Quantum Steering in Hydrogen Atoms: Entropic
   Inequalities and Lindblad Dynamics
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In the present work, we investigate the detection and control of quantum correlations in the hyperfine structure of hydrogen atoms under dissipative dynamics. The hydrogen atom serves as a fundamental platform for studying bipartite quantum correlations between the electron and proton spins, where entanglement is quantified by concurrence and EPR steering is witnessed through violation of the entropic steering inequality. By modeling the open-system evolution via the Lindblad master equation, we analyze the time-dependent behavior of concurrence, steering, and fidelity under varying dissipation rates. Numerical illustrations highlight the resilience of entanglement relative to steering in noisy environments, providing insights into the control of non-classical phenomena.

TI Transforming pure and mixed states using an NMR quantum homogenizer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The universal quantum homogenizer can transform a qubit from any state to any other state with arbitrary accuracy, using only unitary transformations to perform this task. Here we present an implementation of a finite quantum homogenizer using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), with a four-qubit system. We compare the homogenization of a mixed state to a pure state and the reverse process. After accounting for the effects of decoherence in the system, we find the experimental results to be consistent with the theoretical symmetry in how the qubit states evolve in the two cases. We analyze the implications of this symmetry by interpreting the homogenizer as a physical implementation of pure state preparation and information scrambling.

TI A novel hybrid authentication protocol utilizing lattice-based
   cryptography for IoT devices in fog networks
SO DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has taken the interconnected world by storm. Due to their immense applicability, IoT devices are being scaled at exponential proportions worldwide. But, very little focus has been given to securing such devices. As these devices are constrained in numerous aspects, it leaves network designers and administrators with no choice but to deploy them with minimal or no security at all. We have seen distributed denial-ofservice attacks being raised using such devices during the infamous Mirai botnet attack in 2016. Therefore we propose a lightweight authentication protocol to provide proper access to such devices. We have considered several aspects while designing our authentication protocol, such as scalability, movement, user registration, device registration, etc. To define the architecture we used a three-layered model consisting of cloud, fog, and edge devices. We have also proposed several pre-existing cipher suites based on post-quantum cryptography for evaluation and usage. We also provide a fail-safe mechanism for a situation where an authenticating server might fail, and the deployed IoT devices can self-organize to keep providing services with no human intervention. We find that our protocol works the fastest when using ring learning with errors. We prove the safety of our authentication protocol using the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. In conclusion, we propose a safe, hybrid, and fast authentication protocol for authenticating IoT devices in a fog computing environment.

TI Quantum mechanical four-dimensional non-polarizing beamsplitter
SO QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS
AB Some quantum optics researchers might not realize that classical electromagnetism predicts a pi phase shift between S- and P-polarized reflection and might think the reflection coefficients of the transverse modes are independent, or that such a phase shift has no measurable consequences. In this paper, we discuss theoretical grounds to define elements of a 4x4 matrix to represent the beamsplitter, accurately accounting for transverse polarization modes and phase relations between them. We also provide experimental evidence confirming this matrix representation. From a scientific point of view, the paper addresses a non-trivial equivalence between the classical fields Fresnel formalism and the canonical commutation relations of the quantized photonic fields. That the formalism can be readily verified with a simple experiment provides further benefit. The beamsplitter expression derived can be applied in the field of quantum computing.

TI Improving the creation of SiV centers in diamond via sub-μs pulsed
   annealing treatment
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are emerging as promising quantum emitters in applications such as quantum communication and quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate a sub-mu s pulsed annealing treatment that dramatically increases the photoluminescence of SiV centers in diamond. Using a silane-functionalized adamantane precursor and a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, the temperature and energy conditions required to form SiV centers in diamond were mapped out via an optical thermometry system with an accuracy of +/- 50 K and a 1 mu s temporal resolution. Annealing scheme studies reveal that pulsed annealing can obviously minimize the migration of SiV centers out of the diamond lattice, and a 2.5-fold increase in the number of emitting centers was achieved using a series of 200-ns pulses at a 50 kHz repetition rate via acousto-optic modulation. Our study provides a novel pulsed annealing treatment approach to improve the efficiency of the creation of SiV centers in diamond.
   Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are emerging as promising quantum emitters for various applications. Here, authors devised a novel pulsed annealing scheme that improves the conversion efficiency of SiV centers in diamond.

TI Low dephasing and robust micromagnet designs for silicon spin qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Using micromagnets to enable electron spin manipulation in silicon qubits has emerged as a very popular method, enabling single-qubit gate fidelities larger than 99.9%. However, these micromagnets also apply stray magnetic field gradients onto the qubits, making the spin states susceptible to electric field noise and limiting their coherence times. We describe here a magnet design that minimizes qubit dephasing, while allowing for fast qubit control and addressability. Specifically, we design and optimize magnet dimensions and positions relative to the quantum dots, minimizing dephasing from magnetic field gradients. The micromagnet-induced dephasing rates with this design are up to three orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art implementations, allowing for long coherence times. This design is robust against fabrication errors and can be combined with a wide variety of silicon qubit device geometries, thereby allowing exploration of coherence limiting factors and novel upscaling approaches.

TI Intensity-Product-Based Optical Sensing to Beat the Diffraction Limit in
   an Interferometer
SO SENSORS
AB The classically defined minimum uncertainty of the optical phase is known as the standard quantum limit or shot-noise limit (SNL), originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on the SNL, the phase sensitivity is inversely proportional to K, where K is the number of interfering photons or statistically measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous to enhance sensitivity due to the K gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In a typical interferometer, however, the resolution remains in the diffraction limit of the K = 1 case unless the interfering photons are resolved as in quantum sensing. Here, a projection measurement method in quantum sensing is adapted for classical sensing to achieve an additional K gain in the resolution. To understand the projection measurements, several types of conventional interferometers based on N-wave interference are coherently analyzed as a classical reference and numerically compared with the proposed method. As a result, the Kth-order intensity product applied to the N-wave spectrometer exceeds the diffraction limit in classical sensing and the Heisenberg limit in quantum sensing, where the classical N-slit system inherently satisfies the Heisenberg limit of pi/N in resolution.

This yields the first post-quantum succinct argument system from any falsifiable assumption.
   At the heart of our proof is a new quantum rewinding procedure that enables a reduction to repeatedly query a quantum adversary for accepting transcripts as many times as desired. Prior techniques were limited to a constant number of accepting transcripts.

The scheme is built upon supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman [15], and uses the password to generate permutations which obscure the auxiliary points. We include elements of a security proof, and discuss roadblocks to obtaining a proof in the BPR model [1]. We also include some performance results.

TI Sharp Diamond Needles for Single-Photon Emission
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Single-crystal diamond needles (SCDNs) have emerged as promising candidates for optical and quantum sensing applications due to their unique shape, high-quality crystalline structure, and availability for relatively simple mass production. In this study, morphology modification and luminescence features of SCDNs subjected to high-temperature oxidation in air at 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C are investigated. Significant morphological changes, including sharpening, length reduction, and surface feature formation, are revealed as a result of oxidation with scanning electron microscopy observations. The morphology modifications are dependent on oxidation temperature. Gradual sharpening and formation of surface protrusions with (100) and (111) surfaces during oxidation at 650 degrees C significantly accelerate at oxidation temperature increase to 700 degrees C. Observed formation of the surface protrusions is explained by local variation in resistance to oxidation at diamond needle surface. Furthermore, photon correlation measurements reveal that oxidation duration may be optimized allowing obtaining of SCDNs with single nitrogen-vacancy centers situated in their tips, and confirming the viability of these diamonds for quantum sensing. This findings highlight the superior optical properties and structural integrity of SCDNs, making them highly suitable for single-photon emission and other quantum technological applications.

It is also related to isogeny-based digital signatures. Over the last few years, there have been a number of advances in this area, but there are still many open problems.

AB It is shown that under reasonable assumptions a Drake-style equation can be obtained for the probability that our universe is the result of a deliberate simulation. Evaluating loose bounds for certain terms in the equation shows that the probability is unlikely to be as high as previously reported in the literature, especially in a scenario where the simulations are recursive. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of eavesdropping from the outside of such a simulation and introduce a general attack that can circumvent attempts at using quantum cryptography inside the simulation, even if the quantum properties of the simulation are genuine.

TI Quantitative calibration of a traveling-wave parametric amplifier
   applied to an optomechanical platform
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In the past decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity that they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4-400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to two-level systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fitted with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of the phonon population (i.e., Brownian-motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +/- 20% limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.

TI Diamond Surfaces with Clickable Antifouling Polymer Coating for
   Microarray-Based Biosensing
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Diamond enables the construction of various (bio)sensors, including those with quantum-based detection. However, bare diamond interfaces are susceptible to unspecific adhesion of proteins and other macromolecules from biological media or complex samples. This impairs selectivity in biosensing, leads to low signal-to-noise ratio in fluorescence-based applications, and introduces the need for blocking steps in incubation protocols. Here, a stable, protein-repellent, and clickable reactive polymer coating is introduced, abolishing unspecific protein adhesion while concurrently enabling covalent immobilization of functional compounds as recognition elements. The polymer coating has two segments, an antifouling poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) and an alkyne-terminated poly(propargyl methacrylamide) providing the click functionality. The antifouling properties and click-reactivity of the polymers are demonstrated by selective protein binding assays on micropatterns written by microchannel cantilever spotting (mu CS). The assays demonstrated the successful functionalization of both diamond and glass surfaces and the excellent antifouling properties of the polymer coating. The coating procedure is compatible with oxidized diamond surfaces thus well-suitable for diamond-based quantum technology. The results can directly impact applications of diamond materials in optically detected quantum sensing or fluorescence sensing in general. The polymer functionalization can also be used for any case where highly specific interaction with low fouling is desired.

TI Continuous heralding control of vortex beams using quantum metasurface
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Heralded detection is widely used in quantum information processing, as it allows real-time tuning the properties of a heralded photon by acting on the heralding photon. With polarization-entangled photon pairs, the authors use a geometric phase metasurface to achieve a remote and continuous control of the vortex states of the heralded photon.
   Metasurfaces utilize engineered nanostructures to achieve control on all possible dimensions of light, encouraging versatile applications, including beam steering, multifunctional lensing, and multiplexed holograms. Towards the quantum optical regime for metasurfaces, although significant efforts have been put into generating and analyzing specific quantum states, control schemes to further manipulate these quantum states or information are still limited. Here, based on a metasurface, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a continuous heralding scheme to remotely control a vortex beam with high robustness to noise using polarization-entangled photon pairs. Our metasurface entangles polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) and the polarization selection on heralding photon erases the which-OAM information on signal photon. It induces an interference of two different OAM states remotely, manifesting a continuous orbital rotation. Our results show that metasurfaces have potential applications in quantum communication and information processing in entangling information with increasing complexity in the content.

TI Engineering Rydberg-pair interactions in divalent atoms with
   hyperfine-split ionization thresholds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum information processing with neutral atoms relies on Rydberg excitation for entanglement generation. While the use of heavy divalent or open-shell elements, such as strontium or ytterbium, has benefits due to their optically active core and a variety of possible qubit encodings, their Rydberg structure is generally complex. For some isotopes in particular, hyperfine interactions are relevant even for highly excited electronic states. We employ multichannel quantum defect theory to infer the Rydberg structure of isotopes with nonzero nuclear spin and perform nonperturbative Rydberg-pair interaction calculations. We find that due to the high level density and sensitivities to external fields, experimental parameters must be precisely controlled. Specifically in 87Sr, we study an intrinsic F & ouml;rster resonance, unique to divalent atoms with hyperfine-split thresholds, which simultaneously provides line stability with respect to external field fluctuations and enhanced long-range interactions. Additionally, we provide parameters for pair states that can be effectively described by single-channel Rydberg series. The explored pair states provide exciting opportunities for applications in the blockade regime, as well as for more exotic long-range interactions such as largely flat, distance-independent potentials.

TI Multi-Line Superconducting Waveguides Based on YBCO-on-Kapton Technology
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Coplanar (with the ground) and stripline 25 cm long waveguides are manufactured from the YBCO-Kapton material. The waveguides are intended as the key components of a scalable signal delivery for large quantum computing systems and detectors. The waveguide is coupled with an integrated power divider that replaces the standard attenuator. The divider is designed to return most of the power to the previous thermalization stage. The method is projected to reduce the active dissipation by approximate to 10. We investigate the effect of internal strain in YBCO layer on the device's mechanical stability. We show that adhesives with high stiffness are essential for the reliability of YBCO-Kapton devices.

TI Multipartite steering verification with imprecise measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum steering is a fundamental quantum correlation that plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, but its verification crucially relies on precise measurements-an assumption often undermined by practical imperfections. Here, we investigate multipartite steering verification under imprecise measurements and develop a quantitative method that effectively eliminates false positives induced by measurement imprecision. A comparison with a device-independent approach demonstrates that our method accurately delineates the scope of valid verification. In a special case, our method also enables the verification of multipartite entanglement under nonideal conditions. These results substantially enhance the robustness of multipartite steering and entanglement verification against measurement imprecision, thereby promoting their applicability in realistic quantum technologies.

TI Enhanced (t, n) threshold d-level quantum secret
   sharing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum secret sharing is an essential and fundamental technique for sharing a secret with the all participants in quantum cryptography. It can be used to design many complex protocols such as secure multiparty summation, multiplication, sorting, voting, etc. Recently, Song et al. have discussed a quantum protocol for secret sharing, which has (t, n) threshold approach and modulo d, where t and n denote the threshold number of participants and total number of participants, respectively. Kao et al. point out that the secret in the Song et al.'s protocol cannot be reconstructed without other participants' information. In this paper, we discuss a protocol that overcomes this problem.

TI Scalable Parallel Measurement of Individual Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 NV centers in parallel. We show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5778 unique correlation coefficients. We discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the spatial resolution of single defects and will, thereby, help to unlock advances in applications such as singlemolecule NMR and characterization of integrated circuits. In addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.

TI High-Order Randomized Compiler for Hamiltonian Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Hamiltonian simulation is known to be one of the fundamental building blocks of a variety of quantum algorithms such as its most immediate application, that of simulating many-body systems to extract their physical properties. In this work, we present qSWIFT, a high-order randomized algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation. In qSWIFT, the required number of gates for a given precision is independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, while the systematic error is exponentially reduced with regard to the order parameter. In this respect, our qSWIFT is a higher-order counterpart of the previously proposed quantum stochastic drift protocol (qDRIFT), the number of gates in which scales linearly with the inverse of the precision required. We construct the qSWIFT channel and establish a rigorous bound for the systematic error quantified by the diamond norm. qSWIFT provides an algorithm to estimate given physical quantities by using a system with one ancilla qubit, which is as simple as other product-formula-based approaches such as regular Trotter-Suzuki decompositions and qDRIFT. Our numerical experiment reveals that the required number of gates in qSWIFT is significantly reduced compared to qDRIFT. In particular, the advantage is significant for problems where high precision is required; e.g., to achieve a systematic relative propagation error of 10-6, the required number of gates in third-order qSWIFT is 1000 times smaller than that of qDRIFT.

TI Robust and Efficient Hamiltonian Learning
SO QUANTUM
AB With the fast development of quantum technology, the sizes of both digital and analog quantum systems increase drastically. In order to have better control and understanding of the quantum hardware, an important task is to characterize the interaction, i.e., to learn the Hamiltonian, which determines both static and dynamic properties of the system. Conventional Hamiltonian learning methods either require costly process tomography or adopt impractical assumptions, such as prior information on the Hamiltonian structure and the ground or thermal states of the system. In this work, we present a robust and efficient Hamiltonian learning method that circumvents these limitations based only on mild assumptions. The proposed method can efficiently learn any Hamiltonian that is sparse on the Pauli basis using only short-time dynamics and local operations without any information on the Hamiltonian or preparing any eigenstates or thermal states. The method has a scalable complexity and a vanishing failure probability regarding the qubit number. Meanwhile, it performs robustly given the presence of state preparation and measurement errors and resiliently against a certain amount of circuit and shot noise. We numerically test the scaling and the estimation accuracy of the method for transverse field Ising Hamiltonian with random indynamics of large quantum systems.

In the heart of these security features are traditional cryptographic algorithms which are vulnerable to powerful quantum attacks.

Leveraging NIST-recommended algorithms -CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, XMSS, and SPHINCS+- our solutions not only withstand quantum attacks, but also outperform their classical counterparts in efficiency and flexibility for various use cases.

TI Quantum Fourier Transform Has Small Entanglement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a key component of many important quantum algorithms, most famously being the essential ingredient in Shor's algorithm for factoring products of primes. Given its remarkable capability, one would think it can introduce large entanglement to qubit systems and would be difficult to simulate classically. While early results showed the QFT indeed has maximal operator entanglement, we show that this is entirely due to the bit reversal in the QFT. The core part of the QFT has Schmidt coefficients decaying exponentially quickly, and thus it can generate only a constant amount of entanglement regardless of the number of qubits. In addition, we show the entangling power of the QFT is the same as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian with exponentially decaying interactions, and thus a variant of the area law for dynamics can be used to understand the low entanglement intuitively. Using the low entanglement property of the QFT, we show that classical simulations of the QFT on a matrix product state with low bond dimension take time linear in the number of qubits, providing a potential speedup over the classical fast Fourier transform on many classes of functions. We demonstrate this speedup in test calculations on some simple functions. For data vectors of length 106-108, the speedup can be a few orders of magnitude.

TI Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband
   entanglement
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiencybandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.

This module allowed the evaluation of ensemble diamond NV centers for measuring magnetic fields by continuous wave- optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), Rabi oscillation, pulsed ODMR, Ramsey measurement and spin-echo measurement. The sensitivity through pulsed measurements reached 40 nT/ Hz at 1 Hz, which achieved higher sensitivity by one order, especially at a frequency around 1 Hz compared with previously reported compact modules using diamond NV centers.

TI Photoactivation of NV Centers in Diamond via Continuous Wave Laser
   Illumination of Shallow As-Implanted Nitrogen
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond are appealing for quantum sensing applications due to their environmental sensitivity and long coherence times. Precise and scalable shallow color center creation is essential yet challenging for technological quantum applications. This is due to the involvement of several lengthy processes, such as ion implantation and thermal annealing of the samples. The latter process can be addressed by application of an alternative activation technique that bypasses the high-temperature annealing. For this, nitrogen-implanted regions on a diamond substrate are exposed to continuous-wave 405 nm laser radiation. The illumination leads to local activation of NV- centers with photoluminescence yield saturation for regions activated with laser power at around 800 mu W. For low implantation doses, single NV- centers are created with corresponding mean T2 coherence time value around 71 mu s. The NV- creation yield for the lower implantation doses match conventional creation methods, while higher doses show reduced yield values. However, the coherent properties are comparable to NV- centers within annealed samples. This shows that the activated NV- centers are well-suited for advanced applications in quantum sensing and related technologies.

AB Hermite-Korkin-Zolotarev (HKZ) reduction is an important notion of lattice reduction which plays a significant role in number theory (particularly the geometry of numbers), and more recently in coding theory and post-quantum cryptography. In this work, we determine a sharp upper bound on the orthogonality defect of HKZ reduced bases up to dimension 3. Using this result, we determine a general upper bound for the orthogonality defect of HKZ reduced bases of arbitrary rank. This upper bound is sharper than existing bounds in literature, such as the one determined by Lagarias, Lenstra and Schnorr [3].

TI First-Order Trotter Error from a Second-Order Perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulating quantum dynamics beyond the reach of classical computers is one of the main envisioned applications of quantum computers. The most promising quantum algorithms to this end in the near term are the simplest, which use the Trotter formula and its higher-order variants to approximate the dynamics of interest. The approximation error of these algorithms is often poorly understood, even in the most basic and topical cases where the target Hamiltonian decomposes into two realizable terms: H 1/4 H1 thorn H2. Recent studies have reported anomalously low approximation error with unexpected scaling in such cases, which they attribute to quantum interference between the errors from different steps of the algorithm. Here, we provide a simpler picture of these effects by relating the Trotter formula to its second-order variant for such H 1/4 H1 thorn H2 cases. Our method generalizes state-of-the-art error bounds without the technical caveats of prior studies, and elucidates how each part of the total error arises from the underlying quantum circuit. We compare our bound to the true error numerically, and find a close match over many orders of magnitude in the simulation parameters. Our findings further reduce the required circuit depth for the least experimentally demanding quantum simulation algorithms, and illustrate a useful method for bounding simulation error more broadly.

TI Simulation and Measurement of Stray Fields for the Manipulation of Spin
   Qubits in One- and Two-Dimensional Arrays
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The inhomogeneous magnetic stray field of micromagnets has been extensively used to manipulate electron spin qubits. By means of micromagnetic simulations and scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, we show that the polycrystallinity of the magnet and nonuniform magnetization significantly impact the stray field and corresponding qubit properties. The random orientation of the crystal axis in polycrystalline Co magnets alters the qubit frequencies by up to 0.5 GHz, compromising single qubit addressability and single gate fidelities. We map the stray field of Fe micromagnets with an applied magnetic field of up to 500 mT, finding field gradients above 1 mT/nm. The measured gradients and the lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Fe demonstrate the advantage of using Fe instead of Co as magnets in spin qubit devices. These properties of Fe also enabled us to design a 2D arrangement of nanomagnets for driving spin qubits distributed on a 2D lattice.

TI Hamiltonian characterization of multi-time processes with classical
   memory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A central problem in open quantum systems is the characterization of non-Markovian processes, where an environment retains the memory of its interaction with the system. A key distinction is whether or not this memory can be simulated classically, as this can lead to efficient modelling and noise mitigation. Powerful tools have been developed recently within the process matrix formalism, a framework that conveniently characterizes all multi-time correlations through a sequence of measurements. This leads to a detailed classification of classical and quantum-memory processes and provides operational procedures to distinguish between them. However, these results leave open the question of what type of system-environment interactions lead to classical memory. More generally, process-matrix methods lack a direct connection to joint system-environment evolution, a cornerstone of open-system modelling. In this work, we characterize Hamiltonian and circuit-based models of system-environment interactions leading to classical memory. We show that general time-dependent Hamiltonians with product eigenstates, and where the environment's eigenstates form a time-independent, orthonormal basis, always produce a particular type of classical memory: probabilistic mixtures of unitary processes. Equivalently, these Hamiltonians are characterized as commuting with a complete set of observables on the environment. Additionally, we show that the most general type of classical memory processes can be generated by a quantum circuit in which the system and environment interact through a specific class of controlled unitaries. Our results establish the first strong link between process-matrix methods and traditional Hamiltonian-based approaches to open quantum systems.

AB Quantum computing is becoming increasingly relevant. Numerous research efforts are being carried out to improve quantum computers by increasing the number of qubits in their processors, mitigating noise, etc. However, the tools that exist to program these computers are not advancing at the same speed. Therefore, in this work, we propose Quirk+, a quantum circuit development tool based on Quirk. We have implemented improvements over Quirk such as the inclusion of a custom gate importer/exporter, a running circuit inspector, a translator to qasm and vice-versa, as well as other interface usability improvements. Tools such as the one we propose in this paper will facilitate the work of quantum software developers, as well as break down the barriers to access to this type of programming for classical software developers.

TI Quantum and braided ZX calculus*
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We apply quantum group methods to quantum computing, starting with the notion of interacting Frobenius Hopf algebras for ZX calculus with noncommutative algebra and noncocommutative coalgebra. We introduce the notion of *-structures in ZX calculus at this algebraic level and construct examples based on the quantum group u ( q )(sl (2)) at a root of unity. We provide an abstract formulation of the Hadamard gate related to Hopf algebra self-duality. We then solve the problem of extending the notion of interacting Hopf algebras and ZX calculus to take place in a braided tensor category. In the ribbon case, the Hadamard gate coming from braided self-duality obeys a modular identity. We give the example of b ( q )(sl (2)), the self-dual braided version of u ( q )(sl (2)).

TI Design and Fabrication of Grating Couplers for the Optical Addressing of

SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB In this work, silicon photonics structures for the optical addressing of trapped ion is developed for quantum computing applications. Grating-waveguide-grating structures of various designs are designed, and fabricated for various radius curvatures of 12, 15, 25 and 30 mu m, respectively. From the optical measurements, gratings with radius of curvature of 25 and 30 mu m exhibit lower power loss of 36.5 and 33.9 dB with better-focused beam profiles as compared to those with radius of curvature of 12 and 15 mu m. The beam width from these gratings ranges between 17.31 to 41.54 mu m, which provides the feasibility to perform optical addressing on 2 to 4 Sr+ ions trapped along the ground electrode of the ion trap.

TI Localization Detection Based on Quantum Dynamics
SO ENTROPY
AB Detecting many-body localization (MBL) typically requires the calculation of high-energy eigenstates using numerical approaches. This study investigates methods that assume the use of a quantum device to detect disorder-induced localization. Numerical simulations for small systems demonstrate how the magnetization and twist overlap, which can be easily obtained from the measurement of qubits in a quantum device, changing from the thermal phase to the localized phase. The twist overlap evaluated using the wave function at the end of the time evolution behaves similarly to the one evaluated with eigenstates in the middle of the energy spectrum under a specific condition. The twist overlap evaluated using the wave function after time evolution for many disorder realizations is a promising probe for detecting MBL in quantum computing approaches.

TI Theoretical investigation of charge transfer between the
   NV- center in diamond and substitutional N and P
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (N V) lattice defect in diamond, consisting of an N substitutional atom and an adjacent C vacancy, is commonly observed in two charge states, negative (N V -) and neutral (N V 0). The N V - defect exhibits spin state-dependent fluorescence and is, therefore, amenable to optical methods for spin-state readout, while the N V 0 is not. Hence, the N V - defect is much more useful for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, only N V 0 electroluminescence has been observed, even from centers showing N V - in photoluminescence. In the present work, we use first-principles electronic structure calculations to determine adiabatic charge transition levels for the conversion of N V - to N V 0 in the presence of substitutional N or P impurities, which provide the charge of the N V - center. We find that the adiabatic charge transition levels in the presence of such impurities lie at energies close to or lower than the zero-phonon line of the N V - center and that these energies only decrease as the concentration of N donors increases. This work, therefore, elucidates the absence of observed electroluminescence from the N V - and proposes a path toward observation of the phenomenon.

AB Spin defects in semiconductors are attracting interest as a material basis for quantum information and computing technologies. In this work, the spin properties of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy ( NV- ) centers in a 6H-SiC silicon carbide crystal enriched with the 28 Si isotope were studied by high-frequency ( 94 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. Due to an optical excitation channel at the NV- centers, it was possible to initialize the electron spin of the defect using a laser source, which led to a significant increase in the intensity of the recorded EPR signal. The dependences of the observed spin polarization were analyzed at different optical excitation wavelengths (lambda lambda = 640 - 1064 nm), output power (0 0 - 500 mW), and temperature ( 50 - 300 K) of the crystal. The results obtained reveal the optimal experimental conditions for maximizing the efficiency of optical quantum energy transfer to the spin system. This opens up new possibilities for using NV- centers in 6H-SiC to create multi-qubit spin-photon interfaces operating in the infrared region.

TI Identifying high-energy electronic states of NV- centers in
   diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is a prototype photoluminescent point defect spin qubit with promising quantum technology applications, enabled by its efficient optical spin polarization and readout. Its low-lying electronic states and optical spin polarization cycle have been well characterized over decades, establishing it as a benchmark system for state-of-the-art computational methods in point defect research. While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-density functional theory methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels. These results enhance our understanding of the nitrogen-vacancy center's energy spectrum, providing a broader reference for benchmarking high-level first-principles methods. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Universal quantum state preparation via revised greedy algorithm
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Preparation of quantum state lies at the heart of quantum information processing. The greedy algorithm provides a potential method to effectively prepare quantum state. However, the standard greedy (SG) algorithm, in general, cannot take the global maxima and instead becomes stuck on a local maxima. Based on the SG algorithm, in this paper we propose a revised version to design dynamic pulses to realize universal quantum state preparation, i.e. preparing an arbitrary state from another arbitrary one. As applications, we implement this scheme to the universal preparation of single- and two-qubit state in the context of semiconductor quantum dots and superconducting circuits. Evaluation results show that our scheme outperforms the alternative numerical optimizations with higher preparation quality while possesses the comparable high efficiency. Compared with the emerging machine learning, it shows better accessibility and does not require any training. Moreover, the numerical results show that the pulse sequences generated by our scheme are robust against various errors and noises. Our scheme opens a new avenue of optimization in few-level system and limited action space quantum control problems.

TI Distinguishing graph states by the properties of their marginals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Graph states are a class of multipartite entangled quantum states that are ubiquitous in quantum information. We study equivalence relations between graph states under local unitaries (LU) to obtain distinguishing methods both in local and in networked settings. Based on the marginal structure of graph states, we introduce a family of easy-to-compute LU invariants. We show that these invariants uniquely identify the entanglement classes of every graph state up to eight qubits and discuss their reliability for larger numbers of qubits. To handle larger graphs, we generalize tools to test for local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states that work by condensing large graphs into smaller graphs. In turn, we show that statements on the equivalence of these smaller graphs (which are easier to compute) can be used to infer statements on the equivalence of the original, larger graphs. We analyze LU equivalence in two key settings, with and without allowing for the permutation of qubits. We identify entanglement classes, whose marginal structure does not allow us to distinguish them. As a result, we increase the bound on the number of qubits where the LU-LC conjecture holds from 8 to 10 qubits in the setting where qubit permutations are allowed.

TI Baseband control of single-electron silicon spin qubits in two
   dimensions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Micromagnet-enabled electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR) is an established method for high-fidelity single-spin control in silicon, although so far experiments have been restricted to one-dimensional arrays. In contrast, qubit control based on hopping spins has recently emerged as a compelling alternative, with high-fidelity baseband control realized in sparse two-dimensional hole arrays in germanium. In this work, we commission a 28Si/SiGe 2 x 2 quantum dot array both as a four-qubit device using EDSR and as a two-qubit device using baseband hopping control. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the hopping gate of 99.50(6)%, which is similar to the average fidelity of the resonant gate. The hopping gate also circumvents the transient pulse-induced resonance shift from heating observed during EDSR operation. To motivate hopping spins as an attractive means of scaling silicon spin-qubit arrays, we propose an extensible nanomagnet design that enables engineered baseband control of large spin arrays.

TI Gray molasses cooling of 39K atoms in optical tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Robust cooling and nondestructive imaging are prerequisites for many emerging applications of neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers, such as their use in quantum information science and analog quantum simulation. The tasks of cooling and imaging can be challenged, however, by the presence of large trap-induced shifts of their respective optical transitions. Here, we explore a system of K-39 atoms trapped in a near-detuned (780nm) optical tweezer, which leads to relatively minor differential (ground versus excited state) Stark shifts. We demonstrate that simple and robust loading, cooling, and imaging can be achieved through combined addressing of the D-1 and D-2 transitions. While imaging on the D-2 transition, we can simultaneously apply Lambda-enhanced gray molasses (GM) on the D-1 transition, preserving low backgrounds for single-atom imaging through spectral filtering. Using D-1 cooling during and after trap loading, we demonstrate enhanced loading efficiencies as well as cooling to low temperatures. These results suggest a simple and robust path for loading and cooling large arrays of potassium atoms in optical tweezers through the use of resource-efficient near-detuned optical tweezers and GM cooling.

TI Entangling Schrödinger's cat states by bridging discrete- and

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. Integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming their respective limitations. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schr & ouml;dinger's cat states by two methods. The first involves the entanglement-preserving conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). The second method implements a iSWAP\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sqrt{{{{\rm{iSWAP}}}}}$$\end{document} gate between two cat states following the procedure for Fock-state encoding. This simple and fast gate operation completes a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system. Our work offers powerful applications of DV-CV hybridization and marks a first step toward developing a multi-qubit platform based on planar KPO systems.

TI Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducting circuits.

TI Impact of Josephson-Junction Array Modes on Fluxonium Readout
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MISTs) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson-junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.

TI High coherence and low cross-talk in a tileable 3D integrated
   superconducting circuit architecture
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We report high qubit coherence as well as low cross-talk and single-qubit gate errors in a superconducting circuit architecture that promises to be tileable to two-dimensional (2D) lattices of qubits. The architecture integrates an inductively shunted cavity enclosure into a design featuring nongalvanic out-of-plane control wiring and qubits and resonators fabricated on opposing sides of a substrate. The proof-of-principle device features four uncoupled transmon qubits and exhibits average energy relaxation times T-1 = 149(38) mu s, pure echoed dephasing times T-phi,T-e = 189(34) mu s, and single-qubit gate fidelities F= 99.982(4)% as measured by simultaneous randomized benchmarking. The 3D integrated nature of the control wiring means that qubits will remain addressable as the architecture is tiled to form larger qubit lattices. Band structure simulations are used to predict that the tiled enclosure will still provide a clean electromagnetic environment to enclosed qubits at arbitrary scale.

TI D1 magic wavelength tweezers for scaling atom arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient trapping and detection of single atoms in optical tweezers are important for realizing atom arrays, a promising platform for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. However, the scaling up of atom arrays can be impeded by detrimental light shifts induced by the tweezer trap, making it challenging to cool and image single atoms. Here, we report an order-of-magnitude increase in the scalability of Na-23 atom arrays by using D-1 magic wavelength tweezers to reduce the required tweezer power per trap. D-1 magic wavelengths have been previously predicted to exist for all the alkali atoms but are not yet observed to date. We first experimentally confirm a D-1 magic wavelength that is predicted to lie at 615.87 nm, which we then use to trap and image single atoms without having to modulate the trapping and imaging light intensities. We further demonstrate that the mean loading efficiency remains as high as 80.0(6)% for a single trap and 74.2(7)% for a one-dimensional array of eight atoms. The methods reported here are applicable to all the alkalis, including those that are attractive candidates for dipolar molecule assembly, Rydberg dressing, or are fermionic in nature.

TI Manipulations and quantum tomography of bright squeezed states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Generation and manipulation of continuous variable quantum states are the building blocks of quantum communication, quantum key distribution and quantum networks. According to the second-order nonlinear process of the periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal, we design a semi-monolithic optical parametric amplifier (OPA) cavity to generate the bright squeezed light at a wavelength of 1064 nm. With the injection of a seed beam, the squeezed state generated by the OPA has a coherent amplitude, so called bright squeezed state. The squeezing level is directly observed to be -11.6 dB when the pump power is 310 mW at an analysis frequency of 3 MHz. However, with the increase of the pump power, the purity of the squeezed state gets lower and lower due to the increased influence of the anti-squeezing quadrature component on the squeezed quadrature component in the detection process. To obtain a higher purity of the squeezed state for achieving linear optical manipulation and quantum tomography, we choose the pump power of 50 mW, the squeezing level decreases to -6 dB, and the purity of the squeezed state is 98.5% in this case. An electro-optic modulator is adopted to realize the liner manipulation of the squeezed light in the phase space. During the measurement of the bright squeezed state, all the data are taken on condition that the length of the OPA cavity and relative phase between the seed beam and the pump beam are locked by a locking loop. The direct current (DC) signal of the balanced homodyne detection (BHD) is used to accurately determine the phase corresponding to the time domain signal of the squeezed state, while the alternate current (AC) signal of the BHD is mixed with the signal generated by the function generator, after passing through a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter, the signal is then amplified by using a low-noise amplifier. A high-performance oscilloscope is finally used to simultaneously collect the signals, thus obtaining the quantum noise signal of the bright squeezed light after linear manipulation. Together with the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, the quantum tomography, the density matrix and the Wigner function of the bright squeezed light are obtained, that is, all the information such as the photon number distribution of the quantum state is determined. Multiple iterations are taken in the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm process to eliminate the influence of the low quantum efficiency on the detection system, so that the density matrix is fitted well with the theoretical results.

TI Adaptive denoising quantum state preparation in a dynamic environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state preparation (QSP) is an essential step in many quantum information processing tasks and has been deeply studied in a closed system. However, environmental noise inevitably destroys the quantumness of the system, resulting in decreased fidelity. In this work, we investigate the enhancement of fidelity by pulse control for arbitrary single or two-qubit QSP in a noisy environment. The control pulses are designed by leveraging supervised learning. The environment is modeled as a collection of bosons, and we use the quantum state diffusion equation technique to deal with the dynamics of the system. We consider two types of noise: quasistatic noise and dynamic noise. We propose active and adaptive denoising schemes for the quasistatic and dynamic noise, respectively. The environmental parameters are required to construct the dataset when training the neural network (NN) in adaptive denoising, while they are not needed in active denoising. The adaptive denoising scheme is universal in that it can be effectively applied to both quasistatic and dynamic noises. High-fidelity QSP has been obtained by the well-trained NN. Our work demonstrates that machine learning has great potential in optimal pulse design in a dynamic environment.

TI STRU: A VARIANT OF NTRU OVER Z[σ]
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB NTRU is a public-key cryptosystem whose operation is based on convolutional polynomial rings over Z. This work focuses on presenting STRU, the variant of NTRU that results from replacing Z with Z[sigma] (the ring of integers of Q( root-7)). In addition, we study the main features of STRU such as its speed, decryption failure probability and resistance to lattice attacks. Comparing these features we find that, at least theoretically, STRU is faster and slightly more resistant than NTRU. Also, we present and discuss properties of the ring Z[sigma] and its division algorithm.

TI NIEDERREITER CRYPTOSYSTEMS USING QUASI-CYCLIC CODES THAT RESIST QUANTUM
   FOURIER SAMPLING
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems are robust and versatile cryptosystems. These cryptosystems work with many linear error-correcting codes. They are popular these days because they can be quantum-secure. In this paper, we study the Niederreiter cryptosystem using non-binary quasi cyclic codes. We prove, if these quasi-cyclic codes satisfy certain conditions, the corresponding Niederreiter cryptosystem is resistant to the hidden subgroup problem using weak quantum Fourier sampling. Though our work uses the weak Fourier sampling, we argue that its conclusions should remain valid for the strong Fourier sampling as well.

We also find exact canonical MPS representations with a minimal bond dimension for higher-spin and qudit Dicke states.

TI Electronic interferometry with ultrashort plasmonic pulses
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate the existence of a "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This result highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Sequential Hypothesis Testing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce sequential analysis in quantum information processing, by focusing on the fundamental task of quantum hypothesis testing. In particular, our goal is to discriminate between two arbitrary quantum states with a prescribed error threshold e when copies of the states can be required on demand. We obtain ultimate lower bounds on the average number of copies needed to accomplish the task. We give a block-sampling strategy that allows us to achieve the lower bound for some classes of states. The bound is optimal in both the symmetric as well as the asymmetric setting in the sense that it requires the least mean number of copies out of all other procedures, including the ones that fix the number of copies ahead of time. For qubit states we derive explicit expressions for the minimum average number of copies and show that a sequential strategy based on fixed local measurements outperforms the best collective measurement on a predetermined number of copies. Whereas for general states the number of copies increases as log 1/epsilon, for pure states sequential strategies require a finite average number of samples even in the case of perfect discrimination, i.e., epsilon = 0.

TI Thin Film Materials for Room Temperature Quantum Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Thin films with quantum defects are emerging as a potential platform for quantum applications. Quantum defects in some thin films arise due to structural imperfections, such as vacancies or impurities. These defects generate localized electronic states with unique optical and electronic properties. Crystal vacancies or defects that occur when atoms are missing from a crystal lattice can influence a material's quantum properties. In this study, we investigated inexpensive, complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible materials with quantum defects suitable for room temperature applications. The experiments indicated 5, 15, and 17 ns relaxation times for aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide or alumina, and tin oxides, respectively. For all these materials, distinct resonant peaks are observed at approximately 1.1, 1.6, 2.2, and 2.7 GHz at room temperature (i.e., 21 degrees C). These peaks exhibit slight frequency shifts, corresponding to known defect locations and thin film material properties. This discovery may lead the way to reliable, cost-effective quantum applications in our daily lives.

TI Fast optical transport of ultracold molecules over long distances
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optically trapped laser-cooled polar molecules hold promise for new science and technology in quantum information and quantum simulation. Large numerical aperture optical access and long trap lifetimes are needed for many studies, but these requirements are challenging to achieve in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) vacuum chamber that is connected to a cryogenic buffer gas beam source, as is the case for all molecule laser cooling experiments so far. Long distance transport of molecules greatly eases fulfilling these requirements as molecules are placed into a region separate from the MOT chamber. We realize a fast transport method for ultracold molecules based on an electronically focus-tunable lens combined with an optical lattice. The high transport speed is achieved by the 1D red-detuned optical lattice, which is generated by interference of a focus-tunable laser beam and a focus-fixed laser beam. Efficiency of 48(8)% is realized in the transport of ultracold calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules over 46 cm distance in 50 ms, with a moderate heating from 32(2) mu K to 53(4) mu K. Positional stability of the molecular cloud allows for stable loading of an optical tweezer array with single molecules.

TI Bi-planar magnetic stabilisation coils for an inertial sensor based on
   atom interferometry
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Inertial sensors that measure the acceleration of ultracold atoms promise unrivalled accuracy compared to classical equivalents. However, atomic systems are sensitive to various perturbations, including magnetic fields, which can introduce measurement inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we have designed, manufactured, and validated a magnetic field stabilisation system for a quantum sensor based on atom interferometry. We solve for the magnetic field generated by surface currents in-between a pair of bi-rectangular coils and approximate the surface current using discrete wires. The wires are wound by-hand onto machined panels which are retrofitted onto the existing mounting structure of the sensor without interfering with any experimental components. Along the central 60 mm of the y-axis, which aligns with the trajectory of the atoms during interferometry, the coils are measured to generate an independent uniform axial magnetic field with a strength of B-z = (22.81 +/- 0.01) mu T/A [mean +/- 2 sigma std.error] and an independent linear axial field gradient of strength dB(z)/dy = (10.6 +/- 0.1) mu T/Am. The uniform B-z field is measured to deviate by a maximum value of 1.3% in the same region, which is a factor of three times more uniform than the previously-used on-sensor rectangular B-z compensation set.

TI Unveiling wave-particle duality via second-order photon correlations
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Wave-particle duality as a fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is crucial for advancing comprehension of quantum theories and developing quantum technologies with practical applications. However, taking into account experimental impact factors to develop a feasible measurement for wave-like and particle-like properties of light fields is an ongoing challenge, and the non-classicality extraction and determination remains to be explored. In this work, feasibly measurable second-order photon correlations based on Hanbury Brown-Twiss and Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences are employed to analyze the evolution of wave-particle duality for various input states. The wave-particle dualities of chaotic, coherent and mixed classical states as functions of time delay and coherence time are investigated. The realistic impacts of background noise, detection efficiency, intensity ratio and phase differences on the wave-particle duality of nonclassical (Fock and squeezed coherent) states are unveiled. In noisy backgrounds with low detection efficiencies, efficient enhancement and extraction of non-classicality and a continuous transition from classical to nonclassical region are achieved in single photon state mixed with coherent state by adjusting the phase difference from 0 to pi/2. The non-classicality of squeezed coherent state can be induced by the classical wave-like and particle-like properties. The research provides a practical precision measurement of wave-particle duality that is helpful for the improvement of high-resolution quantum imaging and sensing.

TI Measurement of dispersion properties in a short optical fiber for an
   efficient quantum frequency converter
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical fibers have played a pivotal role in the long-distance transportation of quantum states and quantum key distribution due to their low loss. They have garnered attention for photon- pair generation and quantum frequency conversion due to their engineered dispersion properties. Accurate measurement of dispersion properties is essential for these applications. In this study, we introduce a new method to measure the dispersion properties of short optical fibers using Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing (BS-FWM). We successfully measured properties, including zero group-velocity-dispersion wavelength, dispersion slope, and the nonlinear coefficient, for fiber lengths ranging from 9.7 m to 392.7 m. Furthermore, we achieved efficient quantum frequency conversion with an efficiency of 83.8 +/- 0.8% using parameters extracted from a 53.9m-long optical fiber. Our research offers a valuable resource for improving the performance of fiber-based photon-pair sources and quantum frequency converters and has potential implications for advancing fiber-based quantum information processing.

TI Reentrant phase behavior in systems with density-induced tunneling
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We show that correlations in strongly interacting many-particle systems can create quantum decoherence, leading to a mechanism of dissipation that does not rely on an external source. Using analytical methods, we study a bosonic many body system in two dimensions, with extended interactions between particles. We show that, as expected, the system can be driven out of a coherent state. Surprisingly, when the interaction strength is sufficiently large, the system reenters the superfluid phase even after coherence is lost. The breakdown of quantum coherence is a certainty, but interpreting the process correctly relies on understanding and preserving the nature of the coupling between the constituents of the many particle system. The methods used provide a natural cutoff point at the critical temperature, where superfluidity breaks down.

TI On quantum superpositions of graphs, no-signalling and covariance
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We provide a mathematically and conceptually robust notion of quantum superpositions of graphs. The formalism may be useful for the purpose of modelling a 'fully quantum internet' and states of geometry in quantum gravity. We argue that quantum superpositions of graphs do require node names for their correct alignment, which we demonstrate through a no-signalling argument. The need for node names was often overlooked or disagreed upon in previous proposals. Still, node names should remain a fiducial construct, serving a similar purpose to the labelling of points through a choice of coordinates in continuous space. Graph renamings, aka isomorphisms, are understood as a change of coordinates on the graph. We explain how to impose renaming invariance at the level of operators over quantum superpositions of graphs, in a way that still allows us to talk about local operators.

TI Singly doped colloidal quantum dots as optically addressed
   nanopositionable qubits
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are isolated semiconductor nanocrystals with a size-tunable bandgap that can be prepared and processed by well-established solvent-based chemistry, and are currently used for a number of optoelectronic applications. When doped with a single atom, they also have great potential as a platform for optically addressable spin qubits. This perspective first describes the process by which doped CQDs can be made and the electronic structure produced in them by doping with a single atom. The properties that make them particularly well-suited as a spin-photon interface are identified: a local environment for the dopant that is free of unwanted spins; an optical cross-section for the dopant that can be enhanced by orders of magnitude via an exchange interaction with the band edge exciton of the dot; and, as an isolated nanocrystal, the scope for nano-positioning and hence precise incorporation into device structures. Lastly, two areas for development are discussed which would enhance the impact of singly doped quantum dots on quantum technology. The first of these is a synthetic method that ensures deterministic doping with single atoms and the second is to expand the range of dopants available.

AB Quantum circuit simulations are essential for the verification of quantum algorithms on behalf of real quantum devices. However, the memory requirements for such simulations grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved in quantum programs. Moreover, a substantial number of computations in quantum circuit simulations cause low locality data accesses, as they require extensive computations across the entire table of the full state vector. These characteristics lead to significant latency and energy overheads during data transfers between the CPU and main memory. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational logic near DRAM banks, could present a promising solution to address these challenges.
   In this paper, we introduce PIMutation (PIM framework for qUanTum circuit simulATION) for achieving fast and energy-efficient quantum circuit simulation. PIMutation is the first attempt to leverage UPMEM, a publicly available PIM-integrated DIMM, to implement quantum circuit simulations. PIMutation incorporates three optimization strategies to overcome the overhead of quantum circuit simulation using the real PIM system: (i) gate merging, (ii) row swapping, and (iii) vector partitioning. Our evaluations show that PIMutation achieves an average speedup of 2.99x and 16.51x with a reduction of energy of 25.23% and 75.29% over the QuEST simulator on CPU in 16- and 32-qubit benchmarks, respectively.

TI Non-local polarization alignment and control in fibers using feedback
   from correlated measurements of entangled photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum measurements that use the entangled photons' polarization to encode quantum information require calibration and alignment of the measurement bases between spatially separate observers. Because of the changing birefringence in optical fibers arising from temperature fluctuations or external mechanical vibrations, the polarization state at the end of a fiber channel is unpredictable and time-varying. Polarization tracking and stabilization methods originally developed for classical optical communications cannot be applied to polarization-entangled photons, where the separately detected photons are statistically unpolarized, yet quantum mechanically correlated. We report here a fast method for automatic alignment and dynamic tracking of the polarization measurement bases between spatially separated detectors. The system uses the Nelder-Mead simplex method to minimize the observed coincidence rate between non-locally measured entangled photon pairs, without relying on classical wavelength-multiplexed pilot tones or temporally interleaved polarized photons. Alignment and control is demonstrated in a 7.1 km deployed fiber loop as well as in a controlled drifting scenario.

TI Many-body quantum muon effects and quadrupolar coupling in solids
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Strong quantum zero-point motion (ZPM) of light nuclei and other particles is a crucial aspect of many state-of-the-art quantum materials. However, it has only recently begun to be explored from an ab initio perspective, through several competing approximations. Here we develop a unified description of muon and light nucleus ZPM and establish the regimes of anharmonicity and positional quantum entanglement where different approximation schemes apply. Via density functional theory and path-integral molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate that in solid nitrogen, alpha-N-2, muon ZPM is both strongly anharmonic and many-body in character, with the muon forming an extended electric-dipole polaron around a central, quantum-entangled [N-2-mu-N-2](+) complex. By combining this quantitative description of quantum muon ZPM with precision muon quadrupolar level-crossing resonance experiments, we independently determine the static N-14 nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant of pristine alpha-N-2 to be -5.36(2) MHz, a significant improvement in accuracy over the previously-accepted value of -5.39(5) MHz, and a validation of our unified description of light-particle ZPM.
   Quantum entanglement and uncertainty in the positions of light nuclei and implanted particles can crucially impact our understanding of advanced materials. This paper develops a unified theoretical description of these effects and applies it to muon spectroscopy measurements of a material constant to significantly improve their accuracy.

TI CaY@C2n : Exploring Molecular Qubits with Ca-Y
   Metal-Metal Bonds
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Metal-metal bonding is crucial in chemistry for advancing our understanding of the fundamental aspects of chemical bonds. Metal-metal bonds based on alkaline-earth (Ae) elements, especially the heavier Ae elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba), are rarely reported due to their high electropositivity. Herein, we report two heteronuclear di-EMFs CaY@C-s(6)-C-82 and CaY@C-2v(5)-C-80, which contain unprecedented single-electron Ca-Y metal-metal bonds. These compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. The crystallographic study of CaY@C-s(6)-C-82 shows that Ca and Y are successfully encapsulated into the carbon cage with a Ca-Y distance of 3.691 & Aring;. The CW-EPR study of both CaY@C-s(6)-C-82 and CaY@C-2v(5)-C-80 exhibits a doublet, suggesting the presence of an unpaired electron located between Ca and Y. The combined experimental and theoretical results confirm the presence of a Ca-Y single-electron metal-metal bond with substantial covalent interaction, attributed to significant overlap between the 4s4p orbitals of Ca and the 5s5p4d orbitals of Y. Furthermore, pulse EPR spectroscopy was used to investigate the quantum coherence of the electron spin within this bond. The unpaired electron, characterized by its s orbital nature, is effectively protected by the carbon cage, resulting in efficient suppression of both spin-lattice relaxation and decoherence. CaY@C-s(6)-C-82 behaves as an electron spin qubit, displaying a maximum decoherence time of 7.74 mu s at 40 K. This study reveals an unprecedented Ae-rare-earth metal-metal bond stabilized by the fullerene cages and elucidates the molecular qubit properties stemming from their unique bonding character, highlighting their potential in quantum information processing applications.

TI Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A general framework for analyzing the topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.

AB NTRU is a public-key cryptosystem whose operation is based on convolutional polynomial rings over Z. This work focuses on presenting STRU, the variant of NTRU that results from replacing Z with Z [sigma] (the ring of integers of Q(root-7)). In addition, we study the main features of STRU such as its speed, decryption failure probability and resistance to lattice attacks. Comparing these features we find that, at least theoretically, STRU is faster and slightly more resistant than NTRU. Also, we present and discuss properties of the ring Z [sigma] and its division algorithm.

TI Necessary criteria for Markovian divisibility of linear maps
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We describe how to extend the notion of infinitesimal Markovian divisibility from quantum channels to general linear maps and compact and convex sets of generators. We give a general approach toward proving necessary criteria for (infinitesimal) Markovian divisibility. With it, we prove two necessary criteria for infinitesimal divisibility of quantum channels in any finite dimension d: an upper bound on the determinant in terms of a Theta (d)-power of the smallest singular value and in terms of a product of Theta (d) smallest singular values. These allow us to analytically construct, in any given dimension, a set of channels that contains provably non-infinitesimal Markovian divisible ones. Moreover, we show that, in general, no such non-trivial criteria can be derived for the classical counterpart of this scenario.

TI Emerging Role of Quantitative Ultrasound-Based Imaging Techniques for
   Characterizing Rotator Cuff Tears: A Scoping Review
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB Rotator cuff myosteatosis following cuff tears is very common and one of the most important prognostic factors in clinical management. Quantitative ultrasound-based imaging techniques (QUBIT) are frequently used along with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate rotator cuff fatty degeneration. However, the examination of rotator cuff tissue integrity by QUBIT is lacking a standardized imaging protocol and procedural methodologies. In this scoping review, we synthesized the current state of QUBIT against the reference imaging modalities in patients with rotator cuff tears. The literature search was extracted from 963 studies, with 22 studies included in the final review in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extensions for scoping reviews. The selected studies included human participants and focused on measuring at least one prognostic or diagnostic factor using ultrasonography-based imaging with reference to MRI. The findings suggest both conventional B-mode ultrasound and shear wave elastography imaging were comparable to MRI-based imaging techniques for the evaluation of fatty infiltration and rotator cuff tear characterization. This review establishes guidelines for reporting shoulder-specific QUBIT aimed at developing a standardized imaging protocol. The objective was to enhance the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of QUBIT in the clinical setting.

TI Protecting the Quantum Coherence of Two Atoms Inside an Optical Cavity
   by Quantum Feedback Control Combined with Noise-Assisted Preparation
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a theoretical scheme to enhance quantum coherence and obtain steady-state coherence by combining quantum feedback control and noise-assisted preparation. We investigate the effects of quantum-jump-based feedback control and noise field on the quantum coherence and excited-state population between two atoms inside an optical cavity where a noise field drives one, and the other is under quantum feedback control. It is found that steady quantum coherence can be achieved by adding an external noise field, and the quantum feedback can prolong the coherence time with partial suppression of the spontaneous emission of atoms. In addition, we study the influence of the joint action of quantum feedback and noise-assisted preparation on quantum coherence and show that the combined action of feedback control and noise-assisted preparation is more effective in enhancing steady coherence. The findings of our research offer some general guidelines for improving the steady-state coherence of coupled qubit systems and have the potential to be applied in the realm of quantum information technology.

TI Thermal activation of low-density Ga implanted in Ge
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The nuclear spins of low-density implanted Ga atoms in Ge are interesting candidates for solid state-based qubits. To date, activation studies of implanted Ga in Ge have focused on high densities. Here, we extend activation studies into the low-density regime. We use spreading resistance profiling and secondary ion mass spectrometry to derive electrical activation of Ga ions implanted into Ge as a function of the rapid thermal anneal temperature and implant density. We show that for our implant conditions, the activation is best for anneal temperatures between 400 and 650 degrees C with a maximum activation of 69% at the highest fluence. Below 400 degrees C, remaining implant damage results in defects that act as superfluous carriers, and above 650 degrees C, surface roughening and loss of Ga ions are observed. The activation increased monotonically from 10% to 69% as the implant fluence increased from 6 x 10(10) to 6 x 10(12) cm(-2). The results provide thermal anneal conditions to be used for initial studies of using low-density Ga atoms in Ge as nuclear spin qubits. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Homological Quantum Rotor Codes: Logical Qubits from Torsion
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We formally define homological quantum rotor codes which use multiple quantum rotors to encode logical information. These codes generalize homological or CSS quantum codes for qubits or qudits, as well as linear oscillator codes which encode logical oscillators. Unlike for qubits or oscillators, homological quantum rotor codes allow one to encode both logical rotors and logical qudits in the same block of code, depending on the homology of the underlying chain complex. In particular, a code based on the chain complex obtained from tessellating the real projective plane or a Mobius strip encodes a qubit. We discuss the distance scaling for such codes which can be more subtle than in the qubit case due to the concept of logical operator spreading by continuous stabilizer phase-shifts. We give constructions of homological quantum rotor codes based on 2D and 3D manifolds as well as products of chain complexes. Superconducting devices being composed of islands with integer Cooper pair charges could form a natural hardware platform for realizing these codes: we show that the 0-pi\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pi $$\end{document} qubit as well as Kitaev's current-mirror qubit-also known as the Mobius strip qubit-are indeed small examples of such codes and discuss possible extensions.

TI Covariant Representation of Spin and Entanglement-A Review and
   Reformulation
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A consistent theory of quantum entanglement requires that constituent single-particle states belong to the same Hilbert space, the coherent eigenstates of a complete set of operators in a given representation, defined with respect to a shared continuous parameterization. Formulating such eigenstates for a single relativistic particle with spin, and applying them to the description of many-body states, presents well-known challenges. In this paper, we review the covariant theory of relativistic spin and entanglement in a framework first proposed by Stueckelberg and developed by Horwitz, Piron, et al. This approach modifies Wigner's method by introducing an arbitrary timelike unit vector n mu and then inducing a representation of SL(2,C), based on p mu rather than on the spacetime momentum. Generalizing this approach, we construct relativistic spin states on an extended phase space {(x mu,p mu),(zeta mu,pi mu)}, inducing a representation on the momentum pi mu, thus providing a novel dynamical interpretation of the timelike unit vector n mu=pi mu/M. Studying the unitary representations of the Poincar & eacute; group on the extended phase space allows us to define basis quantities for quantum states and develop the gauge invariant electromagnetic Hamiltonian in classical and quantum mechanics. We write plane wave solutions for free particles and construct stable singlet states, and relate these to experiments involving temporal interference, analogous to the spatial interference known from double slit experiments.

TI Digital simulation of zero-temperature spontaneous symmetry breaking in
   a superconducting lattice processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum simulators are ideal platforms to investigate quantum phenomena that are inaccessible through conventional means, such as the limited resources of classical computers to address large quantum systems or due to constraints imposed by fundamental laws of nature. Here, through a digitized adiabatic evolution, we report an experimental simulation of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phase formation induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in a three-generation Cayley tree-like superconducting lattice. We develop a digital quantum annealing algorithm to mimic the system dynamics, and observe the emergence of signatures of SSB-induced phase transition through a connected correlation function. We demonstrate that the signature of a transition from classical AFM to quantum FM-like phase state happens in systems undergoing zero-temperature adiabatic evolution with only nearest-neighbor interacting systems, the shortest range of interaction possible. By harnessing properties of the bipartite R & eacute;nyi entropy as an entanglement witness, we observe the formation of entangled quantum FM and AFM phases. Our results open perspectives for new advances in condensed matter physics and digitized quantum annealing.

TI Generation of sub-MHz and spectrally-bright biphotons from hot atomic
   vapors with a phase mismatch-free scheme
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We utilized the all-copropagating scheme, which maintains the phase-match condition, in the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process to generate biphotons from a hot atomic vapor. The linewidth and spectral brightness of our biphotons surpass those of the biphotons produced with the hot-atom SFWM in the previous works. Moreover, the generation rate of the sub-MHz biphoton source in this work can also compete with those of the sub-MHz biphoton sources of the cold-atom SFWM or cavity-assisted spontaneous parametric down conversion. Here, the biphoton linewidth is tunable for an order of magnitude. As we tuned the linewidth to 610 kHz, the generation rate per linewidth is 1,500 pairs/(s.MHz) and the maximum two-photon correlation function, g(s,as)((2)), of the biphotons is 42. This g(s,as)((2)), violates the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for classical light by 440 tblds, and demonstrates that the biphotons have a high purity. By increasing the pump power by 16 folds, we further enhanced the generation rate per linewidth to 2.3x10(4) pairs/(s.MHz), while the maximum g(s,as)((2) )became 6.7. In addition, we are able to tune the linewidth down to 290 +/- 20 kHz. This is the narrowest linewidth to date among all single-mode biphoton sources of room-temperature and hot media.

TI Optimization complexity and resource minimization of emitter-based
   photonic graph state generation protocols
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Photonic graph states are important for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing, quantum networks, and sensing. They can in principle be generated deterministically by using emitters to create the requisite entanglement. Finding ways to minimize the number of entangling gates between emitters and understanding the overall optimization complexity of such protocols is crucial for practical implementations. Here, we address these issues using graph theory concepts. We develop optimizers that minimize the number of entangling gates, reducing them by up to 75% compared to naive schemes for moderately sized random graphs. While the complexity of optimizing emitter-emitter CNOT counts is likely NP-hard, we are able to develop heuristics based on strong connections between graph transformations and the optimization of stabilizer circuits. These patterns allow us to process large graphs and still achieve a reduction of up to 66% in emitter CNOTs, without relying on subtle metrics such as edge density. We find the optimal emission orderings and circuits to prepare unencoded and encoded repeater graph states of any size, achieving global minimization of emitter and CNOT resources despite the average NP-hardness of both optimization problems. We further study the locally equivalent orbit of graphs. Although enumerating orbits is #P complete for arbitrary graphs, we analytically calculate the size of the orbit of repeater graphs and find a procedure to generate the orbit for any repeater size. Finally, we inspect the entangling gate cost of preparing any graph from a given orbit and show that we can achieve the same optimal CNOT count across the orbit.

TI Shutter-Synchronized Molecular Beam Epitaxy for Wafer-Scale Homogeneous
   GaAs and Telecom Wavelength Quantum Emitter Growth
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quantum dot (QD)-based single-photon emitter devices today are based on self-assembled random position nucleated QDs emitting at random wavelengths. Deterministic QD growth in position and emitter wavelength would be highly appreciated for industry-scale high-yield device manufacturing from wafers. Local droplet etching during molecular beam epitaxy is an all in situ method that allows excellent density control and predetermines the nucleation site of quantum dots. This method can produce strain-free GaAs QDs with excellent photonic and spin properties. Here, we focus on the emitter wavelength homogeneity. By wafer rotation-synchronized shutter opening time and adapted growth parameters, we grow QDs with a narrow peak emission wavelength homogeneity with no more than 1.2 nm shifts on a 45 mm diameter area and a narrow inhomogeneous ensemble broadening of only 2 nm at 4 K. The emission wavelength of these strain-free GaAs QDs is <800 nm, attractive for quantum optics experiments and quantum memory applications. We can use a similar random local droplet nucleation, nanohole drilling, and now, InAs infilling to produce QDs emitting in the telecommunication optical fiber transparency window around 1.3 <mu>m, the so-called O-band. For this approach, we demonstrate good wavelength homogeneity and excellent density homogeneity beyond the possibilities of standard Stranski-Krastanov self-assembly. We discuss our methodology, structural and optical properties, and limitations set by our current setup capabilities.

TI Quantifying scrambling in quantum neural networks
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We quantify the role of scrambling in quantum machine learning. We characterize a quantum neural network's (QNNs) error in terms of the network's scrambling properties via the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). A network can be trained by minimizing a loss function. We show that the loss function can be bounded by the OTOC. We prove that the gradient of the loss function can be bounded by the gradient of the OTOC. This demonstrates that the OTOC landscape regulates the trainability of a QNN. We show numerically that this landscape is flat for maximally scrambling QNNs, which can pose a challenge to training. Our results pave the way for the exploration of quantum chaos in quantum neural networks.

   learning: challenges and opportunities
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field with significant potential, yet it remains highly susceptible to noise, which poses a major challenge to its practical implementation. While various noise mitigation strategies have been proposed to enhance algorithmic performance, the impact of noise is not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of amplitude and phase damping noise on a quantum reinforcement learning algorithm. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we assess how these noise sources influence the learning process and overall performance. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of noise in quantum learning algorithms and suggest that, rather than being purely detrimental, unavoidable noise may present opportunities to enhance QML processes.

Utilizing the systematic approach developed by Wang et al (2017 New J.

We find the analytical expressions of the optimal coupling profile, the operation time, and the maximal entanglement. Our findings have broad applications in quantum state engineering, especially in solid-state devices where dissipative effects cannot be neglected.

TI Mitigating off-resonant error in the cross-resonance gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB An off-resonant error for a driven quantum system refers to interactions due to the input drives having nonzero spectral overlap with unwanted system transitions. For the cross-resonance gate, this includes leakage as well as off-diagonal computational interactions that lead to bit-flip error on the control qubit. In this paper, we quantify an off-resonant error, with more focus on the less studied off-diagonal control interactions, for a direct controlledNOT ( CNOT) gate implementation. Our results are based on a numerical simulation of the dynamics while we demonstrate the connection to time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff and Magnus perturbation theories. We present two methods for suppressing such error terms. First, pulse parameters need to be optimized so off-resonant transition frequencies coincide with the local minima due to the pulse spectrum sidebands. Second, we show the advantage of a Y -DRAG pulse on the control qubit in mitigating the off-resonant error. Depending on qubit-qubit detuning, the proposed methods can improve the average off-resonant error from approximately 10(-3) closer to the 10(-4) level for a direct CNOT calibration.

TI Surface chemical trapping of optical cycling centers
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum information processors based on trapped atoms utilize laser-induced optical cycling transitions for state preparation and measurement. These transitions consist of an electronic excitation from the ground to an excited state and a decay back to the initial ground state, associated with a photon emission. While this technique has been used primarily with atoms, it has also recently been shown to work for some divalent metal hydroxides (e.g. SrOH) and alkoxides (e.g. SrOCH3). This extension to molecules is possible because these molecules feature nearly isolated, atomic-like ground and first-excited electronic states centered on the radical metal atom. We theoretically investigate the extension of this idea to a larger scale by growing the alkyl group, R, beyond the initial methyl group, CH3, while preserving the isolated and highly vertical character of the electronic excitation on the radical metal atom, M. Theory suggests that in the limit as the size of the ligand carbon chain increases, it can be considered a functionalized diamond (or cubic boron nitride) surface. Several requirements must be observed for the cycling centers to function when bound to the surface. First, the surface must have a significant band gap that fully encapsulates both the ground and excited states of the cycling center. Second, while the surface lattice imposes strict limits on the achievable spacing between the SrO- groups, at high coverage, SrO- centers can interact, and show geometric changes and/or electronic state mixing. We show that the coverage of the diamond surface with SrO- cycling centers needs to be significantly sub-monolayer for the functionality of the cycling center to be preserved. Having the lattice-imposed spatial control of SrO- placements will allow nanometer-scale proximity between qubits and will eliminate the need for atom traps for localized cycling emitters. Our results also imply that a functionalization could be done on a scanning microscope tip for local quantum sensing or on photonic structures for optically-mediated quantum information processing.

TI The Simplest 2D Quantum Walk Detects Chaoticity
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum walks are, at present, an active field of study in mathematics, with important applications in quantum information and statistical physics. In this paper, we determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. For this purpose, we consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternating one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates in bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior induced by the boundary shape in the deterministic classical motion translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem, resulting in sharp differences in the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. Indeed, we found, for the Bunimovich stadium-a chaotic billiard-level statistics described by a Brody distribution with parameter delta similar or equal to 0.1. This indicates a weak level repulsion, and also enhanced eigenfunction localization, with an average participation ratio (PR)similar or equal to 1150 compared to the rectangular billiard (regular) case, where the average PR similar or equal to 1500. Furthermore, scarring on unstable periodic orbits is observed. The fact that our simple model exhibits such key signatures of quantum chaos, e.g., non-Poissonian level statistics and scarring, that are sensitive to the underlying classical dynamics in the free particle billiard system is utterly surprising, especially when taking into account that quantum walks are diffusive models, which are not direct quantizations of a Hamiltonian.

AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining attention for their potential, but their lack of interpretability remains a barrier to wider adoption. In this paper, we adapt and extend explainability techniques commonly used in classical neural networks to the quantum domain, making QNNs more transparent and interpretable. By applying both feature-based and example-based methods, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how QNNs generate predictions. Our results demonstrate that these adapted techniques offer valuable insights into the internal mechanisms of QNNs, paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy quantum machine learning models. This work contributes to improving the explainability of QNNs, enhancing their applicability in complex, real-world scenarios.

AB In this study, we explore the dynamics of entanglement in an ensemble of qutrits with a lambda-type level structure interacting with single-mode bosons. Our investigation focuses on zero-energy states within the subspace of totally symmetric wave functions. Remarkably, we observe a universal two-stage dynamics of entanglement with intriguing revival behavior. The revival of entanglement is a consequence of the self-purification process, where the quantum state relaxes and converges universally to a special dark state within the system.

TI Single-photon detection and cryogenic reconfigurability in lithium
   niobate nanophotonic circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The combination of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors and electro-optically reconfigurable circuits in a cryogenic environment is notoriously difficult to reach. Here, the authors realise this on a Lithium-Niobate-On-Insulator platform, reaching high speed modulation at a frequency up to 1 GHz.
   Lithium-Niobate-On-Insulator (LNOI) is emerging as a promising platform for integrated quantum photonic technologies because of its high second-order nonlinearity and compact waveguide footprint. Importantly, LNOI allows for creating electro-optically reconfigurable circuits, which can be efficiently operated at cryogenic temperature. Their integration with superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) paves the way for realizing scalable photonic devices for active manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. Here we demonstrate integration of these two key components in a low loss (0.2 dB/cm) LNOI waveguide network. As an experimental showcase of our technology, we demonstrate the combined operation of an electrically tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer and two waveguide-integrated SNSPDs at its outputs. We show static reconfigurability of our system with a bias-drift-free operation over a time of 12 hours, as well as high-speed modulation at a frequency up to 1 GHz. Our results provide blueprints for implementing complex quantum photonic devices on the LNOI platform.

TI Coherent spin-control of S=1 vanadium and molybdenum complexes
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The burgeoning field of quantum sensing hinges on the creation and control of quantum bits. To date, the most well-studied quantum sensors are optically active, paramagnetic defects residing in crystalline hosts. We previously developed analogous optically addressable molecules featuring a ground-state spin-triplet centered on a Cr4+ ion with an optical-spin interface. In this work, we evaluate isovalent V3+ and Mo4+ congeners, which offer unique advantages, such as an intrinsic nuclear spin for V3+ or larger spin-orbit coupling for Mo4+, as optically addressable spin systems. We assess the ground-state spin structure and dynamics for each complex, illustrating that all of these spin-triplet species can be coherently controlled. However, unlike the Cr4+ derivatives, these pseudo-tetrahedral V3+ and Mo4+ complexes exhibit no measurable emission. Coupling absorption spectroscopy with computational predictions, we investigate why these complexes exhibit no detectable photoluminescence. These cumulative results suggest that design of future V3+ complexes should target pseudo-tetrahedral symmetries using bidentate or tridentate ligand scaffolds, ideally with deuterated or fluorinated ligand environments. We also suggest that spin-triplet Mo4+, and by extension W4+, complexes may not be suitable candidate optically addressable qubit systems due to their low energy spin-singlet states. By understanding the failures and successes of these systems, we outline additional design features for optically addressable V- or Mo-based molecules to expand the library of tailor-made quantum sensors.

TI Transfer of knowledge through reverse annealing: a preliminary analysis
   of the benefits and what to share
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, current quantum annealers present limitations for solving optimization problems efficiently. To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called reverse annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around reverse annealing, no study has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known knapsack problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.

TI Assessing the Effectiveness of Non-Turing Computing Paradigms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years the technological limits inherently present in the classical Turing paradigm of computation have sparked the development of innovative solutions based on quantum devices or analog-digital mixed approaches often based on the time evolution of differential equations. Such promising machinery require accurate analysis to understand if and howthey will be able to perform better than classical approaches in solving hard optimization problems. Here we challenge two machines representative of the quantum annealing and differential equations approaches, namely D-Wave and Memcomputing by devising a benchmark of three well known hard optimization problems from the realms of number theory, optimal transport and optimal scheduling. We introduce the Mean First Solution Time, a novel metric for accurately comparing performances, and take as baseline the classical Gurobi solver. We show that performances of both solvers are heavily dependent on the selected set of internal parameters. Results shed lights on the advantages and current limits of each paradigm and give a perspective on possible future developments.

TI Superconducting nanowire single photon detector on 4H-SiC substrates
   with saturated quantum efficiency
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB On-chip single photon detection is crucial for implementing on-chip quantum communication, quantum simulation, and calculation. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have become one of the essential techniques to achieve high-efficiency, on-chip, single-photon detection at scale due to their high detection efficiency, low dark count rate, and low jitter. Silicon carbide (SiC) has emerged as a promising integrated photonics platform due to its nonlinear optical processing capabilities, compatibility with CMOS technology, and outstanding quantum properties as a device for single photon sources. However, achieving high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detection on SiC substrates has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we deposited polycrystalline NbN thin films onto 4H-SiC substrates. We also ensured that the deposited NbN thin film had a flat surface with a roughness less than 1 nm on the C-side 4H-SiC substrate through optimized chemical mechanical polishing. The NbN-SNSPD achieved a saturated quantum efficiency covering the color center emission bandwidth wavelength range (from 861 to 1550 nm) of the 4H-SiC material. These results offer a promising solution for high-efficiency single-photon detection on fully integrated quantum optical chips on 4H-SiC substrates.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Expectation values from the single-layer quantum approximate
   optimization algorithm on Ising problems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We report on the energy-expectation-value landscapes produced by the single-layer (p = 1) quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) when being used to solve Ising problems. The landscapes are obtained using an analytical formula that we derive. The formula allows us to predict the landscape for any given Ising problem instance and consequently predict the optimal QAOA parameters for heuristically solving that instance using the single-layer QAOA. We have validated our analytical formula by showing that it accurately reproduces the landscapes published in recent experimental reports. We then applied our methods to address the question: how well is the single-layer QAOA able to solve large benchmark problem instances? We used our analytical formula to calculate the optimal energy-expectation values for benchmark MAX-CUT problems containing up to 7000 vertices and 41 459 edges. We also calculated the optimal energy expectations for general Ising problems with up to 100 000 vertices and 150 000 edges. Our results provide an estimate for how well the single-layer QAOA may work when run on a quantum computer with thousands of qubits. In addition to providing performance estimates when optimal angles are used, we are able to use our analytical results to investigate the difficulties one may encounter when running the QAOA in practice for different classes of Ising instances. We find that depending on the parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian, the expectation-value landscapes can be rather complex, with sharp features that necessitate highly accurate rotation gates in order for the QAOA to be run optimally on quantum hardware. We also present analytical results that explain some of the qualitative landscape features that are observed numerically.

TI Spectroscopy and coherent control of two-level system defect ensembles
   using a broadband 3D waveguide
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Defects in solid-state materials play a central role in determining coherence, stability, and performance in quantum technologies. Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication. Unlike conventional approaches limited to narrow spectral windows and fully fabricated devices, BCTDS enables modular, device-independent measurements that reveal quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems.

TI Recipe for local simulation of strongly correlated fermionic matter on
   quantum computers: The two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a nonlocal representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of nonlocal unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.

TI Entangled quantum Unruh Otto engine is more efficient
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose a relativistic quantum Otto cycle between an entangled state of two qubits and their composite excited (or ground) state whose efficiency can be greater than the usual single qubit quantum Otto engine. The hot and cold reservoirs are constructed by providing uniform accelerations to these qubits along with the interaction between the background field and individual qubits. The efficiency, as measured from one of the qubits' frame, not only depends on the energy gap of the states but also the relative acceleration between them. For lower acceleration of our observer's qubit compared to the other one, the cycle is more efficient than the single qubit quantum Otto engine. Furthermore, a complete protocol to construct such a cycle is being provided.

TI Formal Analysis of Post-Quantum Hybrid Key Exchange SSH Transport Layer
   Protocol
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Facing the quantum attack threat, a quantum-resistant version of the SSH Transport Layer protocol has been proposed and been standardized by an IETF working group. This standardization process has been motivated by the fact that if practical quantum computers become available, classical key exchange algorithms used today will no longer be safe because their security can be efficiently broken by Shor's algorithm running on a quantum computer. In this paper, we construct a symbolic model of the proposed protocol, specify it in the specification language CafeOBJ, and conduct a formal analysis of the claimed security properties with the employment of a formal method tool called Invariant Proof Score Generator (IPSG). Three security properties are formally verified with respect to an unbounded number of protocol participants and protocol executions by employing IPSG to produce their formal proofs, the so- called proof scores in CafeOBJ. With another property, namely authentication, we find a counterexample against it, and then we propose to slightly revise the protocol. With the improved version, we formally verify that the authentication property is enjoyed, while the three properties remain secure. To model the presence of malicious participants, we extend the Dolev-Yao intruder, which is the standard intruder model used in security protocol analysis/verification, because the availability assumption of large-scale quantum computers gives the attacker some new capabilities. Under our threat model, the intruder is given capabilities of fully controlling the network as the Dolev-Yao intruder, and additionally breaking ECDH's security as well as compromising secrets.

TI Quantum-like contextuality in large language models
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics, and there is evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage in the context of magic state distillation. To harness it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been affirmative, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to adopt frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (i) a signalling-corrected sheaf-theoretic model and (ii) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large-scale experimental evidence for contextuality in the large language model BERT. We constructed a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiated it in the Simple English Wikipedia, and extracted probability distributions for the instances. This led to the discovery of 77 118 sheaf-contextual and 36 938 948 CbD contextual instances. We prove that these contextual instances arise from semantically similar words by deriving an equation that relates degrees of contextuality to the Euclidean distance of BERT's embedding vectors. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the coreference resolution challenge. These results suggest that quantum methods may be advantageous in the field of natural language processing.

TI Multi-Objective Optimization Technique Based on QUBO and an Ising
   Machine
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With an increase in the complexity of society, solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) has become crucial. In this study, we introduced a novel method called "quadratic unconstrained binary optimization based on the weighted normal" for solving MOPs using Ising machines, such as quantum annealing and digital annealer (DA), in the field of combinatorial optimization. The proposed method applies the penalty-based boundary intersection method to Ising machines under a setting limited to linear objective functions and maximizes the speed and performance of the DA, which is a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization-specific solver. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method by solving a real-world problem with a nonconvex shaped Pareto front (component combination problem). The results suggested that the proposed method could handle both convex- and nonconvex-shaped Pareto fronts, expanding the potential applications of Ising machines to solving complex MOPs. This development could significantly enhance decision-making processes, particularly in achieving sustainable development goals.

TI A phase-field model by an Ising machine and its application to the
   phase-separation structure of a diblock polymer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A novel model to be applied to next-generation accelerators, Ising machines, is formulated on the basis of the phase-field model of the phase-separation structure of a diblock polymer. Recently, Ising machines including quantum annealing machines, attract overwhelming attention as a technology that opens up future possibilities. On the other hand, the phase-field model has demonstrated its high performance in material development, though it takes a long time to achieve equilibrium. Although the convergence time problem might be solved by the next-generation accelerators, no solution has been proposed. In this study, we show the calculation of the phase-separation structure of a diblock polymer as the equilibrium state using phase-field model by an actual Ising machine. The proposed new model brings remarkable acceleration in obtaining the phase-separation structure. Our model can be solved on a large-scale quantum annealing machine. The significant acceleration of the phase-field simulation by the quantum technique pushes the material development to the next stage.

TI Fast-Converging Simulated Annealing for Ising Models Based on Integral
   Stochastic Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been presented as a spin (basic computing element) for the simulated annealing (SA) of Ising models. In this brief, we introduce fast-converging SA based on p-bits designed using integral stochastic computing. The stochastic implementation approximates a p-bit function, which can search for a solution to a combinatorial optimization problem at lower energy than conventional p-bits. Searching around the global minimum energy can increase the probability of finding a solution. The proposed stochastic computing-based SA method is compared with conventional SA and quantum annealing (QA) with a D-Wave Two quantum annealer on the traveling salesman, maximum cut (MAX-CUT), and graph isomorphism (GI) problems. The proposed method achieves a convergence speed a few orders of magnitude faster while dealing with an order of magnitude larger number of spins than the other methods.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering paradox "2=1" for N qubits
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox highlights the absence of a local realistic explanation for quantum mechanics, and shows the incompatibility of the local-hidden-state models with quantum theory. For N-qubit states, or more importantly, the N-qubit mixed states, we present the EPR steering paradox in the form of the contradictory equality "2=1". We show that the contradiction holds for any N-qubit state as long as both "the pure state requirement" and "the measurement requirement" are satisfied. This also indicates that the EPR steering paradox exists in more general cases. Finally, we give specific examples to demonstrate and analyze our arguments.

TI Cryogenic thermal modeling of microwave high density signaling
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit is approximately 140 qubits.

TI Strongly-confined colloidal lead-halide perovskite quantum dots: from
   synthesis to applications
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals enable the realization and exploitation of quantum phenomena in a controlled manner, and can be scaled up for commercial uses. These materials have become important for a wide range of applications, from ultrahigh definition displays, to solar cells, quantum computing, bioimaging, optical communications, and many more. Over the last decade, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals have rapidly gained prominence as efficient semiconductors. Although the majority of studies have focused on large nanocrystals in the weak- to intermediate-confinement regime, quantum dots (QDs) in the strongly-confined regime (with sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter, which ranges from 4-12 nm for lead-halide perovskites) offer unique opportunities, including polarized light emission and color-pure, stable luminescence in the region that is unattainable by perovskites with single-halide compositions. In this tutorial review, we bring together the latest insights into this emerging and rapidly growing area, focusing on the synthesis, steady-state optical properties (including exciton fine-structure splitting), and transient kinetics (including hot carrier cooling) of strongly-confined perovskite QDs. We also discuss recent advances in their applications, including single photon emission for quantum technologies, as well as light-emitting diodes. We finish with our perspectives on future challenges and opportunities for strongly-confined QDs, particularly around improving the control over monodispersity and stability, important fundamental questions on the photophysics, and paths forward to improve the performance of perovskite QDs in light-emitting diodes.
   Reducing the dimensionality of lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals from 3D to 0D leads to fascinating properties. This tutorial review discusses the synthesis, optical properties and applications of such strongly-confined quantum dots.

TI Exploring High-Spin Color Centers in Wide Band Gap Semiconductors SiC: A
   Comprehensive Magnetic Resonance Investigation (EPR and ENDOR Analysis)
SO MOLECULES
AB High-spin defects (color centers) in wide-gap semiconductors are considered as a basis for the implementation of quantum technologies due to the unique combination of their spin, optical, charge, and coherent properties. A silicon carbide (SiC) crystal can act as a matrix for a wide variety of optically active vacancy-type defects, which manifest themselves as single-photon sources or spin qubits. Among the defects, the nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV) are of particular importance. This paper is devoted to the application of the photoinduced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques at a high-frequency range (94 GHz) to obtain unique information about the nature and properties of NV defects in SiC crystal of the hexagonal 4H and 6H polytypes. Selective excitation by microwave and radio frequency pulses makes it possible to determine the microscopic structure of the color center, the zero-field splitting constant (D = 1.2-1.3 GHz), the phase coherence time (T2), and the values of hyperfine (approximate to 1.1 MHz) and quadrupole (Cq approximate to 2.45 MHz) interactions and to define the isotropic (a = -1.2 MHz) and anisotropic (b = 10-20 kHz) contributions of the electron-nuclear interaction. The obtained data are essential for the implementation of the NV defects in SiC as quantum registers, enabling the optical initialization of the electron spin to establish spin-photon interfaces. Moreover, the combination of optical, microwave, and radio frequency resonant effects on spin centers within a SiC crystal shows the potential for employing pulse EPR and ENDOR sequences to implement protocols for quantum computing algorithms and gates.

TI Simulating quantum materials with digital quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum materials exhibit a wide array of exotic phenomena and practically useful properties. A better understanding of these materials can provide deeper insights into fundamental physics in the quantum realm as well as advance information processing technology and sustainability. The emergence of digital quantum computers (DQCs), which can efficiently perform quantum simulations that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, provides a promising path forward for testing and analyzing the remarkable, and often counter-intuitive, behavior of quantum materials. Equipped with these new tools, scientists from diverse domains are racing towards achieving physical quantum advantage (i.e. using a quantum computer to learn new physics with a computation that cannot feasibly be run on any classical computer). The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide a summary of progress made towards this goal that is accessible to scientists across the physical sciences. We will first review the available technology and algorithms, and detail the myriad ways to represent materials on quantum computers. Next, we will showcase the simulations that have been successfully performed on currently available DQCs, emphasizing the variety of properties, both static and dynamic, that can be studied with this nascent technology. Finally, we work through three examples of how to perform various materials simulation problems on DQCs, with full code included in the supplementary material (https://stacks.iop.org/QST/6/043002/mmedia). It is our hope that this review can serve as an organized overview of progress in the field for domain experts and an accessible introduction to scientists in related fields interested in beginning to perform their own simulations of quantum materials on DQCs.

TI A state-averaged orbital-optimized hybrid quantum-classical algorithm
   for a democratic description of ground and excited states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, solving the electronic structure problem from chemistry is considered as the 'killer application' for near-term quantum devices. In spite of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy profiles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e. a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is key to finding useful applications of these promising devices within the field of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a NISQ-friendly method called 'state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver' which combines two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule CH2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin-a crucial step in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms fulfil the necessary condition to describe the molecule's conical intersection, i.e. the ability to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing.

TI Partial traces and the geometry of entanglement: Sufficient conditions
   for the separability of Gaussian states
SO REVIEWS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The notion of partial trace of a density operator is essential for the understanding of the entanglement and separability properties of quantum states. In this paper, we investigate these notions putting an emphasis on the geometrical properties of the covariance ellipsoids of the reduced states. We thereafter focus on Gaussian states and we give new and easily numerically implementable sufficient conditions for the separability of all Gaussian states. Unlike the positive partial transposition criterion, none of these conditions is however necessary.

TI First-Principles Assessment of CdTe as a Tunnel Barrier at the ?-Sn/
   InSb Interface
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Majorana zero modes, with prospective applications in topological quantum computing, are expected to arise in super-conductor/semiconductor interfaces, such as beta-Sn and InSb. However, proximity to the superconductor may also adversely affect the semiconductor's local properties. A tunnel barrier inserted at the interface could resolve this issue. We assess the wide band gap semiconductor, CdTe, as a candidate material to mediate the coupling at the lattice-matched interface between alpha-Sn and InSb. To this end, we use density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U corrections, whose values are machine-learned via Bayesian optimization (BO) [npj Computational Materials 2020, 6, 180]. The results of DFT+U(BO) are validated against angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments for alpha-Sn and CdTe. For CdTe, the z-unfolding method [Advanced Quantum Technologies 2022, 5, 2100033] is used to resolve the contributions of different kz values to the ARPES. We then study the band offsets and the penetration depth of metal-induced gap states (MIGS) in bilayer interfaces of InSb/alpha-Sn, InSb/CdTe, and CdTe/alpha-Sn, as well as in trilayer interfaces of InSb/CdTe/alpha-Sn with increasing thickness of CdTe. We find that 16 atomic layers (3.5 nm) of CdTe can serve as a tunnel barrier, effectively shielding the InSb from MIGS from the alpha-Sn. This may guide the choice of dimensions of the CdTe barrier to mediate the coupling in semiconductor-superconductor devices in future Majorana zero modes experiments.

TI Entanglement-enhanced matter-wave interferometry in a high-finesse
   cavity
SO NATURE
AB An ensemble of atoms can operate as a quantum sensor by placing atoms in a superposition of two different states. Upon measurement of the sensor, each atom is individually projected into one of the two states. Creating quantum correlations between the atoms, that is entangling them, could lead to resolutions surpassing the standard quantum limit(1-3) set by projections of individual atoms. Large amounts of entanglement(4-6) involving the internal degrees of freedom of laser-cooled atomic ensembles(4-16) have been generated in collective cavity quantum-electrodynamics systems, in which many atoms simultaneously interact with a single optical cavity mode. Here we report a matter-wave interferometer in a cavity quantum-electrodynamics system of 700 atoms that are entangled in their external degrees of freedom. In our system, each individual atom falls freely under gravity and simultaneously traverses two paths through space while entangled with the other atoms. We demonstrate both quantum non-demolition measurements and cavity-mediated spin interactions for generating squeezed momentum states with directly observed sensitivity 3.4(- 0.9)(+1.1) dB and 2.5(- 0.6)(+0.6) dB below the standard quantum limit, respectively. We successfully inject an entangled state into a Mach-Zehnder light-pulse interferometer with directly observed sensitivity 1.7(- 0.5)(+0.5) dB below the standard quantum limit. The combination of particle delocalization and entanglement in our approach may influence developments of enhanced inertial sensors(17,18), searches for new physics, particles and fields(19-23), future advanced gravitational wave detectors(24,25) and accessing beyond mean-field quantum many-body physics(26-30).

TI Non-equilibrium quantum domain reconfiguration dynamics in a
   two-dimensional electronic crystal and a quantum annealer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Relaxation dynamics of complex many-body quantum systems trapped into metastable states is a very active field of research from both the theoretical and experimental point of view with implications in a wide array of topics from macroscopic quantum tunnelling and nucleosynthesis to non-equilibrium superconductivity and energy-efficient memory devices. In this work, we investigate quantum domain reconfiguration dynamics in the electronic superlattice of a quantum material using time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and unveil a crossover from temperature to noisy quantum fluctuation dominated dynamics. The process is modeled using a programmable superconducting quantum annealer in which qubit interconnections correspond directly to the microscopic interactions between electrons in the quantum material. Crucially, the dynamics of both the experiment and quantum simulation is driven by spectrally similar pink noise. We find that the simulations reproduce the emergent time evolution and temperature dependence of the experimentally observed electronic domain dynamics.
   Metastable states found in superconductors and charge density wave materials are of fundamental interest. Vodeb et al. study the domain wall dynamics in 1T-TaS2 using scanning tunneling microscopy and a quantum annealer, finding that in both cases the dynamics is driven by spectrally similar noise.

TI Real-time polarization compensation system for wavelength division
   multiplexing in low noise fiber channel based on single photon counting
   feedback
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The physical effects such as random birefringence of fiber optic channels due to environmental influencesmake the optical signals transmitted in them have sensitive polarization variations, which seriously affects theperformance of polarization biased code quantum key distribution systems. In this paper, a low-noise fiberchannel wavelength division multiplexing real-time polarization compensation system is presented, where singlephoton counting is used as a feedback signal. The system can acquire the fiber channel polarization changeinformation by detecting the photon counting of the conjugate reference light. In the system, the compensationalgorithm is designed to control the electric polarization controller to calibrate the polarization state of thequantum signal light under the corresponding polarization base in real time, and the stable fiber channelpolarization compensation is successfully achieved. In order to verify the effectiveness of the compensationsystem, a quantum key distribution test based on BB84 protocol with a transmission distance of 25.2 km isconducted, and stable test results of up to 8 hours are obtained in the laboratory environment and thesimulated metropolitan area network buried fiber environment, with the average quantum bit error rate being0.52% and 1.25%, respectively. The experimental results show that this system can guarantee the stableoperation of polarization-encoded quantum key distribution in the buried fiber environment in urban areas

TI Feature selection method based on quantum inspired genetic algorithm for
   Arabic signature verification
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The signature is a behavioral-based human characteristics that is extensively used as legal evidence of identification on bank checks, credit cards, and wills. Developing a good offline signature verification (OSV) system is essential to avoid fraud. Due to the plurality of signature styles and sample contexts, fea-ture extraction (FE) is challenging for OSV systems. Current signature verification methods present promising results in distinguishing between genuine and forged signatures, but they are far from satis-factory. Regarding feature selection (FS), stable and appropriate features substantially impact signature verification. The issue with current approaches is that they apply combination features without address-ing correlation and discriminant. A genetic algorithm (GA) is popularly deployed as a method for opti-mization to identify the best features. Regrettably, GA has drawbacks when the search dimension is expanded, such as a lack of comprehensive exploitation, difficulties in achieving good convergence, and therefore increased computation. This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by introducing multifeature fusion and discriminant FS using a novel quantum inspired GA (QIGA). QIGAs are con-structed using quantum computing concepts such as qubits (Q-bits) and superposition of states. QIGA is able to express a linear superposition of solutions with the objective of increasing gene diversity by utilizing the qubit as a representation. Quantum rotation computing (QRC) enhances population diversity and tackles computing complexity and early convergence issues in GA. The superposition concept in QRC utilizes both mutation (divergence) and crossover (convergence) procedures to expand diversity and improve population selection. QIGA performs better in a parallel structure because of its quick conver-gence and robust global search capabilities. This implies that QIGA embodies features of both exploration and exploitation. The studied approach is applied to three different databases of signatures: SID-Arabic handwritten signatures, CEDAR, and UTSIG. Consequently, the proposed OSV based on the QIGA improved equal error rate (EER) between 10% and 20% over the GA without influencing computation complexity.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

The system is described by a three-mode Gaussian state and we construct the corresponding covariance matrix at zero and finite temperature. We study associated bipartite and tripartite entanglement measures and discuss their experimental observation. We identify a simple optical setup equivalent to the analog Bose-Einstein black hole which suggests a different way of determining the Hawking temperature and gray-body factor of the system.

TI Towards Quantum 3D Imaging Devices
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We review the advancement of the research toward the design and implementation of quantum plenoptic cameras, radically novel 3D imaging devices that exploit both momentum-position entanglement and photon-number correlations to provide the typical refocusing and ultra-fast, scanning-free, 3D imaging capability of plenoptic devices, along with dramatically enhanced performances, unattainable in standard plenoptic cameras: diffraction-limited resolution, large depth of focus, and ultra-low noise. To further increase the volumetric resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit, and achieve the quantum limit, we are also developing dedicated protocols based on quantum Fisher information. However, for the quantum advantages of the proposed devices to be effective and appealing to end-users, two main challenges need to be tackled. First, due to the large number of frames required for correlation measurements to provide an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, quantum plenoptic imaging (QPI) would require, if implemented with commercially available high-resolution cameras, acquisition times ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes. Second, the elaboration of this large amount of data, in order to retrieve 3D images or refocusing 2D images, requires high-performance and time-consuming computation. To address these challenges, we are developing high-resolution single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) arrays and high-performance low-level programming of ultra-fast electronics, combined with compressive sensing and quantum tomography algorithms, with the aim to reduce both the acquisition and the elaboration time by two orders of magnitude. Routes toward exploitation of the QPI devices will also be discussed.

AB We study rates of asymptotic transformations between entangled states by local operations and classical communication and a sublinear amount of quantum communication. It is known that additive asymptotically continuous entanglement measures provide upper bounds on the rates that are achievable with asymptotically vanishing error. We show that for transformations between pure states, the optimal rate between any pair of states can be characterized as the infimum of such upper bounds provided by fully additive asymptotically continuous entanglement measures.

This principle can be used for creating an infinite number of distinct geometric patterns based on a finite number of basis patterns. Here, we propose a Dammann vortex metasurface (DVM) for optically generating an array of diverse, diffraction -multiplexed vortex patterns, based on three custom-defined basis patterns. The proposed DVM, with its capabil-ity of quantitatively correlating phase and intensity distribution in different diffraction orders, opens up doors for various applications including orbital angular momentum encryptions and quantum entanglement.

TI Engineering the level structure of a giant artificial atom in waveguide
   quantum electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Engineering light-matter interactions at the quantum level has been central to the pursuit of quantum optics for decades. Traditionally, this has been done by coupling emitters, typically natural atoms and ions, to quantized electromagnetic fields in optical and microwave cavities. In these systems, the emitter is approximated as an idealized dipole, as its physical size is orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of light. Recently, artificial atoms made from superconducting circuits have enabled new frontiers in light-matter coupling, including the study of "giant" atoms which cannot be approximated as simple dipoles. Here, we explore an implementation of a giant artificial atom, formed from a transmon qubit coupled to propagating microwaves at multiple points along an open transmission line. The nature of this coupling allows the qubit radiation field to interfere with itself, leading to some striking giant-atom effects. For instance, we observe strong frequency-dependent couplings of the qubit energy levels to the electromagnetic modes of the transmission line. Combined with the ability to in situ tune the qubit energy levels, we show that we can modify the relative coupling rates of multiple qubit transitions by more than an order of magnitude. By doing so, we engineer a metastable excited state, allowing us to operate the giant transmon as an effective lambda system where we clearly demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency.

TI Tri-partite entanglement in neutrino oscillations
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We investigate and quantify bipartite and tripartite entanglement measures in two- and three-flavor neutrino oscillations. The bipartite entanglement is analogous to the entanglement swapping resulting from a beam splitter in quantum optics. We calculate various entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, negativity, and three-tangle for the three-neutrino system. The significant result is that a monogamy inequality in terms of negativity leads to a residual entanglement, implying genuine tripartite entanglement in the three-neutrino system. We establish an analogy of the three-neutrino state with a generalized W-state class in quantum optics.

TI Software implementation of systematic polar encoding based PKC-SPE
   cryptosystem for quantum cybersecurity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The ever-growing threats in cybersecurity growing with the rapid development of quantum computing, necessitates the development of robust and quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This paper introduces a novel cryptosystem, Public Key Cryptosystem based on Systematic Polar Encoding (PKC-SPE), based on the combination of systematic polar encoding and public-key cryptographic principles. The Systematic Polar Encoding (SPE), derived from the well-established field of polar codes, serves as the foundation for this proposed cryptographic scheme. Here, we have used MATLAB Software to introduce and implement the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem. The paper examines key generation, encryption, and decryption algorithms, providing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of systematic polar encoding in public-key cryptography. We assess the efficiency of the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem in three aspects: key size, computational complexity, and system implementation timings. In addition, we compare the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem with PKC-PC cryptosystem and find that it has reduced key sizes ( P r \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$P_{r}$$\end{document} = 0.8436 kbytes). The results obtained through simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed cryptosystem and highlighting its potential for integration into real-world communication systems. Thus, in the paradigm shift to quantum computing, the PKC-SPE cryptosystem emerges as a promising candidate to secure digital communication in the quantum computing era.

TI Resonant energy transfer and collectively driven emitters in waveguide
   QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, g(2 )(tau), while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F & ouml;rster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e., the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multiemitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.

TI Minimal state-preparation times for silicon spin qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficient preparation of quantum states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors remains a significant challenge to achieve quantum advantage. While gate-based methods have been the traditional approach, pulse-based algorithms offer promising alternatives with finer control and potentially reduced overheads. Here, we leverage the concept of minimum evolution time (MET) as a fundamental metric for evaluating and benchmarking quantum-state-preparation efficiency. Using numerical modeling, we investigate METs achievable through optimized microwave and exchange pulse sequences on silicon quantum hardware. We focus our investigations on molecular ground states and arbitrary state transitions. Our results demonstrate remarkably low METs: 2.3 ns for H2, 4.6 ns for HeH+, and 27 ns for LiH. METs consistently remain below 50 ns for arbitrary four-qubit state transitions, outperforming gate-based methods. We perform further analyses, revealing the impact of silicon device parameters on MET performance. Notably, increasing the maximal exchange amplitude from 10 MHz to 1 GHz significantly reduces METs, while higher maximal microwave drive amplitudes lead to faster state transitions. These findings surpass results reported for other quantum architectures. Our numerical analysis also demonstrates reasonable robustness of pulse-based state preparation to device imperfections and leakage. Our study contributes to developing efficient quantum-simulation techniques and provides insights into the strengths of silicon quantum hardware.

TI State learning from pairs of states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Suppose you receive a sequence of qubits where each qubit is guaranteed to be in one of two pure states, but you do not know what those states are. Your task is to determine the states. This can be viewed as a kind of quantum state learning, or quantum state estimation. The problem is that, without more information, all that can be determined is the density matrix of the sequence and, in general, density matrices can be decomposed into pure states in many different ways. To solve the problem, additional information, either classical or quantum, is required. We show that if an additional copy of each qubit is supplied (that is, one receives pairs of qubits, both in the same state, rather than single qubits) the task can be accomplished. This is possible because the mixed two-qubit state has a unique decomposition into pure product states. For illustration purposes, we numerically simulate the symmetric, informationally complete measurement of a sequence of qubit pairs and show that the unknown states and their respective probabilities of occurrence can be inferred from the data with high accuracy. Finally, we propose an experiment that employs a product measurement and can be realized with existing technology, and we demonstrate how the data tell us the states and their probabilities. We find that it is enough to detect a few thousand qubit pairs.

TI Simultaneous temperature and magnetic field measurements using
   time-division multiplexing
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy color centers can perform highly sensitive and spatially resolved quantum measurements of physical quantities such as magnetic field, temperature, and pressure. Meanwhile, sensing so many variables at the same time often introduces additional noise, causing a reduced accuracy. Here, a dual-microwave time-division multiplexing protocol is used in conjunction with a lock-in amplifier in order to decouple temperature from the magnetic field and vice versa. In this protocol, dual-frequency driving and frequency modulation are used to measure the magnetic and temperature field simultaneously in real time. The sensitivity of our system is about 3.4 nT/ root Hz and 1.3 mK/ root Hz, respectively. Our detection protocol not only enables multifunctional quantum sensing, but also extends more practical applications.

TI Universal visible emitters in nanoscale integrated photonics
SO OPTICA
AB Visible wavelengths of light control the quantum matter of atoms and molecules and are foundational for quantum technologies, including computers, sensors, and clocks. The development of visible integrated photonics opens the possibility for scalable circuits with complex functionalities, advancing both science and technology frontiers. We experimentally demonstrate an inverse design approach based on the superposition of guided mode sources, allowing the generation and complete control of free-space radiation directly from within a single 150 nm layer Ta2O5, showing low loss across visible and near-infrared spectra. We generate diverging circularly polarized beams at the challenging 461 nm wavelength that can be directly used for magneto-optical traps of strontium atoms, constituting a fundamental building block for a range of atomic-physics-based quantum technologies. Our generated topological vortex beams and the potential for spatially varying polarization emitters could open unexplored light-matter interaction pathways, enabling a broad new photonic-atomic paradigm. Our platformhighlights the generalizability of nanoscale devices for visible-laser emission and will be critical for scaling quantum technologies.

TI A Convex Hull-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Multipartite
   Entanglement Classification
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum entanglement becomes more complicated and capricious when more than two parties are involved. There have been methods for classifying some inequivalent multipartite entanglements, such as GHZ states and W states. In this paper, based on the fact that the set of all W states is convex, we approximate the convex hull by some critical points from the inside and propose a method of classification via the tangent hyperplane. To accelerate the calculation, we bring ensemble learning of machine learning into the algorithm, thus improving the accuracy of the classification.

TI Photonic Angular Superresolution Using Twisted N00N States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The increased phase sensitivity of N00N states has been used in many experiments, often involving photon paths or polarization. Here we experimentally combine the phase sensitivity of N00N states with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons up to 100 PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI, to resolve rotations of a light field around its optical axis. The results show that both a higher photon number and larger OAM increase the resolution and achievable sensitivity. The presented method opens a viable path to unconditional angular supersensitivity and accessible generation of N00N states between any transverse light fields.

TI Optimal control theory techniques for nitrogen vacancy ensembles in
   single crystal diamond
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Nitrogen vacancy centre ensembles are excellent candidates for quantum sensors due to their vector magnetometry capabilities, deployability at room temperature and simple optical initialization and readout. This work describes the engineering and characterization methods required to control all four principle axis systems (P.A.S.) of NV ensembles in a single crystal diamond without an applied static magnetic field. Circularly polarized microwaves enable arbitrary simultaneous control with spin-locking experiments and collective control using optimal control theory (OCT) in a (100) diamond. These techniques may be further improved and integrated to realize high-sensitivity NV-based quantum sensing devices using all four P.A.S. systems.

TI Orientation determination of nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond using a
   static magnetic field
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a bulk diamond are often employed to realize measurement of multiple physical quantities, which depends on orientation information of NV axis. We report a fast and effective method to determine the orientation of NV axis with the aid of a static magnetic field. By measuring the optically detected magnetic resonance spectra, we can precisely extract the polar angle information between the NV axis and the known magnetic field. Combining with the polar angle information of different kinds of NV centers, we employ the Nelder-Mead algorithm to get the optimal solution of the orientation of NV axis. This method is simple and efficient, and is easily applied in NV-based quantum sensing.

TI Hardware-efficient random circuits to classify noise in a multiqubit
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we extend a multiqubit benchmarking technique known as the binned output generation (BOG) in order to discriminate between coherent and incoherent noise sources in the multiqubit regime. While methods exist to discriminate coherent from incoherent noise at the single and few-qubit level, these methods scale poorly beyond a few qubits or must make assumptions about the form of the noise. On the other end of the spectrum, system-level benchmarking techniques exist, but they fail to discriminate between coherent and incoherent noise sources. We experimentally verify the BOG against randomized benchmarking (RB) (the industry standard benchmarking technique) in the two-qubit regime, then apply this technique to a six-qubit linear chain, a regime currently inaccessible to RB. In this experiment, we inject an instantaneous coherent Z-type noise on each qubit and demonstrate that the measured coherent noise scales correctly with the magnitude of the injected noise, while the measured incoherent noise remains unchanged as expected. This demonstrates a robust technique to measure coherent errors in a variety of hardware.

TI Toward Sustainable Mobility: A Hybrid Quantum-LLM Decision Framework for
   Next-Generation Intelligent Transportation Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) aim to improve mobility and reduce congestion, yet current solutions still struggle with scalability, sensing bottlenecks, and inefficient computational resource usage. These limitations impede the shift towards environmentally responsible mobility. This work introduces ORQCIAM (Orchestrated Reasoning based on Quantum Computing and Intelligence for Advanced Mobility), a modular framework that combines Quantum Computing (QC) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable real-time, energy-aware decision-making in ITSs. Unlike conventional ITS or AI-based approaches that focus primarily on traffic performance, ORQCIAM explicitly incorporates sustainability as a design objective, targeting reductions in travel time, fuel or energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. The framework unifies cognitive, virtual, and federated sensing to enhance data reliability, while a hybrid decision layer dynamically orchestrates QC-LLM interactions to minimize computational overhead. Scenario-based evaluation demonstrates faster incident screening, more efficient routing, and measurable sustainability benefits. Across tested scenarios, ORQCIAM achieved 9-18% reductions in travel time, 6-14% lower estimated CO2 emissions, and around a 50-75% decrease in quantum-optimization calls by concealing QC activation during non-critical events. These results confirm that dynamic QC-LLM coordination effectively decreases computational overhead while supporting greener and more adaptive mobility patterns. Overall, ORQCIAM illustrates how hybrid QC-LLM architectures can serve as catalysts for efficient, low-carbon, and resilient transportation systems aligned with sustainable smart-city goals.

TI QSHO: Quantum spotted hyena optimizer for global optimization
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO) is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the spotted hyenas' social behavior, and it has been developed to solve global optimization problems. SHO has shown superior performance over its competitive metaheuristic algorithms in solving benchmark function optimization and engineering design problems. However, it suffers from getting stuck in local optima due to its lack of exploration while solving multi-modal optimization problems. This article proposes an improved SHO, quantum SHO (QSHO), inspired by quantum computing. The QSHO implements a quantum computing mechanism to promote its exploration ability. The novel method is tested on well-known IEEE CEC2013 and IEEE CEC2017 benchmark suits with 30 and 50 dimensions and four real-world engineering optimization problems. The results of QSHO are compared with that of Classical SHO, improved SHO (ISHO), Modified SHO (MSHO), Oppositional SHO with mutation operator (OBL-MO-SHO), SHO with space transformation search (STS-SHO), Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm (QSSA), and Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA). The results are analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (WSRT) and Friedman Test. The empirical results show that QSHO statistically outperforms other compared algorithms for benchmark problem suits with 30 and 50 dimensions. According to Friedman Test statistics, the QSHO algorithm ranked first and second in solving CEC2013 30D and 50D, respectively, whereas it ranked first in both solving CEC2017 30D and 50D. In addition, we have assessed the QSHO in four real-world engineering optimization problems, and the QSHO statistically outperforms the competitive algorithms.

TI Machine learning with knowledge constraints for design optimization of
   microring resonators as a quantum light source
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With careful design and integration, microring resonators can serve as a promising foundation for developing compact and scalable sources of non-classical light for quantum information processing. However, the current design flow is hindered by computational challenges and a complex, high-dimensional parameter space with interdependent variables. In this work, we present a knowledge-integrated machine learning framework based on Bayesian Optimization for designing squeezed light sources using microring resonators. Our model, after only 5 optimization rounds, identified two optimal structures with distinct cross-sectional areas and radii (65 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:\mu\:m$$\end{document} and 110 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:\mu\:m$$\end{document}), achieving escape efficiencies over 90% and on-chip squeezing levels of 7.48 dB and 9.86 dB, respectively. Our results demonstrate that by adaptively finding the coupling coefficient through BO, the model has identified optimal points in the over-coupled regions with superior performance. This optimization model is developed specifically for single resonators made of silicon nitride. However, its applicability extends beyond this, and it can be used to model structures with auxiliary rings or other materials like silicon carbide. Our approach is expected to streamline the design of other integrated photonic components, including Mach-Zehnder interferometers and directional couplers, for applications in quantum photonic circuits and optical neural networks.

TI Interferometric imaging of amplitude and phase of spatial biphoton
   states
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Biphoton digital holography is developed to perform quantum state tomography in a short measurement time. The interference between an unknown and a reference biphoton state is used to retrieve amplitude and phase information through coincidence imaging on a time-stamping camera.
   High-dimensional biphoton states are promising resources for quantum applications, ranging from high-dimensional quantum communications to quantum imaging. A pivotal task is fully characterizing these states, which is generally time-consuming and not scalable when projective measurement approaches are adopted; however, new advances in coincidence imaging technologies allow for overcoming these limitations by parallelizing multiple measurements. Here we introduce biphoton digital holography, in analogy to off-axis digital holography, where coincidence imaging of the superposition of an unknown state with a reference state is used to perform quantum state tomography. We apply this approach to single photons emitted by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal when the pump photons possess various quantum states. The proposed reconstruction technique allows for a more efficient (three orders of magnitude faster) and reliable (an average fidelity of 87%) characterization of states in arbitrary spatial modes bases, compared with previously performed experiments. Multiphoton digital holography may pave the route toward efficient and accurate computational ghost imaging and high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Scalable quantum eraser with superconducting integrated circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A fast and scalable scheme for multi-qubit resetting in superconducting quantum processors is proposed by exploiting the feasibility of frequency-tunable transmon qubits and transmon-like couplers to engineer a full programmable superconducting erasing head. We demonstrate the emergence of collective effects that lead to a decoherence-free subspace during the erasing process. The presence of such a subspace negatively impacts the device's performance and has been overlooked in other multi-qubit chips. To circumvent this issue and pave the way to the device's scalability, we employ tunable frequency couplers to identify a specific set of parameters that enables us to erase even those states within this subspace, ensuring the simultaneous multi-qubit resetting, verified here for the two-qubit case. In contrast, we show that collectivity effects can also emerge as an ingredient to speed up the erasing process. To end, we offer a proposal to build up integrated superconducting processors that can be efficiently connected to erasure heads in a scalable way.

Fluorescence intensities from these nanopillars are 3.5 times greater than that of single shallow NV centers embedded in unstructured flat diamond.

TI Two-stage lithium niobate nonlinear photonic circuits for low-crosstalk
   and broadband all optical wavelength conversion
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB All optical wavelength converters (AOWCs) that can effectively and flexibly switch optical signals between different wavelength channels are essential elements in future optical fiber communications and quantum information systems. A promising strategy for achieving high-performance AOWCs is to leverage strong three-wave mixing processes in second-order nonlinear nanophotonic devices, specifically thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) waveguides. By exploiting the advantages of sub-wavelength light confinement and dispersion engineering compared with their bulk counterparts, TF-PPLN waveguides provide a viable route for realizing highly efficient and broadband wavelength conversion. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely on a single TF-PPLN device to perform both frequency doubling of the telecom pump and the wavelength conversion process, resulting in significant crosstalk between adjacent signal channels. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a two-stage TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic circuit that integrates a second-harmonic generation module, a signal wavelength conversion module, and multiple adiabatic directional coupler-based pump filters on a single chip. By decoupling the two nonlinear processes and leveraging the high pump-filtering extinction ratio, we achieve low-crosstalk AOWC with a side-channel suppression ratio exceeding 25 dB, substantially surpassing the performance of single-stage devices. Furthermore, our device exhibits an ultra-broad conversion bandwidth of 110 nm and a relatively high conversion efficiency of-15.6 dB, making it an attractive solution for future photonic systems. The two-stage AOWC design shows promise for low-noise phase-sensitive amplification and quantum frequency conversion in future classical and quantum photonic systems.<br /> (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Exploring the Feasibility of Quantum-Based Secure Communications for
   Nuclear Applications
SO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent advancements in reactor designs could offer new revolutionary capabilities, including remote monitoring, increased flexibility, and reduced operation and maintenance costs. Embracing new digital technologies would allow for operational concepts such as semiautonomous or near-autonomous control, and two-way communications for real-time integration with the upcoming smart electric grid. However, such continuous data transmission from and toward a reactor site could potentially introduce new challenges and vulnerabilities, necessitating the prioritization of cybersecurity.Conventional information technology-based encryption schemes, which rely mostly on computational complexity, have been shown to be vulnerable to cyberattacks. With the advent of quantum computing, practically any asymmetric encryption could be potentially compromised. For example, it has been shown that a RSA-2048 bit key could be broken in 8 h.To address this challenge, we explore the feasibility of quantum key distribution (QKD) to secure communications. QKD is a physical layer security scheme relying on the laws of quantum mechanics instead of mathematical complexity. QKD promises not only unconditional security but also detection of potential intrusion, as it allows the communication parties to become aware of eavesdropping. To test the proposed hypothesis, a novel simulation tool (NuQKD) was developed to allow for real-time simulation of the BB84 QKD protocol between two remote terminals. A reference scenario is proposed, generic enough to cover various internal and external communication links to a reactor site. Using NuQKD, the internal and external data links were modeled, and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for various QKD configurations.A performance analysis was conducted, demonstrating that QKD can provide adequate secret key rates with low false alarms and has the potential of addressing the nuclear industry's high standards of confidentiality for distance lengths up to 75 km of fiberoptics. Using a conservative estimation, QKD can provide up to 21.5 kbps of secret key rate for a distance of 1 km and 14.4 kbps at 10 km. The target secret key rates for the corresponding links were estimated at 16 kbps and 80 bps, respectively, based on the analysis of real data from a PUR-1 fully digital reactor. Consequently, QKD is shown to be compatible with existing and future point-to-point reactor communication architectures. These results motivate further study of quantum communications for nuclear reactors.

TI Size and Topology Optimization of Truss Structures Using Quantum-Based
   HS Algorithm
SO BUILDINGS
AB With the development of various metaheuristic algorithms, research cases that perform weight optimization of truss structures are steadily progressing. In particular, due to the possibility of developing quantum computers, metaheuristic algorithms combined with quantum computation are being developed. In this paper, the QbHS (Quantum based Harmony Search) algorithm was proposed by combining quantum computation and the conventional HS (Harmony Search) algorithms, and the size and topology optimization of the truss structure was performed. The QbHS algorithm has the same repetitive computational structure as the conventional HS algorithm. However, the QbHS algorithm constructed QHM (Quantum Harmony Memory) using the probability of Q-bit and proposed to perform pitch adjusting using the basic state of Q-bit. To perform weight optimization of truss structures using the proposed QbHS algorithm, 20 bar, 24 bar, and 72-bar truss structures were adopted as examples and compared with the results of the QE (Quantum Evolutionary) algorithm. As a result, it was confirmed that the QbHS algorithm had excellent convergence performance by finding a lower weight than the QE algorithm. In addition, by expressing the weight optimization results of the truss structure with an image coordinate system, the topology of the truss structure could be confirmed only by the picture. The results of this study are expected to play an important role in future computer information systems by combining quantum computation and conventional HS algorithms.

TI Purcell enhancement and polarization control of single-photon emitters
   in monolayer WSe2 using dielectric nanoantennas
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great promise as hosts for high-purity deterministic single-photon sources. In the last few years, the underlying physics of single photon emission in 2D materials have been uncovered, and their optical properties have been improved to meet criteria for a variety of quantum technologies and applications. In this work, we take advantage of the unique characteristics of dielectric nanoantennas in manipulating the electromagnetic response on a sub-wavelength scale to localize and control defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in 2D layered materials. We show that dielectric nanoantennas are capable of inducing high Purcell enhancement > 20 and therefore brighter single-photon emission, which is characterized by a reduction of the emitters' radiative lifetimes and enhancement of their brightness by more than an order of magnitude. We demonstrate that the sub-wavelength-scale dielectric nanoantennas can be designed to also impose a predetermined strain profile that determines the confinement potential of the SPE, leading to robust control over the optical polarization with up to 94% extinction ratio. The combination of large Purcell enhancement, polarization orientation, and site control through strain engineering demonstrates the advantages and unique capabilities of dielectric nanoantennas for enhancing the quantum optical properties of 2D SPEs for quantum information technologies.

TI Enhancing resilience in Los Angeles energy systems
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant challenges to the resilience and operational stability of energy systems, particularly in regions like Los Angeles (LA). These extreme events disrupt critical infrastructure, hinder renewable energy generation, and amplify uncertainties in energy supply and demand. This paper proposes a novel quantum computing-based Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework to enhance the resilience of Virtual Power Plant (VPP)-enabled microgrids during wildfire scenarios. The framework integrates advanced quantum principles with dynamic wildfire impact modeling to optimize energy resource allocation under high-dimensional uncertainty. Key features of the proposed framework include a quantum-enhanced DRO model for energy dispatch, a wildfire propagation model to capture cascading impacts on grid operations, and a robust energy allocation strategy prioritizing critical loads. The study employs real-world data from recent LA wildfires, incorporating geospatial fire spread dynamics, wind patterns, and renewable generation profiles. A case study on a representative LA microgrid demonstrates the framework's scalability and effectiveness. The proposed method achieves approximately a 25.3% reduction in operational costs, improves the resilience score by up to 18.7%, and ensures uninterrupted support to over 98% of critical loads during high-intensity wildfire scenarios. This research advances the state of the art in energy system resilience by combining quantum computing with robust optimization techniques tailored to wildfire-induced challenges. The findings offer actionable insights for designing adaptive, sustainable, and resilient energy systems in fire-prone regions.

TI Tune-out wavelengths of Rydberg atoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The atomic polarizability represents the response characteristics of atoms to externally applied electromagnetic fields. The wavelength (or frequency) at which the dynamic polarizability of an atom is equal to zero is referred to as the tune-out wavelength (or frequency). Spectroscopy technology based on the tune-out effect has potential applications in quantum precision measurement, quantum computation and quantum communication. Related research topics include the measurement of fundamental physical constants and strong interactions. The tune-out wavelengths of atoms in low-lying states primarily fall within the optical band, where the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements have significant progress. However, for Rydberg atoms in highly excited states, theoretical calculations are challenging due to their high density of atomic states. The difficulty of experimental measurement arises from small splitting of adjacent atomic energy levels. In this paper, we demonstrate the tune-out wavelengths measurement for Rydberg atoms in a cesium vapor cell at room temperature. We utilize a two-photon cascade excitation to prepare Rydberg states and employ amplitude-modulation electromagnetically-induced transparency (AM-EIT) spectroscopy to measure the tuneout wavelength. By continuously scanning the microwave frequencies, we obtain AM-EIT signals of Rydberg atoms. At near-resonant microwave transition wavelengths, strong AM-EIT signals are observed due to microwave-atom coupling. Conversely, at tune-out wavelengths, the dynamically polarization-induced destructive interference in neighboring energy states occurs which leads to the weak AM-EIT signals. The AMEIT provides a spectral resolution of about 10 MHz. We have developed a simplified three-level model to calculate the tune-out wavelength. The results of our theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental findings within a range of +/- 90 MHz.

TI Manipulation of pulse propagation via tunable electromagnetically
   induced transparency in a (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dot system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study investigates the tunable propagation of optical pulses in a three-level system of coupled quantum dots. The system forms an effective closed configuration, supporting strong quantum coherence and controllable light-matter interactions. Using the density matrix formalism, we analyze the quantum dynamical response under the influence of both a weak probe and a strong control field, with inter-dot tunneling acting as a key tunable parameter. Our results reveal that both the tunneling strength ( T-e) and control field Rabi frequency ( Omega(c)) play crucial roles in shaping the system's optical properties. We observe the emergence of electromagnetically induced transparency-like windows, the splitting and shifting of dispersion peaks, and the formation of absorption doublets and transparency windows. The real and imaginary parts of the electric permittivity exhibit pronounced sensitivity to these external controls. Furthermore, the group index and group velocity are shown to be highly tunable, enabling transitions between slow-light and fast-light regimes. Detailed analysis of temporal pulse dynamics demonstrates the ability to achieve controllable delay and advancement of optical pulses, depending on the interaction between T-e and Omega(c). These findings highlight the potential of such quantum dot systems for dynamic photonic control, including applications in optical buffering, reconfigurable delay lines, coherent switching, and quantum information processing. The demonstrated tunability and coherence effects make this platform a promising candidate for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum photonic technologies. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Fluctuation Spectroscopy of Two-Level Systems in Superconducting

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting quantum computing is experiencing a tremendous growth. Although major milestones have already been achieved, useful quantum-computing applications are hindered by a variety of decoher-ence phenomena. Decoherence due to two-level systems (TLSs) hosted by amorphous dielectric materials is ubiquitous in planar superconducting devices. We use high-quality quasilumped-element resonators as quantum sensors to investigate TLS-induced loss and noise. We perform two-tone experiments with a probe and pump electric fields; the pump is applied at different power levels and detunings. We measure and analyze time series of the quality factor and resonance frequency for very long time periods, up to 1000 h. We additionally carry out simulations based on the TLS interacting model in the presence of a pump field. We find that loss and noise are reduced at medium and high power, matching the simulations, but not at low power.

TI Emergent Unitary Designs for Encoded Qubits from Coherent Errors and
   Syndrome Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Unitary k-designs are distributions of unitary gates that match the Haar distribution up to its kth statistical moment. They are a crucial resource for randomized quantum protocols. However, their implementation on encoded logical qubits is nontrivial due to the need for magic gates, which can require a large resource overhead. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to generate unitary designs for encoded qubits in surface codes by applying local unitary rotations ("coherent errors") on the physical qubits followed by syndrome measurement and error correction. We prove that, under some conditions on the coherent errors (notably including all single-qubit unitaries) and on the error-correcting code, this process induces a unitary transformation of the logical subspace. We numerically show that the ensemble of logical unitaries (indexed by the random syndrome outcomes) converges to a unitary design in the thermodynamic limit, provided that the density or strength of coherent errors is above a finite threshold. This "unitary design" phase transition coincides with the code's coherent error threshold under optimal decoding. Furthermore, we propose a classical algorithm to simulate the protocol based on a "staircase" implementation of the surface code encoder and decoder circuits. This enables a mapping to a (1 + 1)-dimensional monitored circuit, where we observe an entanglement phase transition (and thus a classical complexity phase transition of the decoding algorithm) coinciding with the aforementioned unitary design phase transition. Our results provide a practical way to realize unitary designs on encoded qubits, with applications including quantum state tomography and benchmarking in error-correcting codes.

TI Switchable selective interactions in a Dicke model with a driven biased
   term
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB In this work, we propose a method to investigate controllable qubit-resonator interactions in a Dicke model with driven biased term. The nonlinearity of the spectrum, which can be induced by qubit-resonator interactions, plays an important role in such controllable interactions. To gain insight into the mechanism of the nonlinearity, we perform a unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian. The results show that the nonlinearity of the transformed Hamiltonian depends on the qubit-resonator coupling strength. The general forms of the effective Hamiltonians are discussed in detail based on the frequency modulation approach. The dynamical evolution can be switched on and off by adjusting the modulation parameters. By utilizing such controllable interactions, we discuss the creation of Dicke states and the arbitrary superposition of Dicke states. We also consider the nonlinearity of the energy level for the limit of large qubit numbers. In the thermodynamics limit, the Kerr type nonlinearity is induced from "magnon"-resonator coupling, and the selective preparation of "magnon" Fock states can be studied under a "magnon" scenario.

AB We analysed the maximum number of secured users via upstream and downstream continuous-variable and upstream discrete-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) systems coexisting with classical channels in passive optical networks. We demonstrated that downstream continuous-variable QKD outperforms upstream discrete-variable QKD only for small number of users.

TI Koopman Spectral Linearization vs. Carleman Linearization: A
   Computational Comparison Study
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Nonlinearity presents a significant challenge in developing quantum algorithms involving differential equations, prompting the exploration of various linearization techniques, including the well-known Carleman Linearization. Instead, this paper introduces the Koopman Spectral Linearization method tailored for nonlinear autonomous ordinary differential equations. This innovative linearization approach harnesses the interpolation methods and the Koopman Operator Theory to yield a lifted linear system. It promises to serve as an alternative approach that can be employed in scenarios where Carleman Linearization is traditionally applied. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this linearization approach for several commonly used nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

TI Machine-learning certification of multipartite entanglement for noisy
   quantum hardware
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics, both conceptually and for its many applications. Classifying an arbitrary multipartite state as entangled or separable-a task referred to as the separability problem-poses a significant challenge, since a state can be entangled with respect to many different of its partitions. We develop a certification pipeline that feeds the statistics of random local measurements into a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, to determine with respect to which partitions a given quantum state is entangled. After training a model on randomly generated quantum states, entangled in different partitions and of varying purity, we verify the accuracy of its predictions on simulated test data, and finally apply it to states prepared on IBM quantum computing hardware.

TI A Quantum Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS
AB We propose a novel hybrid quantum computing strategy for parallel MCMC algorithms that generate multiple proposals at each step. This strategy makes the rate-limiting step within parallel MCMC amenable to quantum parallelization by using the Gumbel-max trick to turn the generalized accept-reject step into a discrete optimization problem. When combined with new insights from the parallel MCMC literature, such an approach allows us to embed target density evaluations within a well-known extension of Grover's quantum search algorithm. Letting P denote the number of proposals in a single MCMC iteration, the combined strategy reduces the number of target evaluations required from O(P) to O(vP) . In the following, we review the rudiments of quantum computing, quantum search and the Gumbel-max trick in order to elucidate their combination for as wide a readership as possible.

TI A 1.6-mW Cryogenic SiGe LNA IC for Quantum Readout Applications
   Achieving 2.6-K Average Noise Temperature From 3 to 6 GHz
SO IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Readout of superconducting quantum processors of sufficient scale to enable useful fault-tolerant quantum computing will require large arrays of high-performance cryogenic low-noise amplifiers. While it is desirable to employ silicon-based integrated-circuit amplifiers for this application, to date, the noise performance of such devices has been significantly worse than that of amplifiers implemented in III-V technologies. Here, we present the design and characterization of a high-gain cryogenic SiGe LNA IC achieving an average noise temperature of 2.6 K over the 3-6-GHz frequency band while dissipating just 1.6 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this amplifier achieves the best performance of any silicon-based LNA (discrete or integrated circuit) operating in this frequency range.

TI Exergy of passive states: Waste energy after ergotropy extraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Work extraction protocol is always a significant issue in the context of quantum batteries, in which the notion of ergotropy is used to quantify a particular amount of energy that can be extracted through unitary processes. Given the total amount of energy stored in a quantum system, quantifying wasted energy after the ergotropy extraction is a question to be considered when undesired coupling with thermal reservoirs is taken into account. In this paper, we show that some amount of energy can be lost when we extract ergotropy from a quantum system and quantified by the exergy of passive states. Through a particular example, one shows that ergotropy extraction can be done by preserving the quantum correlations of a quantum system. Our study opens the perspective for new advances in open system quantum batteries able to explore exergy stored as quantum correlations.

TI Impact of charge noise on electron exchange interactions in
   semiconductors
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The electron exchange interaction is a promising medium for the entanglement of single-spin qubits in semiconductors as it results in high-speed two-qubit gates. The quality of such entangling gates is reduced by the presence of noise caused by nearby defects acting as two-level fluctuators. To date, the effect of charge noise has been calculated assuming a Gaussian distribution of exchange interaction frequencies between the qubits equivalent to a linear coupling of charge noise with the exchange interaction. In reality the coupling can differ significantly from this linear-coupling approximation depending on the inter-qubit tunnel coupling, detuning of the qubit system, and the magnitude of charge noise. We derive analytical expressions for the frequency spectra of exchange oscillations that encompasses both linear and non-linear coupling to charge-noise. The resulting decoherence times and decay profiles of the exchange oscillations vary considerably. When compared with recent experiments our model shows that non-linear charge-noise coupling is significant and requires consideration to characterise and optimise exchange-based entangling gates.

TI Disentangling Hype from Practicality: On Realistically Achieving Quantum
   Advantage
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB OPERATING ON FUNDAMENTALLY different principles than conventional computers, quantum computers promise to solve a variety of important problems that seemed forever intractable on classical computers. Leveraging the quantum foundations of nature, the time to solve certain problems on quantum computers grows more slowly with the size of the problem than on classical computers-this is called quantum speedup. Going beyond quantum supremacy,(2) which was the demonstration of a quantum computer outperforming a classical one for an artificial problem, an important question is finding meaningful applications (of academic or commercial interest) that can realistically be solved faster on a quantum computer than on a classical one. We call this a practical quantum advantage, or quantum practicality for short.

TI Topology-Optimized Plasmonic Nanoantenna for Efficient Single-photon
   Extraction
SO PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER
AB Quantum emitters coupled to plasmonic nanostructures can act as extremely bright single-photon sources. Interestingly, the mode volumes supported by the plasmonic nanostructures can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the cubic wavelength, which leads to dramatically enhanced light-matter interactions and drastically increased photon emission. However, the requirements of a small mode volume for emission speed-up are always contradictory with a sufficiently large mode volume for efficient extraction, especially in a single architecture. Here, we report the design of a topology-optimized plasmonic nanoantenna to alleviate the above limitation which could greatly enhance far-field photon extraction. The plasmonic nanoantenna is composed of an optimized gold pattern and a silicon nitride substrate, with a nanohole in the center of the gold pattern. Our design is based on density-based topology optimization and is inherently robust to dimensions and fabrication errors. As a result, the normalized extraction decay rate (gamma(e)/gamma(0)) can reach 5.48 at a wavelength of 517 nm if an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.45 is utilized. The proposed method to alleviate the contradiction of plasmonic mode volume could brighten the prospects for future integration of single-photon sources into photonic quantum networks and applications in quantum information science.

TI Improved Real-Time Post-Processing for Quantum Random Number Generators
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Randomness extraction is a key problem in cryptography and theoretical computer science. With the recent rapid development of quantum cryptography, quantum-proof randomness extraction has also been widely studied, addressing the security issues in the presence of a quantum adversary. In contrast with conventional quantum-proof randomness extractors characterizing the input raw data as min-entropy sources, it is found that the input raw data generated by a large class of trusted-device quantum random number generators can be characterized as the so-called reverse block source. This fact enables us to design improved extractors. Two novel quantum-proof randomness extractors for reverse block sources that realize real-time block-wise extraction are proposed specifically. In comparison with the general min-entropy randomness extractors, the designs achieve a significantly higher extraction speed and a longer output data length with the same seed length. In addition, they enjoy the property of online algorithms, which process the raw data on the fly without waiting for the entire input raw data to be available. These features make the design an adequate choice for the real-time post-processing of practical quantum random number generators. Applying the extractors to the raw data generated by a widely used quantum random number generator, a simulated extraction speed as high as 300 Gbps is achieved.
   Novel quantum randomness extractors are proposed against quantum side information. Unlike traditional approaches, the techniques are tailored for reverse block source. The methods achieve significantly higher extraction speeds and longer output data lengths with the same seed length. In addition, the raw data are processed on the fly without waiting for the entire input data available. image

TI Quantum-assisted simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation can help us study poorly understood topics such as high-temperature superconductivity and drug design. However, existing quantum simulation algorithms for current quantum computers often have drawbacks that impede their application. Here, we provide a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating the dynamics of quantum systems. Our approach takes the ansatz wave function as a linear combination of quantum states. The quantum states are fixed, and the combination parameters are variationally adjusted. Unlike existing variational quantum simulation algorithms, our algorithm does not require any classical-quantum feedback loop and by construction bypasses the barren plateau problem. Moreover, our algorithm does not require any complicated measurements such as the Hadamard test. The entire framework is compatible with existing experimental capabilities and thus can be implemented immediately.

We use the master equation to obtain the density operator when the qubit is initially prepared in its excited state and the field is in a finite-dimensional pair coherent state. The properties of the considered system, such as the population inversion, amount of the mixedness, parameter estimation, and squeezing, are explored for one- and two-photon transitions. The effects of photon addition to the field and phase damping on the evaluation of these quantumness measures are also investigated.

TI Efficient relation extraction via quantum reinforcement learning
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Most existing relation extraction methods only determine the relation type after identifying all entities, thus not fully modeling the interaction between relation-type recognition and entity mention detection. This article introduces a novel paradigm for relation extraction by treating relevant entities as parameters of relations and harnessing the strong expressive capabilities and acceleration advantages of quantum computing to address the relation extraction task. In this article, we develop a quantum hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to enhance the interaction between relation-type recognition and entity mention detection. The entire relation extraction process is broken down into a hierarchical structure of two layers of quantum reinforcement learning strategies dedicated to relation detection and entity extraction, demonstrating greater feasibility and expressiveness, especially when dealing with superimposed relations. Our proposed method outperforms existing approaches through experimental evaluations on commonly used public datasets, mainly showcasing its significant advantages in extracting superimposed relationships.

We present a quantum accelerator showing that it can be done even without the presence of very good qubits. Then, we present Dependability for Artificial Intelligence (AI) oriented Hardware. Indeed, AI applications shown relevant resilience properties to faults, meaning that the testing strongly depends on the application behavior rather than on the hardware structure. We will cover AI hardware design issues due to manufacturing defects, aging faults, and soft errors. Finally, We present the use of AxC to reduce the cost of hardening a digital circuit without impacting its reliability. In other words how to go beyond usual modular redundancy scheme.

We are able to detect and characterise CQPS flux qubits with linewidths down to Delta omega=12 +/- 1MHz on several resonator modes, and show that, unlike inductive coupling, here the coupling strength does not depend on the qubit's energy. Since the qubit is galvanically decoupled from the resonator, our approach provides flexibility in material, design and fabrication choices for CQPS-based devices. Our results are two-fold: we report CQPS in TiN and demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, capacitive coupling of a CQPS flux qubit.

TI Entanglement monotones from complementarity relations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Bohr's complementarity and Schrodinger's entanglement are two prominent physical characters of quantum systems. In this article, we formally connect them. It is known that complementarity relations for wave-particle duality are saturated only for pure, single-quanton, quantum states. For mixed states, the wave-particle quantifiers never saturate a complementarity relation and can even reach zero for a maximally mixed state. To fully characterize a quanton, it is not enough to consider its wave-particle aspect; we have also to regard its quantum correlations with other systems. Here we prove that for any complete complementarity relation involving predictability and visibility measures that satisfy the criteria established in the literature, the corresponding quantum correlations are entanglement monotones. Therefore, we formally connect entanglement monotones with complementarity relations without appealing to a particular measure.

TI Qubits on the horizon: decoherence and thermalization near black holes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We examine the late-time evolution of a qubit (or Unruh-De Witt detector) that hovers very near to the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, while interacting with a free quantum scalar field. The calculation is carried out perturbatively in the dimensionless qubit/field coupling g, but rather than computing the qubit excitation rate due to field interactions (as is often done), we instead use Open EFT techniques to compute the late-time evolution to all orders in g(2)t/r(s) (while neglecting order g(4)t/r(s) effects) where r(s) = 2GM is the Schwarzschild radius. We show that for qubits sufficiently close to the horizon the late-time evolution takes a simple universal form that depends only on the near-horizon geometry, assuming only that the quantum field is prepared in a Hadamard-type state (such as the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacua). When the redshifted energy difference, omega (infinity), between the two qubit states (as measured by a distant observer looking at the detector) satisfies omega (infinity)r(s) << 1 this universal evolution becomes Markovian and describes an exponential approach to equilibrium with the Hawking radiation, with the off-diagonal and diagonal components of the qubit density matrix relaxing to equilibrium with different characteristic times, both of order r(s)/g(2).

TI Genuine monogamy relations in no-signaling theories-a geometric approach
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum correlations are subject to certain distribution rules represented by so-called monogamy relations. Derivation of monogamy relations for multipartite systems is a non-trivial problem, as the multipartite correlations reveal their behaviors in a way different from bipartite systems. We here show that simple geometric properties of probabilistic spaces, in conjunction with no-signaling principle, lead to genuine monogamy relations for a large class of Bell type inequalities for many qubits. The term of 'genuine' implies that only one out of N Bell inequalities exhibits a quantum violation. We also generalize our method to qudits. Using the similar geometric approach with a quasi-distance employed, we derive Svetlichny-Zohren-Gill type Bell inequalities for d-dimensional tripartite systems, and show their monogamous nature.

TI Hypersonic acoustic wave control via stealthy hyperuniform phononic
   nanostructures
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Controlling hypersonic surface acoustic waves is crucial for advanced phononic devices such as high-frequency filters, sensors, and quantum computing components. While periodic phononic crystals enable precise bandgap engineering, their ability to suppress acoustic waves is limited to specific frequency ranges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave control using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure, exhibiting characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leads to broad-range acoustic transmission reduction and bandgap-like regions of particularly strong suppression. By integrating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern, we achieve efficient waveguiding at frequencies within these bandgaps. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support complex waveguide shapes. These findings provide an alternative approach to overcome limitations of traditional phononic crystals and advance acoustic technologies such as mechanical quantum computing and smartphone filters.

AB A prominent feature in iron-based superconductors is the strong interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling, which are key ingredients to promote topological states for fault-tolerant quantum computing, including Majorana zero modes (MZMs). While MZMs have been reported recently in FeTe0.55Se0.45, the topological features, magnetism, and superconductivity are found not uniformly across samples. Here, we discuss transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to characterize the electronic states in a series of (Fe,Ni)Te0.55Se0.45. Substituting Ni on the Fe site modifies spin-orbit coupling. We found Ni substitution lowers the superconducting transition temperature and changes the electronic structure and related topological properties. Our investigations suggest the presence of superconductivity and other competing ground states in (Fe,Ni)Te0.55Se0.45. Thus, the ground state control appears to be a prerequisite for the use of MZMs in quantum applications.

AB Quantum computing devices are being installed alongside supercomputing clusters to serve as hardware accelerators. This new type of architecture will require an integrated hybrid software stack. With this goal in mind, we have developed a fully integrated hybrid quantum -classical method in the hope of improving Register Allocation in the classical LLVM compiler. We propose a hybrid variational optimization algorithm for the PBQP formulation of Register Allocation. We implemented this algorithm in C++ inside LLVM using the NVIDIA CUDAQ framework. The performance of the method is evaluated using NVIDIA CUDA-Q noiseless emulators and shows promising results while still needing further optimizations. Our work constitutes a demonstration of an end-to -end tight integration of a quantum subroutine inside an existing classical codebase of interest with potentially interesting performance in fault-tolerant hardware.

TI A modification proposal for the reconciliation mechanism of the key
   exchange algorithm NewHope
SO LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL
AB The latest advances in quantum computing forced the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to launch an initiative for selecting quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. One of the best-known proposals is NewHope, an algorithm that was initially designed as a key exchange algorithm. In its original design, NewHope presented a reconciliation mechanism that is complex and represents an entry barrier for potential implementers. This contribution presents equivalent schemes in one, two and three dimensions, which allow anyone to make the transition to the 4D NewHope algorithm easier to undertake. In addition to that, the effect of modifying some of the parameters associated to NewHope's reconciliation mechanism is studied, which has allowed us to propose different sets of parameters that could increase the security of NewHope implementations.

TI Cross talk compensation in multimode continuous-variable entanglement
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Two-mode squeezed states are scalable and robust entanglement resources for continuous-variable and hybrid quantum information protocols that are realized at a distance. We consider the effect of a linear cross talk in the multimode distribution of two-mode squeezed states propagating through parallel similar channels. First, to reduce degradation of the distributed Gaussian entanglement, we show that the initial two-mode squeezing entering the channel should be optimized already in the presence of a small cross talk. Second, we suggest simultaneous optimization of relative phase between the modes and their linear coupling on a receiver side prior to the use of entanglement, which can fully compensate the cross talk once the channel transmittance is the same for all the modes. For the realistic channels with similar transmittance values for either of the modes, the cross talk can be still largely compensated. This method relying on the mode interference overcomes an alternative method of entanglement localization in one pair of modes using measurement on another pair and feed-forward control. Our theoretical results pave the way to more efficient use of multimode continuous-variable photonic entanglement in scalable quantum networks with cross talk.

TI Impact of scalar NSI on spatial and temporal correlations in neutrino
   oscillations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is non-standard interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e. non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures. This work presents the first investigation of scalar NSI in the context of quantum correlation measures.

TI Bell nonlocality and entanglement in e plus  e -
   → YY at BESIII
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Bell nonlocality and entanglement are two kinds of quantum correlations in quantum systems. Due to the recent upgrade in the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment, it is possible to explore the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation with high precision data. We provide a systematic method for studying quantum correlations in spin-1=2 hyperon-antihyperon systems through the measures for the nonlocality and entanglement. We find that with nonvanishing polarizations of the hyperon and its antihyperon, the kinematic region of nonlocality in the hyperon-antihyperon system is more restricted than the z+z- system in which polarizations of z leptons are vanishing. We also present an experimental proposal to probe the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems at BSEIII.

TI Phase-Coherent Transport in GeSn Alloys on Si
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Germanium-Tin (GeSn) is a novel semiconductor Group IV alloy that can be tuned from indirect to direct bandgap semiconductors by adjusting the Sn content. This property makes this alloy class attractive for integrated photonic applications and high-mobility electronic devices. In this work, the GeSn alloy properties are investigated in the view of applications fields such as spintronics and quantum computing. Using low-temperature magneto-transport measurements, electron interference effects and deriving typical mesoscopic benchmark parameters such as the phase-coherence length in GeSn-based Hall bar structures for Sn concentrations up to 14 at.% is investigated. Furthermore, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations provide direct access to the effective mass of the Gamma-valley electrons as well as the charge carrier mobility. This work provides a new insight into advanced group IV alloys desired for the study of spin dynamics and its quantum computing applications.

TI Toward a Union-Find Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum LDPC codes are a promising direction for low overhead quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Union-Find decoder as a decoder for quantum LDPC codes. We prove that this decoder corrects all errors with weight up to An(alpha) for some A, alpha > 0, where n is the code length, for different classes of quantum LDPC codes such as toric codes and hyperbolic codes in any dimension D >= 3 and quantum expander codes. To prove this result, we introduce a notion of covering radius which measures the spread of an error from its syndrome. We believe this notion could find application beyond the decoding problem. We also perform numerical simulations, which show that our Union-Find decoder outperforms the belief propagation decoder in the low error rate regime in the case of a quantum LDPC code with length 3600.

TI Tunable frequency conversion in doped photonic crystal fiber pumped near
   degeneracy
SO OPTICA
AB Future quantum networks will rely on the ability to coherently transfer optically encoded quantum information between different wavelength bands. Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing in optical fiber is a promising route to achieving this, but requires fibers with precise dispersion control and broadband transmission at signal, target, and pump wavelengths. Here, we introduce a photonic crystal fiber with a germanium-doped core featuring group velocity matching at 1550 nm, the telecoms C-band, and 920 nm, within the emission range of efficient single photon sources based on InAs quantum dots. With low chromatic walk-off and good optical guidance even at long wavelengths, large lengths of this fiber are used to achieve nanometer-scale frequency shifts between wavelengths around 920 nm with up to 79.4% internal conversion efficiency, allowing dissimilar InAs dots to be interfaced. We also show how cascading this frequency conversion can be used to generate a frequency comb away from telecoms wavelengths. Finally, we use the fiber to demonstrate tunable frequency conversion of weak classical signals around 918 nm to the telecoms C-band.

AB Hybrid languages like the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we develop the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.

TI Nav-Q: quantum deep reinforcement learning for collision-free navigation
   of self-driving cars
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The task of collision-free navigation (CFN) of self-driving cars is an NP-hard problem usually tackled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While DRL methods have proven to be effective, their implementation requires substantial computing resources and extended training periods to develop a robust agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning has recently demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple, non-real-world environments. In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation to improve training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware. Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator, a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our empirical evaluations suggest that Nav-Q shows potential to outperform its classical counterpart in terms of training stability, with reduced sensitivity to different weight initializations and slightly higher average cumulative reward during training. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a model with greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines. Finally, we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation, observing that the quantum noise deteriorates the training performances but enhances the exploratory tendencies of the agent during training.

AB Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as a promising method for investigating ground state properties in quantum chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. However, the conventional VQE method generally lacks systematic improvement and convergence guarantees, particularly when dealing with strongly correlated systems. In light of these challenges, we present a novel framework called orbital expansion VQE (OE-VQE) to address these limitations. The key idea is to devise an efficient convergence path by utilizing shallower quantum circuits, starting from a highly compact active space and gradually expanding it until convergence to the ground state is achieved. To validate the effectiveness of the OE-VQE framework, we conducted benchmark simulations on several small yet representative molecules, including the H6 chain, H10 ring and N2 . The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed convergence paths significantly enhance the performance of conventional VQE. Overall, our work sheds valuable insight into the simulation of molecules based on shallow quantum circuits, offering a promising avenue for advancing the efficiency and accuracy of VQE approaches in tackling complex molecular systems.

TI Generating approximate ground states of strongly correlated quantum
   many-body systems through quantum imaginary time evolution
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Most quantum algorithms designed to generate or probe properties of the ground state of a quantum many-body system require as input an initial state with a large overlap with the desired ground state. One approach for preparing such a ground state is Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Recent work by [Motta, M. , Sun, C. , Tan, A.T.K. et al (2020)] introduced an algorithm-which we will refer to as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE)-that shows how ITE can be approximated by a sequence of unitary operators, making QITE potentially implementable on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we provide a heuristic study of the capabilities of the QITE algorithm in approximating the ITE of lattice and molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. We numerically study the performance of the QITE algorithm when provided with a good classical initial state for a large class of systems, some of which are of interest to industrial applications, and check if QITE is able to qualitatively replicate the ITE behavior and improve over a classical mean-field solution. The systems we consider in this work range from one- and two-dimensional lattice systems of various lattice geometries displaying short- and long-range interactions, to active spaces of molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. In addition to the comparison of QITE and ITE, we explicitly show how imaginary time evolved fermionic Gaussian states can serve as initial states which can be efficiently computed on classical computers and efficiently implemented on quantum computers for generic spin Hamiltonians in arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions, which can be of independent interest.

TI Quantum advantage for computations with limited space
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers promise the ability to solve problems that are intractable in the classical setting(1), but in many cases this is not rigorously proven. It is often possible to establish a provable theoretical advantage for quantum computations by restricting the computational power(2-8). In multiple cases, quantum advantage over these restricted models was demonstrated experimentally(9-12). Here we consider space-restricted computations that use only one computational classical or quantum bit with a read-only memory as input. We show that n-bit symmetric Boolean functions can be implemented exactly in this framework through the use of quantum signal processing(13) and O(n(2)) gates, but in the analogous classical computations some of the functions may only be evaluated with probability 1/2 + O (n/root 2(n)). We experimentally demonstrate computations of three-bit to six-bit symmetric Boolean functions by quantum circuits with an algorithmic success probability that exceeds the classical limit. This shows that in computations, quantum scrap space offers an advantage over analogous classical space, and calls for an in-depth exploration of space-time trade-offs in quantum circuits.

TI Time-Frequency Signatures of Electronic Coherence of Colloidal CdSe
   Quantum Dot Dimer Assemblies Probed at Room Temperature by
   Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Electronic coherence signatures can be directly identified in the time-frequency maps measured in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Here, we demonstrate the theory and discuss the advantages of this approach via the detailed application to the fast-femtosecond beatings of a wide variety of electronic coherences in ensemble dimers of quantum dots (QDs), assembled from QDs of 3 nm in diameter, with 8% size dispersion in diameter. The observed and computed results can be consistently characterized directly in the time-frequency domain by probing the polarization in the 2DES setup. The experimental and computed time-frequency maps are found in very good agreement, and several electronic coherences are characterized at room temperature in solution, before the extensive dephasing due to the size dispersion begins. As compared to the frequency-frequency maps that are commonly used in 2DES, the time-frequency maps allow exploiting electronic coherences without additional post-processing and with fewer 2DES measurements. Towards quantum technology applications, we also report on the modeling of the time-frequency photocurrent response of these electronic coherences, which paves the way to integrating QD devices with classical architectures, thereby enhancing the quantum advantage of such technologies for parallel information processing at room temperature.

TI Symmetry packaging II: Packaged subspaces, packaged entanglement, and
   classification
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Symmetry packaging is the phenomenon whereby, upon particle creation, all the internal quantum numbers (IQNs) become locked into a single irreducible representation (irrep) block of the gauge group, as required by locality and gauge invariance. The resulting packaged quantum states exhibit characteristic symmetry constraints and entanglement patterns. We develop a group-theoretic framework to describe the symmetry packaging for a variety of concrete symmetries and to classify the corresponding packaged states: (1) We prove that for any finite or compact group G, there exist G-associated packaged subspaces, in which every vector is automatically a packaged state. In particular, in multi-particle systems, any nontrivial representation of G induces inseparable packaged entanglement that locks together all IQNs. (2) We apply this framework to symmetry packaging in finite groups (cyclic group & Zopf;N, charge conjugation C, fermion parity, parity P, time reversal T, and dihedral groups), compact groups (U(1), SU(N), SU(2), and SU(3)), p-form symmetries, and hybrid symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules forbid the factorization of the resulting states. We illustrate how Bell-type packaged entangled states, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations all arise naturally. These results yield a complete classification of packaged quantum states. (3) Finally, we extend the packaging principle to incorporate full spacetime symmetry and hybrid systems of local, global, and Lorentz/Poincar & eacute; charges. Our approach unifies tools from group theory, gauge theory, and topological classification. These results may be useful for potential applications in high energy physics, quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.

TI Profiled Side-Channel Attack on Cryptosystems Based on the Binary
   Syndrome Decoding Problem
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB The NIST standardization process for post-quantum cryptography has been drawing the attention of researchers to the submitted candidates. One direction of research consists in implementing those candidates on embedded systems and that exposes them to physical attacks in return. The Classic McEliece cryptosystem, which is among the four finalists of round 3 in the Key Encapsulation Mechanism category, builds its security on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem, which is a classic hard problem in code-based cryptography. This cryptosystem was recently targeted by a laser fault injection attack leading to message recovery. Regrettably, the attack setting is very restrictive and it does not tolerate any error in the faulty syndrome. Moreover, it depends on the very strong attacker model of laser fault injection, and does not apply to optimised implementations of the algorithm that make optimal usage of the machine words capacity. In this article, we propose a to change the angle and perform a message-recovery attack that relies on side-channel information only. We improve on the previously published work in several key aspects. First, we show that side-channel information, obtained with power consumption analysis, is sufficient to obtain an integer syndrome, as required by the attack framework. This is done by leveraging classic machine learning techniques that recover the Hamming weight information very accurately. Second, we put forward a computationally-efficient method, based on a simple dot product and information-set decoding algorithms, to recover the message from the, possibly inaccurate, recovered integer syndrome. Finally, we present a masking countermeasure against the proposed attack.

TI A quantum moving target segmentation algorithm for grayscale video based
   on background difference method
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The classical moving target segmentation (MTS) algorithm in a video can segment the moving targets out by calculating frame by frame, but the algorithm encounters a real-time problem as the data increases. Recently, the benefits of quantum computing in video processing have been demonstrated, but it is still scarce for MTS. In this paper, a quantum moving target segmentation algorithm for grayscale video based on background difference method is proposed, which can simultaneously model the background of all frames and perform background difference to segment the moving targets. In addition, a feasible quantum subtractor is designed to perform the background difference operation. Then, several quantum units, including quantum cyclic shift transformation, quantum background modeling, quantum background difference, and quantum binarization, are designed in detail to establish the complete quantum circuit.

This is an exponential speedup over the classical algorithm and also outperforms the existing quantum algorithms. Finally, the experiment on IBM Q demonstrates the feasibility of our algorithm in this noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

AB Current quantum computers suffer from a level of noise that prohibits extracting useful results directly from longer computations. The figure of merit in many near-term quantum algorithms is an expectation value measured at the end of the computation, which experiences a bias in the presence of hardware noise. A systematic way to remove such bias is probabilistic error cancellation (PEC). PEC requires a full characterization of the noise and introduces a sampling overhead that increases exponentially with circuit depth, prohibiting high-depth circuits at realistic noise levels. Probabilistic error reduction (PER) is a related quantum error mitigation method that systematically reduces the sampling overhead at the cost of reintroducing bias. In combination with zero-noise extrapolation, PER can yield expectation values with an accuracy comparable to PEC. Noise reduction through PER is broadly applicable to near-term algorithms, and the automated implementation of PER is thus desirable for facilitating its widespread use. To this end, we present an automated quantum error mitigation software framework that includes noise tomography and application of PER to user-specified circuits. We provide a multi-platform Python package that implements a recently developed Pauli noise tomography (PNT) technique for learning a sparse Pauli noise model and exploits a Pauli noise scaling method to carry out PER. We also provide software tools that leverage a previously developed toolchain, employing PyGSTi for gate set tomography and providing a functionality to use the software Mitiq for PER and zero-noise extrapolation to obtain error-mitigated expectation values on a user-defined circuit.

TI Kinetic inductance current sensor for visible to near-infrared
   wavelength transition-edge sensor readout
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Single-photon detectors based on the superconducting transition-edge sensor are used in a number of visible to near-infrared applications, particularly for photon-number-resolving measurements in quantum information science. To be practical for large-scale spectroscopic imaging or photonic quantum computing applications, the size of visible to near-infrared transition-edge sensor arrays and their associated readouts must be increased from a few pixels to many thousands. In this manuscript, we introduce the kinetic inductance current sensor, a scalable readout technology that exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance in a superconducting resonator to make sensitive current measurements. Kinetic inductance current sensors can replace superconducting quantum interference devices for many applications because of their ability to measure fast, high slew-rate signals, their compatibility with standard microwave frequency-division multiplexing techniques, and their relatively simple fabrication. Here, we demonstrate the readout of a visible to near-infrared transition-edge sensor using a kinetic inductance current sensor with 3.7 MHz of bandwidth. We measure a readout noise of 1.4pA/Hz\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1.4\,{{{\rm{pA}}}}/\sqrt{{{{\rm{Hz}}}}}$$\end{document}, considerably below the detector noise at frequencies of interest, and an energy resolution of (0.137 +/- 0.001) eV at 0.8 eV, comparable to resolutions observed with non-multiplexed superconducting quantum interference device readouts.

TI Accelerating CRYSTALS-Kyber: High-Speed NTT Design with Optimized
   Pipelining and Modular Reduction
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a cornerstone for efficient polynomial multiplication, which is fundamental to lattice-based cryptographic algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Kyber-a leading candidate in post-quantum cryptography (PQC). However, existing NTT accelerators often rely on integer multiplier-based modular reduction techniques, such as Barrett or Montgomery reduction, which introduce significant computational overhead and hardware resource consumption. These accelerators also lack optimization in unified architectures for forward (FNTT) and inverse (INTT) transformations. Addressing these research gaps, this paper introduces a novel, high-speed NTT accelerator tailored specifically for CRYSTALS-Kyber. The proposed design employs an innovative shift-add modular reduction mechanism, eliminating the need for integer multipliers, thereby reducing critical path delay and enhancing circuit frequency. A unified pipelined butterfly unit, capable of performing FNTT and INTT operations through Cooley-Tukey and Gentleman-Sande configurations, is integrated into the architecture. Additionally, a highly efficient data handling mechanism based on Register banks supports seamless memory access, ensuring continuous and parallel processing. The complete architecture, implemented in Verilog HDL, has been evaluated on FPGA platforms (Virtex-5, Virtex-6, and Virtex-7). Post place-and-route results demonstrate a maximum operating frequency of 261 MHz on Virtex-7, achieving a throughput of 290.69 Kbps-1.45x and 1.24x higher than its performance on Virtex-5 and Virtex-6, respectively. Furthermore, the design boasts an impressive throughput-per-slice metric of 111.63, underscoring its resource efficiency. With a 1.27x reduction in computation time compared to state-of-the-art single butterfly unit-based NTT accelerators, this work establishes a new benchmark in advancing secure and scalable cryptographic hardware solutions.

TI Shortcuts to adiabaticity in harmonic traps: A quantum-classical analog
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We present a technique for efficiently transitioning a quantum system from an initial to a final stationary state in less time than is required by an adiabatic (quasistatic) process. Our approach makes use of Nelson's stochastic quantization, which represents the quantum system as a classical Brownian process. Thanks to this mathematical analogy, known protocols for classical overdamped systems can be translated into quantum protocols. In particular, one can use classical methods to find optimal quantum protocols that minimize both the time duration and some other cost function to be freely specified. We have applied this method to the time-dependent harmonic oscillator and tested it on two different cost functions: (i) the cumulative energy of the system over time and (ii) the dynamical phase of the wave function. In the latter case, it is possible to construct protocols that are "adiabatically optimal," i.e., they minimize their distance from an adiabatic process for a given duration.

TI Spin Gapless Quantum Materials and Devices
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Quantum materials, with nontrivial quantum phenomena and mechanisms, promise efficient quantum technologies with enhanced functionalities. Quantum technology is held back because a gap between fundamental science and its implementation is not fully understood yet. In order to capitalize the quantum advantage, a new perspective is required to figure out and close this gap. In this review, spin gapless quantum materials, featured by fully spin-polarized bands and the electron/hole transport, are discussed from the perspective of fundamental understanding and device applications. Spin gapless quantum materials can be simulated by minimal two-band models and could help to understand band structure engineering in various topological quantum materials discovered so far. It is explicitly highlighted that various types of spin gapless band dispersion are fundamental ingredients to understand quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on conventional transport in the bulk and topological transport on the boundaries, various spintronic device aspects of spin gapless quantum materials as well as their advantages in different models for topological field effect transistors are reviewed.

TI Localized nitrogen-vacancy centers generated by low-repetition rate
   fs-laser pulses
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Among hundreds of impurities and defects in diamond, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most interesting to be used as a platform for quantum technologies and nanosensing. Traditionally, synthetic diamond is irradiated with high-energy electrons or nitrogen ions to generate these color-centers. For precise positioning of the NV centers, fs-laser irradiation has been proposed as an alternative approach to produce spatially localized NV centers in diamond. However, most of the studies reported so far used high-repetition rate fs-laser systems. Here, we studied the influence of the irradiation conditions on the generation of NV-. Specifically, we varied pulse fluence, laser focusing, and the number of pulses upon irradiation with 150 fs pulses at 775 nm from a Ti: sapphire laser amplifier operating at 1 kHz repetition rate. Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) was used to investigate the produced NV centers, revealing a sizeable zero-field splitting in the spectra and indicating the conditions in which the lattice strain produced in the ablation process may be deleterious for quantum in-formation applications.

TI Bayesian quantum parameter estimation with Gaussian states and homodyne
   measurements in a dissipative environment
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The deterioration of precision caused by quantum decoherence in dissipative environments is a longstanding problem in the development of quantum metrology. Therefore, it is significant to effectively analyze the evolution of quantum systems under dissipative environments and quantitatively estimate the parameters given a certain probe. Here, we propose a continuous-variable (CV) quantum metrology scheme within the Bayesian paradigm to estimate phase shift, loss coefficient and temperature of a dissipative environment. Through numerical evaluation and concrete analysis, we investigate the achievable precision of Bayesian quantum parameter estimation with Gaussian states and homodyne measurements, and the influence of different parameters on the estimation process. More interestingly, the scheme can be applied in more practical scenarios where not enough measurements are obtained and the frequentist analysis is not well defined.

TI Reversible spin-optical interface in luminescent organic radicals
SO NATURE
AB Molecules present a versatile platform for quantum information science(1,2) and are candidates for sensing and computation applications(3,4). Robust spin-optical interfaces are key to harnessing the quantum resources of materials(5). To date, carbon-based candidates have been non-luminescent(6,7), which prevents optical readout via emission. Here we report organic molecules showing both efficient luminescence and near-unity generation yield of excited states with spin multiplicity S > 1. This was achieved by designing an energy resonance between emissive doublet and triplet levels, here on covalently coupled tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) methyl-carbazole radicals and anthracene. We observed that the doublet photoexcitation delocalized onto the linked acene within a few picoseconds and subsequently evolved to a pure high-spin state (quartet for monoradical, quintet for biradical) of mixed radical-triplet character near 1.8 eV. These high-spin states are coherently addressable with microwaves even at 295 K, with optical readout enabled by reverse intersystem crossing to emissive states. Furthermore, for the biradical, on return to the ground state the previously uncorrelated radical spins either side of the anthracene shows strong spin correlation. Our approach simultaneously supports a high efficiency of initialization, spin manipulations and light-based readout at room temperature. The integration of luminescence and high-spin states creates an organic materials platform for emerging quantum technologies.

TI Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Characteristics of Graphitic Carbon
   Nitride Nanoribbons and Their Applications in Spintronics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The development of quantum information and quantum computing technology requires special materials to design and manufacture nanosized spintronic devices. Possessing remarkable structural, electronic, and magnetic characteristics, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) can be a promising candidate as a building block of futuristic nanoelectronics and spintronic systems. Here, using first-principles calculations, we perform a comprehensive study on the structural stability as well as electronic and magnetic properties of triazine-based g-C3N4 nanoribbons (gt-CNRs). Our calculations show that gt-CNRs with different edge conformation exhibit distinct electronic and magnetic characteristics, which can be tuned by the edge H-passivation rate. By investigating gt-CNRs with various possible edge configurations and H-termination rates, we show that while the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of gt-CNRs stays preserved for all of the studied configurations, half metallicity can only be achieved in nanoribbons with specific edge structure under full H-passivation rate. For spintronic application purposes, we also study spin-transport properties of half-metal gt-CNRs. By determining the suitable gt-CNR configuration, we show the possibility of developing a perfect gt-CNR-based spin filter with a spin filter efficiency (SFE) of 100%. Considering the above-mentioned notable electronic and magnetic characteristics as well as its high thermal stability, we show that gt-CNR would be a remarkable material to fabricate multifunctional spintronic devices.

TI SecureEdge-MedChain: A Post-Quantum Blockchain and Federated Learning
   Framework for Real-Time Predictive Diagnostics in IoMT
SO SENSORS
AB The burgeoning Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) offers unprecedented opportunities for real-time patient monitoring and predictive diagnostics, yet the current systems struggle with scalability, data confidentiality against quantum threats, and real-time privacy-preserving intelligence. This paper introduces Med-Q Ledger, a novel, multi-layered framework designed to overcome these critical limitations in the Medical IoT domain. Med-Q Ledger integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric for transactional integrity with a scalable Holochain Distributed Hash Table for high-volume telemetry, achieving horizontal scalability and sub-second commit times. To fortify long-term data security, the framework incorporates post-quantum cryptography (PQC), specifically CRYSTALS-Di lithium signatures and Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanisms. Real-time, privacy-preserving intelligence is delivered through an edge-based federated learning (FL) model, utilizing lightweight autoencoders for anomaly detection on encrypted gradients. We validate Med-Q Ledger's efficacy through a critical application: the prediction of intestinal complications like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants, a condition frequently necessitating emergency colostomy. By processing physiological data from maternal wearable sensors and infant intestinal images, our integrated Random Forest model demonstrates superior performance in predicting colostomy necessity. Experimental evaluations reveal a throughput of approximately 3400 transactions per second (TPS) with similar to 180 ms end-to-end latency, a >95% anomaly detection rate with <2% false positives, and an 11% computational overhead for PQC on resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, our results show a 0.90 F1-score for colostomy prediction, a 25% reduction in emergency surgeries, and 31% lower energy consumption compared to MQTT baselines. Med-Q Ledger sets a new benchmark for secure, high-performance, and privacy-preserving IoMT analytics, offering a robust blueprint for next-generation healthcare deployments.

TI Vectorized Implementation of Kyber and Dilithium on 32-bit Cortex-A
   Series
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), which typically demands more memory and relatively lower performance compared to Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), recent studies have been actively focused on neon-based parallel implementations for the 64-bit ARMv8-based Cortex-A series. However, research into implementing PQC on the widely adopted 32-bit ARMv7-based Cortex-A series remains insufficient. In this paper, we present the first instance of optimized implementation of Crystals-Kyber and Crystals-Dilithium, a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) selected by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for standardization, on a 32-bit ARMv7-based Cortex-A device. For computational efficiency, we finely tune widely used signed Montgomery multiplication and Barrett multiplication methods to take full advantage of the computational capabilities of NEON engine, a kind of Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) extension, available on the target device. Particularly, we propose improvements to internal parameters and operational techniques in Montgomery and Barrett arithmetic to preserve parallel processing logic. Moreover, we present an optimized merging technique tailored for the NEON engine of ARMv7, aimed at accelerating Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplication. Compared to the state-of-the-art codes of PQM4, our approach achieves significant performance enhancements in Kyber and Dilithium: 62% (54%) for NTT, 50% (62%) for Point multiplication, and 56% (55%) for inverse NTT (NTT-1). Regarding the complete schemes, our implementations outperform the vectorized reference implementations, showing improvements of 50% (14%) in Key Generation, 43% (41%) in Encapsulation (Signing), and 52% (21%) in Decapsulation (Verifying) processes for Kyber768 (Dilithium3), respectively.

TI Tuning the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in
   multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier, are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference phi between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusoidal and 2 pi periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have nonsinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2 pi periodic. We show here that a multiterminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with four superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2 pi and 4 pi periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2 pi or 4 pi periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity electro-optic modulation for
   advanced pulse-comb synthesis
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However, the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning. Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold enhancement in cavity EO comb flatness by exploring the synergistic effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries. Our findings push cavity EO modulation into a new frontier, unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable EO frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.

TI Photoexcitation and recombination processes of the neutral
   nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond from first principles
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) complex in diamond is one of the most prominent solid state defects as the negatively charged NV defect (NV-) is a leading contender for quantum technologies. In quantum information processing applications, NV- is photoexcited that often leads to photoionization to neutral NV defect, NV0, and re-ionization back to NV- should occur to control the S=1 spin of NV-. As a consequence, understanding the photophysics of NV0 is crucial for controlling NV-. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the S=1/2 electron spin of NV0 can also be initialized and read out at certain conditions that turns single NV0 a potential quantum bit. Quantum optics protocols rest on detailed knowledge on the electronic structure of the given system, which is obviously missing for NV0 in diamond. In this study, we combine the group theory and density functional theory calculations toward exploring the nature of the ground and excited states of NV0. We show that the effective three-electron system of NV0 leads to high correlation effects that make this system very challenging for ab initio simulations. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Contextuality-by-Default Description of Bell Tests: Contextuality as the
   Rule and Not as an Exception
SO ENTROPY
AB Contextuality and entanglement are valuable resources for quantum computing and quantum information. Bell inequalities are used to certify entanglement; thus, it is important to understand why and how they are violated. Quantum mechanics and behavioural sciences teach us that random variables 'measuring' the same content (the answer to the same Yes or No question) may vary, if 'measured' jointly with other random variables. Alice's and BoB ' s raw data confirm Einsteinian non-signaling, but setting dependent experimental protocols are used to create samples of coupled pairs of distant +/- 1 outcomes and to estimate correlations. Marginal expectations, estimated using these final samples, depend on distant settings. Therefore, a system of random variables 'measured' in Bell tests is inconsistently connected and it should be analyzed using a Contextuality-by-Default approach, what is done for the first time in this paper. The violation of Bell inequalities and inconsistent connectedness may be explained using a contextual locally causal probabilistic model in which setting dependent variables describing measuring instruments are correctly incorporated. We prove that this model does not restrict experimenters' freedom of choice which is a prerequisite of science. Contextuality seems to be the rule and not an exception; thus, it should be carefully tested.

TI Dyson maps and unitary evolution for Maxwell equations in tensor
   dielectric media
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in dielectric media is of theoretical and experimental interest in a wide variety of fields. An understanding of observational results generally requires a numerical solution of Maxwell equations-usually implemented on conventional computers using sophisticated numerical algorithms. In recent years, advances in quantum information science and in the development of quantum computers have piqued curiosity about taking advantage of these resources for an alternate numerical approach to Maxwell equations. This requires a reformulation of the classical Maxwell equations into a form suitable for quantum computers which, unlike conventional computers, are limited to unitary operations. In this paper, a unitary framework is developed for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a spatially inhomogeneous, passive, nondispersive, and anisotropic dielectric medium. For such a medium, generally, the evolution operator in the combined Faraday-Ampere equations is not unitary. There are two steps needed to convert this equation into a unitary evolution equation. In the first step, a weighted Hilbert space is formulated in which the generator of dynamics is a pseudo-Hermitian operator. In the second step, a Dyson map is constructed which maps the weighted-physical-Hilbert space to the original Hilbert space. The resulting evolution equation for the electromagnetic wave fields is unitary. Utilizing the framework developed in these steps, a unitary evolution equation is derived for electromagnetic wave propagation in a uniaxial dielectric medium. The resulting form is suitable for quantum computing.

TI The dominant eigenvector of a noisy quantum state
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Although near-term quantum devices have no comprehensive solution for correcting errors, numerous techniques have been proposed for achieving practical value. Two works have recently introduced the very promising error suppression by derangements (ESD) and virtual distillation (VD) techniques. The approach exponentially suppresses errors and ultimately allows one to measure expectation values in the pure state as the dominant eigenvector of the noisy quantum state. Interestingly this dominant eigenvector is, however, different than the ideal computational state and it is the aim of the present work to comprehensively explore the following fundamental question: how significantly different are these two pure states? The motivation for this work is two-fold. First, comprehensively understanding the effect of this coherent mismatch is of fundamental importance for the successful exploitation of noisy quantum devices. As such, the present work rigorously establishes that in practically relevant scenarios the coherent mismatch is exponentially less severe than the incoherent decay of the fidelity-where the latter can be suppressed exponentially via the ESD/VD technique. Second, the above question is closely related to central problems in mathematics, such as bounding eigenvalues of a sum of two matrices (Weyl inequalities)-solving of which was a major breakthrough. The present work can be viewed as a first step towards extending the Weyl inequalities to eigenvectors of a sum of two matrices-and completely resolves this problem for the special case of the considered density matrices.

TI Experimental study on the quantum search algorithm over structured
   datasets using IBMQ experience
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In this work, a quantum search algorithm over structured datasets is proposed. Subsequently, the algo-rithm is executed on a real chip quantum computer developed by IBM Quantum experience (IBMQ). QISKit, the software platform developed by IBM, is used for the implementation of this algorithm. Quantum interference, quantum superposition, and p phase shift of the quantum state are applied in the proposed search algorithm. It performs a p phase shift on the initial state and conducts a state elim-ination and amplitude amplification process to reach the 'search key' or 'solution key' from the given structured dataset. The proposed quantum algorithm is executed using the QISKit SDK local backend 'local_qasm_simulator', real chip 'ibmq_16_melbourne', 'ibmq_belem' and 'ibmqx40 IBMQ. The results suggest that the real chipibmq_16_melbourne is more quantum error-or noise-prone than ibmq_belem and ibmqx4. The correctness, validation, and application using the proposed algorithm are demonstrated. The algorithm is very promising in terms of low quantum cost and fewer gate requirements. This implies that the proposed quantum search algorithm may be a compelling and pertinent choice in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology era. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI Matrix product operator symmetries and intertwiners in string-nets with
   domain walls
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We provide a description of virtual non-local matrix product operator (MPO) symmetries in projected entangled pair state (PEPS) representations of string-net models. Given such a PEPS representation, we show that the consistency conditions of its MPO symmetries amount to a set of six coupled equations that can be identified with the pentagon equations of a bimodule category. This allows us to classify all equivalent PEPS representations and build MPO intertwiners between them, synthesising and generalising the wide variety of tensor network representations of topological phases. Furthermore, we use this generalisation to build explicit PEPS realisations of domain walls between different topological phases as constructed by Kitaev and Kong [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373]. While the prevailing abstract categorical approach is sufficient to describe the structure of topological phases, explicit tensor network representations are required to simulate these systems on a computer, such as needed for calculating thresholds of quantum error-correcting codes based on string-nets with boundaries. Finally, we show that all these string-net PEPS representations can be understood as specific instances of Turaev-Viro state-sum models of topological field theory on three-manifolds with a physical boundary, thereby putting these tensor network constructions on a mathematically rigorous footing.

TI Spin memory effect in charged single telecom quantum dots
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single InP-based quantum dots emitting in the third telecom window are probed quasi-resonantly in polarization-resolved microphotoluminescence experiments. For charged quantum dots we observe negative circular polarization being a fingerprint of the optical spin writing of the carriers within the quantum dots. The investigated quantum dots have a very dense ladder of excited states providing relatively easy quasi-resonant optical excitation, and together with telecom wavelengths emission they bring quantum gates and memories closer to compatibility with fiber-optic communication.

TI Singlet Fission in Push-Pull Para-Azaquinodimethane Films under
   the Gaze of Time Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopy
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB In this study, a totally green synthetic protocol was employed to obtain four new donor-acceptor-donor para-azaquinodimethane (pAQM) derivatives to uncover the effect of tuning the push-pull character on their photobehaviour in solution as well as in thin film and in particular on their capability of undergoing singlet fission (SF). The bisthiophene and substituted benzene were used as electron-donor groups at opposite sides of the pAQM electron-acceptor core in asymmetric structures (AsOMe and AsNMe2), whereas different 5-phenyl thiophene moieties were symmetrically linked to the pAQM core in TPh and TPhOMe. The photoinduced excited state dynamics was investigated in a synergic effort by employing both time resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, with the aid of TD-DFT calculations. Our femtosecond transient absorption results showed that intermolecular SF is enabled in the solid state aggregates of these compounds: the fastest and most efficient SF was revealed for the structure with the strongest push-pull degree (AsNMe2). The other asymmetric molecule (AsOMe) interestingly exhibited higher energetic SF-generated triplet excitons (1.3 eV) than literature SF-materials, as demonstrated by the nanosecond transient absorption sensitization experiments, with possible intriguing implications toward silicon matched SF photovoltaics. Time resolved EPR measurements unveiled the spectral signature of the quintet multiexciton intermediate 5(TT) in the pAQM thin films for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, for such unconventional SF materials. The high-spin photoinduced 5(TT) appears to be a promising candidate for Quantum Information Science and technologies as a viable molecular spin qudit.

TI Nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the two-dimensional ±J Ising
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The +/- J Ising model is a simple frustrated spin model, where the exchange couplings independently take the discrete value -J with probability p and +J with probability 1 - p. It is especially appealing due to its connection to quantum error correcting codes. Here, we investigate the nonequilibrium critical behavior of the two-dimensional +/- J Ising model, after a quench from different initial conditions to a critical point T-c(p) on the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic (PF) transition line, especially above, below, and at the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). The dynamical critical exponent z(c) seems to exhibit nonuniversal behavior for quenches above and below the NP, which is identified as a preasymptotic feature due to the repulsive fixed point at the NP, whereas for a quench directly to the NP, the dynamics reaches the asymptotic regime with z(c) similar or equal to 6.02(6). We also consider the geometrical spin clusters (of like spin signs) during the critical dynamics. Each universality class on the PF line is uniquely characterized by the stochastic Loewner evolution with corresponding parameter kappa. Moreover, for the critical quenches from the paramagnetic phase, the model, irrespective of the frustration, exhibits an emergent critical percolation topology at the large length scales.

TI A Framework for Improving the Performance of QKDN using Machine Learning
   Approach
SO ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
   JOURNAL
AB Quantum A reliable secure communication can be given between two remote parties by key sharing, quantum key distribution (QKD) is widely concentrated as the information in QKD is safeguarded by the laws of quantum physics. There are many techniques that deal with quantum key distribution network (QKDN), however, only few of them use machine learning (ML) and soft computing techniques to improve QKDN. ML can analyze data and improve itself through model training without having to be programmed manually. There has been a lot of progress in both the hardware and software of ML technologies. Given ML's advantageous features, it can help improve and resolve issues in QKDN, facilitating its commercialization. The proposed work provides a detailed understanding of role of each layer of QKDN, addressing the limitations of each layer, and suggesting a framework to improve the performance metrics for various applications of QKDN by applying machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine and decision tree algorithms.

TI Diagnostics of quantum-gate coherences deteriorated by unitary errors
   via end-point-measurement statistics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum coherence is a central ingredient in quantum physics with several theoretical and technological ramifications. We consider a figure of merit encoding the information on how the coherence generated on average by a quantum gate is affected by unitary errors (coherent noise sources) in the form of rotation-angle and rotation-axis errors. We provide numerical evidences that such information is well captured by the statistics of local energy measurements on the output states of the gate. These findings are then corroborated by experimental data taken in a quantum optics setting.

TI High Sensitivity Spin Defects in Carbon Implanted Diamond
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB The TR12 color center in diamond is a self-interstitial spin defect capable of room-temperature atomic-scale vector magnetometry for detecting magnetic fields of arbitrary orientation and magnitude. Measurements using the TR12 center show that the sensing dynamic range can potentially outperform that of NV centers in diamond. The powerful quantum sensing capabilities of TR12 place it as a strong alternative candidate for quantum sensing in diamond, especially in extreme magnetic fields. However, its sensitivity in existing literature is relatively low in the mu T/root Hz range. This work examines the spatial distributions of TR12 centers fabricated by high-energy carbon irradiation on an E-grade diamond along the ion irradiation cascade. A detailed study of photoluminescence intensity, optically detected magnetic resonance contrast, and linewidth is conducted. By varying locations along ion cascades of line irradiations with different fluences, the highest sensitivity of 1.2 nT/root Hz is achieved at three orders of magnitude higher than demonstrated in existing literatures. Coherent manipulation of triplet spin states in these ensembles is evident from Rabi oscillation measurements, with decoherence times of approximate to 0.47 mu s at the surface and approximate to 0.42 mu s at the end-of-range. These findings significantly enhance the potential of TR12 for quantum sensing applications.

TI Live cell quantum multiphysiology enabled by a manipulable single
   nanodiamond
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The patch-clamp technique provides direct insight into electrophysiology. However, probing multiphysiology such as local temperature and electromagnetic field dynamics within a single live cell remains a challenge. Here we report live cell quantum multiphysiology using a manipulable-single-nanodiamond-based electron spin sensor. By electrically trapping and integrating a single nanodiamond onto a glass nanopipette, we achieve its 3D manipulation within a single live cell. This enables the first nanoscale controlled live cell quantum sensing of multiphysiology signals under native conditions, providing direct insight into localized intracellular activities. Our observations reveal a spatial heterogeneity in temperature over different sites within a single cell, indicative of local activity-induced heat production. Furthermore, temporally resolved relaxation measurements effectively capture the intracellular free-radical-mediated local electro-magnetic noise dynamics. We find a number of unexpected fluctuation phenomena of electromagnetic noise that may directly represent different types of intracellular free radical generation dynamics. Live cell quantum multiphysiology bridges the gap between high-physical-sensitivity-quantum sensing with high-spatiotemporal-resolution live cell measurements, opening up a new avenue for accessing cellular function with unprecedented capabilities.
   As an analogy to 'Patch clamp' techniques, the authors developed a 'quantum patch clamp' technique based on manipulating a single nanodiamond for performing quantum multiphysiology inside a single live cell.

TI Quantum Metrology in the Finite-Sample Regime
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In quantum metrology, a major application of quantum technologies, the ultimate precision of estimating an unknown parameter is often stated in terms of the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. Yet, the latter fails to completely characterize the distribution of estimates in the nonasymptotic regime. Optimizing metrology protocols with respect to the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound can therefore lead to surprisingly poor finite-sample performance. This can be avoided by quantifying the quality of a metrology protocol by the probability of obtaining an estimate with a given accuracy. Using this intrinsically single-shot quantity naturally accommodates the finite-sample regime. We show that the fundamental limits of this figure of merit can be quantified through a multihypothesis testing problem between quantum states. Building on this connection, we derive an analogue of the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound that contains explicit corrections relevant to the finite-sample regime. We apply the finite-sample metrology framework to the example task of phase estimation with an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles, giving unambiguous evidence that large quantum Fisher information does not guarantee that a metrology protocol has a good finite-sample performance. Overall, analyzing the probability of success allows the reliable study of quantum metrology in the finite-sample regime and opens up a plethora of new avenues for research at the interface of quantum information theory and quantum metrology.

TI Storage and retrieval of solitons in electromagnetically induced
   transparent system of V-type three-level diamond nitrogen-vacancy color
   centers
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Compared with light, the solitons, which are from the balance between dispersion and nonlinearity of the system, possess high stability and fidelity as the information carries in quantum information processing and transmission, and have gained considerable attention in ultra-cold atomic electromagnetically induced transparent (EIT) media. To date, the EIT models on the three-level ultra-cold atoms realized experimentally, are ladder-, Lambda-, and V-type mode. Current studies show that the solitons cannot be stored in V-type three-level ultra-cold atomic EIT media but they can be stored in ladder- and Lambda-type three-level ultra-cold atomic EIT media. It is mainly because the atoms of the V-type system initially are in a excited state, while the atoms of the ladder- and Lambda-type systems initially are in the ground state. For the practical applications, it is a large challenge to control accurately the solitons stored in the ultra-cold atomic EIT media due to their ultralow temperature and rarefaction. Fortunately, with the maturity of semiconductor quantum technology, quantum dots have extensively application prospect in quantum information processing and transmission. However, the solitons cannot be stored in V-type three level InAs/GaAs quantum dot EIT media either, while it can be stored in ladder-type system and Lambda-type system.
   Therefore, herein we propose a V-type three-level nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center EIT model in which a weakprobe field and a strong control field are coupled to different energy levels of NV center in diamond. Subsequently, the linear and nonlinear properties of system are studied by using semiclassical theory combined with multi-scale method. It is shown that when control field is turned on, the linear absorption curve of the system presents an EIT window. And the width of the EIT window increases with the strength of magnetic induction of the control field increasing. In the nonlinear case, the solitons formed can stably propagate over a long distance. Interestingly, the solitons can be stored and retrieved by switching off and on the magnetic field of control field. Moreover, the amplitude of the stored solitons can be modulated by the magnetic induction strength of control field. This result indicates that solitons as information carriers in quantum information processing and transmission of NV center can greatly improve the fidelity of information processing.

TI Intravital microscopic thermometry of rat mammary epithelium by
   fluorescent nanodiamond
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Quantum sensing using the fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) nitrogen-vacancy center enables physical/chemical measurements of the microenvironment, although application of such measurements in living mammals poses significant challenges due to the unknown biodistribution and toxicity of FNDs, the limited penetration of visible light for quantum state manipulation/measurement, and interference from physiological motion. Here, we describe a microenvironmental thermometry technique using FNDs in rat mammary epithelium, an important model for mammary gland biology and breast cancer research. FNDs were injected directly into the mammary gland. Microscopic observation of mammary tissue sections showed that most FNDs remained in the mammary epithelium for at least 8 weeks. Pathological examination indicated no obvious change in tissue morphology, suggesting negligible toxicity. Optical excitation and detection were performed through a skin incision. Periodic movements due to respiration and heartbeat were mitigated by frequency filtering of the signal. Based on these methods, we successfully detected temperature elevation in the mammary epithelium associated with lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, demonstrating the sensitivity and relevance of the technique in biological contexts. This study lays the groundwork for expanding the applicability of quantum sensing in biomedical research, providing a tool for real-time monitoring of physiological and pathological processes.
   This study reports an application of microscopic thermometry in a living rat using quantum sensing based on the fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) nitrogen-vacancy center, demonstrating the relevance of the technique in biomedical research using a mammal.

TI Image Encryption Using Quantum 3D Mobius Scrambling and 3D Hyper-Chaotic
   Henon Map
SO ENTROPY
AB In encryption technology, image scrambling is a common processing operation. This paper proposes a quantum version of the 3D Mobius scrambling transform based on the QRCI model, which changes not only the position of pixels but also the gray values. The corresponding quantum circuits are devised. Furthermore, an encryption scheme combining the quantum 3D Mobius transform with the 3D hyper-chaotic Henon map is suggested to protect the security of image information. To facilitate subsequent processing, the RGB color image is first represented with QRCI. Then, to achieve the pixel-level permutation effect, the quantum 3D Mobius transform is applied to scramble bit-planes and pixel positions. Ultimately, to increase the diffusion effect, the scrambled image is XORed with a key image created by the 3D hyper-chaotic Henon map to produce the encrypted image. Numerical simulations and result analyses indicate that our designed encryption scheme is secure and reliable. It offers better performance in the aspect of key space, histogram variance, and correlation coefficient than some of the latest algorithms.

TI Hidden variables, free choice, context-independence and all that
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB This paper provides a systematic account of the hidden variable models (HVMs) formulated to describe systems of random variables with mutually exclusive contexts. Any such system can be described either by a model with free choice but generally context-dependent mapping of the hidden variables into observable ones, or by a model with context-independent mapping but generally compromised free choice. These two types of HVMs are equivalent, one can always be translated into another. They are also unfalsifiable, applicable to all possible systems. These facts, the equivalence and unfalsifiability, imply that freedom of choice and context-independent mapping are no assumptions at all, and they tell us nothing about freedom of choice or physical influences exerted by contexts as these notions would be understood in science and philosophy. The conjunction of these two notions, however, defines a falsifiable HVM that describes non-contextuality when applied to systems with no disturbance or to consistifications of arbitrary systems. This HVM is most adequately captured by the term 'context-irrelevance', meaning that no distribution in the model changes with context.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice'.

TI Causal and compositional structure of unitary transformations
SO QUANTUM
AB The causal structure of a unitary transformation is the set of relations of possible influence between any input subsystem and any output subsystem. We study whether such causal structure can be understood in terms of compositional structure of the unitary. Given a quantum circuit with no path from input system A to output system B, system A cannot influence system B. Conversely, given a unitary U with a no-influence relation from input A to output B, it follows from [B. Schumacher and M. D. Westmoreland, Quantum Information Processing 4 no. 1, (Feb, 2005)] that there exists a circuit decomposition of U with no path from A to B. However, as we argue, there are unitaries for which there does not exist a circuit decomposition that makes all causal constraints evident simultaneously. To address this, we introduce a new formalism of 'extended circuit diagrams', which goes beyond what is expressible with quantum circuits, with the core new feature being the ability to represent direct sum structures in addition to sequential and tensor product composition. A causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, representing a unitary U, is then one for which there is a path from an input A to an output B if and only if there actually is influence from A to B in U. We derive causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for a large class of unitaries, where in each case, the decomposition is implied by the unitary's respective causal structure. We hypothesize that every finite-dimensional unitary transformation has a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition.

TI Analysis of the NTRU Post-Quantum Cryptographic Scheme in Constrained
   IoT Edge Devices
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Research on post-quantum cryptography aims to solve the problematic of modern public-key cryptography being broken by attacks coming from quantum computers in the future and, moreover, by using classical electronics. This task is so critical that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the final process of standardizing post-quantum schemes for the future protection of embedded applications. Though there are some research work done on embedded systems, it is important to study the impact of these proposals in realistic environments for the Internet of Things (IoT), where the limited computational resources and the strict requirements for power consumption can become incompatible with the usage of cryptographic schemes. In this work, the performance of one of the finalists of the standardization process called NTRU is studied and implemented in a custom wireless sensor node designed for applications in the extreme edge of the IoT. The cryptosystem is implemented and evaluated within the processes of the Contiki-NG operating system. Furthermore, additional experiments are performed to check if commonly integrated hardware peripherals for cryptography inside modern microcontrollers can be used to achieve better performance with NTRU, not only at the single node level but also at the network level, where the NTRU key encapsulation mechanism is tested in a real communication process. The results derived from these experiments show that NTRU is suitable for modern microcontrollers targeting wireless sensor networks design, while old devices present in popular platforms might not afford the cost of its implementation.

TI Parametric phase modulation in superconducting circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Parametric modulation, valued for its versatility, is widely employed in superconducting circuits for quantum simulations and high-fidelity two-qubit gates. Conventionally, the qubit coupling strength is determined by the amplitude of the parametric flux pulse, which affects the qubit parameters dramatically. In this paper, we propose and implement a phase-modulation scheme to tune the interaction strength via adjustment of the relative phase between the parametric flux pulses applied to two coupled qubits. We characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and off-sweet spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths, as confirmed by both population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.

TI High-Performance Unified Hardware Architecture for ML-DSA and ML-KEM PQC
   Standards
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In response to the advent of quantum computers, which pose significant threats to traditional cryptographic systems, NIST announced the quantum-resistant Module Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Digital Signature (ML-DSA) standards in August 2024. While prior studies have proposed hardware designs to accelerate either ML-KEM or ML-DSA individually, a unified architecture supporting all requirements of both schemes remains lacking. Leveraging the shared lattice-based cryptographic structures of ML-KEM and ML-DSA, this paper proposes a novel, high-performance architecture that supports all phases of both standards. The design allows flexible switching between operation modes and security levels at runtime, providing versatility and user-friendliness. Based on a long-term analysis of both cryptosystem theories, we propose optimizations in unified components, with specific configurations that execute both schemes efficiently in hardware while reducing redundant resource utilization from overlapping tasks. The timing diagram is carefully arranged to maximize concurrency, allowing the architecture to deploy multiple tasks in parallel, thereby addressing performance bottlenecks commonly seen in asymmetric cryptosystems. Moreover, we integrate several efficient countermeasure techniques to mitigate side-channel attack vulnerabilities in the hardware implementation. The proposed architecture is validated through implementation on Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA platform, demonstrating optimal execution times for each main algorithm in both post-quantum cryptography standards. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, our implementation exhibits superior performance and efficiency, as evaluated by the area-time product metric, as well as solves problems arising from outdated standards in previous studies.

TI 3D-CONTAINER LOADING PROBLEM WITH A DISTRIBUTION PLAN BASED ON HYBRID
   QUANTUM GENETIC ALGORITHM
SO ECONOMIC COMPUTATION AND ECONOMIC CYBERNETICS STUDIES AND RESEARCH
AB This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model of a three dimensional container loading problem(3D-CLP) considering the distribution plan and designs its hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA). The purpose of the model is to maximize the rate of space utilization and to adjust the loading structure through simple parameter initialization. A hybrid algorithm is put forward based on a quantum genetic algorithm, and spaces depict strategy based on the surfaces. For this reason, the algorithm introduced in this paper proposed a new quantum coding pattern. Compared to the traditional evolutionary algorithm, the quantum genetic algorithm has more powerful capacity in traversal search. Finally, an actual numerical experiment and a comparison test were illustrated to verify the efficient and stable performance of the proposed algorithm. The results have shown that the solution has a satisfactory, stable, compact effect and an adjustable loading structure.

TI Improved Tomographic Estimates by Specialized Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Characterization of quantum objects, being states, processes, or measurements, complemented by previous knowledge about them is a valuable approach, especially as it leads to routine procedures for real-life components. To this end, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated to successfully operate in presence of noise, especially for estimating specific physical parameters. Here, it is shown that a neural network (NN) can improve the tomographic estimate of parameters by including a convolutional stage. This technique is applied to quantum process tomography for the characterization of several quantum channels. A stable and reliable operation is demonstrated that is achievable by training the network only with simulated data. The obtained results show the viability of this approach as an effective tool based on a completely new paradigm for the employment of NNs operating on classical data produced by quantum systems.

TI Entanglement transmission due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We revisited the effectiveness of state and entanglement transmission through a spin-chain-based quantum channel while altering the system parameters and the channel's initial state. Our research is focused on the spin-1/2 XX chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the aim is to measure entanglement dynamics between different part of the chain. The speed of entanglement propagation is utilized to probe the evolution of the system via three scenarios: (i) pure Heisenberg interaction, (ii) pure DM interaction, and (iii) collaboration of both types of couplings. To accomplish this, we employ the fermionization approach to obtain an exact solution to the problem. Aside from investigating the influence of magnetic interaction type on entanglement transfer, the effect of selecting the initial state has also been studied. As a result, we discovered that the phase factor regulating the system's initial state induces sharp drops in the propagation speed of entanglement. We also showed how to predict the location of these dramatic drops using the language of wave interference. In addition, the fastest transmission occurs at a special value of the phase factor in which the highest amount of entanglement reaches the system's different pairs. On the other hand, we observe a continuous and flat range of this factor in which the least amount of entanglement is transmitted and for them we have a sharp drop in the speed profile.

TI IPCC7: Post-Quantum Encryption Scheme Based on a Perfect Dominating Set
   in 3-Regular Graph
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has been actively explored to meet the requirements arising with the rapid development of quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a competition to establish the next-generation cryptographic standards. While previous competitions selected a single cryptographic standard, this competition aimed to standardize several algorithms based on various mathematical problems since the security of PQC has not been studied as extensively as that of legacy cryptosystems. The recent exclusion of the isogeny-based key-establishment algorithm, SIKE, from the competition emphasizes the necessity of exploring cryptographic algorithms based on various fundamental problems. In this study, we propose the Improved Perfect Code Cryptosystem 7 (IPCC7), a new post-quantum encryption scheme, as an improved version of the perfect code cryptosystem (PCC) based on combinatorics conceptualized by Koblitz. The security of our cryptosystem relies on the intractability of finding the perfect dominating set in a given graph. A PCC proposed previously by Koblitz did not receive much attention because of its low efficiency for handling higher-order polynomials. To overcome these drawbacks, we used the product of low-degree polynomials and demonstrated the feasibility of a graph-based encryption scheme. IPCC7 has some limitations for use as a general-purpose PQC. However, considering its relatively small key size (768 bytes public-key and 64 bytes secret key), fast decryption speed (2.0 Gbps), and usable encryption speed (8.6Mbps), IPCC7 is particularly suitable for environments with low-memory constraints, such as white-box encryptions.

AB Post-Quantum cryptography (PQC), in the past few years, constitutes the main driving force of the quantum resistance transition for security primitives, protocols and tools. TLS is one of the widely used security protocols that needs to be made quantum safe. However, PQC algorithms integration into TLS introduce various implementation overheads compared to traditional TLS that in battery powered embedded devices with constrained resources, cannot be overlooked. While there exist several works, evaluating the PQ TLS execution time overhead in embedded systems there are only a few that explore the PQ TLS energy consumption cost. In this paper, a thorough power/energy consumption evaluation and analysis of PQ TLS 1.3 on embedded systems has been made. A WolfSSL PQ TLS 1.3 custom implementation is used that integrates all the NIST PQC algorithms selected for standardisation as well as 2 out of 3 of those evaluated in NIST Round 4. Also 1 out of 2 of the BSI recommendations have been included. The PQ TLS 1.3 with the various PQC algorithms is deployed in a STM Nucleo evaluation board under a mutual and a unilateral client-server authentication scenario. The power and energy consumption collected results are analyzed in detail. The performed comparisons and overall analysis provide very interesting results indicating that the choice of the PQC algorithms in TLS 1.3 to be deployed on an embedded system may be very different depending on the device use as an authenticated or not authenticated, client or server. Also, the results indicate that in some cases, PQ TLS 1.3 implementations can be equally or more energy consumption efficient compared to traditional TLS 1.3.

TI Tighter uncertainty relations based on Wigner-Yanase skew information

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Uncertainty principle is the basis of quantum mechanics. It reflects the basic law of the movement of microscopic particles. Wigner-Yanase skew information, as a measure of quantum uncertainties, is used to characterize the intrinsic features of the state and the observable. In this paper, we mainly investigate the sum uncertainty relations for both quantum mechanical observables and quantum channels based on skew information. We establish a new uncertainty relation in terms of skew information for n observables, which is saturated (thus it holds as equality) for two incompatible observables. We also present two uncertainty relations for arbitrary finite N quantum channels by using skew information. Our uncertainty relations have tighter lower bounds than the existing ones. Detailed examples are provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Trace Class Operators via OPV-Frames
SO FILOMAT
AB Trace class operators for quaternionic Hilbert spaces (QHS) were studied by Moretti and Oppio [18]. In this paper, we study trace class operators via operator valued frames (OPV-frames). We introduce OPV-frames in a right quaternionic Hilbert space H with range in a two sided quaternionic Hilbert space K and obtain various results including several characterizations of OPV-frames. Also, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a bounded operator on a right QHS to be a trace class operator which generalizes a similar result by Attal [2]. Moreover, we construct a trace class operator on a two sided QHS. Finally, we study quaternionic quantum channels as completely positive trace preserving maps and obtain various Choi-Kraus type representations of quaternionic quantum channels using OPV-frames in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

It is also shown that a corresponding acousto-optic cell with a shear acoustic wave propagating in a vitreous medium can be used as a NOT or CNOT gate. The advantage of our method is a possibility for spatial manipulation by qubits via acousto-optic diffraction under condition of changing frequency of the acoustic wave.

AB Silicon photonics has found a profound place among emerging technologies in the past few decades due to several advantages. Due to a series of breakthroughs and increased funding from private and government sectors, the development of silicon photonics has accelerated especially starting from the two years 2004-2005 with a persisting and ever-growing momentum. Among various components, the silicon photonic filters that selectively pass or block particular wavelengths with a finite bandwidth have found particular interest as they are useful in signal processing in different fields ranging from optical communication to microwave photonics and quantum photonics.

TI Security and Privacy Issues and Solutions for UAVs in B5G Networks: A
   Review
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond 5G (B5G) are crucial for revolutionizing various industries, including surveillance, agriculture, and logistics, by enabling high-speed data transfer, ultra-low latency communication, and ultra-reliable connectivity. However, integrating UAVs into B5G networks poses various security and privacy concerns. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks which jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Moreover, UAVs in B5G networks are also at high risk from the application of machine learning (ML)-based attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial manipulation, data poisoning and model evasion techniques, which can compromise the integrity of UAV operations, lead to navigation errors, and expose sensitive data collected by UAVs. Considering the aforementioned security and privacy concerns, this review article presents emerging security and privacy solutions for UAVs in B5G networks. Firstly, We introduce the essential background of integrating UAVs into B5G networks and discuss the advantages and security challenges which the emerging integrated network architecture have. Then, we proceed to analyze and examine the security and privacy landscape by including threats and requirements of UAVs in B5G networks. Based on these threats and requirements, solutions from physical layer security (PLS), blockchain (BC), federated learning (FL) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are discussed and explored in details. Moreover, potential future research directions are discussed in details as open research issues.

TI Efficient Hardware Implementation of the LEDAcrypt Decoder
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This work describes an efficient implementation of the iterative decoder that is the main part of the decryption stage in the LEDAcrypt cryptosystem, recently proposed for post-quantum cryptography based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The implementation we present exploits the structure of the variables in order to accelerate the decoding process while keeping the area bounded. In particular, our focus is on the design of an efficient multiplier, the latter being a fundamental component also in view of considering different values of the cryptosystem's parameters, as it might be required in future applications. We aim to provide an architecture suitable for low cost implementation on both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementations. As for the FPGA, the total execution time is 0.6 ms on the Artix-7 200 platform, employing at most 30% of the total available memory, 15% of the total available Look-up Tables and 3% of the Flip-Flops. The ASIC synthesis has been performed for both STM FDSOI 28 nm and UMC CMOS 65 nm technologies. After logic synthesis with the STM FDSOI 28 nm, the proposed decoder achieves a total latency of 0.15 ms and an area occupation of 0.09 mm(2). The post-Place&Route implementation results for the UMC 65 nm show a total execution time of 0.3 ms, with an area occupation of 0.42 mm(2) and a power consumption of at most 10.5 mW.

TI In-situ phase control of a low-loss membrane-based lithium-niobate
   polarisation-state modulator
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB We report on lithium niobate intermediate-thin films with reduced energy-manufacturing costs for manufacturing low-loss electro-optic components. A micrometer-thick membrane surrounded with tapers is inscribed in a single step by smoothly dicing the bottom face of a stan-dard LiNbO3 electro-optic modulator. Hence, we demonstrate a freestanding polarisation-state modulator with insertion losses as low as 2.6 dB. The in-situ structuring of the membrane allows a giant phase control extending over 40 degrees. These developments open the way to a new generation of membrane-based electro-optic devices with low manufacturing-energy costs and reduced yield losses for sensing, telecommunications, or quantum photonics applications.

TI Functionalization of Quantum Sensors and Measurement of Cellular
   Physicochemical Quantities
SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB Quantum sensing technology has emerged as an innovative method for highly sensitive measurement of physical and chemical parameters in biological and material science fields. Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), which contain nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVCs), enable precise measurement of temperature, magnetic fields, and pH through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). In this study, we developed techniques for FND preparation, surface modification, and intracellular measurement of temperature and thermal conductivity. Optimized FNDs were produced via ion irradiation and oxidation processes. By coating FNDs with hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) or photo-crosslinked lipids (PCL), we significantly improved their dispersion stability and functionality. Furthermore, we developed FND-PDA (polydopamine) composites, which serve as hybrid probes for heating and temperature sensing. Using this system, we revealed that intracellular thermal conductivity is approximately one-sixth that of water. Additionally, we demonstrated that temperature changes act as signals to promote neurite outgrowth during neural stem cell differentiation. By combining precise thermal control and intracellular temperature measurement, we confirmed that a 1-3 degrees C increase enhances neurite extension. This suggests that localized temperature changes function as critical signals for cellular processes. FNDs provide unprecedented opportunities for quantitative nanoscale measurement of physicochemical quantities, offering new insights into biological systems. Their unique properties, including photostability and quantum sensitivity, make FNDs promising tools for advanced bioimaging and quantum sensing applications.

TI Stoquasticity in circuit QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze whether circuit QED Hamiltonians are stoquastic, focusing on systems of coupled flux qubits. We show that scalable sign-problem-free path integral Monte Carlo simulations can typically be performed for such systems. Despite this, we corroborate the recent finding [I. Ozfidan et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 13, 034037 (2020)] that an effective, nonstoquastic qubit Hamiltonian can emerge in a system of capacitively coupled flux qubits. We find that if the capacitive coupling is sufficiently small, this nonstoquasticity of the effective qubit Hamiltonian can be avoided if we perform a canonical transformation prior to projecting onto an effective qubit Hamiltonian. Our results shed light on the power of circuit QED Hamiltonians for the use of quantum adiabatic computation and the subtlety of finding a representation which cures the sign problem in these systems.

TI Dynamics of Transmon Ionization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Qubit measurement and control in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) rely on microwave drives, with higher drive amplitudes ideally leading to faster processes. However, degradation in qubit coherence time and readout fidelity has been observed even under moderate drive amplitudes corresponding to a few photons populating the measurement resonator. Here, we numerically explore the dynamics of a driven transmon-resonator system under strong and nearly resonant measurement drives and find clear signatures of transmon ionization where the qubit escapes out of its cosine potential. Using a semiclassical model, we interpret this ionization as resulting from resonances occurring at specific resonator-photon popula-tions. We find that the photon populations at which these spurious transitions occur are strongly parameter dependent and that they can occur at low resonator-photon population, something that may explain the experimentally observed degradation in measurement fidelity.

TI Optimized SeaSign for Enhanced Efficiency
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper optimized SeaSign - an isogeny-based digital signature algorithm that combines the class group actions of CSIDH with the notion of Fiat-Shamir with abort. The proposed modification is simple yet powerful, which is the repositioning of the rejection sampling within the algorithm. Additionally, SeaSign is further optimized by using the Huff-Edwards hybrid isogeny. As a result, the signature generation of the proposed SeaSign is approximately 3 times faster than the original version of SeaSign. Additionally, this paper presents the results of performance comparisons with other optimization methods of SeaSign. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm has zero rejection rate so it demonstrates more efficient performance in any scenario.

Furthermore, we optimize large CSIDH parameters for performance while still achieving the NIST security levels 1, 2, and 3. Finally, we provide a C-code constant-time implementation of those CSIDH large instantiations using the square-root-complexity Velu's formulas recently proposed by Bernstein, De Feo, Leroux and Smith.

TI Decoherence induced by a sparse bath of two-level fluctuators: Peculiar
   features of 1/f noise in high-quality qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the devastating low-frequency 1/f noise and extending the qubits' coherence times (dephasing time T*(2) and the echo decay time T-2). However, large qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a uniformly high quality. In this work, we show that large variability is a characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many (n >> 1) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates gamma are sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval [gamma(m) , gamma(M)], which is a standard model for 1/f noise. We investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit, i.e., when the TLF density d is small (the limit of sparse bath, with d=n/w << 1, where n is the number of TLFs and omega=ln[gamma(M)/gamma(m)] is the log-width of the distribution). We show that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power spectra S(f)similar to 1/f, but lead to drastically different coherence times T*(2) and T-2. Thus the spectral density S(f) does not determine coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath; instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators, determined by their value of gamma. We show that removing only two of these TLFs greatly increases T-2 and T*(2) times. Our findings help theoretical understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the 1/f noise in these platforms.

TI Advancing Hydrological Prediction with Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks: A
   Comparative Study for Mile Mughan Dam
SO WATER
AB Predicting dam inflow is critical for human life safety, water resource management, and hydroelectric power generation. While machine learning (ML) models address complex, nonlinear hydrological problems, quantum machine learning (QML) offers greater potential to overcome classical computational limits. This study compares a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) with the following two classical models: bidirectional CNN-LSTM and support vector regression (SVR). These models were evaluated to predict monthly inflow to the Mile Mughan Dam, a transboundary hydroelectric and irrigation dam located on the Aras River between Azerbaijan and Iran, using a 14-year dataset (2010-2023) under two scenarios. In total, 70% of data was used for training and 30% for testing. The first scenario encompassed meteorological variables plus three months of inflow lags, and the second included inflow lags only. Model performance was assessed using Coefficient of Determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and graphical plots. HQNN showed superior performance across all metrics. In Scenario 1, HQNN achieved R2 = 0.915, RMSE = 37.318 MCM, NSE = 0.908, MAPE = 8.343%; CNN-BiLSTM had R2 = 0.867, RMSE = 46.506 MCM, NSE = 0.858, MAPE = 10.795%; SVR had R2 = 0.846, RMSE = 52.372 MCM, NSE = 0.821, MAPE = 12.772%. In Scenario 2, HQNN maintained strong performance (R2 = 0.855, RMSE = 48.56 MCM, NSE = 0.845, MAPE = 9.979%) and outperformed CNN-BiLSTM (R2 = 0.810, RMSE = 56.126 MCM, NSE = 0.793, MAPE = 11.456%) and SVR (R2 = 0.801, RMSE = 60.336 MCM, NSE = 0.761, MAPE = 12.901%). In Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, HQNN increased the prediction accuracy by 19.76% and 13.47%, respectively, compared to the CNN-BiLSTM model. These results confirm HQNN's reliability in both multivariate and univariate modeling.

TI Quantum intelligence in medicine: Empowering thyroid disease prediction
   through advanced machine learning
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The medical information system is rich in datasets, but no intelligent systems can easily analyse the disease. Recently, ML (Machine Learning)-based algorithms have acted as a handy diagnostic tool to identify whether a person is affected by thyroid or not. However, they produced classification with low accuracy and led to misclassification. Hence, the proposed system combines quantum computing with ML techniques to enhance computational power and precision. The system employs modified QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation) for feature selection since its searching performance is better than that of conventional PSO for selecting the optimum global position of the particle, thus selecting the relevant feature. Whereas, the QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machine) is implemented for more accurate classification than classical SVM, as it tends to capture complex patterns in data produced due to high dimensional feature space applied by quantum kernel functions. This combination of modified QPSO and QSVM tends to increase the performance accuracy significantly. The efficiency of the proposed model is measured based on derivative parameters, such as F-1-score, recall, precision and accuracy, with corresponding confusion matrix and ROC. Further, the classification is compared with other traditional approaches to predict the accuracy of the proposed model with traditional methods.
   Thyroid is one of the most critical diseases and has the potential to be transformed into a common disease. So, early prediction of the disease helps people to overcome this issue. In the future, the proposed system can be enhanced by applying several feature selection and classification algorithms to improve the performance of thyroid disease prediction with better accuracy rates.image

Current implementations of first principles computational models for catalyst design are data-hungry, problem-specific and confirmatory in nature. However, they can be made less data-dependent, more transferable and exploratory by developing both forward and inverse catalyst mapping tools that are either inexpensive correlations, like scaling relations, or regression models that are based on relevant descriptors analysis. This work reviews the current application and the possible landscape for future advancements of such tools for developing generalized schemes for catalyst design and optimization.

TI Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for
   universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The remarkable complexity of a topologically ordered many-body quantum system is encoded in the characteristics of its anyons. Quintessential predictions emanating from this complexity employ the Fibonacci string net condensate (Fib SNC) and its anyons: sampling Fib-SNC would estimate chromatic polynomials while exchanging its anyons would implement universal quantum computation. However, physical realizations remained elusive. We introduce a scalable dynamical string net preparation (DSNP) that constructs Fib SNC and its anyons on reconfigurable graphs suitable for near-term superconducting processors. Coupling the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits, we create, measure, and braids Fibonacci anyons; charge measurements show 94% accuracy, and exchanging the anyons yields the expected golden ratio phi with 98% average accuracy. We then sample the Fib SNC to estimate chromatic polynomial at phi + 2 for several graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and aim at a classically hard problem.

TI Topological error correction with a Gaussian cluster state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Topological error correction provides an effective method to correct errors in quantum computation. It allows quantum computation to be implemented with a higher error threshold and high tolerating loss rates. We present a topological error correction scheme with continuous variables based on an eight-partite Gaussian cluster state. We show that topological quantum correlation between two modes can be protected against a single quadrature phase displacement error occurring on any mode and some of two errors occurring on two modes. More interestingly, some cases of errors occurring on three modes can also be recognized and corrected, which is different from the topological error correction with discrete variables. We show that the final error rate after correction can be further reduced if the modes are subjected to identical errors occurring on all modes with equal probability. The presented results provide a feasible scheme for topological error correction with continuous variables and it can be experimentally demonstrated with a Gaussian cluster state.

TI Stencil Lithography-Assisted Fabrication of Triangular Grid Pb
   Architecture
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Manipulating Majorana zero modes (MZMs) holds significant promise in propelling the field of topological quantum computation. While scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) exhibits remarkable capabilities in characterizing MZMs, additional geometrical constraints are imperative for achieving precise and controllable manipulation of these zero modes. To this end, it is of great help to integrate a micro mask within a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system to grow specific patterns containing MZMs. Here, a scenario for manipulating the MZMs in the vortex cores based on a triangular grid architecture is proposed. Additionally, a stencil lithography setup that is compatible with a combined MBE and STM system is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. A fine-tuning of the Pb patterns, between a hexagonal antidot lattice to a triangular grid array, is achieved by adjusting the spatial gap between the stencil mask and the underlying substrate. This study provides new possibilities for the fabrication and investigation of Majorana devices.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Battery Anomaly Detection in Smart Transportation
   Systems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Ensuring the safety, reliability, and longevity of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is crucial for sustainable integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, thermal stress and degradation-induced anomalies can cause sudden performance failures, posing critical operational and safety risks. Capturing complex, non-linear, and high-dimensional patterns remains challenging for traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. We propose a hybrid anomaly detection method that incorporates a Variational Quantum Neural Network (VQNN), which uses the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, and parallelism, to learn complex non-linear patterns. The VQNN is integrated with Isolation Forest (IF) and a Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)-based spike characterisation method to form a Quantum Anomaly Detector (QAD). This method distinguishes between normal and anomalous spikes in battery behaviour. Using an Arrhenius-based model, we simulate how the State of Health (SoH) and voltage of a Li-ion battery reduce as temperatures increase. We perform experiments on NASA battery datasets and detect abnormal spikes in 14 out of 168 cycles, corresponding to 8.3% of the cycles. The QAD achieves the highest Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.9820, outperforming the baseline IF model by 7.78%. We use ML to predict the SoH and voltage changes when the temperature varies. Gradient Boosting (GB) achieves a voltage Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.001425, while Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieves the highest R2 score of 0.9343. These results demonstrate that Quantum Machine Learning (QML) can be applied for anomaly detection in Battery Management Systems (BMSs) within intelligent transportation ecosystems and could enable EVs to autonomously adapt their routing and schedule preventative maintenance. With these capabilities, safety will be improved, downtime minimised, and public confidence in sustainable transport technologies increased.

TI Assessing Engineering Students' Conceptual Understanding of Introductory
   Quantum Optics
SO PHYSICS
AB Quantum technologies have outgrown mere fundamental research in laboratories over recent years, and will facilitate more and more potentially disruptive applications in a wide range of fields in the future. In foresight, qualification opportunities need to be implemented in order to train qualified specialists, referred to as the future quantum workforce, in various fields. Universities world-wide have launched qualification programmes for engineers focusing on quantum optics and photonics. In many of these programmes, students attend courses on quantum physics contextualized via quantum optics experiments with heralded photons, because: (1) their experimental and physical foundations may be directly leveraged to teaching a number of quantum technology applications, and (2) physics education research has provided empirical evidence, according to which such quantum optics-based approaches are conducive to learning about quantum concepts. While many teachers are confident about the effectiveness of their concepts, there is little empirical evidence due to the lack of content-area-specific research tools. We present a 16-item concept inventory to assess students' conceptual understanding of quantum optics concepts in the context of experiments with heralded photons adopted from a test instrument published in the literature. We have administered this Quantum Optics Concept Inventory as a post-test to N=216 students after instruction on quantum optics as part of an undergraduate engineering course. We evaluated the instruments' psychometric quality, both in terms of classical test theory, and using a Rasch scaling approach. The Quantum Optics Concept Inventory enables a reliable measure (alpha=0.74), and the data gathered show a good fit to the Rasch model. The students' scores suggest that fundamental quantum effects pose striking learning hurdles to the engineering students. In contrast, most of the students are able to cope with the experimental and technical foundations of quantum optics experiments with heralded photons and their underlying principles, such as the coincidence technique used for the preparation of single-photon states. These findings are in accordance with prior research, and hence, the Quantum Optics Concept Inventory may serve as a fruitful starting point for future empirical research with regard to the education of the future quantum workforce.

TI A New Code-Based Identity-Based Signature Scheme from the Ternary
   Large-Weight SDP
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Identity-based cryptography introduced by Shamir (Crypto'84) has seen many advances through the years. In the context of post-quantum identity-based schemes, most of the efficient designs are based on lattices. In this work, we propose an identity-based identification (IBI) scheme and an identity-based signature (IBS) scheme based on codes. Our design combines the hash-and-sign signature scheme, Wave, with a Stern-like signature scheme, BGKM-SIG1, instantiated over a ternary field using the large-weight Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP). Our scheme significantly outperforms existing code-based identity-based signature constructions.

This study explores a scenario where Alice intends to transmit n bits of classical information to Bob by sending m qudits, using an arbitrary bipartite pure entangled state with E qudits as the shared resource. We employ the unambiguous discrimination strategy in decoding and establish an upper bound on the success probability, which extends the findings of a previous study (Li in Phys Rev A 85:052304, 2012).

TI Discovery of atomic clock-like spin defects in simple oxides from first
   principles
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Virtually noiseless due to the scarcity of spinful nuclei in the lattice, simple oxides hold promise as hosts of solid-state spin qubits. However, no suitable spin defect has yet been found in these systems. Using high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predict spin defects in calcium oxide with electronic properties remarkably similar to those of the NV center in diamond. These defects are charged complexes where a dopant atom - Sb, Bi, or I - occupies the volume vacated by adjacent cation and anion vacancies. The predicted zero phonon line shows that the Bi complex emits in the telecommunication range, and the computed many-body energy levels suggest a viable optical cycle required for qubit initialization. Notably, the high-spin nucleus of each dopant strongly couples to the electron spin, leading to many controllable quantum levels and the emergence of atomic clock-like transitions that are well protected from environmental noise. Specifically, the Hanh-echo coherence time increases beyond seconds at the clock-like transition in the defect with 209Bi. Our results pave the way to designing quantum states with long coherence times in simple oxides, making them attractive platforms for quantum technologies.
   Recently, long spin coherence times have been predicted for spin defects in simple oxides. Here, by using high-throughput first-principles calculations, the authors identify promising spin defects in CaO, with electronic properties similar to those of NV centers but with longer coherence times.

AB In the present Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ), hybrid algorithms that leverage classical resources to reduce quantum costs are particularly appealing. We formulate and apply such a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to a power system optimization problem called Unit Commitment, which aims to satisfy a target power load at minimal cost. Our algorithm extends the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a classical minimizer in order to support mixed binary optimization. Using Qiskit, we simulate results for sample systems to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We also compare to purely classical methods. Our results indicate that classical solvers are effective for our simulated Unit Commitment instances with fewer than 400 power generation units. However, for larger problem instances, the classical solvers either scale exponentially in runtime or must resort to coarse approximations. This opens the door to potential quantum advantage for systems with several hundred units, though quantum error correction may be necessary at this scale.

TI Phase estimation of local Hamiltonians on NISQ hardware
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this work we investigate a binned version of quantum phase estimation (QPE) set out by Somma (2019 New J. Phys. 21 123025) and known as the quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP). Specifically, we determine whether the circuit decomposition techniques we set out in previous work, Clinton et al (2021 Nat. Commun. 12 1-10), can improve the performance of QEEP in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) regime. To this end we adopt a physically motivated abstraction of NISQ device capabilities as in Clinton et al (2021 Nat. Commun. 12 1-10). Within this framework, we find that our techniques reduce the threshold at which it becomes possible to perform the minimum two-bin instance of this algorithm by an order of magnitude. This is for the specific example of a two dimensional spin Fermi-Hubbard model. For example, we estimate that the depolarizing single qubit error rate required to implement a minimum two bin example of QEEP-with a 5 x 5 Fermi-Hubbard model and up to a precision of 10%-can be reduced from 10(-7) to 10(-5). We explore possible modifications to this protocol and propose an application, which we dub randomized quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (rQEEP). rQEEP outputs estimates on the fraction of eigenvalues which lie within randomly chosen bins and upper bounds the total deviation of these estimates from the true values. One use case we envision for this algorithm is resolving density of states features of local Hamiltonians.

TI Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer
   entropies
SO QUANTUM
AB Nonstabilizerness or 'magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Renyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Renyi index alpha. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of alpha. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for alpha > 1, while it is a constant for alpha < 1. This highlights that alpha-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on alpha: alpha-SREs with alpha < 1 relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while alpha > 1 probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.

TI An efficient Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with fixed
   linear ramp schedule for truss structure optimization
SO ADVANCED MODELING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB This study proposes a novel structural optimization framework based on quantum variational circuits, in which the multiplier acting on the cross-sectional area of each rod in a truss structure as an updater is used as a design variable. Specifically, we employ a classical processor for structural analysis with the finite element method, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is subsequently performed to update the cross-sectional area so that the compliance is minimized. The advantages of this framework can be seen in three key aspects. First, by defining design variables as multipliers, rather than simply reducing the design variable to a binary candidate of inclusion or exclusion (corresponding to qubit states, "0" and "1"), it provides greater flexibility in adjusting the cross-sectional area of the rod at each iteration of the optimization process. Second, the multipliers acting on rods are encoded with on-off encoding, eliminating additional constraints in the convergence judgement. As a result, the objective function is in a simple format, enabling efficient optimization using QAOA. Third, a fixed linear ramp schedule (FLRS) for variational parameter setting bypasses the classical optimization process, thereby improving the operational efficiency of the framework. In the two structural cases investigated in this study, the proposed approach highlights the feasibility and applicability potential of quantum computing in advancing engineering design and optimization. Numerical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework, providing a firm foundation for future research on quantum-assisted optimization methods in engineering fields.

TI First-order quantum phase transition in the squeezed Rabi model
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum phase transition and entanglement in the Rabi model with a squeezed light are investigated. We find a special unitary-transformation method that removes the nonintegrable squeezing and counterrotating-wave interactions when the qubit frequency is close to the field frequency. The analytical ground state agrees well with the numerical solution. We demonstrate that the ground state exhibits a first-order quantum phase transition at a critical point induced linearly by the squeezed light. This quantum phase transition requires neither multiple qubits nor an infinite ratio of qubit frequency to field frequency, which solves a critical problem for the theory and experiment in Rabi model. As the qubit-field coupling strength increases, the ground-state entanglement reaches its maximum value at the critical point.

AB Near-term quantum computers contain noisy devices, which makes it difficult to infer the correct answer even if a program is run for thousands of trials. On current machines, qubit measurements tend to be the most error-prone operations (with an average error-rate of 4%) and often limit the size of quantum programs that can be run reliably on these systems. As quantum programs create and manipulate correlated states, all the program qubits are measured in each trial and thus, the severity of measurement errors increases with the program size. The fidelity of quantum programs can be improved by reducing the number of measurement operations.
   We present JigSaw, a framework that reduces the impact of measurement errors by running a program in two modes. First, running the entire program and measuring all the qubits for half of the trials to produce a global (albeit noisy) histogram. Second, running additional copies of the program and measuring only a subset of qubits in each copy, for the remaining trials, to produce localized ( higher fidelity) histograms over the measured qubits. JigSaw then employs a Bayesian post-processing step, whereby the histograms produced by the subset measurements are used to update the global histogram. Our evaluations using three different IBM quantum computers with 27 and 65 qubits show that JigSaw improves the success rate on average by 3.6x and up-to 8.4x. Our analysis shows that the storage and time complexity of JigSaw scales linearly with the number of qubits and trials, making JigSaw applicable to programs with hundreds of qubits.

AB Silicon quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize technology with capabilities to solve real-life problems that are computationally complex or even intractable for modern computers [1] by offering sufficient high quality qubits to perform complex error-corrected calculations. Silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor based quantum dots present a promising pathway for realizing practical quantum computers. To improve certain qubit properties, it is a common strategy to incorporate multiple electrons in the same dot in order to form qubits in higher confined orbital states. Theoretical modelling is an essential part of understanding the quantum behaviour of these electrons, providing a basis for validating the physical working of device models as well as providing insights into experimental data.
   Hartree-Fock theory is an imperative tool for the electronic structure modelling of multi-electron quantum dots due to its ability to simulate a large number of electrons with manageable computation load. However, an efficient calculation of the self-consistent field becomes hard because dot formations in silicon are characterized by strong electron-electron interactions and conduction band valleys, besides the relatively high comparative effective mass, which add to create a behaviour dominated by repulsion between electrons rather than a well established shell structure. In this paper, we present a Hartree-Fock-based method that accounts for these complexities for the modelling of silicon quantum dots. With this method, we first establish the significance of including electron-electron interactions and valley degree of freedom and their implications. We then explore a simple case of anisotropic dots and observe the impact of anisotropy on dot formations.

AB Broadbent and Islam (TCC '20) proposed a quantum cryptographic primitive called quantum encryption with certified deletion. In this primitive, a receiver in possession of a quantum ciphertext can generate a classical certificate that the encrypted message has been deleted. Although their construction is information-theoretically secure, it is limited to the setting of one-time symmetric key encryption (SKE), where a sender and receiver have to share a common key in advance and the key can be used only once. Moreover, the sender has to generate a quantum state and send it to the receiver over a quantum channel in their construction. Deletion certificates are privately verifiable, which means a verification key for a certificate must be kept secret, in the definition by Broadbent and Islam. However, we can also consider public verifiability. In this work, we present various constructions of encryption with certified deletion.
   - Quantum communication case: We achieve (reusable-key) public key encryption (PKE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) with certified deletion. Our PKE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of IND-CPA secure PKE, and our ABE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions. These two schemes are privately verifiable.
   - Classical communication case: We also achieve interactive encryption with certified deletion that uses only classical communication. We give two schemes, a privately verifiable one and a publicly verifiable one. The former is constructed assuming the LWE assumption in the quantum random oracle model. The latter is constructed assuming the existence of one-shot signatures and extractable witness encryption.

TI Weighted slice rank and a minimax correspondence to Strassen's spectra
SO JOURNAL DE MATHEMATIQUES PURES ET APPLIQUEES
AB Structural and computational understanding of tensors is the driving force behind faster matrix multiplication algorithms, the unraveling of quantum entanglement, and the breakthrough on the cap set problem. Strassen's asymptotic spectra program (FOCS 1986) characterizes optimal matrix multiplication algorithms through monotone functionals. Our work advances and makes novel connections among two recent developments in the study of tensors, namely center dot the slice rank of tensors, a notion of rank for tensors that emerged from the resolution of the cap set problem (Ann. Math. 2017),center dot and the quantum functionals of tensors (STOC 2018), monotone functionals defined as optimizations over moment polytopes.More precisely, we introduce an extension of slice rank that we call weighted slice rank and we develop a minimax correspondence between the asymptotic weighted slice rank and the quantum functionals. Weighted slice rank encapsulates different notions of bipartiteness of quantum entanglement.The correspondence allows us to give a rank-type characterization of the quantum functionals. Moreover, whereas the original definition of the quantum functionals only works over the complex numbers, this new characterization can be extended to all fields. Thereby, in addition to gaining deeper understanding of Strassen's theory for the complex numbers, we obtain a proposal for quantum functionals over other fields. The finite field case is crucial for combinatorial and algorithmic problems where the field can be optimized over.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Entanglement, non-hermiticity and duality
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Usually duality process keeps energy spectrum invariant. In this paper, we provide a duality, which keeps entanglement spectrum invariant, in order to diagnose quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian non-interacting fermionic systems. We limit our attention to non-Hermitian systems with a complete set of biorthonormal eigenvectors and an entirely real energy spectrum. The original system has a reduced density matrix rho(o) and the real space is partitioned via a projecting operator R-o. After dualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix rho(d) and a new real space projector R-d. Remarkably, entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy keep invariant. Inspired by the duality, we defined two types of non-Hermitian models, upon R-o is given. In type-I exemplified by the "non-reciprocal model", there exists at least one duality such that R-d is Hermitian. In other words, entanglement information of type-I non-Hermitian models with a given R-o is entirely controlled by Hermitian models with R-d. As a result, we are allowed to apply known results of Hermitian systems to efficiently obtain entanglement properties of type-I models. On the other hand, the duals of type-II models, exemplified by "non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model", are always non-Hermitian. For the practical purpose, the duality provides a potentially efficient computation route to entanglement of non-Hermitian systems. Via connecting different models, the duality also sheds lights on either trivial or nontrivial role of non-Hermiticity played in quantum entanglement, paving the way to potentially systematic classification and characterization of non-Hermitian systems from the entanglement perspective.

TI Mott insulating state of IrO6 honeycomb monolayer structured in
   ilmenite-type oxide superlattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Quantum magnetism based on the Kitaev honeycomb model has been intensively studied both by theoretical material design and experimental materialization. In contrast to the considerable progress of theoretical modeling and experiments on bulk crystals, it is still difficult to find a candidate material applicable to thin films and devices toward future quantum computation. Here we clearly demonstrate a Mott insulating state of IrO6 honeycomb monolayer structured in ilmenite-type Mg-Ir-O/MgTiO3 superlattices, which is a good candidate of the Kitaev honeycomb magnet applicable to devices. Electronic states detected by photoelectron spectroscopy agree well with those in theoretical band calculations. The stabilized superlattice with the Mott gap state is a promising platform to examine the device physics of the Majorana fermions and the Z2 fluxes in the Kitaev honeycomb model, suggesting the thin-film techniques are quite beneficial for triggering the exploration of quantum computation in designable and evolvable heterostructures.

TI A 4-to-6-GHz Cryogenic CMOS LNA With 4.4-K Average Noise Temperature in
   22-nm FDSOI
SO IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Integrated readout systems are desired to enable future large-scale superconducting quantum computers. These systems require high-performance cryogenic low-noise amplifiers, and implementing these in CMOS is desirable from an integration point of view. However, realizing the necessary noise and power performance required for this application while using CMOS is an open challenge. Here, we present the design of a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (DDSOI) technology. Operating between 4 and 6 GHz and consuming 15.8 mW, it achieved a peak gain of 38 dB, a minimum noise of 3.5 K at 5.2 GHz, and an average noise of 4.4 K. Through back-gate control and bias optimization, it can be operated at a lower supply voltage while dissipating < 4.5 mW at the expense of 0.7-K higher noise. Considering a figure of merit (FOM), which takes into account the number of added noise photons, gain, bandwidth, and power consumption, the LNA, biased at low power, demonstrates an FOM of > 3 x higher than other state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) LNAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cryo-CMOS LNA operating above 4 GHz that exhibits a noise temperature below 4 K.

TI Quantum-accessible reinforcement learning beyond strictly epochal
   environments
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In recent years, quantum-enhanced machine learning has emerged as a particularly fruitful application of quantum algorithms, covering aspects of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning offers numerous options of how quantum theory can be applied, and is arguably the least explored, from a quantum perspective. Here, an agent explores an environment and tries to find a behavior optimizing some figure of merit. Some of the first approaches investigated settings where this exploration can be sped-up, by considering quantum analogs of classical environments, which can then be queried in superposition. If the environments have a strict periodic structure in time (i.e. are strictly episodic), such environments can be effectively converted to conventional oracles encountered in quantum information. However, in general environments, we obtain scenarios that generalize standard oracle tasks. In this work, we consider one such generalization, where the environment is not strictly episodic, which is mapped to an oracle identification setting with a changing oracle. We analyze this case and show that standard amplitude-amplification techniques can, with minor modifications, still be applied to achieve quadratic speed-ups. In addition, we prove that an algorithm based on Grover iterations is optimal for oracle identification even if the oracle changes over time in a way that the "rewarded space" is monotonically increasing. This result constitutes one of the first generalizations of quantum-accessible reinforcement learning.

TI Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We analyse the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyse various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.

TI Preparing Dicke states in a spin ensemble using phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a Dicke state preparation scheme which uses global control of N spin qubits: our scheme is based on the standard phase estimation algorithm, which estimates the eigenvalue of a unitary operator. The scheme prepares a Dicke state nondeterministically by collectively coupling the spins to an ancilla qubit via a ZZ interaction, using inverted right perpendicularlog(2) Ninverted left perpendicular + 1 ancilla qubit measurements. The preparation of such Dicke states can be useful if the spins in the ensemble are used for magnetic sensing: we discuss a possible realization using an ensemble of electronic spins located at diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled to a single superconducting flux qubit. We also analyze the effect of noise and limitations in our scheme.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics under time-translation symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A dynamical symmetry is employed to determine the structure of the quantum non-Markovian time-local master equation. Such a structure is composed from two components: scalar kinetic coefficients and the standard quantum Markovian operator form. The kinetic coefficients are generally time-dependent and incorporate information on the kinematics and memory effects, while the operators manifest the dynamical symmetry. Specifically, we focus on time-translation symmetric dynamics, where the Lindblad jump operators constitute the eigenoperators of the free dynamics. This symmetry is motivated by thermodynamic microscopic considerations, where strict energy conservation between system and environment imposes the time-translation symmetry. The construction is generalized to other symmetries, and to driven quantum systems. The formalism is illustrated by three exactly solvable non-Markovian models, where the exact reduced description exhibits a dynamical symmetric structure. The formal structure of the master equation leads to a first principle calculation of the exact kinetic coefficients. This opens the possibility to simulate in a modular fashion non-Markovian dynamics.

TI Proposal for a destructive controlled phase gate using linear optics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn showed that linear optics techniques could be used to implement a nonlinear sign gate. They also showed that two of their nonlinear sign gates could be combined to implement a controlled-phase gate, which has a number of practical applications. Here we describe an alternative implementation of a controlled-phase gate for a single-rail target qubit that only requires the use of a single nonlinear sign gate. This gives a much higher average probability of success when the required ancilla photons are generated using heralding techniques. This implementation of a controlled-phase gate destroys the control qubit, which is acceptable in a number of applications where the control qubit would have been destroyed in any event, such as in a postselection process.

TI On applying the lackadaisical quantum walk algorithm to search for
   multiple solutions on grids
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum computing promises to improve the information processing power to levels unreachable by classical computation. Quantum walks are heading the development of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more efficiently than their clas-sical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures whose vertices have a self-loop of weight l. This paper addresses several issues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the two stopping condi-tions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. In the most discrepant case shown here, a stopping condition is prematurely satisfied at the step T = 288 with a success prob-ability Pr = 0.593276, while the suitable condition captures the actual amplification that occurred until T = 409 with Pr = 0.878178. We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. For instance, we show here that decreases in the density of solutions can even take a success probability of 0.849178 to 0.961896. In contrast, increases in the relative distances can even take a success probability of 0.871665 to 0.940301. Furthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal adjustment of the self-loop weight l for such d-dimensional grids. It turns out other fits of l found in the literature are particular cases. Our experiments demonstrate that successful searches for multiple solutions with higher than two dimensions are possible by achieving success probabilities such as 0.999979, with the value of l proposed here, where it would be 0.637346, with the value of l proposed in previous works. Finally, we observe a two-to -one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum walk and Grover's algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping condition. That modified stopping condition can escape intermediary fluctuations that would produce premature stops at T = 6 with Pr = 0.000878 where the system can evolve until T = 354 with Pr = 0.99999, as an example that we show here. In conclusion, this work deals with practical issues one should consider when applying the lackadaisical quantum walk, besides expanding the technique to a broader range of search problems.

TI Impossibility of adversarial self-testing and secure sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Self-testing is the task where spatially separated Alice and Bob cooperate to deduce the inner workings of untrusted quantum devices by interacting with them in a classical manner. We examine the task above where Alice and Bob do not trust each other which we call adversarial self-testing. We show that adversarial self-testing implies secure sampling-a simpler task that we introduce where distrustful Alice and Bob wish to sample from a joint probability distribution with the guarantee that an honest party's marginal is not biased. By extending impossibility results in two-party quantum cryptography, we give a simple proof that both of these tasks are impossible in all but trivial settings.

TI Snakes and Ladders: Adapting the Surface Code to Defects
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB One of the critical challenges solid-state quantum processors face is the presence of fabrication imperfections and two-level systems, which render certain qubits and gates either inoperable or much noisier than tolerable by quantum error-correction protocols. To address this challenge, we develop a suite of novel and highly performant methods for adapting surface code patches in the presence of defective qubits and gates, which we call Snakes and Ladders. We explain how our algorithm generates and compares several strategies in order to find the optimal one for any given configuration of defective components, as well as introduce heuristics to improve runtime and minimize computing resources required by our algorithm. In addition to memory storage we also show how to apply our methods to lattice surgery protocols. Compared to prior works, our methods significantly improve the code distance of the adapted surface code patches for realistic defect rates, resulting in a logical performance similar to that of the defect-free patches.

TI Ferromagnetic materials for Josephson π junctions
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The past two decades have seen an explosion of work on Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials. Such junctions are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. In the presence of the exchange field, spin-singlet Cooper pairs from conventional superconductors undergo rapid phase oscillations as they propagate through a ferromagnetic material. As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and pi as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. pi-junctions have been proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain qubit designs for quantum computing. If a junction contains two or more ferromagnetic layers whose relative magnetization directions can be controlled by a small applied magnetic field, then the junction can serve as the foundation for a memory cell. Success in all of those applications requires careful choices of ferromagnetic materials. Often, materials that optimize magnetic properties do not optimize supercurrent propagation, and vice versa. In this review, we discuss the significant progress that has been made in identifying and testing a wide range of ferromagnetic materials in Josephson junctions over the past two decades. The review concentrates on ferromagnetic metals, partly because eventual industrial applications of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions will most likely start with metallic ferromagnets (either in all metal junctions or junctions containing an insulating layer). We will briefly mention work on non-metallic barriers, including ferromagnetic insulators, and some of the exciting work on spin-triplet supercurrent in junctions containing non-collinear magnetic inhomogeneity.

TI A quantum search decoder for natural language processing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Probabilistic language models, e.g. those based on recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory models (LSTMs), often face the problem of finding a high probability prediction from a sequence of random variables over a set of tokens. This is commonly addressed using a form of greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. In this work, we construct a quantum algorithm to find the globally optimal parse (i.e. for infinite beam width) with high constant success probability. When the input to the decoder follows a power law with exponent k >0, our algorithm has runtime R-nf(R,R- k), where R is the alphabet size, n the input length; here f <1/2, and f<right arrow>0 exponentially fast with increasing k, hence making our algorithm always more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. We further modify our procedure to recover a finite beam width variant, which enables an even stronger empirical speedup while still retaining higher accuracy than possible classically. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency.

TI Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study
   with Unruh-DeWitt detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, 023197 (2025)] has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant H, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature H/(27r), indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

TI Probing spatial effects on quantum reservoir sensing in
   quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the impact of spatial separation between two sensor qubits on quantum sensing performance within a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate reservoir. By analyzing the quantum Fisher information and quantum signal-to-noise ratio for sensor qubits initialized in both entangled and product states, we reveal distinct behaviors in estimating key reservoir parameters, including spectral density coupling strength and temperature. For coupling strength estimation, smaller spatial distances between the sensor qubits enhance sensing precision. In contrast, for temperature sensing, the spatial separation emerges as a valuable resource, enabling significant improvements in estimation accuracy. Additionally, we discover that product states may outperform entangled states for parameter estimation in quantum reservoir sensing. These findings provide insights into leveraging spatial configurations and state initialization for optimizing quantum sensing protocols in quantum reservoirs.

TI Universal nonequilibrium dynamics of pure states and density-dependent
   thermalization in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Nonequilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for nonequilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multipoint correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-N Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and nonlocal Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We provide understanding of our numerical and analytical large-N results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the noninteracting SYK2 model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYKq>4 model thermalizes slower than the noninteracting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the nonlocal and/or multipoint quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.

TI Superadditivity in large N field theories and performance of
   quantum tasks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom (N) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this "superadditivity" phenomenon in large N field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the success of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naively be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be rephrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this rephrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.

TI Decoherence of nitrogen-vacancy spin ensembles in a nitrogen
   electron-nuclear spin bath in diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been developed into essential hardware units for a wide range of solid-state-based quantum technology applications. While such applications require the long spin lifetimes of the NV centers, they are often limited due to decoherence. In this study, we theoretically investigate the decoherence of NV-spin ensembles induced by nitrogen impurities (P1 centers), which are one of the most dominant and inevitable magnetic field noise sources in diamond. We combined cluster correlation expansion and density functional theory to compute the Hahn-echo spin-coherence time of the NV centers for a broad range of P1 concentrations. Results indicate a clear linear dependence of T-2 on P1 concentrations on a log scale with a slope of -1.06, which is in excellent agreement with previous experimental results. The interplay between the Jahn-Teller effect and the hyperfine interaction in the P1 center plays a critical role in determining the bath dynamics and the resulting NV decoherence. Our results provide a theoretical upper bound for the NV-spin T-2 over a wide range of P1 densities, serving as a key reference for materials optimization and spin bath characterization to develop highly coherent NV-based devices for quantum information technology.

TI Balanced Product Quantum Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB This work provides the first explicit and non-random family of [[N, K, D]] LDPC quantum codes which encode K is an element of Theta(N-4/5) logical qubits with distance D is an element of Omega(N-3/5). The family is constructed by amalgamating classical codes and Ramanujan graphs via an operation called balanced product. Recently, Hastings-Haah-O'Donnell and Panteleev-Kalachev were the first to show that there exist families of LDPC quantum codes which break the polylog(N)root N distance barrier. However, their constructions are based on probabilistic arguments which only guarantee the code parameters with high probability whereas our bounds hold unconditionally. Further, balanced products allow for non-abelian twisting of the check matrices, leading to a construction of LDPC quantum codes that can be shown to have K is an element of Theta(N) and that we conjecture to have linear distance D is an element of Theta(N).

TI Stronger speed limit for observables: Tighter bound for the capacity of
   entanglement, the modular Hamiltonian, and the charging of a quantum
   battery
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB How fast an observable can evolve in time is answered by so-called observable speed limit. Here, we prove a stronger version of the observable speed limit and show that the previously obtained bound is a special case of the new bound. The stronger quantum speed limit for the state also follows from the stronger quantum speed limit for observables (SQSLO). We apply this to prove a stronger bound for the entanglement rate using the notion of capacity of entanglement (the quantum information theoretic counterpart of the heat capacity) and show that it outperforms previous bounds. Furthermore, we apply the SQSLO for the rate of modular Hamiltonian and in the context of interacting qubits in a quantum battery. These illustrative examples reveal that the speed limit for the modular energy and the time required to charge the battery can be exactly predicted using the new bound. This shows that for estimating the charging time of quantum battery SQSLO is actually tight, i.e., it saturates. Our findings can have important applications in quantum thermodynamics, the complexity of operator growth, predicting the time rate of quantum correlation growth, and quantum technology, in general.

TI Coherently excited superresolution using intensity product of

   measurements
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recently, the delayed-choice quantum eraser has been applied for coherently excited superresolution using phase-controlled projection measurements of laser light to overcome the diffraction limit in classical physics as well as to solve the limited order N of the N00N state in quantum physics. Here, a general scheme of the phase-controlled quantum eraser-based superresolution is proposed for quantum sensing satisfying the Heisenberg limit, and its general solution is derived for an arbitrary Nth-order intensity correlation. Furthermore, phase quantization of the proposed superresolution is discussed to better understand the wave nature of quantum mechanics. Unlike other methods of superresolution in quantum sensing, the proposed method is for the intensity products between phase-controlled quantum erasers and thus is compatible with most conventional sensing metrologies.

TI Continuous control of classical-quantum crossover by external high
   pressure in the coupled chain compound CsCuCl3
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In solid materials, the parameters relevant to quantum effects, such as the spin quantum number, are basically determined and fixed at the chemical synthesis, which makes it challenging to control the amount of quantum correlations. We propose and demonstrate a method for active control of the classical-quantum crossover in magnetic insulators by applying external pressure. As a concrete example, we perform high-field, high-pressure measurements on CsCuCl3, which has the structure of weakly-coupled spin chains. The magnetization process experiences a continuous evolution from the semi-classical realm to the highly-quantum regime with increasing pressure. Based on the idea of "squashing" the spin chains onto a plane, we characterize the change in the quantum correlations by the change in the value of the local spin quantum number of an effective two-dimensional model. This opens a way to access the tunable classical-quantum crossover of two-dimensional spin systems by using alternative systems of coupled-chain compounds. In real materials, a spin quantum number assumes a fixed value, which makes it challenging to realize a crossover between quantum and classical spin regimes. Here the authors demonstrate such a crossover in a weakly coupled chain compound by controlling the amount of quantum correlations, in the form of the inverse spin quantum number, with external pressure.

TI Insight into ground-state spin arrangement and bipartite entanglement of
   the polymeric coordination compound [Dy2Cu2]..
   through the symmetric spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB The ground-state spin arrangement and the bipartite entanglement within Cu2+-Cu2+ dimers across the magnetization process of the 4f-3d heterometallic coordination polymer [Dy(hfac)(2)(CH3OH)(2)Cu(dmg)(Hdmg)2].. (H(2)dmg = dimethylglyoxime, Hhfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoropentane-2,4-dione) are theoretically examined using the symmetric isotropic spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain. The numerical results point to five possible ground states of the compound with three different degrees of the quantum entanglement within Cu2+-Cu2+. Besides the standard ferrimagnetic and saturated phases without quantum entanglement of Cu2+ ions, which are manifested in low-temperature magnetization curve as wide plateaus at the nonsaturated magnetization 16.26.. B and at the saturation value 20.82..B, respectively, one also finds an intriguing singlet-like phase with just partial entanglement within Cu2+-Cu2+ and two singlet phases with fully entangled Cu2+-Cu2+ dimers. The former quantum phase can be identified in the low-temperature magnetization process as very narrow intermediate plateau at the magnetization 9.27.. B per unit cell, while the latter ones as zero magnetization plateau and intermediate plateau at the magnetization 18.54..B. Non-monotonous temperature variations of the concurrence, through which the entanglement within cooper dimers is quantified, point to the possible temporary thermal activation of the entangled states of Cu2+-Cu2+ also above non-entangled ferrimagnetic and saturated phases.

TI Tight Analysis of Grover-Meets-Simon and Alg-PolyQ2 Attacks via
   Formalizing Quantum Rank-Solving under Deferred Measurement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The combination of quantum algorithms is one promising approach to attacking symmetric cryptography. In this paper, we study in detail the Grover-meets-Simon and Alg-PolyQ2 algorithms under deferred measurement, which combine the ideas of Grover's and Simon's algorithms and are applicable to attacking the FX construction. By converting intermediate measurements into unitary operations deferred to the end of the quantum circuit, both quantum algorithms involve a quantum rank-solving problem. To address it, we first provide a formal analysis of the generalized quantum Gauss-Jordan elimination and characterize the resulting quantum state after the corresponding unitary operations, which serves as a subroutine in these two algorithms. Subsequently, we derive the tight bounds of the attack success probability of these two algorithms based on the initial amplitude, offering a novel perspective that confirms their effectiveness. Furthermore, our research perspective provides an idea for analyzing the attack success probability for some quantum algorithms integrating Grover's algorithm without considering quantum input length, and contributes to a deeper understanding of these attacks' underlying mechanisms under the deferred measurement principle.

TI Membrane phononic crystals for high- Qm mechanical defect
   modes at MHz frequencies in piezoelectric aluminum nitride
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Q(m). Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high- Q(m) single or multiple localized phononic defect modes at MHz frequencies. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high- Q(m) localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Q(m) x f(m) -product of 1.5 x10(13 ) Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for direct coupling to qubits or in situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits or low-noise sensors.

AB Efficient traffic management solutions in 6G communication systems face challenges as the scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. This paper aims to yield an all-inclusive framework ensuring reliable air pollution monitoring throughout smart cities, capitalizing on leading-edge techniques to encourage large coverage, high-accuracy data, and scalability. Dynamic sensors deployed to mobile ad-hoc pieces of fire networking sensors adapt to ambient changes. To address this issue, we proposed the Quantum-inspired Clustering Algorithm (QCA) and Quantum Entanglement and Mobility Metric (MoM) to enhance the efficiency and stability of clustering. Improved the sustainability and durability of the network by incorporating Dynamic CH selection employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Data was successfully routed using a hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization (QGA-ACO) approach. Simulation results were implemented using the ns-3 simulation tool, and the proposed model outperformed the traditional methods in deployment coverage (95%), cluster stability index (0.97), and CH selection efficiency (95%). This work is expected to study the 6G communication systems as a key enabler for IoT applications and as the title legible name explains, the solutions smartly done in a practical and scalable way gives a systematic approach towards solving the IoT traffic, and multi-routing challenges that are intended to be addressed in 6G era delivering a robust IoT ecosystem in securing the process.

TI Magnetoelectric BAW and SAW Devices: A Review
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Magnetoelectric (ME) devices combining piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials have emerged as powerful tools to miniaturize and enhance sensing and communication technologies. This paper examines recent developments in bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) ME devices, which demonstrate unique capabilities in ultra-sensitive magnetic sensing, compact antennas, and quantum applications. Leveraging the mechanical resonance of BAW and SAW modes, ME sensors achieve the femto- to pico-Tesla sensitivity ideal for biomedical applications, while ME antennas, operating at acoustic resonance, allow significant size reduction, with high radiation gain and efficiency, which is suited for bandwidth-restricted applications. In addition, ME non-reciprocal magnetoacoustic devices using hybrid magnetoacoustic waves present novel solutions for RF isolation, which have also shown potential for the efficient control of quantum defects, such as negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers. Continued advancements in materials and device structures are expected to further enhance ME device performance, positioning them as key components in future bio-sensing, wireless communication, and quantum information technologies.

   Gate
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS

The controlled NOT and phase-shift gates respectively comprise a combination of nuclear-magnetic-resonance pulse sequences and a free development operator of two nuclear spins with time. According to the order in which the controlled NOT and phase-shift gates act on the nuclear spin system, the nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based physical realization of a quantum Toffoli gate is achieved. The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is numerically solved by the Suzuki formula to confirm the correctness and feasibility of the realization of the quantum Toffoli gate based on nuclear magnetic resonance.

TI Compact all-fiber quantum-inspired LiDAR with over 100?dB noise
   rejection and single photon sensitivity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entanglement and correlation of quantum light can enhance LiDAR sensitivity in the presence of strong background noise. However, the power of such quantum sources is fundamentally limited to a stream of single photons and cannot compete with the detection range of high-power classical LiDAR transmitters. To circumvent this, we develop and demonstrate a quantum-inspired LiDAR prototype based on coherent measurement of classical time-frequency correlation. This system uses a high-power classical source and maintains the high noise rejection advantage of quantum LiDARs. In particular, we show that it can achieve over 100dB rejection (with 100ms integration time) of indistinguishable (with statistically identical properties in every degree of freedom) in-band noise while still being sensitive to single photon signals. In addition to the LiDAR demonstration, we also discuss the potential of the proposed LiDAR receiver for quantum information applications. In particular, we propose the chaotic quantum frequency conversion technique for coherent manipulation of high dimensional quantum states of light. It is shown that this technique can provide improved performance in terms of selectivity and efficiency as compared to pulse-based quantum frequency conversion.
   LiDARs exploiting quantum correlations provide enhancement in noise resilience and sensitivity, but high-power classical sources offer much higher operating distances. Here, the authors show how to exploit high power classical time-frequency correlations to keep the best of both worlds.

TI Kyber, Saber, and SK-MLWR Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms
   Model Checking with Maude
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Facing the potential threat raised by quantum computing, a great deal of research from many groups and industrial giants has gone into building public-key post-quantum cryptographic primitives that are resistant to the quantum attackers. Among them, there is a large number of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), whose purpose is to provide a secure key exchange, which is a very crucial component in public-key cryptography. This paper presents a formal security analysis of three lattice-based KEMs including Kyber, Saber, and SK-MLWR. We use Maude, a specification language supporting equational and rewriting logic and a high-performance tool equipped with many advanced features, such as a reachability analyzer that can be used as a model checker for invariant properties, to model the three KEMs as state machines. Because they all belong to the class of lattice-based KEMs, they share many common parts in their designs, such as polynomials, vectors, and message exchange patterns. We first model these common parts and combine them into a specification, called base specification. After that, for each of the three KEMs, by extending the base specification, we just need to model some additional parts and the mechanism execution. Once completing the three specifications, we conduct invariant model checkings with the Maude search command, pointing out a similar man-in-the-middle attack. The occurrence of this attack is due to the fact that authentication is not part of the KEMs, and therefore an active attacker can modify all communication between two honest parties.

TI Polarimetric Quantum-Strong Correlations with Independent Photons on the
   Poincare Sphere
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB Controllable, quantum-strong correlations of polarization states can be implemented with multi-photon independent states. Polarization-based photonic quantum correlations can be traced back to the overlap of the polarization Stokes vectors on the Poincare sphere between two polarization filters. The quantum Rayleigh scattering prevents a single photon from propagating in a straight line inside a dielectric medium, and it also provides a mechanism for the projective measurement of polarization. Complexities associated with single-photon sources and detectors can be eliminated because the quantum Rayleigh scattering in a dielectric medium destroys entangled photons. Entanglement-free, identical sources and processing devices give rise to correlations rather than these being caused by "quantum nonlocality". These analytic developments were prompted by the vanishing expectation values of the Pauli spin vector for a single photon of maximally entangled photonic Bell states.

TI Order p Quantum Wasserstein Distances from Couplings
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB Optimal transport provides a powerful mathematical framework with applications spanning numerous fields. A cornerstone within this domain is the p-Wasserstein distance, which serves to quantify the cost of transporting one probability measure to another. While recent attempts have sought to extend this measure to the realm of quantum states, existing definitions often present certain limitations, such as not being faithful. In this work, we present a new definition of quantum Wasserstein distances. This definition, leveraging the coupling method and a metric applicable to pure states, draws inspiration from a property characterising the classical Wasserstein distance-its determination based on its value on point masses. Subject to certain continuity properties, our definition exhibits numerous attributes expected of an optimal quantum rendition of the Wasserstein distance. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates metrics familiar to quantum information theory, such as the trace distance. Moreover, it provides an organic extension for metrics, like Nielsen's complexity metric, allowing their application to mixed states with a natural operational interpretation. We analyse this metric's attributes in the context of random quantum states, unveil phase transitions concerning the complexity of subsystems of random states and use it to derive circuit lower bounds. In addition, we show how we can use our definition to study hypercontractive inequalities for quantum channels that do not admit a faithful fixed point, allowing us to derive concentration inequalities. Finally, we discuss how our distance is well suited to define quantum Wasserstein generative adversarial networks.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Sensor Consolidation Measurement Approach for
   Cyber-Physical Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Cyber-Physical System (CPS) devices interconnect to grab data over a common platform from industrial applications. Maintaining immense data and making instant decision analysis by selecting a feasible node to meet latency constraints is challenging. To address this issue, we design a quantum-inspired online node consolidation (QONC) algorithm based on a time-sensitive measurement reinforcement system for making decisions to evaluate a feasible node, ensuring reliable service and deploying the node at the appropriate position for accurate data computation and communication. We design an Angular-based node position analysis method to localize the node through rotation and t-gate usage to mitigate latency and enhance system performance. We formalize the estimation and selection of the feasible node based on quantum formalization node parameters (node contiguity, node optimal knack rate, node heterogeneity, probability of fusion variance error ratio). We design a fitness function to assess the probability of node fitness before selection. The simulation results show that our approach achieves an effective measurement rate of performance index by reducing the average error ratio from 0.17-0.22, increasing the average coverage ratio from 29% to 42%, and the qualitative execution frequency of services. Moreover, the proposed model achieves a 74.3% offloading reduction accuracy and a 70.2% service reliability rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our system is scalable and efficient under numerous simulation frameworks.

TI Dangling Bonds as Possible Contributors to Charge Noise in Silicon and
   Silicon-Germanium Quantum Dot Qubits
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Spin qubits based on Si and Si1-xGex quantum dot architectures exhibit among the best coherence times of competing quantum computing technologies, yet they still suffer from charge noise that limit their qubit gate fidelities. Identifying the origins of these charge fluctuations is therefore a critical step toward improving Si quantum-dot-based qubits. Here, we use hybrid functional calculations to investigate possible atomistic sources of charge noise, focusing on charge trapping at Si and Ge dangling bonds (DBs). We evaluate the role of global and local environment in the defect levels associated with DBs in Si, Ge, and Si1-xGex alloys, and consider their trapping and excitation energies within the framework of configuration coordinate diagrams. We additionally consider the influence of strain and oxidation in charge-trapping energetics by analyzing Si and Ge-Si DBs in SiO2 and strained Si layers in typical Si1-xGex quantum dot heterostructures. Our results identify that Ge dangling bonds are more problematic charge-trapping centers both in typical Si1-xGex alloys and associated oxidation layers, and they may be exacerbated by compositional inhomogeneities. These results suggest the importance of alloy homogeneity and possible passivation schemes for DBs in Si-based quantum dot qubits and are of general relevance to mitigating possible trap levels in other Si, Ge, and Si1-xGex-based metal-oxide-semiconductor stacks and related devices.

TI Highly Entangled Stationary States from Strong Symmetries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian symmetries can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, Re<acute accent>nyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U(1) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU(N) symmetries, both logarithmic and Re<acute accent>nyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that, while Re<acute accent>nyi negativities with n > 2 scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized Re<acute accent>nyi negativities with n < 2) exhibits a volume-law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems and, hence, also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical classification model based on branching
   multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Tensor networks are emerging architectures for implementing quantum classification models. The branching multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (BMERA) is a tensor network known for its enhanced entanglement properties. This paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical classification model based on BMERA and explores the correlation between circuit layout, expressiveness, and classification accuracy. Additionally, we present an autodifferentiation method for computing the cost function gradient, which serves as a viable option for other hybrid quantum-classical models. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our classification model in tasks such as image recognition and cluster excitation discrimination, offering a novel approach for designing quantum classification models.

TI Lazy Modular Reduction for NTT
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The number theoretic transform (NTT) is a fundamental operation in cryptography, especially for lattice-based cryptographic schemes. This paper introduces LazyNTT, a novel method that reduces the number of Montgomery multiplications required in the NTT computation by replacing some of them with standard multiplication without modular reduction. This approach enhances the performance of the NTT computation and modular polynomial multiplication in lattice-based cryptographic schemes. The proposed LazyNTT can be generalized by increasing the number of standard multiplications. The experimental results show that the proposed LazyNTT improves the cycle counts of the NTT by up to 28% and 9%, respectively, by allowing two and one standard multiplications.

TI Quantum spin nematic phase in a square-lattice iridate
SO NATURE
AB Spin nematic is a magnetic analogue of classical liquid crystals, a fourth state of matter exhibiting characteristics of both liquid and solid1,2. Particularly intriguing is a valence-bond spin nematic3-5, in which spins are quantum entangled to form a multipolar order without breaking time-reversal symmetry, but its unambiguous experimental realization remains elusive. Here we establish a spin nematic phase in the square-lattice iridate Sr2IrO4, which approximately realizes a pseudospin one-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit6-9. Upon cooling, the transition into the spin nematic phase at TC approximate to 263 K is marked by a divergence in the static spin quadrupole susceptibility extracted from our Raman spectra and concomitant emergence of a collective mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetries. The quadrupolar order persists in the antiferromagnetic phase below TN approximate to 230 K and becomes directly observable through its interference with the antiferromagnetic order in resonant X-ray diffraction, which allows us to uniquely determine its spatial structure. Further, we find using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering a complete breakdown of coherent magnon excitations at short-wavelength scales, suggesting a many-body quantum entanglement in the antiferromagnetic state10,11. Taken together, our results reveal a quantum order underlying the Neel antiferromagnet that is widely believed to be intimately connected to the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity12,13.

TI Quantum Graph Neural Network Models for Materials Search
SO MATERIALS
AB Inspired by classical graph neural networks, we discuss a novel quantum graph neural network (QGNN) model to predict the chemical and physical properties of molecules and materials. QGNNs were investigated to predict the energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of small organic molecules. The models utilize the equivariantly diagonalizable unitary quantum graph circuit (EDU-QGC) framework to allow discrete link features and minimize quantum circuit embedding. The results show QGNNs can achieve lower test loss compared to classical models if a similar number of trainable variables are used, and converge faster in training. This paper also provides a review of classical graph neural network models for materials research and various QGNNs.

TI A Little Bit of Classical Magic to Achieve (Super-)Quantum Speedup
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce nebit, a classical bit with a signed probability distribution. We study its properties and basic transformations that can be applied to it. Then, we introduce a simple dynamical model - a classical random walk supplemented with nebits. We show that such a model exhibits some counterintuitive non-classical properties and that it can achieve or even exceed the speedup of Grover's quantum search algorithm. The proposed classical dynamics never reveals negativity of nebits and thus we do not need any operational interpretation of negative probabilities. We argue that nebits can be useful as a measure of non-classicality as well as a tool to find new quantum algorithms.

TI Experimental Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography via Parallel
   Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum state tomography (QST) via local measurements on reduced density matrices (LQST) is a promising approach but becomes impractical for large systems. To tackle this challenge, we developed an efficient quantum state tomography method inspired by quantum overlapping tomography [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 100401 (2020)], which utilizes parallel measurements (PQST). In contrast to LQST, PQST significantly reduces the number of measurements and offers more robustness against shot noise. Experimentally, we demonstrate the feasibility of PQST in a treelike superconducting qubit chip by designing high-efficiency circuits, preparing W states, ground states of Hamiltonians, and random states, and then reconstructing these density matrices using full quantum state tomography (FQST), LQST, and PQST. Our results show that PQST reduces measurement cost, achieving fidelities of 98.68% and 95.07% after measuring 75 and 99 observables for six-qubit and nine-qubit W states, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the largest density matrix of the 12-qubit W state is achieved with the similarity of 89.23% after just measuring 243 parallel observables, while 312 1/4 531 441 complete observables are needed for FQST. Consequently, PQST will be a useful tool for future tasks such as the reconstruction, characterization, benchmarking, and properties learning of states.

TI Efficient inference in the transverse field Ising model
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB In this paper we introduce an approximate method to solve the quantum cavity equations for transverse field Ising models. The method relies on a projective approximation of the exact cavity distributions of imaginary time trajectories (paths). A key feature, novel in the context of similar algorithms, is the explicit separation of the classical and quantum parts of the distributions. Numerical simulations show accurate results in comparison with the sampled solution of the cavity equations, the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (when possible) and other approximate inference methods in the literature. The computational complexity of this new algorithm scales linearly with the connectivity of the underlying lattice, enabling the study of highly connected networks, as the ones often encountered in quantum machine learning problems.

TI Quantum Behavior of a Heavy Impurity Strongly Coupled to a Bose Gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the problem of an infinitely heavy impurity interacting with a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. When the impurity-boson interactions are short-ranged, we show that boson-boson interactions induce a quantum blockade effect, where a single boson can effectively block or screen the impurity potential. Since this behavior depends on the quantum granular nature of the Bose gas, it cannot be captured within a standard classical-field description. Using a combination of exact quantum Monte Carlo methods and a truncated basis approach, we show how the quantum correlations between bosons lead to universal few-body bound states and a logarithmically slow dependence of the polaron ground-state energy on the boson-boson scattering length. Moreover, we expose the link between the polaron energy and the spatial structure of the quantum correlations, spanning the infrared to ultraviolet physics.

AB Dissipative quantum systems can under appropriate conditions exhibit bi- or multipartite entanglement at the steady state. The presence and properties of these quantum correlations depend on the relevant model parameters. Here, we characterize the steady-state entanglement in connection with the spatial structure of a small chain of three ions dispersively coupled with a pumped optical cavity. Within a semiclassical approximation, we describe the relation between entanglement, spatial organization, and vibrational modes of the ion chain. Upon increasing the pumping strength, our system undergoes a transition from a sliding to a pinned configuration, in which ions are expelled from the maxima of the optical potential. The features of the steady-state entanglement strongly depend on the kind of pinned configuration reached. We identify scenarios leading to entangled steady states, analyze the effect of defect formation upon entanglement between different system partitions, and observe the presence of multipartite quantum correlations.

TI Tensor network for anomaly detection in the latent space of proton
   collision events at the LHC
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models at the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this study, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parameterized matrix product state with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.

TI Testing spontaneous wavefunction collapse with quantum electromechanics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Theories of spontaneous wavefunction collapse offer an explanation of the possible breakdown of quantum mechanics for macroscopic systems. However, the challenge of resolving predicted collapse signatures above background noise has precluded conclusive tests. Here, we propose to overcome this challenge using quantum control and measurement of a superconducting qubit coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator. We show that this can amplify the weak signals from collapse-induced heating and simultaneously suppress qubit noise, initializing the qubit close to its ground state. Combined, this could enable a conclusive test of collapse models. The ability to quantum control macroscopic mechanical resonators and resolve extremely small signals from them could further other fundamental research beyond collapse models, such as laboratory-based dark matter searches and the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with gravity.

TI Superconducting Coupler with Exponentially Large On:Off Ratio
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Tunable two-qubit couplers offer an avenue to mitigate errors in multiqubit superconducting quantum processors. However, most couplers achieve this by fine tuning circuit parameters and often target specific couplings, such as the spurious ZZ interaction. We introduce a superconducting coupler that alleviates these limitations by suppressing all two-qubit interactions with an exponentially large on:off ratio and without the need for fine tuning. Our approach is based on a bus mode supplemented by an ancillary nonlinear resonator mode. Driving the ancillary mode leads to a coupler-state-dependent field displacement in the resonator that, in turn, results in an exponential suppression of real and virtual two-qubit interactions with respect to the drive power. A superconducting circuit implementation supporting the proposed mechanism is presented.

TI Efficient Learning of Quantum States Prepared With Few Fermionic
   Non-Gaussian Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an efficient algorithm for learning states on n fermion modes prepared by any number of Gaussian and at most t non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner mapping, this also includes n-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbor matchgate circuits with at most t SWAP gates. Our algorithm is based exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The sample and time complexity of our algorithm is poly(n, 2t); thus if t = O(log(n)), it is efficient. We also show that, if t scales slightly more than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an efficient property-testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state, determines whether such a state is far or close to the set of states for which our learning algorithm works. In addition to the outputs of quantum circuits, our tomography algorithm is efficient for some physical target states, such as those arising in time dynamics and low-energy physics of impurity models. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved upper bound on their circuit complexity, enabling an efficient circuit-compilation method.

TI Robustness of quantum coherence and quantum criticality in spin-1
   many-body system
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The tripartite quantum coherence for spin -21 and bipartite quantum coherence for spin-1 many-body systems are studied with the quantum renormalization group method to investigate the quantum criticality behaviour of both systems. We find both spin -21 and spin-1 systems exhibit quantum criticality behaviour after different number of iterations. However, the bipartite quantum coherence for spin-1 system reaches the quantum criticality behaviour in lesser number of iterations than the tripartite quantum coherence for spin -21 system. The quantum criticality behaviour of both systems is also investigated through non-analytic and the scaling behaviour of quantum coherence. Additionally, quantum correlations and quantum phase transition are observed to be more vigorous with higher spin comparatively to the number of parties (i.e., bipartite, tripartite, multipartite) involved in a quantum correlations.

AB In this article, the properties of quantum hash functions are further explored. Previous findings show that so-called small-bias sets (special subsets of the set of elements of a cyclic group) generate a "phase" quantum hash function. Here, it was proved that they also generate an "amplitude" quantum hash function. Namely, it turned out that constructing small-bias sets while generating amplitude quantum functions yields a well-balanced combination of the cryptographic properties of unidirectionality and collision resistance. As a corollary of the obtained theorem, a general statement about the generation of new amplitude quantum hash functions based on universal hash families and small-bias sets was proved.

TI Spatially correlated classical and quantum noise in driven qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Correlated noise across multiple qubits poses a significant challenge for achieving scalable and fault-tolerant quantum processors. Despite recent experimental efforts to quantify this noise in various qubit architectures, a comprehensive understanding of its role in qubit dynamics remains elusive. Here, we present an analytical study of the dynamics of driven qubits under spatially correlated noise, including both Markovian and non-Markovian noise. Surprisingly, we find that by operating the qubit system at low temperatures, where correlated quantum noise plays an important role, significant long-lived entanglement between qubits can be generated. Importantly, this generation process can be controlled on-demand by turning the qubit driving on and off. On the other hand, we demonstrate that by operating the system at a higher temperature, the crosstalk between qubits induced by the correlated noise is unexpectedly suppressed. We finally reveal the impact of spatio-temporally correlated 1/f noise on the decoherence rate, and how its temporal correlations restore lost entanglement. Our findings provide critical insights into not only suppressing crosstalk between qubits caused by correlated noise but also in effectively leveraging such noise as a beneficial resource for controlled entanglement generation.

TI Many-body entanglement via 'which-path' information
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a multi-particle 'which-path' gedanken experiment with a quantum detector. Contrary to conventional 'which-path' experiments, the detector maintains its quantum state during interactions with the particles. We show how such interactions can create an interference pattern that vanishes on average, as in conventional 'which-path' schemes, but contains hidden many-body quantum correlations. Measuring the state of the quantum detector projects the joint-particle wavefunction into highly entangled states, such as GHZ's. Conversely, measuring the particles projects the detector wavefunction into desired states, such as Schrodinger-cat or GKP states for a harmonic-oscillator detector, e.g., a photonic cavity. Our work thus opens a new path to the creation and exploration of many-body quantum correlations in systems not often associated with these phenomena, such as atoms in waveguide QED and free electrons in transmission electron microscopy.

TI Computable limits of optical multiple-access communications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is a valuable quantum resource in quantum information processing. In classical communication over quantum channels, it is known to boost the communication rate drastically. To generalize such a boost to more general scenarios, we provide computable limits on the communication over optical multiple-access channels (MACs) for both the entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. For the unassisted case, we generalize the coherent-state achievable rate region and outer bound known for the thermal-loss case [B. J. Yen and J. H. Shapiro, Phys. Rev. A 72, 062312 (2005)] to general bosonic Gaussian MACs. For the assisted case, we generalize the two-mode squeezed vacuum rate region and the outer bound for the thermal-loss case [H. Shi et al., npj Quantum Inf. 7, 74 (2021)] to general bosonic MACs. In terms of the total communication rate of all senders, we prove additivity for general MACs, generalizing the two-sender version in M.-H. Hsieh et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 54, 3078 (2008). Furthermore, for optical communication modeled as phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian MACs, we prove that the optimal total rate is achieved by Gaussian entanglement and therefore can be efficiently evaluated. The computable limits confirm entanglement's boosts in optical multiple-access communications. Finally, we formulate an entanglement-assisted version of minimum entropy conjecture, which leads to the additivity of the capacity region of phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian MACs if it is true.

TI Three qubits in less than three baths: Beyond two-body system-bath
   interactions in quantum refrigerators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that quantum absorption refrigerators, which have traditionally been studied as of three qubits, each of which is connected to a thermal reservoir, can also be constructed by using three qubits and two thermal baths, where two of the qubits, including the qubit to be locally cooled, are connected to a common bath. With a careful choice of the system, bath, and qubit-bath interaction parameters within the Born-Markov and rotating-wave approximations, one of the qubits attached to the common bath achieves a cooling in the steady state. We observe that the proposed refrigerator may also operate in a parameter regime where no or negligible steady-state cooling is achieved, but there is considerable transient cooling. The steady-state temperature can be lowered significantly by an increase in the strength of the few-body interaction terms existing due to the use of the common bath in the refrigerator setup. The proposed refrigerator built with three qubits and two baths is shown to provide steady-state cooling for both Markovian qubit-bath interactions between the qubits and canonical bosonic thermal reservoirs, and a simpler reset model for the qubit-bath interactions.

AB Identifying use cases with superconducting circuits not critically affected by the inherent noise is a pertinent challenge. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrable effects in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling the system's qubits to ancillary ones that are periodically reset. We compare the digital reset protocol to the usual Lindblad continuous-time evolution by considering non-interacting integrable systems dynamics, which can be analyzed using scattering between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles caused by the dissipation. If not dominant, the inherent noise would cause extra scattering but would not critically change the physics. A corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of stabilizing exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.

AB In this Letter, we show how to efficiently generate entanglement between two artificial giant atoms with photon-mediated interactions in a waveguide. Taking advantage of the adjustable decay processes of giant atoms into the waveguide and of the interference processes, spontaneous sudden birth of entanglement can be strongly enhanced with giant atoms. Highly entangled states can also be generated in the steady-state regime when the system is driven by a resonant classical field. We show that the statistics of the light emitted by the system can be used as a witness of the presence of entanglement in the system, since giant photon bunching is observed close to the regime of maximal entanglement. Given the degree of quantum correlations incoherently generated in this system, our results open a broad avenue for the generation of quantum correlations and manipulation of photon statistics in systems of giant atoms.

We show that, for a translationally invariant circuit, the compilation results in a fidelity gain that grows extensively in the size of the input circuit, outperforming any local or quasilocal compilation approach.

TI Engineering interactions by collective coupling of atom pairs to cavity
   photons for entanglement generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Engineering atom-atom interactions is essential both for controlling novel phases of matter and for efficient preparation of many-body entangled states, which are key resources in quantum communication, computation, and metrology. In this work, we propose a scheme to tailor these interactions by coupling driven atom pairs to optical cavity photons via a molecular state in the dispersive regime, resulting in an effective photon-fielddependent potential. As an illustrative example, by analyzing the quantum Fisher information, we show that such induced interactions can generate robust many-body entanglement in two-mode ultracold bosons in an optical cavity. By tuning the photon-induced interactions through the cavity drive, we identify conditions for preparing highly entangled states on timescales that mitigate decoherence due to photon loss. Our results show that entanglement formation rate scales strongly with both photon and atom number, dramatically reducing the timescale compared to bare atomic interactions. We also identify an optimal measurement for exploiting the metrological potential of the atomic state in an interferometric protocol with significant photon losses, saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we show that despite these losses the atomic state exhibits strong Bell correlations. Our results pave the way for engineering atom-atom interactions to study novel phases of light and matter in hybrid atom-photon systems, as well as for tailoring complex quantum states for new quantum technology protocols and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

TI Nanowrinkle waveguide in graphene for enabling secure Dirac fermion
   transport
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Localized states in graphene have garnered significant attention in quantum information science due to their potential applications. Despite graphene's superior transport and electronic properties compared to other semiconductors, achieving nanoscale confinement remains challenging due to its gapless nature. In this study, we explore the unique transport properties along nanowrinkles in monolayer graphene. We demonstrate the creation of a one-dimensional conduction channel by alternating pseudomagnetic fields along the nanowrinkle, enabling ballistic Dirac fermion transport without leakage. This suggests a feasible method for secure quantum information transfer over long distances. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to bent nanowrinkles, showcasing well-guided Dirac fermion propagation unless the bent angle is sufficiently large. Our demonstration of the nanowrinkle waveguide in graphene introduces a novel approach to controlling Dirac fermion transport through strain engineering, for quantum information technology applications.

AB The regime of strong coupling between photons and excitons gives rise to hybrid light-matter particles with fascinating properties and powerful implications for semiconductor quantum technologies. As the properties of excitons crucially depend on their host crystal, a rich field of exciton-polariton engineering opens by exploiting the diversity of semiconductors currently available. From dimensionality to binding energy to unusual orbitals, various materials provide different fundamental exciton properties that are often complementary, enabling vast engineering possibilities. This article aims to showcase some of the main materials for strong light-matter engineering, focusing on their fundamental complementarity and what this entails for future quantum technologies.

TI An Holistic Extension for Classical Logic via Quantum Fredkin Gate
SO ENTROPY
AB An holistic extension for classical propositional logic is introduced in the framework of quantum computation with mixed states. The mentioned extension is obtained by applying the quantum Fredkin gate to non-factorizable bipartite states. In particular, an extended notion of classical contradiction is studied in this holistic framework.

TI The QQUIC Transport Protocol: Quantum-Assisted UDP Internet Connections
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution, initialized in 1984, is a commercialized secure communication method that enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key using quantum mechanics. We propose a QQUIC (Quantum-assisted Quick UDP Internet Connections) transport protocol, which modifies the well-known QUIC transport protocol by employing quantum key distribution instead of the original classical algorithms in the key exchange stage. Due to the provable security of quantum key distribution, the security of the QQUIC key does not depend on computational assumptions. It is possible that, surprisingly, QQUIC can reduce network latency in some circumstances even compared with QUIC. To achieve this, the attached quantum connections are used as the dedicated lines for key generation.

TI Bell Inequality Violation of Light Quarks in Dihadron Pair Production at
   Lepton Colliders 1,*2,3,†
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spin correlations between particles produced at colliders provide valuable insights for quantum information studies. While traditional studies of quantum information at colliders are typically limited to massive particles with perturbative decay, we propose an innovative method to explore the Bell inequality in massless quark pair systems by analyzing the azimuthal correlations in pi+pi- dihadron pair production at lepton colliders. Revisiting the Belle data, we have shown the potential to detect Bell inequality violation of light quarks by introducing an additional angular cut, achieving a significance of 2.56 even in the worst-case scenario of 100% correlated systematic uncertainties in each bin. The significance substantially exceeds 56 when considering uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. Our approach opens avenues for exploring spin quantum information with nonperturbative processes as spin analyzer and leverages existing data for quantum information research.

TI Photon-added deformed spin coherent states and bipartite entanglement
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In present manuscript, we build the photon-added deformed spin coherent states (PA-DSCSs) according to deformed spin algebra (DSA). We present the way for solving the unity operator problem and we give the solution for some particular cases. The obtained states are developed through the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) realization of the DSA. The statistical features of the obtained coherent states are examined through the variation of the Mandel's parameter. By using the PA-DSCSs, we investigate the bipartite entanglement with respect to different parameters of these states.

TI Estimating expectation values using approximate quantum states
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce an approximate description of an N-qubit state, which contains sufficient information to estimate the expectation value of any observable to a precision that is upper bounded by the ratio of a suitably-defined seminorm of the observable to the square root of the number of the system's identical preparations M, with no explicit dependence on N. We describe an operational procedure for constructing the approximate description of the state that requires, besides the quantum state preparation, only single-qubit rotations followed by single-qubit measurements. We show that following this procedure, the cardinality of the resulting description of the state grows as 3MN. We test the proposed method on Rigetti's quantum processor unit with 12, 16 and 25 qubits for random states and random observables, and find an excellent agreement with the theory, despite experimental errors.

TI One- and two-dimensional quantum lattice algorithms for Maxwell
   equations in inhomogeneous scalar dielectric media I: theory
SO RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS
AB A quantum lattice algorithm (QLA) is developed for Maxwell equations in scalar dielectric media using the Riemann-Silberstein representation on a Cartesian grid. For x-dependent and y-dependent dielectric inhomogeneities, the corresponding QLA requires a minimum of 8 qubits/spatial lattice site. This is because the corresponding Pauli spin matrices have off-diagonal components which permit the local collisional entanglement of these qubits. However, z-dependent inhomogeneities require a QLA with a minimum of 16 qubits/lattice site since the Pauli spin matrix sigma(z) is diagonal. For two-dimensional inhomogeneities, one can readily couple the 8- 8 qubit schemes for x-y variations. z-x and y-z variations can be treated by either a 16-8 qubit scheme or a 16-16 qubit representation.

TI Research on information hiding and recognition technology of halftone
   prints based on mobile phone
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB This paper studies the method of embedding printing quantum information in the printed image and identifying whether the image carries hidden information by comparing the eigenvalues of the gray-level cooccurrence matrix of the image. The anti-counterfeiting performance of the halftone hidden image after the embedded printed quantum information is analyzed through a combination of subjective and objective methods. The results show that the anti-counterfeiting performance of the image is not affected after the embedded printed quantum information. The encrypted image and the unencrypted image are in the ASM energy, entropy. The difference between differential entropy is obvious. The halftone information hiding algorithm proposed in this paper provides a new idea for realizing the display of halftone hidden information on the mobile terminal.

TI Probing chaos by magic monotones
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB There is a property of a quantum state called "magic." As shown by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, so-called stabilizer states, which are composed of only Clifford gates, can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, and thus quantum computation gives no advantage. Nonstabilizer states are called magic states, which are necessary to achieve the universal quantum computation. Magic (monotone) is the measure of the amount of nonstabilizer resource, and it measures how difficult it is for a classical computer to simulate the state. We study magic of states in the integrable and chaotic regimes of the higher-spin generalization of the Ising model through two quantities: "mana" and "robustness of magic" (RoM). We find that in the chaotic regime, mana increases monotonically in time in the early-time region, and at late times these quantities oscillate around some nonzero value that increases linearly with respect to the system size. Our result also suggests that under chaotic dynamics, any state evolves to a state whose mana almost saturates the optimal upper bound; i.e., the state becomes "maximally magical." We find that RoM also shows similar behaviors. On the other hand, in the integrable regime, mana and RoM behave periodically in time in contrast to the chaotic case. In addition to mana and RoM, for the early-time behavior of magic, we study the stabilizer Re ' nyi entropy, which can be numerically computed for larger systems than mana and RoM. In the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, classical spacetime emerges from the chaotic nature of the dual quantum system. Our results suggest that magic of quantum states is strongly involved in the emergence of spacetime geometry.

TI Simple realization of a hybrid controlled-controlled-Z gate with
   photonic control qubits encoded via eigenstates of the photon-number
   parity operator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose a simple method to realize a hybrid controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate with two photonic qubits simultaneously controlling a superconducting (SC) target qubit, by employing two microwave cavities coupled to a SC ququart (a four-level quantum system). In this proposal, each control qubit is a photonic qubit, which is encoded by two arbitrary orthogonal eigenstates (with eigenvalues +/- 1, respectively) of the photon-number parity operator. Since the two arbitrary encoding states can take various quantum states, this proposal can be applied to realize the hybrid CCZ gate, for which the two control photonic qubits can have various encodings. The gate realization is quite simple because only a basic operation is needed. During the gate operation, the higher energy intermediate levels of the ququart are not occupied, and, thus, decoherence from these levels is greatly suppressed. We further discuss how to apply this gate to generate a hybrid Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state of a SC qubit and two photonic qubits, which takes a general form. As an example, our numerical simulation demonstrates that high-fidelity generation of a cat-cat-spin hybrid GHZ state is feasible within current circuit QED technology. This proposal is quite general, which can be applied to realize the hybrid CCZ gate as well as to prepare various hybrid GHZ states of a matter qubit and two photonic qubits in other physical systems, such as two microwave or optical cavities coupled to a four-level natural or artificial atom.

TI Osteoarthritis Classification Using Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural
   Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This work explores the integration of quantum computing within a classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework, leveraging a VGG16 model enhanced with a quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for the classification of knee osteoarthritis (OA) severity. A custom quantum layer was incorporated to boost the model's feature extraction capabilities, enabling effective differentiation between healthy and OA-affected knees in medical imaging data. The model utilises the Swish activation function, which combines smoothness and nonlinearity to enhance learning efficiency and gradient flow, which are critical in complex diagnostic tasks. Using a QCNN, this model harnesses the ability of quantum computing to represent high-dimensional data transformations, a novel approach that complements classical CNN layers by exploring patterns that are not captured in traditional networks. The initial results showed a high classification accuracy of 97.26%, suggesting that quantum-enhanced layers can significantly bolster feature extraction and classification in medical diagnostics. Furthermore, multiple variations of pre-trained models with Quantum Convolutional Layers, such as XceptionNet, ResNet, and InceptionNet, were developed and compared in terms of the evaluation metrics that achieved 87.84,89.70, and 86.64, respectively. This hybrid VGG16-QCNN model showed the highest accuracy, demonstrating the potential of QCNNs in advancing the precision and scalability of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

TI QUANTUM INSPIRED CHAOTIC SALP SWARM OPTIMIZATION FOR DYNAMIC
   OPTIMIZATION
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE-AGH
AB Many real-world problems are dynamic optimization problems that are unknown beforehand. In practice, unpredictable events such as the arrival of new jobs, due date changes, and reservation cancellations, changes in parameters or constraints make the search environment dynamic. Many algorithms are designed to deal with stationary optimization problems, but these algorithms do not face dynamic optimization problems or manage them correctly. Although some optimization algorithms are proposed to deal with the changes in dynamic environments differently, there are still areas of improvement in existing algorithms due to limitations or drawbacks, especially in terms of locating and following the previously identified optima. With this in mind, we studied a variant of SSA known as QSSO, which integrates the principles of quantum computing. An attempt is made to improve the overall performance of standard SSA to deal with the dynamic environment effectively by locating and tracking the global optima for DOPs. This work is an extension of the proposed new algorithm QSSO, known as the Quantum-inspired Chaotic Salp Swarm Optimization (QCSSO) Algorithm, which details the various approaches considered while solving DOPs. A chaotic operator is employed with quantum computing to respond to change and guarantee to increase individual searchability by improving population diversity and the speed at which the algorithm converges. We experimented by evaluating QCSSO on a well-known generalized dynamic benchmark problem (GDBG) provided for CEC 2009, followed by a comparative numerical study with well-regarded algorithms. As promised, the introduced QCSSO is discovered as the rival algorithm for DOPs.

TI The quantum frontier of software engineering: A systematic mapping study
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Quantum computing is becoming a reality, and quantum software engineering (QSE) is emerging as a new discipline to enable developers to design and develop quantum programs. Objective: This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the current state of QSE research, aiming to identify the most investigated topics, the types and number of studies, the main reported results, and the most studied quantum computing tools/frameworks. Additionally, the study aims to explore the research community's interest in QSE, how it has evolved, and any prior contributions to the discipline before its formal introduction through the Talavera Manifesto. Method: We searched for relevant articles in several databases and applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select the most relevant studies. After evaluating the quality of the selected resources, we extracted relevant data from the primary studies and analyzed them. Results: We found that QSE research has primarily focused on software testing, with little attention given to other topics, such as software engineering management. The most commonly studied technology for techniques and tools is Qiskit, although, in most studies, either multiple or none specific technologies were employed. The researchers most interested in QSE are interconnected through direct collaborations, and several strong collaboration clusters have been identified. Most articles in QSE have been published in non-thematic venues, with a preference for conferences. Conclusions: The study's implications are providing a centralized source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field, facilitating knowledge transfer, and contributing to the advancement and growth of QSE.

TI Quasi-Perfect state transfer in spin chains via parametrization of
   on-site energies
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.

TI Full-Permutation Dynamical Decoupling in Triple-Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dynamical decoupling of spin qubits in silicon can increase fidelity and can be used to extract the frequency spectra of noise processes. We demonstrate a full-permutation dynamical decoupling technique that cyclically exchanges the spins in a triple-quantum-dot qubit. This sequence not only suppresses both low-frequency charge-noise-induced and magnetic-noise-induced errors; it also refocuses leakage errors to first order, which is particularly interesting for encoded exchange-only qubits. For a specific construction, which we call "NZ1y," the qubit is isolated from error sources to such a degree that we measure a remarkable exchange pulse error of 2.8 x 10-5. This sequence maintains a quantum state for roughly 18,000 exchange pulses, extending the qubit coherence from T2 & lowast; = 2 mu s to T2 = 720 mu s. We experimentally validate an error model that includes 1/f charge noise and 1/f magnetic noise in two ways: by direct exchange-qubit simulation and by integration of the assumed noise spectra with derived filter functions, both of which reproduce the measured error and leakage with respect to a change of the repetition rate.

TI A systematic decision-making framework for tackling quantum software
   engineering challenges
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing systems harness the power of quantum mechanics to execute computationally demanding tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. This has led to the emergence of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE), which focuses on unlocking the full potential of quantum computing systems. As QSE gains prominence, it seeks to address the evolving challenges of quantum software development by offering comprehensive concepts, principles, and guidelines. This paper aims to identify, prioritize, and develop a systematic decision-making framework of the challenging factors associated with QSE process execution. We conducted a literature survey to identify the challenging factors associated with QSE process and mapped them into 7 core categories. Additionally, we used a questionnaire survey to collect insights from practitioners regarding these challenges. To examine the relationships between core categories of challenging factors, we applied Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM). Lastly, we applied fuzzy TOPSIS to rank the identified challenging factors concerning to their criticality for QSE process. We have identified 22 challenging factors of QSE process and mapped them to 7 core categories. The ISM results indicate that the 'resources' category has the most decisive influence on the other six core categories of the identified challenging factors. Moreover, the fuzzy TOPSIS indicates that 'complex programming', 'limited software libraries', 'maintenance complexity', 'lack of training and workshops', and 'data encoding issues' are the highest priority challenging factor for QSE process execution. Organizations using QSE could consider the identified challenging factors and their prioritization to improve their QSE process.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is ubiquitous in the analysis of driven and coupled resonators. However, the limitations of the RWA seem to be poorly understood and in some cases the RWA disposes of essential physics. We investigate the RWA in the context of electrical circuits. Using a classical Hamiltonian approach, we find that by balancing electrical and magnetic components of the resonator drive or resonator-resonator coupling, the RWA can be made exact. This type of balance, in which the RWA is exact, has applications in superconducting qubits, where it suppresses nutation normally associated with strong Rabi driving. In the context of dispersive readout, balancing the qubit-resonator coupling changes the qubit leakage induced by the resonator drive but does not remove it in the case of the transmon qubit.

TI A Comprehensive Review of MI-HFE and IPHFE Cryptosystems: Advances in
   Internal Perturbations for Post-Quantum Security
SO AXIOMS
AB The RSA cryptosystem has been a cornerstone of modern public key infrastructure; however, recent advancements in quantum computing and theoretical mathematics pose significant risks to its security. The advent of fully operational quantum computers could enable the execution of Shor's algorithm, which efficiently factors large integers and undermines the security of RSA and other cryptographic systems reliant on discrete logarithms. While Grover's algorithm presents a comparatively lesser threat to symmetric encryption, it still accelerates key search processes, creating potential vulnerabilities. In light of these challenges, there has been an intensified focus on developing quantum-resistant cryptography. Current research is exploring cryptographic techniques based on error-correcting codes, lattice structures, and multivariate public key systems, all of which leverage the complexity of NP-hard problems, such as solving multivariate quadratic equations, to ensure security in a post-quantum landscape. This paper reviews the latest advancements in quantum-resistant encryption methods, with particular attention to the development of robust trapdoor functions. It also provides a detailed analysis of prominent multivariate cryptosystems, including the Matsumoto-Imai, Oil and Vinegar, and Polly Cracker schemes, alongside recent progress in lattice-based systems such as Kyber and Crystals-DILITHIUM, which are currently under evaluation by NIST for potential standardization. As the capabilities of quantum computing continue to expand, the need for innovative cryptographic solutions to secure digital communications becomes increasingly critical.

TI Symplectic decomposition from submatrix determinants
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB An important theorem in Gaussian quantum information tells us that we can diagonalize the covariance matrix of any Gaussian state via a symplectic transformation. While the diagonal form is easy to find, the process for finding the diagonalizing symplectic can be more difficult, and a common, existing method requires taking matrix powers, which can be demanding analytically. Inspired by a recently presented technique for finding the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix from certain submatrix eigenvalues, we derive a similar method for finding the diagonalizing symplectic from certain submatrix determinants, which could prove useful in Gaussian quantum information.

TI Observation of the Rotational Doppler Effect With Structured Beams in
   Atomic Vapor
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB A vector beam with the spatial variation polarization has attracted keen interest and is progressively applied in quantum information, quantum communication, precision measurement, and so on. In this letter, the spectrum observation of the rotational Doppler effect based on the coherent interaction between atoms and structured light in an atomic vapor is realized. The geometric phase and polarization of the structured beam are generated and manipulated by using a flexible and efficacious combination optical elements, converting an initial linearly polarized Gaussian beam into a phase vortex beam or an asymmetric or symmetric vector beam. These three representative types of structured beam independently interact with atoms under a longitudinal magnetic field to explore the rotational Doppler shift associated with the topological charge. We find that the rotational Doppler broadening increases obviously with the topological charge of the asymmetric and symmetric vector beam. There is no rotational Doppler broadening observed from the spectrum of the phase vortex beam, although the topological charge, and spatial profile of the beam change. This study can be applied to estimate the rotational velocity of the atom-level or molecule-level objects, measure the intensity of magnetic fields and study the quantum coherence in atomic ensembles.

AB We study the complexity of learning quantum states in various models with respect to the stabilizer formalism and obtain the following results:
   center dot We prove that a linear number T-gates are necessary for any Clifford+T circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, an exponential improvement over the previously known bound. This bound is asymptotically tight if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist.
   center dot Given an n-qubit pure quantum state |psi  that has fidelity at least tau with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least tau - epsilon. The algorithm uses O(n/(epsilon(2)iota(4))) samples and exp(O(n/tau(4))) / epsilon(2) time. In the regime of tau constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially faster than the naive exp(O(n(2)))-time brute-force algorithm over all stabilizer states.
   center dot In the special case of tau > cos(2)(Pi/8), we show that a modification of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.
   center dot We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.
   The underlying algorithmic primitive in all of our results is Bell difference sampling. To prove our results, we establish and/or strengthen connections between Bell difference sampling, symplectic Fourier analysis, and graph theory.

TI Engineering Spin-Orbit Interactions in Silicon Qubits at the
   Atomic-Scale
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Spin-orbit interactions arise whenever the bulk inversion symmetry and/or structural inversion symmetry of a crystal is broken providing a bridge between a qubit's spin and orbital degree of freedom. While strong interactions can facilitate fast qubit operations by all-electrical control, they also provide a mechanism to couple charge noise thereby limiting qubit lifetimes. Previously believed to be negligible in bulk silicon, recent silicon nano-electronic devices have shown larger than bulk spin-orbit coupling strengths from Dresselhaus and Rashba couplings. Here, it is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms in silicon along the [110] direction (without inversion symmetry) or [111] direction (with inversion symmetry), a wide range of Dresselhaus and Rashba coupling strength can be achieved from zero to 1113 x 10-13eV-cm. It is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms, the local symmetry (C2v, D2d, and D3d) can be changed to engineer spin-orbit interactions. Since spin-orbit interactions affect both qubit operation and lifetimes, understanding their impact is essential for quantum processor design.
   Different Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit strengths from 0 - 1113 x 10-13 eV cm for spin qubits can be engineered by placing phosphorus atoms in different lattice locations in the silicon crystal. The charge noise induced spin relaxation can therefore be minimized when there is no effective spin-orbit coupling. The results are verified by experimental measurements, atomistic simulations, and symmetry analysis. image

TI Demonstration of optimal non-projective measurement of binary coherent
   states with photon counting
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum state discrimination is a central problem in quantum measurement theory, with applications spanning from quantum communication to computation. Typical measurement paradigms for state discrimination involve a minimum probability of error or unambiguous discrimination with a minimum probability of inconclusive results. Alternatively, an optimal inconclusive measurement, a non-projective measurement, achieves minimal error for a given inconclusive probability. This more general measurement encompasses the standard measurement paradigms for state discrimination and provides a much more powerful tool for quantum information and communication. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal inconclusive measurement for the discrimination of binary coherent states using linear optics and single-photon detection. Our demonstration uses coherent displacement operations based on interference, single-photon detection, and fast feedback to prepare the optimal feedback policy for the optimal non-projective quantum measurement with high fidelity. This generalized measurement allows us to transition among standard measurement paradigms in an optimal way from minimum error to unambiguous measurements for binary coherent states. As a particular case, we use this general measurement to implement the optimal minimum error measurement for phase-coherent states, which is the optimal modulation for communications under the average power constraint. Moreover, we propose a hybrid measurement that leverages the binary optimal inconclusive measurement in conjunction with sequential, unambiguous state elimination to realize higher dimensional inconclusive measurements of coherent states.

TI An operator algebraic approach to black hole information
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present an operator algebraic perspective on the black hole information problem. For a black hole after Page time that is entangled with the early radiation we formulate a version of the information puzzle that is well-posed in the G -> 0 limit. We then give a description of the information recovery protocol in terms of von Neumann algebras using elements of the Jones index theory of type II1 subfactors. The subsequent evaporation and recovery steps are represented by Jones's basic construction, and an operation called the canonical shift. A central element in our description is the Jones projection, which leads to an entanglement swap and implements an operator algebraic version of a quantum teleportation protocol. These aspects are further elaborated on in a microscopic model based on type I algebras. Finally, we argue that in the emergent type III algebra the canonical shift may be interpreted as a spacetime translation and, hence, that at the microscopic level "translation = teleportation".

TI From square plaquettes to triamond lattices for SU(2) gauge theory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Lattice gauge theory should be able to address significant new scientific questions when implemented on quantum computers. In practice, error-mitigation techniques have already allowed encouraging progress on small lattices. In this work we focus on a truncated version of SU(2) gauge theory, which is a familiar non-Abelian step toward quantum chromodynamics. First, we demonstrate effective error mitigation for imaginary time evolution on a lattice having two square plaquettes, obtaining the ground state using an IBM quantum computer and observing that this would have been impossible without error mitigation. Then we propose the triamond lattice as an expedient approach to lattice gauge theories in three spatial dimensions and we derive the Hamiltonian. Finally, error-mitigated imaginary time evolution is applied to the three-dimensional triamond unit cell, and its ground state is obtained from an IBM quantum computer. Future work will want to relax the truncation on the gauge fields, and the triamond lattice is increasingly valuable for such studies.
   When implemented on quantum computers, lattice gauge theory should be able to address significant new scientific questions about quarks and gluons. The authors of this paper replace the traditional Cartesian lattice by one that has unique symmetry properties, and they use this new lattice to perform an error-mitigated quantum computer calculation.

TI A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near-Infrared Emission
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM-TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky-blue color and near-infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in "just the right positions", allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In-depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.
   A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM-I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM-TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature. image

TI Two-photon interferences of weak coherent lights
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Multiphoton interference is an important phenomenon in modern quantum mechanics and experimental quantum optics, and it is fundamental for the development of quantum information science and technologies. Over the last three decades, several theoretical and experimental studies have been performed to understand the essential principles underlying such interference and to explore potential applications. Recently, the two-photon interference (TPI) of phase-randomized weak coherent states has played a key role in the realization of long-distance quantum communication based on the use of classical light sources. In this context, we investigated TPI experiments with weak coherent pulses at the single-photon level and quantitatively analyzed the results in terms of the single- and coincidence-counting rates and one- and two-photon interference-fringe shapes. We experimentally examined the Hong-Ou-Mandel-type TPI of phase-randomized weak coherent pulses to compare the TPI effect with that of correlated photons. Further experiments were also performed with two temporally- and spatially separated weak coherent pulses. Although the observed interference results, including the results of visibility and fringe shape, can be suitably explained by classical intensity correlation, the physics underlying the TPI effect needs to be interpreted as the interference between the two-photon states at the single-photon level within the utilized interferometer. The results of this study can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the TPI of coherent light at the single-photon level.

AB Optimal rates for achieving an information processing task are often characterized in terms of regularized information measures. In many cases of quantum tasks, we do not know how to compute such quantities. Here, we exploit the symmetries in the recently introduced D-# in order to obtain a hierarchy of semidefinite programming bounds on various regularized quantities. As applications, we give a general procedure to give efficient bounds on the regularized Umegaki channel divergence as wen as the classical capacity and two-way assisted quantum capacity of quantum channels. In particular, we obtain slight improvements for the capacity of the amplitude damping channel. We also prove that for fixed input and output dimensions, the regularized sandwiched Renyi divergence between any two quantum channels can he approximated up to an c accuracy in time that is polynomial in 1/epsilon.

TI Average-Case Speedup for Product Formulas
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum simulation is a promising application of future quantum computers. Product formulas, or Trotterization, are the oldest and still remain an appealing method to simulate quantum systems. For an accurate product formula approximation, the state-of-the-art gate complexity depends on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and a local energy estimate. In this work, we give evidence that product formulas, in practice, may work much better than expected. We prove that the Trotter error exhibits a qualitatively better scaling for the vast majority of input states, while the existing estimate is for the worst states. For general k-local Hamiltonians and higher-order product formulas, we obtain gate count estimates for input states drawn from any orthogonal basis. The gate complexity significantly improves over the worst case for systems with large connectivity. Our typical-case results generalize to Hamiltonians with Fermionic terms, with input states drawn from a fixed-particle number subspace, and with Gaussian coefficients (e.g., the SYK models). Technically, we employ a family of simple but versatile inequalities from non-commutative martingales called uniform smoothness, which leads to Hypercontractivity, namely p-norm estimates for k-local operators. This delivers concentration bounds via Markov's inequality. For optimality, we give analytic and numerical examples that simultaneously match our typical-case estimates and the existing worst-case estimates. Therefore, our improvement is due to asking a qualitatively different question, and our results open doors to the study of quantum algorithms in the average case.

Specifically, by working with spin chains with about ten qubits and in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature T, we show that it is possible to locate with an error of only a few percents the correct spots of the QCPs for almost all the models studied here. The spin chains we investigate are given by the XXZ model with or without an external longitudinal magnetic field as well as the XX model, the XY model and the Ising model, all of them subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.

Near the t (t) over bar threshold, entanglement observables are enhanced by suppressing the contribution of q (q) over bar subprocesses, which is achieved by a simple cut on the velocity of the t (t) over bar system in the laboratory frame. Furthermore, we design new observables that directly measure the relevant combinations of t (t) over bar spin correlation coefficients involved in the measurement of entanglement and Bell inequalities. As a result, the statistical sensitivity is enhanced, up to a factor of 7 for Bell inequalities near threshold.

TI Quantum simulations of SO(5) many-fermion systems using qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Background: The structure and dynamics of many -body systems are the result of a delicate interplay between underlying interactions. Fermionic pairing, for example, plays a central role in various physical systems, ranging from condensed matter to nuclear systems, where it can lead to collective phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity. In atomic nuclei, the interplay between pairing and particle -hole interactions leads to a high degree of complexity and intricate entanglement structures. Despite this apparent complexity, symmetries emerge and manifest themselves in observable regular patterns. These symmetries and their breakings have long been used to determine relevant degrees of freedom and simplify classical descriptions of many -body systems. Purpose: This work explores the potential utility of quantum computers with arrays of qudits in simulating interacting fermionic systems, when the qudits can naturally map the relevant degrees of freedom determined by an underlying symmetry group. Method: The Agassi model of fermions interacting via particle -hole and pairing interactions is based on an underlying so(5) algebra. Such systems can intuitively be partitioned into pairs of modes with five basis states, which thus naturally map to arrays of d = 5 qudits (qu5its). Classical noiseless simulations of the time evolution of systems with up to twelve qu5its are performed, by implementing quantum circuits that are developed herein, using PYTHON codes invoking Google's CIRQ software. The resource requirements of the qu5it circuits are analyzed and compared with two different mappings to qubit systems: a physics -aware Jordan-Wigner mapping requiring four qubits per mode pair and a state -to -state mapping requiring three qubits per mode pair. Results: While the dimensionality of Hilbert spaces in mappings to qu5it systems are less than those for the corresponding qubit systems, the number of entangling operations, depending on the available hardware, can either be greater or smaller than for the physics -aware Jordan-Wigner mapping. The state -to -state mapping, while having a smaller Hilbert space than Jordan-Wigner mappings, appears to be the least efficient in gate counts. Further, a previously unknown sign problem has been identified from Trotterization errors in time evolving high-energy excitations. Conclusions: There appear to be advantages in employing quantum computers with arrays of qudits to perform simulations of many -body dynamics that exploit the role of underlying symmetries, specifically in lowering the required quantum resources and in reducing anticipated errors that take the simulation out of the physical space. If the necessary entangling gates are not directly supported by the hardware, physics -aware mappings to qubits may, however, be advantageous for other aspects.

AB Reinforcement learning has driven impressive advances in machine learning. Simultaneously, quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms using quantum annealing underlie heavy developments. Recently, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architecture combining both paradigms has been proposed. This novel algorithm, which utilizes Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for Q-value approximation has outperformed regular deep reinforcement learning in terms of time-steps needed to converge. However, this algorithm was restricted to single-agent and small 2x2 multi-agent grid domains. In this work, we propose an extension to the original concept in order to solve more challenging problems. Similar to classic DQNs, we add an experience replay buffer and use different networks for approximating the target and policy values. The experimental results show that learning becomes more stable and enables agents to find optimal policies in grid-domains with higher complexity. Additionally, we assess how parameter sharing influences the agents' behavior in multi-agent domains. Quantum sampling proves to be a promising method for reinforcement learning tasks, but is currently limited by the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) size and therefore by the size of the input and Boltzmann machine.

TI Optical mode conversion via spatiotemporally modulated atomic
   susceptibility
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Light is an excellent medium for both classical and quantum information transmission due to its speed, manipulability, and abundant degrees of freedom into which to encode information. Recently, space-division multiplexing has gained attention as a means to substantially increase the rate of information transfer by utilizing sets of infinite-dimensional propagation eigenmodes such as the Laguerre-Gaussian "donut" modes. Encoding in these high-dimensional spaces necessitates devices capable of manipulating photonic degrees of freedom with high efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate controlling the optical susceptibility of an atomic sample can be used as powerful tool for manipulating the degrees of freedom of light that pass through the sample. Utilizing this tool, we demonstrate photonic mode conversion between two Laguerre-Gaussian modes of a twisted optical cavity with high efficiency. We spatiotemporally modulate the optical susceptibility of an atomic sample that sits at the cavity waist using an auxiliary Stark-shifting beam, in effect creating a mode-coupling optic that converts modes of orbital angular momentum l = 3 -> l = 0. The internal conversion efficiency saturates near unity as a function of the atom number and modulation beam intensity, finding application in topological few-body state preparation, quantum communication, and potential development as a flexible tabletop device.

TI Resonant tunneling in natural photosynthetic systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The high internal quantum efficiency observed in higher plants remains an outstanding problem in understanding photosynthesis. Several approaches such as quantum entanglement and quantum coherence have been explored. However, none has yet drawn an analogy between superlattices and the geometrical structure of granal thylakoids in leaves. In this paper, we calculate the transmission coefficients and perform numerical simulations using the parameters relevant to a stack of thylakoid discs. We then show that quantum resonant tunneling can occur at low effective mass of particles for 680 nm and 700 nm incident wavelengths corresponding to energies at which photosynthesis occurs.

TI Non-Markovian measure independent of initial states of open systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, quantifying non-Markovian effect in open quantum system has become an important subject in the quantum decoherence control field. In this paper, a non-Markovian measure independent of the initial state of open system is proposed, thereby extending non-Markovian measure based on quantum Fisher information from the case where the initial state of the system is a pure state to the case where the initial state of the system is an arbitrary mixed state. As its application, the non-Markovian process is quantified by quantum Fisher information about a two-level system undergoing the three well-known dissipative channels, i.e. amplitude dissipative channel, phase damping channel, and random unitary channel. The results show that the conditions of non-Markovian processes in the three dissipative channels are independent of the selection of the initial state of the system by means of the quantum Fisher information of a phase parameter. Further, for amplitude dissipation channel and phase damping channel, the conditions for the non-Markovian processes to occur are equivalent to those given by trace distance, divisibility, quantum mutual information, quantum Fisher-information matrix, et al. As expected, for the case of amplitude dissipation channel, the corresponding results can reduce to the one in other paper (Lu X M, Wang X G, Sun C P 2010 Phys. Rev. A 82 042103) by selecting the initial state of the system as an optimal pure state. However, for random unitary channel, the conditions of non-Markovian process are not equivalent to those for other measures. In addition, we also obtain an interesting relationship between quantum Fisher information and quantum coherence of the open system in the three dissipative channels, namely the square of quantum l(1) coherence for the evolved state of system is exactly equal to the quantum Fisher information of the phase parameter. In a word, the obtained results not only improve the application scope of using the quantum Fisher information to detect non-Markovian effects in open systems, but also further highlight its important role in quantum information processing.

TI Boosting projective methods for quantum process and detector tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce two methods for quantum process and detector tomography. In the quantum process tomography method, we develop an analytical procedure for projecting the linear inversion estimation of a quantum channel onto the set of completely positive trace-preserving matrices. By integrating this method with alternate projection techniques, we achieve a three-order-of-magnitude improvement in approximating the closest quantum channel to an arbitrary Hermitian matrix compared to existing methods without compromising computational efficiency. Our second method extends this approach to quantum detector tomography, demonstrating superior efficiency compared to current techniques. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate our protocols across channels of up to four qubits in quantum process tomography and systems of up to six qubits in quantum detector tomography, showcasing superior precision and efficiency.

TI Polar Codes for Quantum Reading
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum readout provides a general framework for formulating statistical discrimination of quantum channels. Several paths have been taken for such this problem. However, there is much to be done in the avenue of optimizing channel discrimination using classical codes. At least two open questions can be pointed out: how to construct low complexity encoding schemes that are interesting for channel discrimination and, more importantly, how to develop capacity-achieving protocols. This paper aims at presenting a solution to these questions using polar codes. Firstly, we characterize the information rate and reliability parameter of the channels under polar encoding. We also show that the error probability of the scheme proposed decays exponentially with the square root of the code length. Secondly, an analysis of the optimal quantum states to be used as probes is given.

In addition, we give a procedure for constructing a matrix whose isospectral reduction down to a submatrix is given. We also prove that the isospectral reduction completely determines the restriction of the quantum walk transition matrix to a subset. Using these, we construct new families of simple graphs exhibiting perfect quantum state transfer.

TI Experimental demonstration of improved quantum optimization with linear
   Ising penalties
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The standard approach to encoding constraints in quantum optimization is the quadratic penalty method. Quadratic penalties introduce additional couplings and energy scales, which can be detrimental to the performance of a quantum optimizer. In quantum annealing experiments performed on a D-Wave Advantage, we explore an alternative penalty method that only involves linear Ising terms and apply it to a customer data science problem. Our findings support our hypothesis that the linear Ising penalty method should improve the performance of quantum optimization compared to using the quadratic penalty method due to its more efficient use of physical resources. Although the linear Ising penalty method is not guaranteed to exactly implement the desired constraint in all cases, it is able to do so for the majority of problem instances we consider. For problems with many constraints, where making all penalties linear is unlikely to be feasible, we investigate strategies for combining linear Ising penalties with quadratic penalties to satisfy constraints for which the linear method is not well-suited. We find that this strategy is most effective when the penalties that contribute most to limiting the dynamic range are removed.

TI Evaluating the job shop scheduling problem on a D-wave quantum annealer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Job Shop Scheduling is a combinatorial optimization problem of particular importance for production environments where the goal is to complete a production task in the shortest possible time given limitations in the resources available. Due to its computational complexity it quickly becomes intractable for problems of interesting size. The emerging technology of Quantum Annealing provides an alternative computational architecture that promises improved scalability and solution quality. However, several limitations as well as open research questions exist in this relatively new and rapidly developing technology. This paper studies the application of quantum annealing to solve the job shop scheduling problem, describing each step required from the problem formulation to the fine-tuning of the quantum annealer and compares the solution quality with various classical solvers. Particular attention is devoted to aspects that are often overlooked, such as the computational cost of representing the problem in the formulation required by the quantum annealer, the relative qubits requirements and how to mitigate chain breaks. Furthermore, the impact of advanced tools such as reverse annealing is presented and its effectiveness discussed. The results indicate several challenges emerging at various stages of the experimental pipeline which bring forward important research questions and directions of improvement.

TI Remarks on the Time Asymptotics of Schmidt Entropies
SO DYNAMICS
AB Schmidt entropy is used as a common denotation for all Hilbert space entropies that can be defined via the Schmidt decomposition theorem; they include quantum entanglement entropies and classical separability entropies. Exact results about the asymptotic growth in time of such entropies (in the form of Renyi entropies of any order >= 1) are directly derived from the Schmidt decompositions. Such results include a proof that pure point spectra entail boundedness in time of all entropies of order larger than 1; and that slower than exponential transport forbids faster than logarithmic asymptotic growth. Applications to coupled Quantum Kicked Rotors and to Floquet systems are presented.

We show that the tachyonic contributions to the orbifold partition function can be appropriately summed and analytically continued to an expression that is finite in the physical region 0 < N <= 1 resulting in a finite and calculable answer for the entanglement entropy. We discuss the implications of the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for the information paradox, quantum gravity, and holography.

TI Superconducting architecture demonstrating fast, tunable
   high-fidelity CZ gates with parametric control of ZZ
   coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Future quantum information processors require tunable coupling architectures that can produce highfidelity logical gates between two or more qubits. Parametric coupling is a powerful technique for generating tunable interactions between many qubits. Here, we present a highly flexible parametric coupling scheme with superconducting qubits that provides complete removal of residual ZZ coupling and the implementation of driven SWAP or SWAP-free controlled-Z(CZ) gates. Our fully integrated twodimensional on-chip coupler design is only weakly flux tunable, cancels static linear coupling between the qubits, avoids internal coupler dynamics or excitations, and is extensible to multiqubit circuit-QED systems. Exploring gate fidelity versus gate duration allows us to maximize two-qubit gate fidelity, while providing insights into possible error sources for these gates. Randomized benchmarking over several hours reveals that the parametric SWAP CZ gate achieves an average fidelity of 99.44 +/- 0.09% in a gate duration of 70 ns and that a dispersively driven parametric SWAP-free CZ gate attains an average fidelity of 99.47 +/- 0.07% in only 30 ns. The fidelity remained above this value for over 8 hand peaked twice with a maximum of 99.67 +/- 0.14%. Overall, our parametric approach combines versatility, precision, speed, and high performance in one compact coupler design.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver for dynamic correlation functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent practical approaches for the use of current generation noisy quantum devices in the simulation of quantum many-body problems have been dominated by the use of a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). These coupled quantum-classical algorithms leverage the ability to perform many repeated measurements to avoid the currently prohibitive gate depths often required for exact quantum algorithms, with the restriction of a parametrized circuit to describe the states of interest. In this work, we show how the calculation of zero-temperature dynamic correlation functions defining the linear response characteristics of quantum systems can also be recast into a modified VQE algorithm, which can be incorporated into the current variational quantum infrastructure. This allows for these important physical expectation values describing the dynamics of the system to be directly converged on the frequency axis, and they approach exactness over all frequencies as the flexibility of the parametrization increases. The frequency resolution hence does not explicitly scale with gate depth, which is approximately twice as deep as a ground-state VQE. We apply the method to compute the single-particle Green's function of ab initio dihydrogen and lithium hydride molecules, and demonstrate the use of a practical active space embedding approach to extend to larger systems. While currently limited by the fidelity of two-qubit gates, whose number is increased compared to the ground-state algorithm on current devices, we believe the approach shows potential for the extraction of frequency dynamics of correlated systems on near-term quantum processors.

TI Entanglement between valence and sea quarks in hadrons of 1+1
   dimensional QCD
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB The conceptual interpretation of valence-and sea-quark sepa-ration, which is a key aspect of the parton model and of an intuitive picture of hadron structure, becomes obscured by quan-tum effects in QCD. This suggests that there may be measures of entanglement between quark degrees of freedom that are present in QCD, but absent in the intuitive picture with a clear valence-sea (VS) separation. In this paper, we define the first rigorous measure of VS entanglement in QCD in an attempt to bring conceptual clarity to this issue, and, potentially, to find a measure of the applicability of the parton model to QCD bound states. This VS entanglement vanishes in the large-Nc limit, and it remains low when finite-Nc states resemble their large-Nc counterparts. We perform a numerical study of VS entanglement in 1 + 1 dimensional discrete light-cone quantized QCD, and in the process develop a method for building the color-singlet basis of 1 + 1d QCD that is manifestly complete and orthogonal by construction. We calculate this VS entanglement entropy for the first time and find that it is relatively low for the first few excited states of both mesons and baryons compared to all other states in the spectrum, with the VS entropy of ground state hadrons providing a minimum. We also see that for ground state mesons the entropy is well described in the 1/Nc approximation. These results suggest that low energy hadrons may be the only QCD bound states for which the large-Nc expansion, and perhaps the parton model, provide an accurate description. This work also provides the first evidence that the VS entanglement entropy of QCD in 3 + 1d, which would likely serve as an order parameter for the transition between quark and hadron degrees of freedom, may be perturbatively accessible through a large-Nc expansion.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI Teleportation of the entangled state of two superconducting qubits
SO EPL
AB An efficient scheme is proposed to teleport an entangled state of two superconducting (SC) qubits from Alice's to Bob's lab. This type of two-level systems has recently attracted a lot of attention due to the possible tunability of the coupling strength of the qubits with each other. To achieve the purpose, we first generate the GHZ state as the necessary teleportation channel. Then, appropriate interactions are performed in two processes between two of the five qubits, each with a certain frequency modulative external magnetic field which is applied on specific one of the qubits. Next, via applying proper gates and measurements in each lab, we observe that the teleportation can be successfully performed with maximum possible values of fidelity and success probability. At last, to make the protocol close to reality, decay rates of SC qubits are also taken into account, showing that our protocol still works well, satisfactorily. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Expert perspectives on the future of quantum physics education at the
   secondary level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB As quantum technologies increasingly impact society and the workforce, there is a growing need to integrate quantum physics (QP) education into all levels of the curriculum, including secondary education. However, despite increasing interest, there is little consensus on which topics should be covered and to what depth. This study addresses this issue by exploring experts' perspectives on the future of QP education at the secondary school level. Using an adapted Delphi method, we conducted three rounds of surveys with a diverse panel of quantum physics and physics education experts. The study aimed to identify the most appropriate QP concepts for inclusion in secondary school curricula and the instructional level at which they should be taught. The findings show strong expert support for including foundational QP topics, such as quantum interference, superposition, and quantum measurement, taught at a conceptual rather than a mathematical level. More advanced topics related to quantum technologies were widely deemed unsuitable for the secondary school. These results are consistent with existing national curricula and provide valuable insights into current perspectives on QP education, reinforcing the importance of core quantum physics concepts in secondary education. These insights lay the groundwork for further research into the future direction of quantum education and support the integration of quantum technologies into secondary school curricula.

AB Tail Assignment is the problem of allocating individual aircraft to a set of flights subject to multiple constraints while optimising an objective function, such as operational costs. Given the enormous amount of possibilities and constraints involved, this problem has been a case study over the last decade. Many solutions have emerged using classical computing, but with limitations. Quantum Annealing (QA) is a heuristic technique to solve combinatorial optimisation problems by finding global minimum energy levels over an energy landscape using quantum mechanics. In this study, Tail Assignment Problem was framed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) model and was solved using a classical and two hybrid solvers. The considered hybrid solvers made use of the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. Tests were run based on extractions from real-world data, analysing, empirically, the performance of the implementation in terms of quality (i.e., the lowest operational costs) of the obtained solutions. We concluded that, for the considered datasets, there was a higher probability of obtaining better solutions for this problem using one of the hybrid solvers when compared with a classical heuristic algorithm such as Simulated Annealing (SA).

TI Hybrid quantum-classical stochastic programming for co-planning 5G base
   stations and photovoltaic power stations in urban communities
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid deployment of Fifth-generation base stations (5G BSs) in urban communities has led to rising electricity costs for mobile network operators. Meanwhile, distributed photovoltaic power plants (PVs) provide a promising solution to offset energy expenses and reduce renewable energy curtailment. This study proposes a hybrid quantum-classical two-stage stochastic programming approach for the co-planning of BSs and PVs in urban communities. In the first stage, warm-start quantum annealing is employed to determine BS deployment locations and capacities. In the second stage, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate and improve the operational performance of the integrated BS-PV system. Case study results show that the proposed method reduces total planning costs to one-third compared to traditional experience-based strategies, enhances PV utilization by 12.53%, reduces electricity costs by 51.04%, and achieves over 5.4 times improvement in computational efficiency. These results demonstrate not only technical advantages but also practical value in supporting cost-effective and low-carbon urban infrastructure planning.

TI Quantum hardware calculations of periodic systems with
   partition-measurement symmetry verification: Simplified models of
   hydrogen chain and iron crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Running quantum algorithms on real hardware is essential for understanding their strengths and limitations, especially in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Herein we focus on the practical aspect of quantum computational calculations of solid-state crystalline materials based on theory developed in our group by using real quantum hardware with a noise mitigation technique referred to as partition-measurement symmetry verification, which performs postselection of shot counts based on Z(2) and U-1 symmetry verification. We select two periodic systems with different levels of complexity for these calculations. One of them is the distorted hydrogen chain as an example of very simple systems, and the other one is iron crystal in the bcc and fcc phases as it is considered to be inaccessible by using classical computational wave-function methods. The ground-state energies are evaluated based on the translational quantum subspace expansion method for the hydrogen chain, and periodic boundary condition adapted variational quantum eigensolver for our iron models. By applying these techniques for the simplest two-qubit iron model systems, the correlation energies obtained by the hardware calculations agree with those of the state-vector simulations within similar to 5 kJ/mol. Although the quantum computational resources used for those experiments are still limited, the techniques applied to obtain our simplified models will be applicable in essentially the same manner to more complicated cases as quantum hardware matures.

TI Noise Analysis of Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB For searching an item in unstructured databases, Grover's quantum search algorithm offers quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. This paper reports 2 to 5 quantum-bit (Qubit) implementations of Grover's search algorithm using the phase-flip method for oracle function realization without any extra ancilla qubit. A comprehensive estimation and analysis of the theoretical and physical accuracies of the algorithm have been presented. The impact of increasing qubits on accuracy has been computed and analyzed. The metrics delineated for comparison are the number of qubits and gates, depth of the circuit, execution time, and theoretical/physical accuracy. The results revealed a greater disparity between theoretical and physical accuracy using a higher number of qubits perceived to be caused by noisy qubits utilized in computations. The novelty of the work is the investigation of variations caused by the noise in the accuracy and execution time of Grover's search algorithm. The results indicate that because of noise, the accuracy of 2-and 3-qubit implementations declined by 14.49% and 33.86%, whereas the execution time increased by 50% and 80%; respectively.

TI Type II entanglement in classical mechanics
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A classical analog of entanglement using classical light beams was proposed recently. It was shown that this analog is valid only for single-particle entanglement (type II). By extending our previous study, which indicated how quantum entanglement spans the laws of classical mechanics, we show that "classical entanglement"applies not only to fast-moving particles but to all classical particles. In fact, we show that classical mechanics laws, when applied to a single particle, are spanned by type II entanglement. The present study concludes our investigation of classical mechanics laws as a collapse of entangled states into labeled states.

TI A sharp geometric measure of entanglement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Despite their elegance and widespread use, the current geometric measures (GMs) of entanglement exhibit a significant limitation: they fail to effectively distinguish local unitary (LU) inequivalent states due to the inherent nature of their definition. We illustrate the impact of this limitation using the fidelity of the teleportation protocol as an example. To address this issue, we introduce the sharp geometric measure (SGM) by modifying the standard definition of the Geometric Measure. We show that the closed-form expression of the SGM can be equivalently derived using the Riemannian structure of both the composite state space and the reduced density operator space. Furthermore, we define a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) derived from the SGM, which we term GMS. We demonstrate that GMS resolves two key limitations of some existing GME measures, thereby establishing its utility and effectiveness in quantifying GME.

TI Nonlinear optics with structured light
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC ADVANCES
AB The interest in tailoring light in all its degrees of freedom is steadily gaining traction, driven by the tremendous developments in the toolkit for the creation, control and detection of what is now called structured light. Because the complexity of these optical fields is generally understood in terms of interference, the tools have historically been linear optical elements that create the desired superpositions. For this reason, despite the long and impressive history of nonlinear optics, only recently has the spatial structure of light in nonlinear processes come to the fore. In this review we provide a concise theoretical framework for understanding nonlinear optics in the context of structured light, offering an overview and perspective on the progress made, and the challenges that remain.

TI Non-maximally Entangled Mixed States of X and Non-X Types
   as Teleportation Channels
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Mixed spin-1/2 states violating Bell-CHSH inequality is useful for teleportation. There exist states which do not violate Bell-inequality but is still useful as teleportation channels. Maximally entangled mixed states of Munro class and Ishizaka-Hiroshima class are such types which although satisfy Bell-CHSH inequality, yet can perform better as teleportation channels for a given degree of mixedness (Adhikari et al., Quant. Inf. Comp. 10, 039, 2010). In this work we construct class of mixed states of non-maximally entangled types whose efficacy as teleportation channels have been studied. For certain range of state parameters, these non-maximally entangled mixed states performs better as quantum teleportation channels than certain maximally entangled mixed states (such as Werner state). These constructed states, though entangled, satisfy Bell-CHSH inequality implying further that violation of local inequalities may not be good indicators of their ability to complete quantum processing tasks such as teleportation.

TI Diagnosis of information scrambling from Hamiltonian evolution under
   decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We apply a quantum teleportation protocol based on the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment to quantify how scrambling a given quantum evolution is. It has an advantage over the direct measurement of out-of-time ordered correlators when used to diagnose the information scrambling in the presence of decoherence effects stemming from a noisy quantum device. We demonstrate the protocol by applying it to two physical systems: Ising spin chain and SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory. To this end, we numerically simulate the time evolution of the two theories in the Hamiltonian formalism. The lattice Yang-Mills theory is implemented with a suitable truncation of Hilbert space on the basis of the Kogut-Susskind formalism. On a two-leg ladder geometry and with the lowest nontrivial spin representations, it can be mapped to a spin chain, which we call the Yang-Mills-Ising model and is also directly applicable to future digital quantum simulations. We find that the Yang-Mills-Ising model shows the signal of information scrambling at late Limes.

TI Engineering Transport via Collisional Noise: A Toolbox for Biology
   Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB The study of noise assisted-transport in quantum systems is essential in a wide range of applications, from near-term NISQ devices to models for quantum biology. Here, we study a generalized XXZ model in the presence of stochastic collision noise, which allows describing environments beyond the standard Markovian formulation. Our analysis through the study of the local magnetization, the inverse participation ratio (IPR) or its generalization, and the inverse ergodicity ratio (IER) showed clear regimes, where the transport rate and coherence time could be controlled by the dissipation in a consistent manner. In addition, when considering various excitations, we characterized the interplay between collisions and system interactions, identifying regimes in which transport was counterintuitively enhanced when increasing the collision rate, even in the case of initially separated excitations. These results constitute an example of an essential building block for the understanding of quantum transport in structured noisy and warm-disordered environments.

TI Many-body entanglement and topology from uncertainties and
   measurement-induced modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present universal characteristics of quantum entanglement and topology through virtual entanglement modes that fluctuate into existence in subsystem measurements. For generic interacting systems and extensive conserved quantities, these modes give rise to a statistical uncertainty which corresponds to entanglement entropies. Consequently, the measurement-induced modes provide directly observable route to entanglement and its scaling laws. Moreover, in topological systems, the measurement-induced edge modes give rise to quantized and nonanalytic uncertainties, providing easily accessible signatures of topology. Our work provides a much-needed direct method to probe the performance of emerging quantum simulators to realize entangled and topological states.

TI Quantum Thermodynamics of Nonequilibrium Processes in Lattice Gauge
   Theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early Universe and in particle colliders, starting from the standard model of particle physics. Classical computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbertspace structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a Z2 lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1 & thorn; 1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Due to numerous limitations including restrictive qubit topologies, short coherence times, and prohibitively high noise floors, few quantum chemistry experiments performed on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware have achieved the high bar of chemical precision, namely energy errors to within 1.6 mHa of full configuration interaction. To have any hope of doing so, we must layer contemporary resource reduction techniques with best-in-class error mitigation methods; in particular, we combine the techniques of qubit tapering and the contextual subspace variational quantum eigensolver with several error mitigation strategies comprised of measurement-error mitigation, symmetry verification, zero-noise extrapolation, and dual-state purification. We benchmark these strategies across a suite of eight 27-qubit IBM Falcon series quantum processors, taking preparation of the HCl molecule's ground state as our testbed.

TI Lossy compression of statistical data using quantum annealer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a new lossy compression algorithm for statistical floating-point data through a representation learning with binary variables. The algorithm finds a set of basis vectors and their binary coefficients that precisely reconstruct the original data. The optimization for the basis vectors is performed classically, while binary coefficients are retrieved through both simulated and quantum annealing for comparison. A bias correction procedure is also presented to estimate and eliminate the error and bias introduced from the inexact reconstruction of the lossy compression for statistical data analyses. The compression algorithm is demonstrated on two different datasets of lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. The results obtained using simulated annealing show 3-3.5 times better compression performance than the algorithm based on neural-network autoencoder. Calculations using quantum annealing also show promising results, but performance is limited by the integrated control error of the quantum processing unit, which yields large uncertainties in the biases and coupling parameters. Hardware comparison is further studied between the previous generation D-Wave 2000Q and the current D-Wave Advantage system. Our study shows that the Advantage system is more likely to obtain low-energy solutions for the problems than the 2000Q.

TI Delocalized Excitation Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range
   Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with longrange interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the nonperturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource intensive.

TI Peratic phase transition by bulk-to-surface response
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The study of dynamical phase transitions has been attracting considerable research efforts in the last decade. One theme of present interest is to search for exotic scenarios beyond the framework of equilibrium phase transitions. Here, we establish a duality between many-body dynamics and static Hamiltonian ground states for both classical and quantum systems. We construct frustration-free Hamiltonians whose ground-state phase transitions have rigorous duality to chaotic transitions in dynamical systems. By this duality, we show that the corresponding ground-state phase transitions are characterized by a bulk-to-surface response; these phase transitions are then dubbed "peratic," meaning that they are defined by their response to the boundary. For the classical system, we show how the timelike dimension emerges in the static ground states. For the quantum system, the ground state is a superposition of geometrical lines on a two-dimensional array; these lines encode the dynamical Floquet evolution history of one-dimensional disordered spin chains. Our prediction of a peratic phase transition has direct consequences in quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg atoms and superconducting qubits, as well as anisotropic spin glass materials. The discovery would shed light on the unification of dynamical phase transitions with equilibrium systems.

TI Temporally long C-band heralded single photons generated from hot atoms
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB C-band photons are recognized for having the lowest loss coefficient in optical fibers, making them highly favorable for optical fiber-based communication. In this study, we systematically investigated the temporal width of C-band heralded single photons and developed a theoretical model for biphoton generation via the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process using a diamond-type transition scheme, which has not been previously reported. Our experimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this model. In addition, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group relating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in this atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the behavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source behaves similarly to the cold-atom source. Guided by our theoretical model, we observed 1529 nm (C-band) heralded single photons with a temporal width of 28.3 +/- 0.6 ns, corresponding to a linewidth of 11.0 +/- 0.2 MHz. For comparison, the ultimate linewidth limit is 6.1 MHz, determined by the natural linewidth of the atoms. Among all atom-based sources of 1300-1550 nm heralded single photons utilizing either cold or hot atoms, the temporal width achieved in this work represents the first instance of a width exceeding 10 ns, making it (or its linewidth) the longest (or narrowest) record to date. This work significantly enhances our understanding of diamond-type or cascade-type SFWM biphoton generation and marks an important milestone in achieving greater temporal width in atom-based sources of C-band heralded single photons.

TI Gaussianity and simulability of Cliffords and matchgates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Though Cliffords and matchgates are both examples of classically simulable circuits, they are considered simulable for different reasons. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill explains the simulability Cliffords, and the efficient simulability of matchgates is understood via Pfaffians of antisymmetric matrices. We take the perspective that by studying Clifford-matchgate hybrid circuits, we expand the set of known simulable circuits and reach a better understanding of what unifies these two circuit families. While the simulability of Clifford conjugated matchgate circuits for single qubit outputs has been briefly considered, the simulability of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits has not been generalized up to this point. In this paper we extend that work, studying simulability of marginals as well as Pauli expectation values of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits. We describe a hierarchy of Clifford circuits, and find that as we consider more general Cliffords, we lose some amount of simulability of bitstring outputs. We then show that the known simulability of Pauli expectation values of Clifford circuits acting on product states can be generalized to Clifford circuits acting after any matchgate circuit. We conclude with general discussion about the relationship between Cliffords and matchgates, and show that both circuit families can be understood as being Gaussian.

TI Flip-Chip-Based Fast Inductive Parity Readout of a Planar
   Superconducting Island
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The properties of superconducting devices depend sensitively on the parity (even or odd) of the quasiparticles that they contain. Encoding quantum information in the parity degree of freedom is central in several emerging solid-state qubit architectures, including in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices. In the latter case, accurate, nondestructive, and time-resolved parity measurements are a challenging issue. Here, we report on control and real-time parity measurement in a superconducting island embedded in a superconducting loop and realized in a hybrid two-dimensional heterostructure using a microwave resonator. To avoid microwave losses impeding time-resolved measurements, the device and readout resonator are located on separate chips, connected via flip-chip bonding, and couple inductively through vacuum. The superconducting resonator detects the parity-dependent circuit inductance, allowing for fast parity readout. We have resolved even- and odd-parity states with a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR approximate to 3 for an integration time of 20 mu s and a detection fidelity exceeding 98%. The real-time parity measurement shows a state lifetime extending into the millisecond range. Our approach will lead to a better understanding of coherence-limiting mechanisms in superconducting quantum hardware and help to advance inductive-readout schemes for hybrid qubits.

TI Beyond Hard-Core Bosons in Transmon Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Arrays of transmons have proven to be a viable medium for quantum information science and quan-tum simulations. Despite their widespread popularity as qubit arrays, there remains yet untapped potential beyond the two-level approximation or, equivalently, the hard-core boson model. With the higher excited levels included, coupled transmons naturally realize the attractive Bose-Hubbard model. The dynamics of the full model has been difficult to study due to the unfavorable scaling of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space with the system size. In this work, we present a framework for describing the effective unitary dynamics of highly excited states of coupled transmons based on high-order degenerate pertur-bation theory. This allows us to describe various collective phenomena-such as bosons stacked onto a single site behaving as a single particle, edge localization, and effective longer-range interactions-in a unified, compact, and accurate manner. A further benefit of our approach is that boson stacks can be nat-urally interpreted as interacting quasiparticles, enabling transmon arrays to be used to explore and study additional lattice models besides the standard Bose-Hubbard one. While our examples deal with one-dimensional chains of transmons for the sake of clarity, the theory can be readily applied to more general geometries.

TI Detector of microwave photon pairs based on a Josephson photomultiplier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a viable design of a microwave two-photon threshold detector. In essence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon detector-a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM)-an absorbing microwave detector based on a capacitively shunted rf superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). To implement a two-photon threshold detector, we utilize a dimer of resonators-two lumped-element resonators interacting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively coupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the external flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a nonperturbative two-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the coherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in another resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least two photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand in situ switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the modified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate that, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than 99% fidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may serve as a building block for the implementation of efficient photon-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.

TI Designing dynamically corrected gates robust to multiple noise sources
   using geometric space curves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noise-induced gate errors remain one of the main obstacles to realizing a broad range of quantum information technologies. Dynamical error suppression using carefully designed control schemes is critical for overcoming this challenge. Such schemes must be able to correct against multiple noise sources simultaneously afflicting a qubit to reach error-correction thresholds. Here we present a general framework for designing control fields that simultaneously suppress both noise in the fields themselves as well as transverse dephasing noise. Using the recently developed space curve quantum control formalism, in which robust quantum evolution is mapped to closed geometric curves in a multidimensional Euclidean space, we derive the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee the simultaneous cancellation of both types of noise to leading order. In particular, we find that the cancellation of control field noise requires the derivative of the space curve to have zero-area projections, which is a much more subtle property compared to the closed-curve condition needed to suppress transverse dephasing. We present several techniques for solving both these conditions simultaneously and provide explicit examples of error-resistant control fields. Our work also sheds light on the relation between holonomic evolution and the suppression of control field errors.

TI Underlying SUSY in a generalized Jaynes-Cummings model

Our model includes non-linear processes for both the free qubit and boson field as well as non-linear, multi-boson excitation exchange between them. It shows an underlying algebra with supersymmetric quantum mechanics features allowing an operator based diagonalization that simplifies the calculations of observables. As a practical example, we show the evolution of the population inversion and the boson quadratures for an initial state consisting of the qubit in the ground state interacting with a coherent field for a selection of cases covering the standard Jaynes-Cummings model and some of its extensions including Stark shift, Kerr-like, intensity dependent coupling, multi-boson exchange and algebraic deformations.

TI A quantum mechanical explanation for auditory-visual hallucinations
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Auditory-visual hallucinations might be caused by Quantum Mechanics. The Many-Worlds Interpretation suggests those who have hallucinations might be experiencing alternate realities due to the unique nature of the quantum. Hallucinations, in part to their quantum nature, are neither biological or social-environmental. On the other hand, the scholarship on the origin of Auditory-Visual Hallucinations usually focuses on either the biological or the social-environmental. There is a range of evidence to suggest that quantum mechanics operates in the brain, like EEGs and the nature of mental states, but the social dynamic is introduced via the Many-Worlds Interpretation. The hypothesis that hallucinations are the result of the Many-Worlds Interpretation is reached through a consideration of quantum biology, optics and acoustics. The proposed hypothesis allows us to consider potential therapeutic and medical benefits of the theory, potentially improving the lives of patients via potential technologies or through reducing the trivialisation of their experiences.

TI Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and
   higher-order counter-propagating SPDC
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories, and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realized in periodically poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the inter-converted wavelengths. Here we comprehensively investigate the noise spectrum of a QFC device pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realized as a bulk periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal quasi-phase-matched for conversion between 637 nm and 1587 nm, which was also polished and coated to resonantly enhance the pump field by a factor of 50. While Raman scattering dominates the noise background from 1140 nm to 1330 nm, at larger energy shifts (beyond 60 THz), parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the strongest noise source. Further, the noise spectrum was contaminated by a regular succession of narrow-band peaks, which we attribute to a heretofore unidentified higher-order counter-propagating SPDC processes - with quasi-phase-matching orders up to 44 evident in our measurements. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the limiting noise sources in QFC devices that use quasi-phase-matched crystals and will prove an invaluable resource in guiding their future development.

TI Coarse-grained intermolecular interactions on quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are increasingly being applied in simulations of strongly bound (covalently bonded) systems using full molecular orbital basis representations. The application of quantum computers to the weakly bound intermolecular and noncovalently bonded regime, however, has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a coarse-grained representation of the electronic response that is ideally suited for determining the ground state of weakly interacting molecules using a VQA. We require qubit numbers that grow linearly with the number of molecules and derive scaling behavior for the number of circuits and measurements required, which compare favorably to traditional variational quantum eigensolver methods. We demonstrate our method on IBM superconducting quantum processors and show its capability to resolve the dispersion energy as a function of separation for a pair of nonpolar molecules???thereby establishing a means by which quantum computers can model Van der Waals interactions directly from zero-point quantum fluctuations. Within this coarse-grained approximation, we conclude that current-generation quantum hardware is capable of probing energies in this weakly bound but nevertheless chemically ubiquitous and biologically important regime. Finally, we perform experiments on simulated and real quantum computers for systems of three, four, and five oscillators as well as oscillators with anharmonic onsite binding potentials; the consequences of the latter are unexamined in large systems using classical computational methods but can be incorporated here with low computational overhead.

TI Nonreciprocal macroscopic tripartite entanglement in
   atom-optomagnomechanical system
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate how to generate the nonreciprocal macroscopic tripartite entanglement among the atomic ensemble, ferrimagnetic magnon and mechanical oscillator in a hybrid atom-optomagnomechanical system, where an ensemble of two-level atoms and a yttrium iron garnet micro-bridge supporting the magnon and mechanical modes are placed in a spinning optical resonator driven by a laser field. The phonon being the quantum of the mechanical mode interacts with the magnon and the optical photon via magnetostriction and radiation pressure, respectively, and meanwhile the photon couples to the atomic ensemble. The results show that not only all bipartite entanglements but also the genuine tripartite entanglement among the atomic ensemble, magnon and phonon could be generated at the steady state. Moreover, the nonreciprocity of atom-magnon-phonon entanglement can be obtained with the aid of the optical Sagnac effect by spinning the resonator, in which the entanglement is present in a chosen driving direction but disappears in the other direction. The nonreciprocal macroscopic tripartite entanglement is robust against temperature and could be flexibly controlled by choosing the system parameters. Our work enriches the study of macroscopic multipartite quantum states, which may have potential applications in the development of quantum information storage and the construction of multi-node chiral quantum network.

TI Employing Interacting Qubits for Distributed Microgrid Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB To empower flexible and scalable operations, distributed control of multi-inverter microgrids, based on classical communication networks among distributed energy resources, has attracted considerable attention as it can guarantee synchronization and provide suitable remedies to the problem of improper power sharing. Notwithstanding this, resilience of the current schemes on classical communication makes microgrids vulnerable to cyber attacks. Inspired by recent revolutionary breakthroughs in quantum communication, in this paper, we devise a novel synchronization mechanism. We extend the synchronization framework utilized in distributed control algorithms to networks of quantum systems by generating pinning terms and coupling mechanism for the new synchronization rule via exploiting proper quantum jump operators and observables, and show that the quantum system will converge to a time-variant target state. Our devised quantum distributed controller (QDC) gives rise to a novel quantum communication scheme for distributed control of microgrids and enables microgrids to exploit the state-of-the-art quantum communication frameworks as communication infrastructure. Test results on two representative AC and DC networked microgrids validate the efficacy and universality of the quantum distributed control.

TI Entropic diagram characterization of quantum coherence: Degenerate
   distillation and the maximum eigenvalue uncertainty bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a geometric approach to characterize quantum coherence through entropic diagrams that map the eigenvalue spectra of density matrices into a two-dimensional space defined by von Neumann and Tsallis-2 entropies. We derive the relative entropy of coherence using the Schur-Horn majorization theorem and introduce a new coherence monotone-the relative cross-entropy of coherence-which is valid only for mixed states and whose behavior under various classes of quantum operations is examined in detail. Interestingly, our approach reveals distinct entropy-coherence distillation curves and introduces the notion of degenerate coherence distillation, where coherence is concentrated into higher-dimensional, partially uniform spectral configurations. Although the degenerate coherence distillation does not always surpass standard qubit coherence distillation in asymptotic rate, it may offer an operationally meaningful alternative for protocols that require high-dimensional or symmetrically structured coherence resources. In addition, we derive a refined entropic uncertainty relation that incorporates the maximum eigenvalue of post-measurement states, which leads to state-dependent bounds that improve upon the conventional Maassen-Uffink bound. These findings suggest that entropic diagrams may serve not only as a useful visual and analytical tool but also as a guide for developing resource-efficient strategies in quantum information processing.

TI Robust Teleportation of a Surface Code and Cascade of Topological
   Quantum Phase Transitions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow us to steer quantum information in a nonlocal way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using nonmaximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here, we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface-code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori-type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the X + Z angle along the self-dual line-indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg-atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.

TI General Framework for Randomized Benchmarking
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Randomized benchmarking refers to a collection of protocols that in the past decade have become central methods for characterizing quantum gates. These protocols aim at efficiently estimating the quality of a set of quantum gates in a way that is resistant to state preparation and measurement errors. Over the years many versions have been developed, however a comprehensive theoretical treatment of randomized benchmarking has been missing. In this work, we develop a rigorous framework of randomized benchmarking general enough to encompass virtually all known protocols as well as novel, more flexible extensions. Overcoming previous limitations on error models and gate sets, this framework allows us, for the first time, to formulate realistic conditions under which we can rigorously guarantee that the output of any randomized benchmarking experiment is well described by a linear combination of matrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed analysis of the fitting problem associated with randomized benchmarking data. We introduce modern signal processing techniques to randomized benchmarking, prove analytical sample complexity bounds, and numerically evaluate performance and limitations. In order to reduce the resource demands of this fitting problem, we introduce novel, scalable postprocessing techniques to isolate exponential decays, significantly improving the practical feasibility of a large set of randomized benchmarking protocols. These postprocessing techniques overcome shortcomings in efficiency of several previously proposed methods such as character benchmarking and linear-cross entropy benchmarking. Finally, we discuss, in full generality, how and when randomized benchmarking decay rates can be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity. On the technical side, our work substantially extends the recently developed Fourier-theoretic perspective on randomized benchmarking by making use of the perturbation theory of invariant subspaces, as well as ideas from signal processing.

TI Hole mobility in compressively strained germanium on silicon exceeds 7 x
   106 cm2V-1s-1
SO MATERIALS TODAY
AB The concurrent achievement of the record-low resistance charge transport and compatibility with spin qubit technology in solid-state materials is a critical milestone for advancing high-speed, energy-efficient classical and quantum electronics technologies. Here, we demonstrate that holes, the positively charged counterparts of electrons, can propagate with exceptional ease in a nanometres-thin compressively strained germanium layer epitaxially grown on a silicon substrate. Through precise material engineering, we achieve a record-breaking hole mobility of 7.15 x 106 cm2V-1s-1 at a density of 1.7 x 1011 cm-2, establishing a new benchmark for hole transport in group-IV semiconductor materials, importantly, epitaxially grown on a silicon substrate. Our work outlines a design strategy for realising an ultra-clean, low-dimensional system that confines highly mobile holes within a quantum well, while maintaining excellent electrostatic tunability. Crucially, the observed high hole mobility is achieved in gated Hall-bar devices, demonstrating their practical viability for scalable cryogenic classical and quantum electronics applications. These findings unlock new opportunities for a high-performance semiconductor platform capable of underpinning the next generation of quantum information processing, cloud data centres, AI-driven technologies and energy-efficient electronics.

TI Separation of spherically and translationally covariant finite quantum
   spaces within the XXX model
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB A method of separation of subspaces with definite values of the total spin, its z-projection and quasimomentum, within the state space of the XXX model, i.e. the N-th tensor power of a single qubit, is presented. We construct a complete system of orthogonal projectors onto such subspaces by use of the basis of wavelets and chosen measuring operators based on the total spin. We also demonstrate, on examples of N = 6 and 8 magnetic spin rings, that the constructed projectors can be further decomposed into the orthogonal sum of density matrices of eigenstates of the XXX model in the corresponding subspaces. This decomposition exhibits a Galois symmetry, stemming from roots of indecomposable factors of characteristic polynomial of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this way, we propose an alternative for Bethe Ansatz for moderate lengths of spin chains, by a return to the original spectral problem, avoiding the highly nonlinear system of Bethe Ansatz equations. Such results are easy to adapt in quantum information processing.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum telescopy clock games
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the clock game-a task formulated in the framework of quantum information theory-that can be used to improve the existing schemes of quantum-enhanced telescopy. The problem of learning when a stellar photon reaches a telescope is translated into an abstract game, which we call the clock game. A winning strategy is provided that involves performing a quantum non-demolition measurement that verifies which stellar spatio-temporal modes are occupied by a photon without disturbing the phase information. We prove tight lower bounds on the entanglement cost needed to win the clock game, with the amount of necessary entangled bits equaling the number of time bins being distinguished. This lower bound on the entanglement cost applies to any telescopy protocol that aims to nondestructively extract the time bin information of an incident photon through local measurements, and our result implies that the protocol of Khabiboulline et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 070504 (2019)] is optimal in terms of entanglement consumption. The full task of the phase extraction is also considered, and we show that the quantum Fisher information of the stellar phase can be achieved by local measurements and shared entanglement without the necessity of nonlinear optical operations. The optimal phase measurement is achieved asymptotically with increasing number of ancilla qubits, whereas a single qubit pair is required if nonlinear operations are allowed.

TI Islands in flat-space cosmology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Flat-space cosmologies (FSCs) are solutions to three-dimensional theories of gravity without cosmological constants that have cosmological horizons. A detector located near the timelike singularity of the spacetime can absorb Hawking modes that are created near the horizon. Continuation of this process will eventually cause the entropy of the radiation to be larger than the entropy of the FSC, which leads to the information paradox. In this paper, we resolve this paradox for the FSC using the island proposal. To do this, we couple an auxiliary flat bath system to this spacetime in timelike singularity so that Hawking modes are allowed to enter the bath, and the entropy of radiation can be measured in its asymptotic region where gravity is also weak. We show that adding island regions that receive the partners of Hawking modes cause the entropy of radiation to follow a Page curve, which leads to resolving the information paradox. Moreover, we design a quantum teleportation protocol by which one can extract the information residing in islands.

TI Quantum amplification and simulation of strong and ultrastrong coupling
   of light and matter
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The interaction of light and matter at the single -photon level is of central importance in various fields of physics, including, e.g., condensed matter physics, astronomy, quantum optics, and quantum information. Amplification of such quantum light-matter interaction can be highly beneficial to, e.g., improve device performance, explore novel phenomena, and understand fundamental physics, and has therefore been a longstanding goal. Furthermore, simulation of light-matter interaction in the regime of ultrastrong coupling, where the interaction strength is comparable to the bare frequencies of the uncoupled systems, has also become a hot research topic, and considerable progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally in the past decade. In this review, we provide a detailed introduction of recent advances in amplification of quantum light-matter interaction and simulation of ultrastrong light-matter interaction, particularly in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics and in cavity optomechanics.

TI An integrated atom array-nanophotonic chip platform with background-free
   imaging
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Arrays of neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers have emerged as a leading platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation due to their scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and high-fidelity operations. Individual atoms are promising candidates for quantum networking due to their capability to emit indistinguishable photons that are entangled with their internal atomic states. Integrating atom arrays with photonic interfaces would enable distributed architectures in which nodes hosting many processing qubits could be efficiently linked together via the distribution of remote entanglement. However, many atom array techniques cease to work in close proximity to photonic interfaces, with atom detection via standard fluorescence imaging presenting a major challenge due to scattering from nearby photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate an architecture that combines atom arrays with up to 64 optical tweezers and a millimeter-scale photonic chip hosting more than 100 nanophotonic cavities. We achieve high-fidelity (similar to 99.2%), background-free imaging in close proximity to nanofabricated cavities using a multichromatic excitation and detection scheme. The atoms can be imaged while trapped a few hundred nanometers above the dielectric surface, which we verify using Stark shift measurements of the modified trapping potential. Finally, we rearrange atoms into defect-free arrays and load them simultaneously onto the same or multiple devices.

TI Spectral interferometry-based microwave-frequency vibrometry for
   integrated acoustic wave devices
SO OPTICA
AB Microwave phononics is a promising platform for sensing, computing, and quantum information science; thus, sensitive and high-throughput characterization tools are needed not only for device verification and optimization but also for revealing transient and nonlinear dynamics. Existing interferometric optical vibrometers for 2D mapping are challenged by operating point stabilization, surface reflectivity contrast, and long acquisition time. Here, we use spectral interferometry, which is insensitive to these factors and utilizes a continuous raster scanning scheme for vibration mapping with high throughput. We intensity-modulate our broadband light source with an electro-optic modulator to resolve vibrations at microwave frequencies. Our system requires no fast photodetector or digitizer operating in the microwave frequency range. We image the 1 GHz vibration field of a 300 x 150 mu m2 area of an entire surface acoustic wave device in 10 min with simultaneous surface profilometry. Our system has a vibration sensitivity of 120 fm/sqrt(Hz) and a linear throughput of 0.77 mm/s on the chip surface. The technique offers capabilities for characterizing a wide range of acoustic wave and micromechanical devices to better understand their behavior and performance.

TI Optical properties of Zr-doped AlN epilayers
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Aluminum nitride (AlN) doped with zirconium (Zr), AlN:Zr, an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor, has been theoretically predicted as a promising material for quantum information systems, piezoelectric applications, and photoconductive semiconductor switches. We report on the optical characterization of AlN:Zr epilayers synthesized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. Photoluminescence measurements demonstrate that Zr doping introduces distinct emission features near 1.8, 2.46, and 3.63 eV. These emission lines, together with a prominent absorption peak centered at 1.78 eV whose intensity increases with Zr content, are identified as originating from the complex between Zr and nitrogen vacancy, Zr-Al-V-N. Evidence indicates that the dominant optical absorption and emission pathways involve the neutral charge state of this complex, (Zr-Al-V-N)(0). This finding is highly encouraging, given that (Zr-Al-V-N)(0) is considered an ideal candidate for a qubit. Concurrently, our analysis reveals that Zr incorporation also promotes the formation of deleterious aluminum vacancy (V-Al) and V-Al-complex related defects, necessitating process optimization to minimize their concentration for practical device realization.

TI Evaluation of detection efficiency of a transition edge sensor at C-band
   wavelength
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Photon-number-resolving detectors face strict demands regarding detection efficiency to meet the needs of quantum information processing. We constructed a system that can accurately evaluate system detection efficiency of a photon-number-resolving detector. We generated an optical pulse containing an arbitrary number of photons for the initial states by attenuated laser light; this pulse was used to evaluate the detection efficiency of the device under test. To generate this pulse, we modulated a continuous wavelength tunable laser using an acoustic optical modulator. From the photon statistics of the initial states, we found a second-order correlation function that was almost 1 at any wavelength, and these photon statistics followed a Poisson distribution. For the device under test, we evaluated the detection efficiency of a transition edge sensor and we employed two methods to calculate the number of detected photons. This value was calculated based on each photon state (method 1) or based on the zero photon state by assuming a Poisson distribution (method 2). Although the results of both methods were comparable within the range of uncertainty, method 2 yielded smaller uncertainty than method 1. We found that the wavelength-dependent detection efficiency was explained by the photon absorptance characteristics of the device under test. Additionally, the system detection efficiency varied from approximately 87 % to 93 %, and the expanded uncertainty values of methods 1 and 2 were 4.1 % and 1.5 %, respectively. This system enables the accurate evaluation of quantum states of photons at various wavelengths.

TI Quantum process tomography of unitary maps from time-delayed
   measurements
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum process tomography conventionally uses a multitude of initial quantum states and then performs state tomography on the process output. Here we propose and study an alternative approach which requires only a single (or few) known initial states together with time-delayed measurements for reconstructing the unitary map and corresponding Hamiltonian of the time dynamics. The overarching mathematical framework and feasibility guarantee of our method is provided by the Takens embedding theorem. We explain in detail how the reconstruction of a single-qubit Hamiltonian works in this setting and provide numerical methods and experiments for general few-qubit and lattice systems with local interactions. In particular, the method allows to find the Hamiltonian of a two qubit system by observing only one of the qubits.

TI Practically secure quantum position verification
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We discuss quantum position verification (QPV) protocols in which the verifiers create and send single-qubit states to the prover. QPV protocols using single-qubit states are known to be insecure against adversaries that share a small number of entangled qubits. We introduce QPV protocols that are practically secure: they only require single-qubit states from each of the verifiers, yet their security is broken if the adversaries sharing an impractically large number of entangled qubits employ teleportation-based attacks. These protocols are a modification of known QPV protocols in which we include a classical random oracle without altering the amount of quantum resources needed by the verifiers. We present a cheating strategy that requires a number of entangled qubits shared among the adversaries that grows exponentially with the size of the classical input of the random oracle.

TI Quantum Asymptotic Spectra of Graphs and Non-Commutative Graphs, and
   Quantum Shannon Capacities
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We study quantum versions of the Shannon capacity of graphs and non-commutative graphs. We introduce the asymptotic spectrum of graphs with respect to quantum and entanglement-assisted homomorphisms, and we introduce the asymptotic spectrum of non-commutative graphs with respect to entanglement-assisted homomorphisms. We apply Strassen's spectral theorem (J. Reine Angew. Math., 1988) in order to obtain dual characterizations of the corresponding Shannon capacities and asymptotic preorders in terms of their asymptotic spectra. This work extends the study of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs initiated by Zuiddam (Combinatorica, 2019) to the quantum domain. We then exhibit spectral points in the new quantum asymptotic spectra and discuss their relations with the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. In particular, we prove that the (fractional) real and complex Haemers bounds upper bound the quantum Shannon capacity, which is defined as the regularization of the quantum independence number (Mancinska and Roberson, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2016), and that the fractional real and complex Haemers bounds are elements in the quantum asymptotic spectrum of graphs. This is in contrast to the Haemers bounds defined over certain finite fields, which can be strictly smaller than the quantum Shannon capacity. Moreover, since the Haemers bound can be strictly smaller than the Lovasz theta function (Haemers, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 1979), we find that the quantum Shannon capacity and the Lovasz theta function do not coincide. As a consequence, two well-known conjectures in quantum information theory, namely: 1) the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity of a classical channel is equal to the Lovasz theta function and 2) maximally entangled states and projective measurements are sufficient to achieve the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity, cannot both be true.

TI Quantum Incoherence Based Simultaneously on k Bases
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum coherence is known as an important resource in many quantum information tasks, which is a basis-dependent property of quantum states. In this paper, we discuss quantum incoherence based simultaneously on k bases using Matrix Theory Method. First, by defining a correlation function m(e,f) of two orthonormal bases e and f, we investigate the relationships between sets I(e) and I(f) of incoherent states with respect to e and f. We prove that I(e) = I(f) if and only if the rank-one projective measurements generated by e and f are identical. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the intersection I(e) boolean AND I(f) to include a state except the maximally mixed state. Especially, if two bases e and f are mutually unbiased, then the intersection has only the maximally mixed state. Secondly, we introduce the concepts of strong incoherence and weak coherence of a quantum state with respect to a set B of k bases and propose a measure for the weak coherence. In the two-qubit system, we prove that there exists a maximally coherent state with respect to B when k = 2 and it is not the case for k = 3.

TI Projectivities of Informationally Complete Measurements

It is of central importance in quantum information processing such as channel estimating, device testing, quantum key distribution, etc. However, constructing such measurements with good properties is a long-standing problem. In this work, projective realizations of IC measurements are investigated. Conditions of informational completeness are presented with proofs first. Then the projective realizations of IC measurements, including proposing the first general construction of minimal projective IC measurements (MPICM) in no prime power dimensional systems, as well as determining an unknown state in Cn$C<^>{n}$ via a single projective measurement with some kinds of optimalities in a larger system, are investigated. Finally, The results can be extended to local state tomography. Some discussions on employing several kinds of optimalities are also provided.
   The paper investigates projective realizations of informationally complete measurements. The definition of minimal projective informationally complete measurement (MPICM), which extends mutually unbiased bases (MUB), is proposed with a general construction provided, and the realizations of informational completeness via a single projective measurement with certain optimalities are studied. It indicates that projective ones are always better than others on certain criteria.image

TI Generalizing Pauli spin matrices using cubic lattices
SO JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY
AB In quantum mechanics, the connection between the operator algebraic realization and the logical models of measurement of state observables has long been an open question. In the approach that is presented here, we introduce a new application of the cubic lattice. We claim that the cubic lattice may be faithfully realized as a subset of the self-adjoint space of a von Neumann algebra. Furthermore, we obtain a unitary representation of the symmetry group of the cubic lattice. In so doing, we re-derive the classic quantum gates and gain a description of how they govern a system of qubits of arbitrary cardinality.

TI Multiple electron pumping
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The need to pump single electrons with a high degree of accuracy and fidelity has led to the development of a range of different pump and turnstile designs. Previous pumping mechanisms have all demonstrated that pumping more than one electron per cycle degrades the quantisation of the measured current. This unreliable delivery of multiple electrons per cycle has limited the use of on-demand single electron sources in electron quantum optic experiments. We present highly quantised current with multiple electrons pumped per cycle. We experimentally demonstrate that in our pumps an increase in electron throughput per cycle does not lead to an appreciable degradation in the accuracy of the produced current.
   Our pump is realised in an aluminium gallium arsenide two-dimensional electron gas, where electrons are pumped through a one- dimensional split-gate confinement potential under the influence of an applied source-drain voltage VSD, and where the pump is driven by a trapezoidal arbitrary waveform. This combination of a split-gate potential, VSD bias and trapezoidal wave form has led to the observation of robust quantised plateaus where not just a single electron, but a multiple integer number of electrons are pumped per cycle with a high degree of robustness and without the need of a magnetic field. For seven electrons per cycle, we report an increase of over two orders of magnitude in pumping accuracy from 2.72x10(-2) in devices operating in the conventional pumping regime, to 1.64x10(-4) in pumps operating in what we call the long plateau regime, a regime accessed under a change in a split- gate pumps applied VSD voltage. This pump will find direct use in quantum transport measurements where the metrological accuracy of single electrons pumped per cycle is not required and the low throughput per cycle of electrons is limiting.

TI Non-Gaussianity as a Signature of a Quantum Theory of Gravity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tabletop tests of quantum gravity (QG) have long been thought to be practically impossible. However, remarkably, because of rapid progress in quantum information science (QIS), such tests may soon be achievable. Here we uncover an exciting new theoretical link between QG and QIS that also leads to a radical new way of testing QG with QIS experiments. Specifically, we find that only a quantum, not classical, theory of gravity can create non-Gaussianity, a QIS resource that is necessary for universal quantum computation, in the quantum field state of matter. This allows tests based on QIS in which non-Gaussianity in matter is used as a signature of QG. In comparison with previous studies testing QG with QIS where entanglement is used to witness QG when all other quantum interactions are excluded, our non-Gaussianity witness cannot be created by direct classical gravity interactions, facilitating tests that are not constrained by the existence of such processes. Our new signature of QG also enables tests that are based on just a single quantum system rather than a multipartite quantum system, simplifying previously considered experimental setups. We describe a tabletop test of QG that uses our non-Gaussianity signature and that is based on just a single quantum system, a Bose-Einstein condensate, in a single location. In contrast to proposals based on optomechanical setups, Bose-Einstein condensates have already been manipulated into massive nonclassical states, aiding the prospect of testing QG soon.

TI One-Photon Solutions to the Multiqubit Multimode Quantum Rabi Model for
   Fast W-State Generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB General solutions to the quantum Rabi model involve subspaces with an unbounded number of photons. However, for the multiqubit multimode case, we find special solutions with at most one photon for an arbitrary number of qubits and photon modes. Such solutions exist for arbitrary single qubit-photon coupling strength with constant eigenenergy, while still being qubit-photon entangled states. Taking advantage of their peculiarities and the reach of the ultrastrong coupling regime, we propose an adiabatic scheme for the fast and deterministic generation of a two-qubit Bell state and arbitrary single-photon multimode W states with nonadiabatic error less than 1%. Finally, we propose a superconducting circuit design to catch and release the W states, and shows the experimental feasibility of the multimode multiqubit quantum Rabi model.

TI Strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light-matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one-two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the thresholdless second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.

TI Implementation of a multi-terminal quantum sorter in solid state systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Identifying quantum states stands at the core of quantum information processing. However, an accurate observable measurement can pose a tough challenge whenever multiple outcomes are possible, e.g. measuring momentum vs. electron spin, which takes only two components. Quantum systems with a larger number of degrees of freedom increase the options for quantum computations and may enhance the quantum parallelism. Our goal in this work is to define a system that functions as a quantum sorter in a concrete manner, by choosing an interaction Hamiltonian that enables the device to separate the eigenstates into multiple output ports, achieving a so-called mode-lead disentanglement. To this end, we implemented numerically the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textsf{R}$$\end{document}-matrix formalism, which was developed to solve scattering transport problems in solid state systems. The states that are aimed to be separated are described by the transverse momentum of the incident modes and by their spin component, as a possible implementation of qudits. In order to achieve the desired resolution in terms of mode and spin, we study a range of possible Hamiltonians, corresponding to different configurations of the scattering potential.

TI Programmable quantum emitter formation in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon-based quantum emitters are candidates for large-scale qubit integration due to their single-photon emission properties and potential for spin-photon interfaces with long spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate local writing and erasing of selected light-emitting defects using femtosecond laser pulses in combination with hydrogen-based defect activation and passivation at a single center level. By choosing forming gas (N2/H2) during thermal annealing of carbon-implanted silicon, we can select the formation of a series of hydrogen and carbon-related quantum emitters, including T and Ci centers while passivating the more common G-centers. The Ci center is a telecom S-band emitter with promising optical and spin properties that consists of a single interstitial carbon atom in the silicon lattice. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ci center brightness is enhanced by several orders of magnitude in the presence of hydrogen. Fs-laser pulses locally affect the passivation or activation of quantum emitters with hydrogen for programmable formation of selected quantum emitters.
   Quantum emitters in Si show promise for applications in quantum information processing and communication due to their potential as spin-photon interfaces. Jhuria et al. report the formation of selected telecom emitters in Si using local writing and erasing by fs laser pulses and annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum secret sharing as a privacy-preserving scheme necessitating collaborative efforts from all participating users to collectively recover encrypted information. This paper introduces a novel dynamic multi-party to multi-party quantum secret sharing protocol based on Bell states, enabling secure sharing of secrets among dynamically changing multi-party. The protocol innovatively employs Bell states combined with simplified local unitary operations, significantly reducing the complexity and enhancing the scalability of practical implementations in quantum communication systems. Particularly, through simulation using IBM's Qiskit framework, its correctness and practicality are confirmed. Security analysis demonstrates that the protocol effectively withstands common attack methods, providing reliability, and security in quantum communication. This research presents a more flexible and efficient solution in the field of quantum secret sharing.
   This work proposes a novel quantum secret sharing protocol that utilizes Bell states to achieve dynamic management of communication among multi-party. A comprehensive security analysis is provided, and the correctness and feasibility of the protocol are verified through simulation. The protocol delves into both theoretical operations and practical participant management, offering new insights for the design and analysis of quantum communication protocols. image

TI Estimation with Heisenberg-Scaling Sensitivity of a Single Parameter
   Distributed in an Arbitrary Linear Optical Network
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum sensing and quantum metrology propose schemes for the estimation of physical properties, such as lengths, time intervals, and temperatures, achieving enhanced levels of precision beyond the possibilities of classical strategies. However, such an enhanced sensitivity usually comes at a price: the use of probes in highly fragile states, the need to adaptively optimise the estimation schemes to the value of the unknown property we want to estimate, and the limited working range, are some examples of challenges which prevent quantum sensing protocols to be practical for applications. This work reviews two feasible estimation schemes which address these challenges, employing easily realisable resources, i.e., squeezed light, and achieve the desired quantum enhancement of the precision, namely the Heisenberg-scaling sensitivity. In more detail, it is here shown how to overcome, in the estimation of any parameter affecting in a distributed manner multiple components of an arbitrary M-channel linear optical network, the need to iteratively optimise the network. In particular, we show that this is possible with a single-step adaptation of the network based only on a prior knowledge of the parameter achievable through a "classical" shot-noise limited estimation strategy. Furthermore, homodyne measurements with only one detector allow us to achieve Heisenberg-limited estimation of the parameter. We further demonstrate that one can avoid the use of any auxiliary network at the price of simultaneously employing multiple detectors.

TI Decoherence, Anti-Decoherence, and Fisher Information
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we study quantum decoherence as reflected by the dynamics of a system that accounts for the interaction between matter and a given field. The process is described by an important information geometry tool: Fisher's information measure (FIM). We find that it appropriately describes this concept, detecting salient details of the quantum-classical changeover (qcc). A good description of the qcc report can thus be obtained; in particular, a clear insight into the role that the uncertainty principle (UP) plays in the pertinent proceedings is presented. Plotting FIM versus a system's motion invariant related to the UP, one can also visualize how anti-decoherence takes place, as opposed to the decoherence process studied in dozens of papers. In Fisher terms, the qcc can be seen as an order (quantum)-disorder (classical, including chaos) transition.

TI Quantifying Quantum Steering with Limited Resources: A Semi-supervised
   Machine Learning Approach
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum steering, an intermediate quantum correlation lying between entanglement and nonlocality, has emerged as a critical quantum resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as quantum key distribution and true randomness generation. The ability to detect and quantify quantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi-definite programming (SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not priori known, making it time-consuming to compute the steerable measure for any given quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full information of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which can be complex and resource-consuming. In this work, the semi-supervised self-training model is used to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal measure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of labeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed by the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective measurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target states, circumventing the need for quantum tomography. The model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and can achieve high levels of precision with limited resources.

TI Entanglement suppression, quantum statistics, and symmetries in spin-3/2
   baryon scatterings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics, and enhanced symmetries in the nonrelativistic S-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the SU(3) light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the S matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the S matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the S matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or nonrelativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is nonvanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the S matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-s particles, we identify an enhanced SU(2s + 1)spin symmetry for the Identity gate.

TI Non-Markovian sensing of a quantum reservoir
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum sensing explores protocols using the quantum resource of sensors to achieve highly sensitive measurement of physical quantities. The conventional schemes generally use unitary dynamics to encode quantities into sensor states. In order to measure the spectral density of a quantum reservoir, which plays a vital role in controlling the reservoir-caused decoherence to microscopic systems, we propose a nonunitary-encoding optical sensing scheme. Although the nonunitary dynamics for encoding in turn degrades the quantum resource, we surprisingly find a mechanism to make the encoding time a resource to improve the precision and to make the squeezing of the sensor a resource to surpass the shot-noise limit. Our result shows that it is due to the formation of a sensor-reservoir bound state. Enriching the family of quantum sensing, our scheme gives an efficient way to measure the quantum reservoir and might supply an insightful support to decoherence control.

TI Mid-Infrared Quantum Scanning Microscopy via Visible Light Beyond
   Spatial Correlations
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region, spanning from 2- to 25-, provides access to rich chemical information through the vibrational modes of functional groups, lipids, and other complex molecules. However, conventional imaging in this range remains limited by challenges in generating MIR light and by the lack of mature detection technologies. Quantum imaging with undetected light (QIUL) offers an alternative approach by using photon-pair sources in which the sample is illuminated with MIR light while detection and image reconstruction are carried out at visible wavelengths. We report the first QIUL technique that achieves diffraction-limited resolution without relying on spatial correlations of the photon-pair, thereby overcoming a fundamental limitation of all previous implementations. This work establishes induced coherence without induced emission as the essential physical resource underlying QIUL and redefines its operational boundary, extending its applicability to regimes where spatial correlations are weak or absent. Our results represent a conceptual advance in quantum imaging and open the way toward practical and cost-effective MIR microscopy based on visible detection.

TI On Laws of Thought-A Quantum-like Machine Learning Approach
SO ENTROPY
AB Incorporating insights from quantum theory, we propose a machine learning-based decision-making model, including a logic tree and a value tree; a genetic programming algorithm is applied to optimize both the logic tree and value tree. The logic tree and value tree together depict the entire decision-making process of a decision-maker. We applied this framework to the financial market, and a "machine economist" is developed to study a time series of the Dow Jones index. The "machine economist" will obtain a set of optimized strategies to maximize profits, and discover the efficient market hypothesis (random walk).

TI Asymptotic Entanglement Sudden Death in Two Atoms with Dipole-Dipole and
   Ising Interactions Coupled to a Radiation Field at Non-Zero Detuning
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the time evolution and asymptotic behavior of a system of two two-level atoms (qubits) interacting off-resonance with a single mode radiation field. The two atoms are coupled to each other through dipole-dipole as well as Ising interactions. An exact analytic solution for the system dynamics that spans the entire phase space is provided. We focus on initial states that cause the system to evolve to entanglement sudden death (ESD) between the two atoms. We find that combining the Ising and dipole-dipole interactions is very powerful in controlling the entanglement dynamics and ESD compared with either one of them separately. Their effects on eliminating ESD may add up constructively or destructively depending on the type of Ising interaction (Ferromagnetic or anti-Ferromagnetic), the detuning parameter value, and the initial state of the system. The asymptotic behavior of the ESD is found to depend substantially on the initial state of the system, where ESD can be entirely eliminated by tuning the system parameters except in the case of an initial correlated Bell state. Interestingly, the entanglement, atomic population and quantum correlation between the two atoms and the field synchronize and reach asymptotically quasi-steady dynamic states. Each one of them ends up as a continuous irregular oscillation, where the collapse periods vanish, with a limited amplitude and an approximately constant mean value that depend on the initial state and the system parameters choice. This indicates an asymptotic continuous exchange of energy (and strong quantum correlation) between the atoms and the field takes place, accompanied by diminished ESD for these chosen setups of the system. This system can be realized in spin states of quantum dots or Rydberg atoms in optical cavities, and superconducting or hybrid qubits in linear resonators.

TI Single Flux Quantum-Based Digital Control of Superconducting Qubits in a
   Multichip Module
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Single flux quantum (SFQ) digital logic has been proposed for the scalable control of next-generation superconducting-qubit arrays. In the initial implementation, SFQ-based gate fidelity was limited by quasiparticle (QP) poisoning induced by the dissipative on-chip SFQ driver circuit. In this work, we introduce a multichip-module architecture to suppress phonon-mediated QP poisoning. Here, the SFQ elements and qubits are fabricated on separate chips that are joined with In-bump bonds. We use interleaved randomized benchmarking to characterize the fidelity of SFQ-based gates and we demonstrate an error per Clifford gate of 1.2(1)%, an order-of-magnitude reduction over the gate error achieved in the initial realization of SFQ-based qubit control. We use purity benchmarking to quantify the contribution of incoherent error at 0.96(2)%; we attribute this error to photon-mediated QP poisoning mediated by the resonant millimeterwave antenna modes of the qubit and SFQ-qubit coupler. We anticipate that a straightforward redesign of the SFQ driver circuit to limit the bandwidth of the SFQ pulses will eliminate this source of infidelity, allowing SFQ-based gates with error approaching approximate known theoretical limits, of order 0.1% for resonant sequences and 0.01% for more complex pulse sequences involving variable pulse-to-pulse separation.

TI Optically Active Spin Defects in Few-Layer Thick Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Optically active spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising quantum systems for the design of two-dimensional quantum sensing units offering optimal proximity to the sample being probed. In this Letter, we first demonstrate that the electron spin resonance frequencies of boron vacancy centers (V-B(-)) can be detected optically in the limit of few-atomic-layer thick hBN flakes despite the nanoscale proximity of the crystal surface that often leads to a degradation of the stability of solid-state spin defects. We then analyze the variations of the electronic spin properties of V-B(-) centers with the hBN thickness with a focus on (i) the zero-field splitting parameters, (ii) the optically induced spin polarization rate and (iii) the longitudinal spin relaxation time. This Letter provides important insights into the properties of V-B(-) centers embedded in ultrathin hBN flakes, which are valuable for future developments of foil-based quantum sensing technologies.

TI Local coherence by thermalized intra-system coupling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum superposition of energy eigenstates can appear autonomously in a single quantum two-level system coupled to a low-temperature thermal bath, if such coupling has a proper composite nature. We propose here a principally different and more feasible approach employing engineered interactions between two-level systems being thermalized into a global Gibbs state by weakly coupled thermal bath at temperature T. Therefore, in such case quantum coherence appears by a different mechanism, whereas the system-bath coupling does not have to be engineered. We demonstrate such autonomous coherence generation reaching maximum values of coherence. Moreover, it can be alternatively built up by using weaker but collective interaction with several two-level systems. This approach surpasses the coherence generated by the engineered system-bath coupling for comparable interaction strengths and directly reduces phase estimation error in quantum sensing. This represents a necessary step towards the autonomous quantum sensing.

TI Ramsey interferometry of nuclear spins in diamond using stimulated Raman
   adiabatic passage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We report the first experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in nuclear-spin transitions of N-14 within nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond. It is shown that the STIRAP technique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a crucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that advantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey interferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary quantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the STIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is experimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of diamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.

AB Current methods for authentication and key agreement based on public-key cryptography are vulnerable to quantum computing. We propose a novel approach based on artificial intelligence research in which communicating parties are viewed as autonomous agents which interact repeatedly using their private decision models. Authentication and key agreement are decided based on the agents' observed behaviors during the interaction. The security of this approach rests upon the difficulty of modeling the decisions of interacting agents from limited observations, a problem which we conjecture is also hard for quantum computing. We release PyAMI, a prototype authentication and key agreement system based on the proposed method. We empirically validate our method for authenticating legitimate users while detecting different types of adversarial attacks. Finally, we show how reinforcement learning techniques can be used to train server models which effectively probe a client's decisions to achieve more sample-efficient authentication.

TI Exact Recursive Calculation of Circulant Permanents: A Band of Different

The proposed system of linear recurrence equations with variable coefficients provides a powerful tool for the analysis of the circulant permanents, their fast, linear-time computing; and finding their asymptotics in a large-matrix-size limit. The latter problem is an open fundamental problem. Its solution would be tremendously important for a unified analysis of a wide range of the nature's #P-hard problems, including problems in the physics of many-body systems, critical phenomena, quantum computing, quantum field theory, theory of chaos, fractals, theory of graphs, number theory, combinatorics, cryptography, etc.

TI Efficient steady-state-entanglement generation in strongly driven
   coupled qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We report on a mechanism to optimize the generation of steady-state entanglement in a system of coupled qubits driven by microwave fields. Due to the interplay between Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana pumping involving three levels and a subsequent fast relaxation channel, which is activated by tuning the qubits-reservoir couplings, a maximally entangled state can be populated. This mechanism does not require the fine tuning of multiphoton resonances but depends on the sign of the qubit-qubit coupling. In particular, we find that by a proper design of the system parameters and the driving protocol, the two-qubit steady-state concurrence can attain values close to 1 in a wide range of driving amplitudes. Our results may be useful to gain further insight into entanglement control and manipulation in dissipative quantum systems exposed to strong driving.

TI Optimized quantum folding Barrett reduction for quantum modular
   multipliers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Due to the reversibility constraints of quantum circuits, the development of modular operations in quantum modular multiplication has been significantly limited. In this work, we propose an optimized modular operation scheme based on Barrett reduction and implement quantum circuits for three versions of Barrett reduction, including our optimized approach. The proposed quantum modular operation circuit can be integrated with quantum-quantum and quantum-classical multiplication circuits. Additionally, we analyze the quantum resource requirements of the proposed circuit and compare the results across the three versions. Our optimized folding Barrett reduction scheme demonstrates superior performance. Furthermore, general quantum modular reduction relies on recursive subtractors and controlled adders to avoid division operation, resulting in a T-depth of approximately \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(2<^>n)$$\end{document}, where n is the bit length of the modulus. In contrast, our approach achieves a T-depth of only \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(n<^>2)$$\end{document} by utilizing the Barrett reduction.

TI High field magnetometry with hyperpolarized nuclear spins
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors have attracted broad interest in the quest towards sub-micronscale NMR spectroscopy. Such sensors predominantly operate at low magnetic fields. Instead, however, for high resolution spectroscopy, the high-field regime is naturally advantageous because it allows high absolute chemical shift discrimination. Here we demonstrate a high-field spin magnetometer constructed from an ensemble of hyperpolarized C-13 nuclear spins in diamond. They are initialized by Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers and protected along a transverse Bloch sphere axis for minute-long periods. When exposed to a time-varying (AC) magnetic field, they undergo secondary precessions that carry an imprint of its frequency and amplitude. For quantum sensing at 7T, we demonstrate detection bandwidth up to 7 kHz, a spectral resolution <100 mHz, and single-shot sensitivity of 410pT/root Hz. This work anticipates opportunities for microscale NMR chemical sensors constructed from hyperpolarized nanodiamonds and suggests applications of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in quantum sensing.

TI Simulation Investigation of Quantum FSO-Fiber System Using the BB84 QKD
   Protocol Under Severe Weather Conditions
SO PHOTONICS
AB In response to the increasing demands for reliable, fast, and secure communications beyond 5G scenarios, the high-capacity networks have become a focal point. Quantum communication is at the forefront of this research, offering unmatched throughput and security. A free space optics (FSO) communication system integrated with fiber-end is designed and investigated using the Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution (BB84-QKD) protocol. Simulation results show that reliable transmission can be achieved over a 10-15 km fiber length with a signal power of -19.54 dBm and high optical-to-signal noise of 72.28-95.30 dB over a 550 m FSO range under clear air, haze, fog, and rain conditions at a data rate of 1 Gbps. Also, the system using rectilinearly and circularly polarized signals exhibits a Stokes parameter intensity of -4.69 to -35.65 dBm and -7.7 to -35.66 dBm Stokes parameter intensity, respectively, over 100-700 m FSO range under diverse weather conditions. Likewise, for the same scenario, an FSO range of 100 m incorporating 2.5-4 mrad beam divergence provides the Stokes power intensity of -6.03 to -11.1 dBm and -9.04 to -14.12 dBm for rectilinearly and circularly polarized signals, respectively. Moreover, compared to existing works, this work allows faithful and secure signal transmission in free space, considering FSO-fiber link losses.

This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times.

TI Coupling spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride to a microwave cavity
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become a promising platform for quantum sensing. While sensitivity of these defects is limited by their interactions with the spin environment in hBN, inefficient microwave delivery can further reduce their sensitivity. Here, we design and fabricate a microwave double arc resonator for efficient transferring of the microwave field at 3.8 GHz. The spin transitions in the ground state of V-B(-) B are coupled to the frequency of the microwave cavity, which result in enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast. In addition, the linewidth of the ODMR signal further reduces, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity as low as 42.4 mu T/root Hz. Our robust and scalable device engineering is promising for future employment of spin defects in hBN for quantum sensing.

TI Shaping the spatial correlations of entangled photon pairs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Quantum imaging enhances imaging systems performance, potentially surpassing fundamental limits such as noise and resolution. However, these schemes have limitations and are still a long way from replacing classical techniques. Therefore, there is a strong focus on improving the practicality of quantum imaging methods, with the goal of finding real-world applications. With this in mind, in this tutorial we describe how the concepts of classical light shaping can be applied to imaging schemes based on entangled photon pairs. We detail two basic experimental configurations in which a spatial light modulator is used to shape the spatial correlations of a photon pair state and highlight the key differences between this and classical shaping. We then showcase two recent examples that expand on these concepts to perform aberration and scattering correction with photon pairs. We include specific details on the key steps of these experiments, with the goal that this can be used as a guide for building photon-pair-based imaging and shaping experiments.

We analytically compute the coefficient of performance, the cooling power, and the polarization of the target qubit for an arbitrary number of cycles, taking realistic experimental imperfections into account.

TI Reduction of afterpulse and dark count effects on SPAD detectors using
   processing methods
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Single-photon detector is a device that can detect fragile light signals such as photons. Noise is one of the major problems of Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) in quantum communication and other applications. The two main noises in SPAD are afterpulse and dark count rate. Afterpulse is one of the most critical challenges of SPAD type InGaAs at 1550 nm wavelength. Several solutions have been presented to reduce noise. One of the most important methods presented is based on pulse gate. Pulse gate is effective in noise reduction by limiting SPAD operation time. Self-differentiating and up-conversion methods are also used in telecommunication wavelength SPADs to reduce noise, which have high implementation costs due to their complex structure. In this paper, we present a novel method for SPAD noise reduction. In this method, the time of SPAD output pulses is recorded and checked. The processor detects photon pulses and noise with a new algorithm. Noise pulses are removed, and photon pulses remain. This method is suitable for some Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols that are simultaneous sender and receiver. It cannot be used in LiDAR and other similar asynchronous applications. The noise reduction method presented in this paper can be used for all types of single photon detectors and at different wavelengths. Also, this method can be used simultaneously with other noise reduction methods and it greatly reduces the amount of noise.

TI Quiescent power consumption of carbon-based analog operational
   amplifiers at low temperatures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In modern integrated circuit systems, quiescent power consumption increases with higher integration density, posing a fundamental limitation for further integration scaling. This challenge becomes even more critical in cryogenic environments, such as superconducting quantum computing and space exploration applications, where ultralow quiescent power consumption is essential for maintaining reliable circuit operation at extremely low temperatures. Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293-10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.

TI Prepare Linear Distributions with Quantum Arithmetic Units
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum arithmetic logic units (QALUs) perform essential arithmetic operations within a quantum framework, serving as the building blocks for more complex computations and algorithms in quantum computing. In this paper, we present an approach to prepare linear probability distributions with quantum full adders. There are three main steps. Firstly, Hadamard gates are applied to the two input terms, preparing them at quantum states corresponding to uniform distribution. Next, the two input terms are summed up by applying quantum full adder, and the output sum is treated as a signed integer under two's complement representation. By the end, additional phase -1 is introduced to the negative components. Additionally, we can discard either the positive or negative components with the assistance of the Repeat-Until-Success process. Our work demonstrates a viable approach to prepare linear probability distributions with quantum adders. The resulting state can serve as an intermediate step for subsequent quantum operations.

TI High-Tc Superinductors Through Tailored Metamaterial Losses
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Superinductance, with impedance surpassing the quantum resistance of 6.47 k Omega, has recently been discovered in high-temperature superconducting terahertz metamaterials, enabling advancement in quantum computing and high-frequency electronics. Superconducting Cooper pairs enable low-loss kinetic inductance, a crucial factor in achieving superinductance. However, sustaining this effect at terahertz frequencies is hindered by increasing ohmic losses, necessitating a deeper understanding of dissipation mechanisms. In this study, radiative and ohmic losses are systematically analyzed in metamaterial LC resonators fabricated with 25 and 50 nm YBa2Cu3O7-delta films. Using a Lorentzian fitting function derived from coupled-mode theory, a parametric loss model linking radiative losses is established to film conductivity, providing design principles for optimized superconducting metamaterials with sustained superinductance. This work lays the foundation for scalable metamaterial superinductor design, advancing quantum computing, kinetic inductance detectors, and terahertz high-temperature superconductor based single photon detectors.

TI Rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on quantum LS-SVM
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Rolling bearing is an indispensable part of the contemporary industrial system, and its working conditions affect the state of the entire industrial system. Therefore, there is great engineering value to researching and improving the fault diagnosis technology of rolling bearings. However, with the involvement of the whole mechanical equipment, we need to have a large quantity of data to support the accuracy of fault diagnosis, while the efficiency of classical machine learning algorithms is poor in processing big data, and huge amount of computing resources is required. To solve this problem, this paper combines the HHL algorithm in quantum computing with the LS-SVM algorithm in machine learning and proposes a fault diagnosis model based on a quantum least square support vector machine (QSVM). Based on experiments simulated on analog quantum computers, we demonstrate that our fault diagnosis based on QSVM is feasible, and it can play a far superior advantage over the classical algorithm in the context of big data.

AB The analyses of highly configurable systems, as applied in software or automotive domains, yield hard problems due to the exponentially increasing number of possible product configurations. Current research identified that such combinatorial optimization problems, e.g. configuration selection and prioritization, are ideal targets for expected exponential quantum speedups. However, empirical evidence about the applicability of quantum computing to these problems is still missing. In this paper, we investigate how the constraint satisfaction and optimization problems of configuration selection and prioritization can be addressed using quantum computing. We propose a method to transform the configuration selection and prioritization problems encoded in attributed feature models into a quantum mechanical formulation suitable for optimization problems. We provide a Python library to automatically perform this transformation and apply the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), such that configuration selection and prioritization are solved with quantum computers. Our approach is evaluated regarding feasibility, solution quality, and scalability. We show that QAOA obtains good results regarding configuration selection, but for configuration prioritization, the approach needs further improvement.

TI Discovery of Room-Temperature Topological Insulators in Functionalized

SO MATERIALS
AB Topological insulators and semimetals are necessary to realize quantum computing and spintronics. We use first-principles calculations to investigate the atomic structure, electronic band structure, and Z2 invariants of four sets of pure and functionalized buckled hexagonal monolayers that are promising candidates for topological nature: BiAs, AsP, SbAs, BiSb, and functionalized monolayers BiAsX2, AsPX2, SbAsX2, and BiSbX2 (X = H, O, S). Our results show that BiAsO2, BiAsS2, AsPO2, SbAsO2, SbAsS2, BiSbH2, BiSbO2, and BiSbS2 are topological insulators with small SOC-induced band gaps ranging from 0.05 to 0.37 eV. Further, we propose AsPS2 to be a topological semiconductor. Topological insulators stand on the boundary of induction and conductance and are crucial in realizing quantum computers. The room-temperature topological insulators predicted here will have promising impacts in quantum computing, nanoelectronics, and spintronics.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms and Quantum Error Mitigation
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Quantum computers can exploit a Hilbert space whose dimension increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In experiment, quantum supremacy has recently been achieved by the Google team by using a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device with over 50 qubits. However, the question of what can be implemented on NISQ devices is still not fully explored, and discovering useful tasks for such devices is a topic of considerable interest. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are regarded as well-suited for execution on NISQ devices by combining quantum computers with classical computers, and are expected to be the first useful applications for quantum computing. Meanwhile, mitigation of errors on quantum processors is also crucial to obtain reliable results. In this article, we review the basic results for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and quantum error mitigation techniques. Since quantum computing with NISQ devices is an actively developing field, we expect this review to be a useful basis for future studies.

TI Spatial addressing of qubits in a dispersive waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Waveguide quantum electrodynamics-the study of atomic systems interacting with propagating electromagnetic fields-is a powerful platform for understanding the complex interplay between light and matter. Qubit control is an indispensable tool in this field, and most experiments thus far have used narrowband control pulses to interact with qubits at specific frequencies. Dynamics can change significantly with fast, broadband pulses, since waveguide properties such as dispersion affect the pulse evolution and its impact on the qubit. Here we use dispersion to achieve spatial addressing of superconducting qubits separated by a subwavelength distance within a microwave waveguide. This approach relies on a self-focusing effect to create a position-dependent interaction between a chirped pulse and an individual qubit. This method emphasizes the importance of dispersion in the design and analysis of quantum experiments, and offers avenues for the rapid control of quantum states.

TI Electric Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Helicity in a
   Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures is crucial for enhancing operational performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion helicity in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6 can be controlled by the direction of the external electric field applied during the field cooling process. The electric field-tuned helicity remains stable at low temperature, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between nearest neighbors, induced by the electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating helicity selection. The electrical control of magnetic helicity demonstrated in this study can be extended to other centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, paving the way for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.

TI Triple Fixed-Point Theorems: Generalized Analysis with AI/Crypto
   Applications
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB This study uses important findings from Hilbert Space (HS) theory to suggest new fixedpoint theorems for Three Self-Mappings (3-SMs) that apply to Generalized Inner Product Spaces (GIPS). We made it apparent when Common Fixed Points (CFPs) can exist and be unique, even when the contraction criteria aren't as strict. This improvement makes the theory better for systems with more than one operator. Our results are important in two main areas: (1) Artificial Intelligence (AI), where we use fixed-point analysis to make sure that Deep Equilibrium Models (DEMs) will work correctly, and (2) Cryptography (Crypto), where we use the mathematical properties of inner product spaces to make new lattice-based designs for Post-Quantum Protocols (PQPs). Real-world examples from nonlinear analysis and computational proof of the presented theorems support the theoretical contributions. This work combines advanced functional analysis with modern problems in Machine Learning (ML) and cybersecurity, giving it both mathematical depth and real-world usefulness.

TI Structural stability hypothesis of dual unitary quantum chaos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits-a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focusing on the spectral form factor, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.

TI Quantum eigenvector continuation for chemistry applications
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB A typical task for classical and quantum computing in chemistry is finding a potential energy surface (PES) along a reaction coordinate, which involves solving the quantum chemistry problem for many points along the reaction path. Developing algorithms to accomplish this task on quantum computers has been an active area of development, yet finding all the relevant eigenstates along the reaction coordinate remains a difficult problem, and determining PESs is thus a costly proposal. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a eigenvector continuation-a subspace expansion that uses a few eigenstates as a basis-as a tool for rapidly exploring PESs. We apply this to determining the binding PES or torsion PES for several molecules of varying complexity. In all cases, we show that the PES can be captured using relatively few basis states; suggesting that a significant amount of (quantum) computational effort can be saved by making use of already calculated ground states in this manner.

TI Symmetries of Liouvillians of squeeze-driven parametric oscillators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the symmetries of the Liouville superoperator of one dimensional parametric oscillators, especially the so-called squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, and discover a remarkable quasi-spin symmetry su(2) at integer values of the ratio eta=omega/K of the detuning parameter omega to the Kerr coefficient K, which reflects the symmetry previously found for the Hamiltonian operator. We find that the Liouvillian of an su(2) representation |j,mj > has a characteristic double-ellipsoidal structure, and calculate the relaxation time TX for this structure. We then study the phase transitions of the Liouvillian which occur as a function of the parameters xi=epsilon 2/K and eta=omega/K. Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. Our findings may have applications in the generation and stabilization of states of interest in quantum computing.

TI Fast quantum-enhanced imaging with visible-wavelength entangled photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum resources can provide supersensitive performance in optical imaging. Detecting entangled photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) with single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) image sensor arrays (ISAs) enables practical wide-field quantum-enhanced imaging. However, matching the SPDC wavelength to the peak detection efficiency range of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible mass -producible SPAD-ISAs has remained technologically elusive, resulting in low imaging speeds to date. Here, we show that a recently developed visible-wavelength entangled photon source enables high-speed quantum imaging. By operating at high detection efficiency of a SPAD-ISA, we increase acquisition speed by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous similar quantum imaging demonstrations. Besides being fast, the quantum-enhanced phase imager operating at short wavelengths retrieves nanometer scale height differences, tested by imaging evaporated silica and protein microarray spots on glass samples, with sensitivity improved by a factor of 1.351 +/- 0.004 over equivalent ideal classical imaging. This work represents an important stepping stone towards scalable real-world quantum imaging advantage, and may find use in biomedical and industrial applications as well as fundamental research.

TI Facing the Future of Crime: A Framework for Police Use of Technology
SO POLITICAL QUARTERLY
AB Technological change is rapid and brings many benefits to society. However, for some technologies there will be unintended consequences that create new opportunities for crime, or new ways of committing existing offences. Understanding what these threats are and addressing them is of great importance if we are to benefit responsibly from innovation and change. To illustrate the issues of central importance, we consider two emerging technologies-artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Of course, technological change also brings opportunities to reduce crime and make society safer. Nonetheless, the police adoption of technology should be done in a responsible manner which includes the need to evaluate whether it works to reduce crime, at what cost and how the use of new technologies will be received by the public. We discuss a framework for thinking about the police adoption of new technologies and the evidence that should be collected in advance to inform such decision making.

AB Efficient quantum control is necessary for practical quantum computing implementations with current technologies. Conventional algorithms for determining optimal control parameters are computationally expensive, largely excluding them from use outside of the simulation. Existing hardware solutions structured as lookup tables are imprecise and costly. By designing a machine learning model to approximate the results of traditional tools, a more efficient method can be produced. Such a model can then be synthesized into a hardware accelerator for use in quantum systems. In this study, we demonstrate a machine learning algorithm for predicting optimal pulse parameters. This algorithm is lightweight enough to fit on a low-resource FPGA and perform inference with a latency of 175 ns and pipeline interval of 5 ns with > 0.99 gate fidelity. In the long term, such an accelerator could be used near quantum computing hardware where traditional computers cannot operate, enabling quantum control at a reasonable cost at low latencies without incurring large data bandwidths outside of the cryogenic environment.

TI Exploring the Molecular Mechanism of the Antioxidant Activity of
   Medicine and Food Homology Licorice Flavonoids Based on Pharmacophore
   Theory and Quantum Calculations
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Licorice flavonoids are a kind of flavonoids extracted from the root of licorice, which have good antioxidant activity and are widely used in the food industry. In the early research of the research group, it has been found that the antioxidant activity of licorice flavonoids can be altered by solvent mediation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the antioxidant properties of licorice flavonoids is still not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the antioxidant activity of licorice flavonoids based on the principles of pharmacophore theory and quantum computing. Firstly, network pharmacology will be employed to study the antioxidant properties of licorice flavonoids. The major active components and key structural features responsible for the antioxidant activity in licorice flavonoids will be screened using pharmacophore theory and further validated through molecular docking. Lastly, quantum computing will be utilized to uncover the potential mechanism underlying their antioxidant activity. Pharmacophore studies have shown that licochalcone B, retrochalcone, isoliquiritin, and isoliquiritigenin exhibit low predicted IC50 values, indicating that these compounds are key components of licorice flavonoids in the antioxidant process. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and frontier molecular orbital studies have shown that licochalcone B, retrochalcone, isoliquiritin, and isoliquiritigenin all exhibit certain chemical reactivity. Quantum computing studies have found that the para-phenol hydroxyl group on the core structure of licochalcone B, isoliquiritigenin, retrochalcone, and isoliquiritin is a crucial functional group for the antioxidant activity of flavonoid compounds. In general, this study successfully elucidated the mode of action of licorice flavonoids in the antioxidant process, providing some guidance for the synthesis of new antioxidant compounds.

TI Research on A Lattice-Based Fuzzy Signature and Bimodal Gaussian
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Fuzzy signatures differ from standard signature schemes in that they use noisy strings as keys, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific auxiliary data. With the advent of quantum computing, lattice-based digital signatures are considered potential candidates for resisting quantum attacks. In this work, we revisited the lattice-based fuzzy signature scheme proposed by Zheng et al. and demonstrated how the scheme can be implemented more efficiently and securely. In our new signature scheme, our contributions are as follows: The utilization of bimodal Gaussian sampling reduces the number of aborting terminations while simultaneously decreasing the signature size. By eliminating the T matrix from the verification equation, we improve verification efficiency. Additionally, in response to the linear sketch proposed by the authors, we provide a proof of the collision resistance of the mapping h, which further enhances the correctness of the scheme.

TI Quantum-Inspired Power System Reliability Assessment
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB To enable an in-depth study of power system operation and planning, the assessment of standard reliability indices is inevitable. The Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach is a broadly used method in replacing the analytical methods in reliability indices assessment. The accuracy of MCS, however, highly depends on the sampling size, and hence, a complicated system with large number of components requires a large sampling size and daunting computational effort. To address this shortcoming, this paper attempts to take advantage of potentials of the quantum computing (QC) for power system reliability assessment by realizing the following contributions: 1) an innovative quantum model designed for reliability assessment; 2) a quantum circuit that achieves the quadratic speed up compared to the classical MCS method; 3) an efficient quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm to accurately evaluate the reliability indices. The accuracy and efficacy of the quantum reliability method are extensively verified and demonstrated on both radial and mesh distribution systems.

TI A stress-induced source of phonon bursts and quasiparticle poisoning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for superconductivity, creating a condition often called "quasiparticle poisoning". Both superconducting qubits and low threshold dark matter calorimeters have observed excess bursts of quasiparticles or phonons that decrease in rate with time. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these events.
   Identifying sources of quasiparticle poisoning is an active problem in superconducting quantum circuits. Here the authors show that the rate of quasiparticle bursts in a cryogenic calorimeter decreases by two orders of magnitude in a low-stress suspended state, suggesting stress as a key mechanism.

TI Transfer of optical orbital angular momentum under
   nonreciprocity-reciprocity amplification conversion
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Magnet-free optical nonreciprocity has significant applications in quantum communication, quantum networks, and optical information processing. In this research, considering a degenerate two-level thermal atomic system with the Doppler effect of thermal atoms, the nonreciprocal amplification (NRA) of dual-path degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) signals is achieved under the action of a co-propagating pumping field. On this basis, spatially multiplexed multiple FWM processes are formed by introducing another counter- propagating pumping field, thereby achieving the reciprocal amplification (RA) of the dual-channel FWM signals. Furthermore, by using multiple sets of spiral phase plates to load spiral phases on the signal light and the pumping light respectively, higher-order Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams carrying different optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) are generated and participate in the FWM process, achieving the transfer of the OAM of the pumping light to the amplified FWM fields. Simultaneously, using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the conservation characteristics of the OAM of each FWM signal in the NRA-RA conversion are further analyzed. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that in the multiple FWM process induced by a pair of counter-propagating pump fields, the OAM of the amplified FWM signal in each channel varies with that of the pump field. However, the overall process maintains the OAM conservation. This study provides a feasible solution for expanding the channel capacity using OAM based on NRA-RA system, showing that the OAM has potential application prospects in achieving high-capacity optical communication and multi-channel signal processing.

TI Spatial solitons in an electrically driven graphene multilayer medium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the evolution of coupled optical solitons in a multilayer graphene medium. The considered graphene medium is subjected to microwave voltage biasing. The coupled two optical solitons emerge through the electrical (i.e., microwave voltage) perturbation of the effective permittivity of the graphene multilayer. We show that the coupled solitons are electrically adjustable by controlling the amplitude and frequency of the biasing microwave voltage. Importantly, this proposed regime of electrically controlled optical solitons offers a modality to generate entangled optical solitons and two-mode squeezed solitons. Furthermore, the hybrid interaction that includes both the driving microwave voltage and the optical solitons yields a platform to combine the two worlds of quantum photonics and quantum superconducting systems.

TI Catastrophic magnetic flux avalanches in NbTiN superconducting
   resonators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Macroscopic superconducting components are an important building block of various quantum circuits. Since several of the envisioned applications require exposure to magnetic fields, it is of utmost importance to explore the impact of magnetic fields on their performance. Here we explore the complex pattern of magnetic field penetration and identify its impact on the resonance frequency of NbTiN superconducting resonators by combining magneto-optical imaging and high-frequency measurements. At temperatures below approximately half of the superconducting critical temperature, the development of magnetic flux avalanches manifests itself as a noisy response in the field-dependent resonance frequency. Magneto-optical imaging reveals different regimes and distinguishes the impact of avalanches in the ground plane and resonator. Our findings demonstrate that superconducting resonators represent a valuable tool to investigate magnetic flux dynamics. Moreover, the current blooming of niobium-based superconducting radio-frequency devices makes this report timely by unveiling the severe implications of magnetic flux dynamics.
   Quantum circuits are constructed from various superconducting components such as qubits and quantum logic gates and each come with their own challenges in terms of efficient operation. Here, the authors investigate the effects of magnetic field penetration on superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators and suggest ways to improve their magnetic resilience.

TI The Floquet Fluxonium Molecule: Driving Down Dephasing in Coupled
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB High-coherence qubits, which can store and manipulate quantum states for long times with low error rates, are necessary building blocks for quantum computers. Here we propose a driven superconducting erasure qubit, the Floquet fluxonium molecule, which minimizes bit-flip rates through disjoint support of its qubit states and suppresses phase flips by a novel second-order insensitivity to flux-noise dephasing. We estimate the bit-flip, phase-flip, and erasure rates through numerical simulations, with predicted coherence times of approximately 50 ms in the computational subspace and erasure lifetimes of about 500 mu s. We also present a protocol for performing high-fidelity single-qubit rotation gates via additional flux modulation, on timescales of roughly 500 ns, and propose a scheme for erasure detection and logical readout. Our results demonstrate the utility of drives for building new qubits that can outperform their static counterparts.

TI Generalised Winograd Schema and its Contextuality
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 17-21, 2023
CL Paris, FRANCE
AB Ambiguities in natural language give rise to probability distributions over interpretations. The distributions are often over multiple ambiguous words at a time; a multiplicity which makes them a suitable topic for sheaf-theoretic models of quantum contextuality. Previous research showed that different quantitative measures of contextuality correlate well with Psycholinguistic research on lexical ambiguities. In this work, we focus on coreference ambiguities and investigate the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a test proposed by Levesque in 2011 to evaluate the intelligence of machines. The WSC consists of a collection of multiple-choice questions that require disambiguating pronouns in sentences structured according to the Winograd schema, in a way that makes it difficult for machines to determine the correct referents but remains intuitive for human comprehension. In this study, we propose an approach that analogously models the Winograd schema as an experiment in quantum physics. However, we argue that the original Winograd Schema is inherently too simplistic to facilitate contextuality. We introduce a novel mechanism for generalising the schema, rendering it analogous to a Bell-CHSH measurement scenario. We report an instance of this generalised schema, complemented by the human judgements we gathered via a crowdsourcing platform. The resulting model violates the Bell-CHSH inequality by 0.192, thus exhibiting contextuality in a coreference resolution setting.

TI Superconducting qubits in a flip-chip architecture
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Flip-chip architectures have recently enabled significant scaling-up of multi-qubit circuits and have been used to assemble hybrid quantum systems that combine different substrates, for example, for quantum acoustics experiments. The standard flip-chip method uses superconducting galvanic connections between two substrates, typically implemented using sophisticated indium wafer-bonding systems, which give highly reliable and temperature-cyclable assemblies, but are expensive, somewhat inflexible in design, and require robust substrates that can sustain the large compressive forces required to cold-weld the indium bonds. A much simpler method is to assemble dies using very low-force contacts and air-dried adhesives, although this does not provide a galvanic contact between the dies. Here, we demonstrate that the latter technique can be used to reliably couple superconducting qubit circuits, in which the qubits are on separate dies, without the need for a galvanic connection. We demonstrate full vector qubit control of each qubit on each of the two dies, with high-fidelity single-shot readout, and further demonstrate entanglement-generating excitation swaps as well as benchmark a controlled-Z entangling gate between the two qubits on the two dies. This exemplifies a simple and inexpensive assembly method for two-plus-one-dimensional quantum circuit integration that supports the use of delicate or unusually shaped substrates.

AB Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is attractive for its relatively small public key size, but it is still unsatisfactory due to its efficiency, compared to other post-quantum proposals. In this paper, we focus on the performance of SIDH when the starting curve is E6 : y2 = x3 + 6x2 + x, which is fixed in Round-3 SIKE implementation. Inspired by previous works [1], [2], we present several tricks to accelerate key generation of SIDH and each process of SIKE. Our experimental results show that the performance of this work is at least 6.09% faster than that of the SIKE implementation, and we can further improve the performance when large storage is available.

TI RETRACTED: Data Encryption Technology Analysis of Robot Computer Network

SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB In order to ensure the security of robot computer network information, a data encryption technology is proposed. Through the comprehensive research of symmetric cryptography algorithm, open cryptography algorithm, hybrid encryption algorithm, AES algorithm, quantum cryptography technology, and ECC algorithm, a data encryption method suitable for robot computer network information is proposed. It is found that when analyzing the entanglement characteristics of the four-particle cluster state, the anomaly will inevitably disturb its state. In the eavesdropping detection, the communication parties can cooperate to detect the existence of abnormal conditions. In addition, in the formal communication stage, trial photons are introduced, whose confidentiality characteristics are guaranteed by the principle of quantum noncloning and the uncertainty principle. Therefore, this technology further ensures the confidentiality of communication.

TI Decoherence, appearance, and reality in agential realism
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB This paper reconsiders what implications quantum decoherence has for Karen Barad's agential realism. In contrast with the recent claim of Thomas Everth and Laura Gurney (2022), this paper argues that decoherence supports rather than defeats the holist, relational ontology of agential realism. Indeed, decoherence offers an explanation for how a quantum system can remain entangled and superposed in principle while it nevertheless in practice appears classical to a local observer. Decoherence shows why the appearance of classicality is not an objection to the ontology being in reality that of agential realism, in accordance with Barad's repeated insistence that we should not mistake principle for practice. Whether users of agential realism in social theory should be encouraged by this is another matter that this paper does not take a stance on. As an ontology, however, agential realism is vindicated.

TI Measurement of correlated charge noise in superconducting qubits at an
   underground facility
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The charge environment of superconducting qubits may be studied through the introduction of controlled, quantified amounts of ionizing radiation. We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4 pi coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19-0.03+0.04\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.1{9}_{-0.03}<^>{+0.04}$$\end{document} mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly seven higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.

TI Preserving Phase Coherence and Linearity in Cat Qubits with Exponential
   Bit-Flip Suppression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multipole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over 0.1 s with a mean photon number of only 4. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of T1;eff <^> 70 mu s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat-qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two-thirds) of a 3 mu s cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.

TI Recursive relations and quantum eigensolver algorithms within modified

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We derive recursive relations for the Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation applied to the half-filled Hubbard dimer. While the standard SW transformation is set to block-diagonalize the transformed Hamiltonian solely at the first order of perturbation, we infer from recursive relations two types of modifications, variational or iterative, that approximate, or even enforce for the homogeneous case, the desired block-diagonalization at infinite order of perturbation. The modified SW unitary transformations are then used to design an test quantum algorithms adapted to the noisy and fault-tolerant era. This work paves the way toward the design of alternative quantum algorithms for the general Hubbard Hamiltonian.

TI Quasiparticle Dynamics in Epitaxial Al-InAs Planar Josephson Junctions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quasiparticle (QP) effects play a significant role in the coherence and fidelity of superconducting quantum circuits. The Andreev bound states of high-transparency Josephson junctions can act as low-energy traps for QPs, providing a mechanism for studying the dynamics and properties of both the QPs and the junction. Using locally injected and thermal QPs, we study QP loss and QP poisoning in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions incorporated in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) galvanically shorting a superconducting resonator to ground. We observe changes in the resonance line shape and frequency shifts consistent with QP trapping into and clearing out of the ABSs of the junctions when the junctions are phase biased. By monitoring the QP trapping and clearing mechanisms in time, we find a time scale of O(1 mu s) for these QP dynamics, consistent with the presence of phonon-mediated QP-QP interactions. Our measurements suggest that electron-phonon interactions play a significant role in the relaxation mechanisms of our system, while electron-photon interactions and electron-phonon interactions govern the clearing mechanisms. Our results highlight the QP-induced dissipation and complex QP dynamics in superconducting quantum circuits fabricated on superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures.

TI Quantifying entanglement from the geometric perspective
SO EPL
AB entanglement between several particles is essential for applications like quantum metrology or quantum cryptography, but it is also central for foundational phenomena like quantum non-locality. This leads to the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a quantum state. We present a review on the geometric measure of entanglement, being a quantifier based on the distance of a state to the nearest separable state. We explain basic properties, existing methods to compute it, its operational interpretations, as well as scaling and complexity issues. We point out intimate relations to fundamental problems in mathematics concerning eigenvalues and norms of tensors. Consequently, the geometric measure of entanglement provides a playground where physical intuition and mathematical rigor benefit from each other.

TI Quantum Hall Valley Splitters and a Tunable Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
   in Graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Graphene is a very promising test bed for the field of electron quantum optics. However, a fully tunable and coherent electronic beam splitter is still missing. We report the demonstration of electronic beam splitters in graphene that couple quantum Hall edge channels having opposite valley polarizations. The electronic transmission of our beam splitters can be tuned from zero to near unity. By independently setting the beam splitters at the two corners of a graphene p-n junction to intermediate transmissions, we realize a fully tunable electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This tunability allows us to unambiguously identify the quantum interferences due to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and to study their dependence with the beam-splitter transmission and the interferometer bias voltage. The comparison with conventional semiconductor interferometers points toward universal processes driving the quantum decoherence in those two different 2D systems, with graphene being much more robust to their effect.

TI The foundation of the hyperunified field theory I - Fundamental building
   block and symmetry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB Starting from the motional property of functional field based on the action principle of path integral formulation while proposing maximum coherence motion principle and maximum locally entangled-qubits motion principle as guiding principles, we show that such a functional field as fundamental building block appears naturally as an entangled qubit-spinor field expressed by a locally entangled state of qubits. Its motion brings about the appearance of Minkowski space-time with dimension determined by the motioncorrelation Mc-spin charge and the emergence of M-c-spin/hyperspin symmetry as fundamental symmetry. Intrinsic Q(c)-spin charge displays a periodic feature as the mod 4 qubit number, which enables us to classify all entangled qubit-spinor fields and space-time dimensions into four categories with respect to four Q(c)-spin charges C-Qc = 0; 1; 2; 3. An entangled decaqubit-spinor field in 19-dimensional hyper-space-time is found to be a hyperunified qubit-spinor field which unifies all discovered leptons and quarks and brings on the existence of mirror lepton-quark states. The inhomogeneous hyperspin symmetry WS(1, 18) as hyperunified symmetry in association with inhomogeneous Lorentztype symmetry PO(1, 18) and global scaling symmetry provides a unified fundamental symmetry. The maximum locally entangled-qubits motion principle is shown to lay the foundation of hyperunified field theory, which enables us to comprehend long-standing questions raised in particle physics and quantum field theory.

TI Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source-drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time t(meas )is much less than the decoherence time t(dec) such that t(dec) /t(meas)>100. This suggests that less than 1% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility of implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.

TI The optimization of flux trajectories for the adiabatic controlled-Z
   gate on split-tunable transmons
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In a system of two tunable-frequency qubits, it is well-known that adiabatic tuning into strong coupling-interaction regions between the qubit subspace and the rest of the Hilbert space can be used to generate an effective controlled-Z rotation. We address the problem of determining a preferable adiabatic trajectory along which the qubit frequency is tuned and apply this to the flux-tunable transmon model. The especially minimal anharmonic nature of these quantum processors makes them good candidates for qubit control using non-computational states as long as higher-level leakage is properly addressed. While the statement of this method has occurred multiple times in the literature, there have been few discussions on which trajectories may be used. We present a generalized method for optimizing parameterized families of possible flux trajectories and provide examples of use on five test families of one and two parameters.

TI There exist infinitely many kinds of partial separability/entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In tri-partite systems, there are three basic biseparability, A-BC, B-CA, and C-AB, according to bipartitions of local systems. We begin with three convex sets consisting of these basic biseparable states in the three-qubit system, and consider arbitrary iterations of intersections and/or convex hulls of them to get convex cones. One natural way to classify tri-partite states is to consider those convex sets to which they belong or do not belong. This is especially useful to classify partial entanglement of mixed states. We show that the lattice generated by those three basic convex sets with respect to convex hull and intersection has infinitely many mutually distinct members to see that there are infinitely many kinds of three-qubit partial entanglement. To do this, we consider an increasing chain of convex sets in the lattice and exhibit three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger diagonal states distinguishing those convex sets in the chain.

TI Recoverability for optimized quantum f-divergences
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The optimized quantum f-divergences form a family of distinguishability measures that includes the quantum relative entropy and the sandwiched Renyi relative quasi-entropy as special cases. In this paper, we establish physically meaningful refinements of the data-processing inequality for the optimized f-divergence. In particular, the refinements state that the absolute difference between the optimized f-divergence and its channel-processed version is an upper bound on how well one can recover a quantum state acted upon by a quantum channel, whenever the recovery channel is taken to be a rotated Petz recovery channel. Not only do these results lead to physically meaningful refinements of the data-processing inequality for the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but they also have implications for perfect reversibility (i.e. quantum sufficiency) of the optimized f-divergences. Along the way, we improve upon previous physically meaningful refinements of the data-processing inequality for the standard f-divergence, as established in recent work of Carlen and Vershynina [arXiv:1710.02409, arXiv:1710.08080]. Finally, we extend the definition of the optimized f-divergence, its data-processing inequality, and all of our recoverability results to the general von Neumann algebraic setting, so that all of our results can be employed in physical settings beyond those confined to the most common finite-dimensional setting of interest in quantum information theory.

In this letter, we first report a 3/2 diagonal resistance, indicating the existence of a 3/2 state in a nanometer-sized triple-gated quantum point contact (QPC) fabricated on a high-mobility (not ultra-high-mobility) single-layer two-dimensional (2D) GaAs wafer. The center gate plays a crucial role in realizing the QPC's 3/2 state. Our observation of the 3/2 state using a conventional QPC device, which is a suitable building block for semiconductor quantum devices, paves a new path for the development of semiconductor-based quantum technologies.

TI Analytical framework for quantum alternating operator ansatze
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We develop a framework for analyzing layered quantum algorithms such as quantum alternating operator ansatze (QAOA). In the context of combinatorial optimization, our framework relates quantum cost gradient operators, derived from the cost and mixing Hamiltonians, to classical cost difference functions that reflect cost function neighborhood structure. By considering QAOA circuits from the Heisenberg picture, we derive exact general expressions for expectation values as series expansions in the algorithm parameters, cost gradient operators, and cost difference functions. This enables novel interpretability and insight into QAOA behavior in various parameter regimes. For single-level QAOA(1) we show the leading-order changes in the output probabilities and cost expectation value explicitly in terms of classical cost differences, for arbitrary cost functions. This demonstrates that, for sufficiently small positive parameters, probability flows from lower to higher cost states on average. By selecting signs of the parameters, we can control the direction of flow. We use these results to derive a classical random algorithm emulating QAOA(1) in the small-parameter regime, i.e. that produces bitstring samples with the same probabilities as QAOA(1) up to small error. For deeper QAOA( p ) circuits we apply our framework to derive analogous and additional results in several settings. In particular we show QAOA always beats random guessing. We describe how our framework incorporates cost Hamiltonian locality for specific problem classes, including causal cone approaches, and applies to QAOA performance analysis with arbitrary parameters. We illuminate our results with a number of examples including applications to QUBO problems, MaxCut, and variants of MaxSAT. We illustrate the generalization of our framework to QAOA circuits using mixing unitaries beyond the transverse-field mixer through two examples of constrained optimization problems, Max Independent Set and Graph Coloring. We conclude by outlining some of the further applications we envision for the framework.

TI Comparing the cost of violating causal assumptions in Bell experiments:
   locality, free choice and arrow-of-time
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The causal modelling of Bell experiments relies on three fundamental assumptions: locality, freedom of choice and arrow-of-time. It turns out that nature violates Bell inequalities, which implies the failure of at least one of those assumptions. Since rejecting any of them, even partially, is sufficient to explain the observed correlations, it is natural to inquire about the cost in each case. This paper builds upon the findings in Blasiak et al. 2021 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 118, e2020569118 (doi:10.1073/pnas.2020569118) showing the equivalence between the locality and free choice assumptions. Here, we include retrocausal models to complete the picture of causal explanations of the observed correlations. Furthermore, we refine the discussion by considering more challenging causal scenarios which allow only single-arrow type violations of a given assumption. The figure of merit chosen for the comparison of the causal cost is defined as the minimal frequency of violation of the respective assumption required for a simulation of the observed experimental statistics.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice'.

SO ICT EXPRESS
AB Falcon, a NIST-standardized DSA, is ideal for broadcast-based communication like UAV due to its short key and signature. Since each UAV broadcasts the signed message to surrounding parties, UAVs must verify numerous signatures in flight. After migrating from ECDSA to Falcon for quantum security, it is crucial to maintain the same throughput of signature verification. However, existing Falcon implementations do not guarantee that throughput. We optimize Falcon Verify for Cortex-M4, enhancing NTT-based polynomial multiplication with signed representation and Plantard-based modular multiplication. We outperform the latest Falcon implementation in pqm4 by 64%/75% (resp. Falcon-512/Falcon-1024) in verification time, ensuring ECDSA-like throughput.

TI Chemical tuning of quantum spin-electric coupling in molecular magnets
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Controlling quantum spins using electric rather than magnetic fields promises substantial architectural advantages for developing quantum technologies. In this context, spins in molecular magnets offer tunability of spin-electric couplings (SECs) by rational chemical design. Here we demonstrate systematic control of SECs in a family of Mn(II)-containing molecules by varying the coordination environment of the spin centre. The trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) molecular structure with C3 symmetry leads to a substantial molecular electric dipole moment that is directly connected to its magnetic anisotropy. The interplay between these two features gives rise to experimentally observed SECs, which can be rationalized by wavefunction theoretical calculations. Our findings guide strategies for the development of electrically controllable molecular spin qubits for quantum technologies.

TI Polaron dynamics of Bloch-Zener oscillations in an extended Holstein
   model
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recent developments in qubit engineering make circuit quantum electrodynamics devices promising candidates for the study of Bloch oscillations (BOs) and Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions. In this work, a hybrid circuit chain with alternating site energies under external electric fields is employed to study Bloch-Zener oscillations (BZOs), i.e. coherent superpositions of BOs and LZ transitions. We couple each of the tunable qubits in the chain to dispersionless optical phonons and build an extended Holstein polaron model with the purpose of investigating vibronic effects in the BZOs. We employ an extension of the Davydov ansatz in combination with the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle to simulate the dynamics of the qubit chain under the influence of high-frequency quantum harmonic oscillators. Band gaps emerge due to energy differences in site energies at alternating qubit sites, and are shown to play key roles in tuning band structures and time periodic reconstructions of the wave patterns. In the absence of qubit-phonon interactions, the qubits undergo either standard BZOs or breathing modes, depending on whether the initial wave packet is formed by a broad or narrow Gaussian wave packet, respectively. The BZOs can get localized in space if the band gaps are sufficiently large. In the presence of qubit-phonon coupling, the periodic behavior of BZOs can be washed out and undergo dynamic localization. The influence of an ohmic bath on the dynamics of BZOs is investigated by means of a Markovian master equation approach. Finally, we calculate the von Neumann entropy as a measure of the entanglement between qubits and phonons.

TI Unidirectional output from a quantum-dot single-photon source hybrid
   integrated on silicon
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a quantum-dot single-photon source (QD SPS) hybrid integrated on a silicon waveguide embedding a photonic crystal mirror, which reflects photons and enables efficient unidirectional output from the waveguide. The silicon waveguide is constituted of a subwavelength grating so as to maintain the high efficiency even under the presence of stacking misalignment accompanied by hybrid integration processes. Experimentally, we assembled the hybrid photonic structure by transfer printing and demonstrated single-photon generation from a QD and its unidirectional output from the waveguide. These results point out a promising approach toward scalable integration of SPSs on silicon quantum photonics platforms.

TI Approximating Edit Distance in Truly Subquadratic Time: Quantum and
   MapReduce
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB The edit distance between two strings is defined as the smallest number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions that need to be made to transform one of the strings to another one. Approximating edit distance in subquadratic time is "one of the biggest unsolved problems in the field of combinatorial pattern matching" [37]. Our main result is a quantum constant approximation algorithm for computing the edit distance in truly subquadratic time. More precisely, we give an O(n(1.810)) quantum algorithm that approximates the edit distance within a factor of 3. We further extend this result to an O(n(1.708)) quantum algorithm that approximates the edit distance within a larger constant factor.
   Our solutions are based on a framework for approximating edit distance in parallel settings. This framework requires as black box an algorithm that computes the distances of several smaller strings all at once. For a quantum algorithm, we reduce the black box to metric estimation and provide efficient algorithms for approximating it. We further show that this framework enables us to approximate edit distance in distributed settings. To this end, we provide a MapReduce algorithm to approximate edit distance within a factor of 1 + epsilon, with sublinearly many machines and sublinear memory. Also, our algorithm runs in a logarithmic number of rounds.

TI Quantum blockchain based on asymmetric quantum encryption and a stake
   vote consensus algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As emerging next-generation information technologies, blockchains have unique advantages in information transparency and transaction security. They have attracted great attentions in social and financial fields. However, the rapid development of quantum computation and the impending realization of quantum supremacy have had significant impacts on the advantages of traditional blockchain based on traditional cryptography. Here, we propose a blockchain algorithm based on asymmetric quantum encryption and a stake vote consensus algorithm. The algorithm combines a consensus algorithm based on the delegated proof of stake with node behaviour and Borda count (DPoSB) and quantum digital signature technology based on quantum state computational distinguishability with a fully flipped permutation (QSCD(ff)) problem. DPoSB is used to generate blocks by voting, while the quantum signature applies quantum one-way functions to guarantee the security of transactions. The analysis shows that this combination offers better protection than other existing quantum-resistant blockchains. The combination can effectively resist the threat of quantum computation on blockchain technology and provide a new platform to ensure the security of blockchain.

TI Direct measurement of microwave loss in Nb films for superconducting
   qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Niobium films are a key component in modern two-dimensional superconducting qubits, yet their contribution to the total qubit decay rate is not fully understood. The presence of different layers of materials and interfaces makes it difficult to identify the dominant loss channels in present two-dimensional qubit designs. In this paper, we present the study that directly correlates measurements of RF losses in such films to material parameters by investigating a high-power impulse magnetron sputtered (HiPIMS) film atop a three-dimensional niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) resonator. By using a 3D SRF structure, we are able to isolate the niobium film loss from other contributions. Our findings indicate that microwave dissipation in the HiPIMS-prepared niobium films, within the quantum regime, resembles that of record-high intrinsic quality factor of bulk niobium SRF cavities, with lifetimes extending into seconds. Microstructure and impurity level of the niobium film do not significantly affect the losses. These results set the scale of microwave losses in niobium films and show that niobium losses do not dominate the observed coherence times in present two-dimensional superconducting qubit designs, instead highlighting the dominant role of the dielectric oxide in limiting the performance. We can also set a bound for when niobium film losses will become a limitation for qubit lifetimes.

TI Coherence protection of spin qubits in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in foils of hexagonal boron nitride are an attractive platform for magnetic field imaging, since the probe can be placed in close proximity to the target. However, as a III-V material the electron spin coherence is limited by the nuclear spin environment, with spin echo coherence times of similar to 100 ns at room temperature accessible magnetic fields. We use a strong continuous microwave drive with a modulation in order to stabilize a Rabi oscillation, extending the coherence time up to similar to 4 mu s, which is close to the 10 mu s electron spin lifetime in our sample. We then define a protected qubit basis, and show full control of the protected qubit. The coherence times of a superposition of the protected qubit can be as high as 0.8 mu s. This work establishes that boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride can have electron spin coherence times that are competitive with typical nitrogen vacancy centres in small nanodiamonds under ambient conditions.
   Spin defects in 2D hBN are promising for magnetic field sensing but suffer from short spin coherence times. Here the authors extend the coherence time for an ensemble of spins in hBN to 4 microseconds by using a continuous microwave drive and demonstrate qubit control in a protected spin space.

TI Rapid stabilization of stochastic quantum systems in a unified framework
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Rapid stabilization of general stochastic quantum systems is investigated based on the rapid stability of stochastic differential equations. We introduce a Lyapunov-LaSalle-like theorem for a class of nonlinear stochastic systems first, based on which a unified framework of rapidly stabilizing stochastic quantum systems is proposed. According to the proposed unified framework, we design the switching state feedback controls to achieve the rapid stabilization of single-qubit systems, two-qubit systems, and N-qubit systems. From the unified framework, the state space is divided into two state subspaces, and the target state is located in one state subspace, while the other system equilibria are located in the other state subspace. Under the designed state feedback controls, the system state can only transit through the boundary between the two state subspaces no more than two times, and the target state is globally asymptotically stable in probability. In particular, the system state can converge exponentially in (all or part of) the state subspace where the target state is located. Moreover, the effectiveness and rapidity of the designed state feedback controls are shown in numerical simulations by stabilizing GHZ states for a three-qubit system.

TI Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating
   strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The accurate first-principles description of strongly correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here, we demonstrate that using quantum algorithms to obtain the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate Ca2CuO3, the excitonic ground state of monolayer WTe2, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal SrVO3. Numerical simulations using a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to 54 qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical preoptimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.

TI Solving Boolean Satisfiability Problems With The Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB One of the most prominent application areas for quantum computers is solving hard constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. However, detailed analyses of the complexity of standard quantum algorithms have suggested that outperforming classical methods for these problems would require extremely large and powerful quantum computers. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed for near-term quantum computers, yet previous work has shown strong limitations on the ability of QAOA to outperform classical algorithms for optimization problems. Here we instead apply QAOA to hard constraint satisfaction problems, where both classical and quantum algorithms are expected to require exponential time. We analytically characterize the average success probability of QAOA on a constraint satisfaction problem commonly studied using statistical physics methods: random k-SAT at the threshold for satisfiability, as the number of variables n goes to infinity. We complement these theoretical results with numerical experiments on the performance of QAOA for small n , which match the limiting theoretical bounds closely. We then compare QAOA with leading classical solvers. For random 8-SAT, we find that for more than 14 quantum circuit layers, QAOA achieves more efficient scaling than the highest-performance classical solver we tested, WalkSATlm. Our results suggest that near-term quantum algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems may outperform their classical counterparts.

Such a basic operation is seen to give rise to a wealth of interesting and useful effects, from the generation of a tunable degree of entanglement to the birth of peculiar correlations in the photon numbers and the quadratures of multimode, multiphoton, states of light. The experimental investigation of these properties will have an impact both on fundamental studies concerning, for example, the quantumness and entanglement of macroscopic states, and for possible applications in the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies.

TI Evaluation framework for quantum security risk assessment: A
   comprehensive strategy for quantum-safe transition
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB The rise of large-scale quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional cryptographic security measures. Quantum attacks, particularly targeting the mathematical foundations of current asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, render them ineffective. Even standard symmetric key cryptography is susceptible, albeit to a lesser extent, with potential security enhancements through longer keys or extended hash function outputs. Consequently, the cryptographic solutions currently employed to safeguard data will be inadequately secure and vulnerable to emerging quantum technology threats. In response to this impending quantum menace, organizations must chart a course towards quantum-safe environments, demanding robust business continuity plans and meticulous risk management throughout the migration process. This study provides an in-depth exploration of the challenges associated with migrating from a non-quantum-safe cryptographic state to one resilient against quantum threats. We introduce a comprehensive security risk assessment framework that scrutinizes vulnerabilities across algorithmic, certificate, and protocol layers, covering the entire migration journey, including pre-migration, through-migration, and post-migration stages. Our methodology links identified vulnerabilities to the well-established STRIDE threat model, establishing precise criteria for evaluating their potential impact and likelihood throughout the migration process. Moving beyond theoretical analysis, we address vulnerabilities practically, especially within critical components like cryptographic algorithms, public key infrastructures, and network protocols. Our study not only identifies potential attacks and vulnerabilities at each layer and migration stage but also suggests possible countermeasures and alternatives to enhance system resilience, empowering organizations to construct a secure infrastructure for the quantum era. Through these efforts, we establish the foundation for enduring security in networked systems amid the challenges of the quantum era.

TI Mitigating heavy metal pollution in agriculture: A multi-omics and
   nanotechnology approach to safeguard global wheat production
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES
AB The escalating issue of heavy metal (HM) contamination in agricultural soils presents an urgent challenge to the sustainability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. This review underscores the critical need for innovative approaches to ensure food security while mitigating environmental degradation. The integration of nano and quantum technologies with multi-omics frameworks emerges as a groundbreaking solution to this pressing issue. HMs like Cd, As, and Pb severely impair plant physiology, leading to diminished yields and compromised grain quality. Nanoparticles such as ZnO, TiO2, and MnO2, along with quantum dots, have shown substantial promise in bolstering wheat's natural defense systems, enhancing both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant pathways, and reducing metal uptake through targeted detoxification mechanisms. By leveraging advanced omics technologies-transcriptomics, ionomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-researchers can unravel key molecular pathways and biomarkers, offering precision-guided interventions for metal stress management. Furthermore, future innovations like genome-editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and transgenic techniques hold the potential to create wheat varieties inherently more resilient to environmental contaminants.. The review highlights the necessity of long-term field trials and the exploration of under-researched metals and nanoparticles to bring these promising laboratory findings to real-world application. These combined strategies not only contribute to sustainable agriculture but also provide a viable path toward reducing the ecological footprint of HM contamination, thereby safeguarding global food security.

TI Unified multivariate trace estimation and quantum error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Calculating the trace of the product of m n-qubit density matrices (multivariate trace) is a crucial subroutine in quantum error mitigation and information measure estimation. We propose a unified multivariate trace estimation (UMT) which conceptually unifies the previous qubit-optimal and depth-optimal approaches with tunable quantum circuit depth and number of qubits. The constructed circuits have ⠂(m - 1)/s ⠃ or n ⠂(m - 1)/s ⠃ depth corresponding to (s + m)n or s + mn qubits for s & ISIN; {1, ... , ⠅m/2 ⠆}, respectively. Such flexible circuit structures enable people to choose suitable circuits for different hardware devices. We apply UMT to virtual distillation to achieve exponential error suppression and design a family of concrete circuits to calculate the trace of the product of eight and nine n-qubit density matrices. A numerical example shows that the additional circuits still mitigate the noise expectation value under the global depolarizing channel.

TI Photo-Induced Charge State Dynamics of the Neutral and Negatively
   Charged Silicon Vacancy Centers in Room-Temperature Diamond
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond is drawing much attention due to its optical and spin properties, attractive for quantum information processing and sensing. Comparatively little is known, however, about the dynamics governing SiV charge state interconversion mainly due to challenges associated with generating, stabilizing, and characterizing all possible charge states, particularly at room temperature. Here, multi-color confocal microscopy and density functional theory are used to examine photo-induced SiV recombination - from neutral, to single-, to double-negatively charged - over a broad spectral window in chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) diamond under ambient conditions. For the SiV0 to SiV- transition, a linear growth of the photo-recombination rate with laser power at all observed wavelengths is found, a hallmark of single photon dynamics. Laser excitation of SiV-, on the other hand, yields only fractional recombination into SiV2-, a finding that is interpreted in terms of a photo-activated electron tunneling process from proximal nitrogen atoms.
   Silicon vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are candidates for quantum networks but exhibit charge instability under illumination. This work uses variable-wavelength infra-red excitation to characterize charge transfer from SiV0 to SiV- and from SiV- to SiV2-. These processes occur via different mechanisms, namely, single-photon recombination and electron tunnelling from a nitrogen donor, findings supported by density functional theory modeling. image

In this variant, the solution of a given multivariate quadratic system must also be regular, i.e. each fixed-length block of consecutive entries has only one nonzero entry. We prove the NP-completeness of this variant and show similarities and differences with other computational problems used in cryptography. Then we analyze its hardness by reviewing the most common solvers for polynomial systems over finite fields, derive asymptotic formulas for the corresponding complexities and compare the different approaches.

TI Comparing models for a unitary black hole S matrix
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This paper compares features, challenges, and puzzles of different models for a unitary black hole S-matrix, focusing on both recent nonisometric models, as well as "nonviolent unitarization," which is based on new quantum interactions of a black hole. As a foundation for comparison, the description of realtime Hawking evolution is first overviewed, including leading effects of gravitational dressing and backreaction. Connection is then made to qubit models for evolution, and some technology is outlined to facilitate their description. Important features of both nonisometric models and nonviolent unitarization are investigated in qubit models, which illustrate essential differences between the respective approaches. The nonisometric models present puzzles for understanding evolution of internal outgoing excitations, which can be excited by interactions such as particle decay. Qubit models for nonviolent unitarization are further developed, and nicely illustrate aspects of that approach. Some remaining questions in generalizing to more complete models for evolution are discussed.

TI Tightening monogamy and polygamy relations of unified entanglement in
   multipartite systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We study monogamy and polygamy inequalities of unified entanglement in multipartite quantum systems. We first derive the monogamy inequality of unified-(q, s) entanglement for multi-qubit states under arbitrary bipartition, and then obtain the monogamy inequalities of the alpha th (0 <= alpha <= R/2, r >= root 2) power of entanglement of formation for tripartite states and their generalizations in multi-qubit quantum states. We also generalize the polygamy inequalities of unified-(q, s) entanglement for multiqubit states under arbitrary bipartition. Moreover, we investigate polygamy inequalities of the beta th (beta >= max(1, s), 0 <= s <= s(0), 0 <= s(0) <= root 5) power of the entanglement of formation for 2 circle times 2 circle times 2 and n-qubit quantum systems. Finally, using detailed examples, we show that the results are tighter than previous studies.

AB We have proposed and demonstrated an ultra-compact Y-branch splitter on the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform with topology optimization. Fabrication constraints, such as minimum feature size and radius of curvature, are also involved within the optimization process. With optimized design and high aspect ratio etching techniques, the footprint of Y-branch splitter is only 6 mu mx4 mu m while the average insertion loss is as low as 0.12 dB within 40 nm operation wavelength range.

TI Electronic and Electrical Properties of Island-Type Hybrid Structures
   Based on Bi-Layer Graphene and Chiral Nanotubes: Predictive Analysis by
   Quantum Simulation Methods
SO COATINGS
AB Hybrid structures based on graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most relevant modern nanomaterials for applications in various fields, including electronics. The variety of topological architectures of graphene/CNT hybrids requires a preliminary study of their physical properties by in silico methods. This paper is devoted to the study of the electronic and electrical properties of graphene/CNT hybrid 2D structures with an island topology using the self-consistent charge density functional-based tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) formalism and the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. The island-type topology is understood as the atomic configuration of a graphene/CNT hybrid film, in which the structural fragments of graphene and nanotubes form "islands" (regions of the atomic structure) with an increased density of carbon atoms. The island-type graphene/CNT hybrid structures are formed by AB-stacked bilayer graphene and (6,3)/(12,8) chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The bilayer graphene is located above the nanotube perpendicular to its axis. Based on the binding energy calculations, it is found that the atomistic models of the studied graphene/SWCNT hybrid structures are thermodynamically stable. The peculiarities of the band structure of graphene/SWCNT (6,3) and graphene/SWCNT (12,8) hybrid structures are analyzed. It is shown that the electronic properties of graphene/SWCNT hybrid structures are sensitive to the orientation and size of the graphene layers with respect to the nanotube surface. It is found that an energy gap of similar to 0.1 eV opens in the band structure of only the graphene/SWCNT (6,3) hybrid structure, in which the graphene layers of the same length are arranged horizontally above the nanotube surface. We revealed the electrical conductivity anisotropy for all considered atomistic models of the graphene/SWCNT (12,8) hybrid structure when bilayer graphene sheets with different sizes along the zigzag and armchair directions are located at an angle with respect to the nanotube surface. The obtained knowledge is important to evaluate the prospects for the potential application of the considered atomic configurations of graphene/SWCNT hybrid structures with island-type topology as connecting conductors and electrodes in electronic devices.

TI On decoherence in surface hopping: The nonadiabaticity threshold
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB This study presents a strategy to efficiently and safely account for decoherence in the fewest switches surface hopping method. Standard decoherence corrections often lead to overly strong coherence suppression. A simple and general solution to this problem is to restrict decoherence to regions of low nonadiabaticity, measured by the dimensionless Massey parameter. The same threshold values are suitable for a variety of systems, regardless of their size and absolute energy scale. When restricted to uncoupled regions, a Gaussian overlap decoherence correction consistently leads to more accurate populations than using no correction. The article also examines under what circumstances it is appropriate to decohere instantaneously. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI State Preparation in the Heisenberg Model through Adiabatic Spiraling
SO QUANTUM
AB An adiabatic state preparation technique, called the adiabatic spiral, is proposed for the Heisenberg model. This technique is suitable for implementation on a number of quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, or superconducting qubits. Classical simulations of small systems suggest that it can be successfully implemented in the near future. A comparison to Trotterized time evolution is performed and it is shown that the adiabatic spiral is able to outperform Trotterized adiabatics.

TI Effect of relativistic motion on superconducting quantum bits under
   decoherence
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In the present manuscript, we consider a quantum system of two super-conducting (SC) qubits that move at relativistic speeds and each qubit coupled to a resonator mode (RM). Here, the relativistic motion of the SC-qubits results from the modulation of the time-varying coupling between the SC-qubits and the resonator for which the system resembles the rotating approximation and anti-Jaynes-Cummings (JC) dynamics. We study the time variation of some interesting current quantumness measures with respect to the time-varying coupling (TVC) considering von Neumann entropy, negativity and Mandel parameter. We illustrate the dynamical behavior of the SC-qubits-RMs entanglement, SC-qubit-SC-qubit entanglement and photon statistics of the RMs at relativistic motion in the absence and presence of dissipative environment.

TI Anneal-path correction in flux qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum annealers require accurate control and optimized operation schemes to reduce noise levels, in order to eventually demonstrate a computational advantage over classical algorithms. We study a high coherence four-junction capacitively shunted flux qubit (CSFQ), using dispersive measurements to extract system parameters and model the device. Josephson junction asymmetry inherent to the device causes a deleterious nonlinear cross-talk when annealing the qubit. We implement a nonlinear annealing path to correct the asymmetry in situ, resulting in a substantial increase in the probability of the qubit being in the correct state given an applied flux bias. We also confirm the multi-level structure of our CSFQ circuit model by annealing it through small spectral gaps and observing quantum signatures of energy level crossings. Our results demonstrate an anneal-path correction scheme designed and implemented to improve control accuracy for high-coherence and high-control quantum annealers, which leads to an enhancement of success probability in annealing protocols.

TI Amplification of quantum transfer and quantum ratchet
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Amplification of quantum transfer and ratchet-type processes are important for quantum technologies. We also expect that quantum ratchet works in quantum photosynthesis, where possible role of quantum effects is now widely discussed but the underlying dynamical processes are still not clearly known. In this work, we study a model of amplification of quantum transfer and making it directed, which we call the quantum ratchet model. The model is based on a special quantum control master equation with dynamics induced by a feedback-type process. The ratchet effect is achieved in the quantum control model with dissipation and sink, where the Hamiltonian depends on vibrations in the energy difference synchronized with transitions between energy levels. A similarity between this model and the model of coherent transport in quantum photosynthesis, where the time dependence of the Hamiltonian arises due to vibrons, is studied. Amplitude and frequency of the oscillating vibron together with the dephasing rate are the parameters of the quantum ratchet which determine its efficiency. We study with which parameters the quantum ratchet minimizes the exction recombination time and show that the experimentally known values of the parameters of the photosynthetic reaction center correspond to values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet which realize a local minimum of the exciton recombination time. We also find other values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet minimizing the exciton recombination time, which correspond to a twice smaller frequency of the vibron compared to that observed in experiments.

TI Scrambling Dynamics and Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators in Quantum
   Many-Body Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB This tutorial article introduces the physics of quantum information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The goals are to understand how to precisely quantify the spreading of quantum information and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce a general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, under certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). The general behavior of the OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which the OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, including exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate the OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experimental schemes for measuring the OTOC in various quantum simulators.

TI Quantum switching between nonclassical correlated single photons and
   two-photon bundles in a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to realize a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model for a single atom inside an optical cavity. It is shown that the interplay of a laser detuning and atom (cavity) pump (driven) field gives rise to the strong single photon blockade, two-photon bundles, and photon-induced tunneling. With the cavity driven field, strong photon blockade occurs in the weak coupling regime, and switching between single photon blockade and photon-induced tunneling at two-photon resonance are achievable via increasing the driven strength. By turning on the atom pump field, quantum switching between two-photon bundles and photon-induced tunneling at four-photon resonance are realized. More interestingly, the high-quality quantum switching between single photon blockade, two-photon bundles, and photon-induced tunneling at three-photon resonance is achieved with combining the atom pump and cavity driven fields simultaneously. In contrast to the standard two-level Jaynes-Cummings model, our scheme with generating a two-photon (multi-photon) Jaynes-Cummings model reveals a prominent strategy to engineer a series of special nonclassical quantum states, which may pave the way for investigating basic quantum devices to implement in quantum information processing and quantum networks.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Coherence dynamics in low-energy nuclear fusion
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Low-energy nuclear fusion reactions have been described using a dynamical coupled-channels density matrix method, based on the theory of open quantum systems. For the first time, this has been combined with an energy projection method, permitting the calculation of energy resolved fusion probabilities. The results are benchmarked against calculations using stationary Schrodinger dynamics and show excellent agreement. Calculations of entropy, energy dissipation and coherence were conducted, demonstrating the capability of this method. It is evident that the presence of quantum decoherence does not affect fusion probability. This framework provides a basis for quantum thermodynamic studies using thermal environments.

TI Ethics Readiness of Technology: The Case for Aligning Ethical Approaches
   with Technological Maturity
SO SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
AB The ethics of emerging technologies faces an anticipation dilemma: engaging too early risks overly speculative concerns, while engaging too late may forfeit the chance to shape a technology's trajectory. Despite various methods to address this challenge, no framework exists to assess their suitability across different stages of technological development. This paper proposes such a framework. I conceptualise two main ethical approaches: outcomes-oriented ethics, which assesses the potential consequences of a technology's materialisation, and meaning-oriented ethics, which examines how (social) meaning is attributed to a technology. I argue that the strengths and limitations of outcomes- and meaning-oriented ethics depend on the uncertainties surrounding a technology, which shift as it matures. To capture this evolution, I introduce the concept of ethics readiness-the readiness of a technology to undergo detailed ethical scrutiny. Building on the widely known Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), I propose Ethics Readiness Levels (ERLs) to illustrate how the suitability of ethical approaches evolves with a technology's development. At lower ERLs, where uncertainties are most pronounced, meaning-oriented ethics proves more effective; while at higher ERLs, as impacts become clearer, outcomes-oriented ethics gains relevance. By linking Ethics Readiness to Technology Readiness, this framework underscores that the appropriateness of ethical approaches evolves alongside technological maturity, ensuring scrutiny remains grounded and relevant. Finally, I demonstrate the practical value of this framework by applying it to quantum technologies, showing how Ethics Readiness can guide effective ethical engagement.

TI Agreement and disagreement in a non-classical world
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The Agreement Theorem Aumann (1976 Ann. Stat. 4, 1236-1239. (doi:10.1214/aos/1176343654)) states that if two Bayesian agents start with a common prior, then they cannot have common knowledge that they hold different posterior probabilities of some underlying event of interest. In short, the two agents cannot 'agree to disagree'. This result applies in the classical domain where classical probability theory applies. But in non-classical domains, such as the quantum world, classical probability theory does not apply. Inspired principally by their use in quantum mechanics, we employ signed probabilities to investigate the epistemics of the non-classical world. We find that here, too, it cannot be common knowledge that two agents assign different probabilities to an event of interest. However, in a non-classical domain, unlike the classical case, it can be common certainty that two agents assign different probabilities to an event of interest. Finally, in a non-classical domain, it cannot be common certainty that two agents assign different probabilities, if communication of their common certainty is possible-even if communication does not take place.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice'.

TI New key management scheme lattice-based for clustered wireless sensor
   networks
SO PLOS ONE
AB Aiming at the quantum algorithm which can solve the problem of large integer decomposition and discrete logarithm in polynomial time, an anti-quantum computing key management scheme for clustered sensor networks is proposed in this paper. The lattice-based cryptosystem is used to achieve the anti-quantum performance of the key management scheme, and the security of the network is further improved through the mutual authentication of sensor network nodes. Due to the limited storage space of sensor nodes, this paper adopts the cluster management of wireless sensor networks, and most sensor nodes only need a small amount of storage space, thus reducing the deployment cost. Cluster management is suitable for medium and large-scale deployment of sensor networks. Because the data traffic is much larger than that of mutual authentication, the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks use symmetric keys to communicate with each other after mutual authentication, which can effectively improve the communication efficiency in the case of frequent data communication. Experiments show that the authentication scheme based on lattice cryptosystem proposed in this paper will not improve with the continuous improvement of the security level, and its authentication scale will maintain a relatively stable state, while the algorithm scheme based on RSA will increase the authentication cost with the continuous improvement of the security level, so the scheme proposed in this paper is more suitable for application in the environment with high security level. This scheme can effectively reduce the cost of mutual authentication of sensor nodes, is conducive to the expansion of the network, and can ensure the security of authentication between sensor nodes even in the post-quantum era.

TI Superconducting NbxTi1-xN
   prepared at high deposition rates with plasma-enhanced atomic layer
   deposition and substrate biasing
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Superconducting films ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers thickness are integral to a wide range of quantum devices. The further development of quantum technologies hinges on material advances. With its atomic-scale growth control, plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is very promising as an enabling technique for the growth of superconducting thin films. This work demonstrates high deposition rates of similar to 30-60 nm/h in PEALD of superconducting NbxTi1-xN films through a supercycle process with accurate composition control. The film thicknesses vary from 4 to 97 nm. All prepared films are face-centered cubic polycrystalline with low similar to 1 at. % O content. Accurate ion-energy control by means of RF substrate biasing yields an improved electrical resistivity for 30 nm Nb0.5Ti0.5N films from 497 +/- 45 mu Omega cm (grounded substrate) down to 184 +/- 19 mu Omega cm (-81 V bias) through its impact on structural properties. Substrate biasing results in an increase in film disorder while enhancing mass density. A 6-7 K critical temperature (T-c) of superconductivity is measured for 30 nm Nb0.5Ti0.5N films, which does not show strong variations with substrate bias. The tunability and high deposition rate of the NbxTi1-xN deposition process puts forward PEALD as a promising technique to tackle material challenges in quantum technology. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Epitaxial growth of gold films on the elemental superconductors V(100),
   Nb(100), and Nb(110)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Quantum technologies require a new generation of superconducting electronic devices and circuitry. However, the superconducting materials used to construct them are restricted to a class of bulk superconductors. Gold films grown in contact with superconducting materials can exhibit superconducting correlations through the proximity effect, with various possible implementations in quantum technology. Here we study the growth of flat Au films on various surfaces of the elemental superconductors vanadium and niobium through a combination of lowtemperature scanning tunneling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In particular, we investigate the growth morphology and composition as a function of temperature and coverage. We find that gold films can grow flat and oxygen-free when annealed to sufficiently high temperatures; however, they are also susceptible to partial intermixing with the substrate elements. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements elucidate the emergence of a proximitized superconducting gap at the gold surface. Additionally, we demonstrate the survival of the magnetic state of FeTPP-Cl molecules on the surface of these gold films, proving that they behave as a good support for probing molecular magnetism. We found that the exchange interaction between the molecular spin and the superconducting condensate can be inferred by the measurement of subgap YuShiva-Rusinov states. Our paper shows that proximitized Au films constitute a promising platform to explore on-superconducting-surface synthesis and the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism in a large spin-orbit coupling environment.

TI Anomalous Loss Reduction Below Two-Level System Saturation in Aluminum
   Superconducting Resonators
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Superconducting resonators are widely used in many applications such as qubit readout for quantum computing, and kinetic inductance detectors. These resonators are susceptible to numerous loss and noise mechanisms, especially the dissipation due to two-level systems (TLS) which become the dominant source of loss in the few-photon and low temperature regime. In this study, capacitively-coupled aluminum half-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators are investigated. Surprisingly, the loss of the resonators is observed to decrease with a lowering temperature at low excitation powers and temperatures below the TLS saturation. This behavior is attributed to the reduction of the TLS resonant response bandwidth with decreasing temperature and power to below the detuning between the TLS and the resonant photon frequency in a discrete ensemble of TLS. When response bandwidths of TLS are smaller than their detunings from the resonance, the resonant response and thus the loss is reduced. At higher excitation powers, the loss follows a logarithmic power dependence, consistent with predictions from the generalized tunneling model (GTM). A model combining the discrete TLS ensemble with the GTM is proposed and matches the temperature and power dependence of the measured internal loss of the resonator with reasonable parameters.
   A capacitively-coupled coplanar waveguide microwave resonator is fabricated and characterized, revealing an unconventional reduction of loss with decreasing temperature below 50 mK at low photon numbers. This anomalous behavior is attributed to the response bandwidth of a single two-level system (TLS) dropping below the TLS-resonance detuning at low temperatures, reducing the intrinsic loss of the resonator.image

TI Reconfigurable photothermal doping filament for selective spin
   manipulation and addressing
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The room temperature manipulation of solid-state spins provides an opportunity to develop quantum applications under ambient conditions. Local electromagnetic fields, that usually produced by current in micro/nanoscale metal wires, have been employed for the coherent driving and addressing of spin qubit. However, the fixed distribution limits the spatial selectivity and efficiency of qubit manipulation, which is of central importance in a scaled-up quantum system. Here, we report a solution by demonstrating a reconfigurable current with arbitrary shape to engineer microwave and DC magnetic field at microscale. A "photothermal doping" method was proposed to optically control local insulator-to-metal transition in vanadium dioxide. by freely changing the filament and electromagnetic field on demand. Our work paves the way for developing quantum devices with large-scale spin qubits.

TI Neutral-atom entangling gate in the ultrastrong coupling regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method to deterministically entangle qubits or ensembles of qubits interacting with a shared bosonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that the resulting gate is a product of two unitaries: one unitary acts only on the quantum state of the qubits and entangles them, while the other acts only on the quantum state of the boson, producing a phase shift. We find that the gate time is inversely proportional to the qubit-boson interaction strength, and by tuning the qubit-boson interaction strength, one can prepare a maximally entangled state or a squeezed state. Applying the quantum gate to multiple qubit ensembles, we show that the quantum gate prepares a Schr & ouml;dinger cat state. We also examine imperfections such as including free evolution of the qubits and show that this produces an effective mixing. Our proposal is feasible for ultrastrong coupling experiments.

TI Multiaxis quantum noise spectroscopy robust to errors in state
   preparation and measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Characterizing temporally correlated noise and "non-Markovian" qubit dynamics is a key prerequisite for achieving noise-tailored error mitigation and optimal device performance. Quantum noise spectroscopy can provide quantitative estimation of the noise spectral features; however, in its current form it is highly vulnerable to implementation nonidealities, notably, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Further to that, existing protocols have been mostly developed for dephasing-dominated noise processes, with competing dephasing and relaxation effects being largely unaccounted for. We introduce quantum noise spectroscopy protocols inspired by spin-locking techniques that enable the characterization of arbitrary temporally correlated multiaxis noise on a qubit with fixed energy splitting, while remaining resilient to realistic static SPAM errors. By validating the performance of our protocol in both numerical simulation and on cloud-based IBM quantum processors, we demonstrate the successful separation and estimation of native noise spectrum components as well as SPAM error rates. We find that SPAM errors can significantly alter or mask important noise features, with spectra overestimated by up to 26.4% in a classical noise regime. Clear signatures of nonclassical noise are manifest in the reconstructed IBM-qubit dephasing spectra, once SPAM-error effects are compensated for. Our work provides a timely tool for benchmarking realistic sources of noise in qubit devices.

TI Entanglement of a bipartite channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The most general quantum object that can be shared between two distant parties is a bipartite channel, as it is the basic element to construct all quantum circuits. In general, bipartite channels can produce entangled states, and can be used to simulate quantum operations that are not local. While much effort over the last two decades has been devoted to the study of entanglement of bipartite states, very little is known about the entanglement of bipartite channels. In this work, we rigorously study the entanglement of bipartite channels as a resource theory of quantum processes. We present an infinite and complete family of measures of dynamical entanglement, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for convertibility under local operations and classical communication. Then we focus on the dynamical resource theory where free operations are positive partial transpose (PPT) superchannels, but we do not assume that they are realized by PPT pre- and postprocessing. This leads to a greater mathematical simplicity that allows us to express all resource protocols and the relevant resource measures in terms of semidefinite programs. Along the way, we generalize the negativity from states to channels, and introduce the max-logarithmic negativity, which has an operational interpretation as the exact asymptotic entanglement cost of a bipartite channel. Finally, we use the non-positive partial transpose (NPT) resource theory to derive a no-go result: it is impossible to distill entanglement out of bipartite PPT channels under any sets of free superchannels that can be used in entanglement theory. This allows us to generalize one of the long-standing open problems in quantum information-the NPT bound entanglement problem-from bipartite states to bipartite channels. It further leads us to the discovery of bound entangled positive operator valued measures.

TI Noise detection with spectator qubits and quantum feature engineering
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Designing optimal control pulses that drive a noisy qubit to a target state is a challenging and crucial task for quantum engineering. In a situation where the properties of the quantum noise affecting the system are dynamic, a periodic characterization procedure is essential to ensure the models are updated. As a result, the operation of the qubit is disrupted frequently. In this paper, we propose a protocol that addresses this challenge by making use of a spectator qubit to monitor the noise in real-time. We develop a machine-learning-based quantum feature engineering approach for designing the protocol. The complexity of the protocol is front-loaded in a characterization phase, which allow real-time execution during the quantum computations. We present the results of numerical simulations that showcase the favorable performance of the protocol.

TI Optimizing quantum control pulses with complex constraints and few
   variables through autodifferentiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Applying optimal control algorithms on realistic quantum systems confronts two key challenges: to efficiently adopt physical constraints in the optimization and to minimize the variables for the convenience of experimental tuneups. To resolve these issues, we propose an algorithm by incorporating multiple constraints into the gradient optimization over piecewise pulse constant values, which are transformed to contained numbers of the finite Fourier basis for bandwidth control. Such complex constraints and variable transformation involved in the optimization introduce extreme difficulty in calculating gradients. We resolve this issue efficiently utilizing autodifferentiation on the machine learning platform TensorFlow. We test our algorithm by finding smooth control pulses to implement single-qubit and two-qubit gates for superconducting transmon qubits with alwayson interaction, which remains a challenge of quantum control in various qubit systems. Our algorithm provides a promising optimal quantum control approach that is friendly to complex and optional physical constraints.

TI Barren Plateaus Preclude Learning Scramblers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Scrambling processes, which rapidly spread entanglement through many-body quantum systems, are difficult to investigate using standard techniques, but are relevant to quantum chaos and thermalization. In this Letter, we ask if quantum machine learning (QML) could be used to investigate such processes. We prove a no-go theorem for learning an unknown scrambling process with QML, showing that it is highly probable for any variational Ansatz to have a barren plateau landscape, i.e., cost gradients that vanish exponentially in the system size. This implies that the required resources scale exponentially even when strategies to avoid such scaling (e.g., from Ansatz-based barren plateaus or no-free-lunch theorems) are employed. Furthermore, we numerically and analytically extend our results to approximate scramblers. Hence, our work places generic limits on the learnability of unitaries when lacking prior information.

While its observation was first reported in disordered cold atom clouds, ordered subwavelength arrays of emitters have emerged as promising platforms to design highly cooperative optical properties based on dipolar interactions. In this work we characterize the eigenmodes of 2D and 3D regular arrays, using a method which can be used for both infinite and very large systems. In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.

AB This work presents a novel realization approach to quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs). The preparation of the required Gibbs states, as well as the evaluation of the loss function's analytic gradient, is based on variational quantum imaginary time evolution, a technique that is typically used for ground-state computation. In contrast to existing methods, this implementation facilitates near-term compatible QBM training with gradients of the actual loss function for arbitrary parameterized Hamiltonians which do not necessarily have to be fully visible but may also include hidden units. The variational Gibbs state approximation is demonstrated with numerical simulations and experiments run on real quantum hardware provided by IBM Quantum. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of this variational QBM approach to generative and discriminative learning tasks using numerical simulation.

TI Demonstration of Maxwell demon-assisted Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
   via superconducting quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The concept of Maxwell demon plays an essential role in connecting thermodynamics and information theory, while entanglement and nonlocality are fundamental features of quantum theory. Given the rapid advancements in the field of quantum information science, there is a growing interest and significance in investigating the connection between Maxwell demon and quantum correlation. The majority of research endeavors thus far have been directed toward the extraction of work from quantum correlation through the utilization of Maxwell demon. Recently, a novel concept called Maxwell demon-assisted Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has been proposed, which suggests that it is possible to simulate quantum correlation by doing work. This seemingly counterintuitive conclusion is attributed to the fact that Alice and Bob need classical communication during EPR steering task, a requirement that does not apply in the Bell test. In this study, we demonstrate Maxwell demonassisted EPR steering with superconducting quantum circuits. By compiling and optimizing a quantum circuit to be implemented on a 2D superconducting chip, we were able to achieve a steering parameter of S-2 = 0.770 +/- 0.005 in the case of two measurement settings, which surpasses the classical bound of 1/root 2 by 12.6 standard deviations. In addition, experimental observations have revealed a linear correlation between the nonlocality demonstrated in EPR steering and the work done by the demon. Considering the errors in practical operation, the experimental results are highly consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings not only suggest the presence of a Maxwell demon loophole in the EPR steering, but also contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay between quantum correlation, information theory, and thermodynamics.

TI Quantum robust control theory for Hamiltonian and control field
   uncertainty*
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum robust control-which can employ fast leading order approximations, slower but more accurate asymptotic methods, or a combination thereof for quantification of robustness-enables control of moments of quantum observables and gates in the presence of Hamiltonian uncertainty or field noise. In this paper, we present a generalized quantum robust control theory that extends the previously described theory of quantum robust control in several important ways. We present robust control theory for control of any moment of arbitrary quantum control objectives, introducing moment-generating functions and transfer functions for quantum robust control that generalize the tools of frequency domain response theory to quantum systems, and extend the Pontryagin maximum principle for quantum control to control optimization in the presence of noise in the manipulated amplitudes or phases used to shape the control field. To provide guidelines as to the types of quantum control systems and control objectives for which asymptotic robustness analysis is important for accuracy, we introduce methods for assessing the Lie algebraic depth of quantum control systems, and illustrate through examples drawn from quantum information processing how such accurate methods for quantification of robustness to noise and uncertainty are more important for control strategies that exploit higher order quantum pathways. In addition, we define the relationship between leading order Taylor expansions and asymptotic estimates for quantum control moments in the presence of Hamiltonian uncertainty and field noise, and apply such leading order approximations to significant pathways analysis and dimensionality reduction of asymptotic quantum robust control calculations, describing numerical methods for implementation of these calculations.

TI Facial emotion recognition using deep quantum and advanced transfer
   learning mechanism
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Introduction Facial expressions have become a common way for interaction among humans. People cannot comprehend and predict the emotions or expressions of individuals through simple vision. Thus, in psychology, detecting facial expressions or emotion analysis demands an assessment and evaluation of decisions for identifying the emotions of a person or any group during communication. With the recent evolution of technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has gained significant usage, wherein DL (Deep Learning) based algorithms are employed for detecting facial expressions.Methods The study proposes a system design that detects facial expressions by extracting relevant features using a Modified ResNet model. The proposed system stacks building-blocks with residual connections and employs an advanced extraction method with quantum computing, which significantly reduces computation time compared to conventional methods. The backbone stem utilizes a quantum convolutional layer comprised of several parameterized quantum-filters. Additionally, the research integrates residual connections in the ResNet-18 model with the Modified up Sampled Bottle Neck Process (MuS-BNP), retaining computational efficacy while benefiting from residual connections.Results The proposed model demonstrates superior performance by overcoming the issue of maximum similarity within varied facial expressions. The system's ability to accurately detect and differentiate between expressions is measured using performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision.Discussion This performance analysis confirms the efficacy of the proposed system, highlighting the advantages of quantum computing in feature extraction and the integration of residual connections. The model achieves quantum superiority, providing faster and more accurate computations compared to existing methodologies. The results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising solution for facial expression recognition tasks, significantly improving both speed and accuracy.

TI Synchronizing Two Superconducting Qubits through a Dissipating Resonator
SO ENTROPY
AB A system consisting of two qubits and a resonator is considered in the presence of different sources of noise, bringing to light the possibility of making the two qubits evolve in a synchronized way. A direct qubit-qubit interaction turns out to be a crucial ingredient, as well as the dissipation processes involving the resonator. The detrimental role of the local dephasing of the qubits is also taken into account.

TI Integrated silicon photonic MEMS
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB Silicon photonics has emerged as a mature technology that is expected to play a key role in critical emerging applications, including very high data rate optical communications, distance sensing for autonomous vehicles, photonic-accelerated computing, and quantum information processing. The success of silicon photonics has been enabled by the unique combination of performance, high yield, and high-volume capacity that can only be achieved by standardizing manufacturing technology. Today, standardized silicon photonics technology platforms implemented by foundries provide access to optimized library components, including low-loss optical routing, fast modulation, continuous tuning, high-speed germanium photodiodes, and high-efficiency optical and electrical interfaces. However, silicon's relatively weak electro-optic effects result in modulators with a significant footprint and thermo-optic tuning devices that require high power consumption, which are substantial impediments for very large-scale integration in silicon photonics. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology can enhance silicon photonics with building blocks that are compact, low-loss, broadband, fast and require very low power consumption. Here, we introduce a silicon photonic MEMS platform consisting of high-performance nano-opto-electromechanical devices fully integrated alongside standard silicon photonics foundry components, with wafer-level sealing for long-term reliability, flip-chip bonding to redistribution interposers, and fibre-array attachment for high port count optical and electrical interfacing. Our experimental demonstration of fundamental silicon photonic MEMS circuit elements, including power couplers, phase shifters and wavelength-division multiplexing devices using standardized technology lifts previous impediments to enable scaling to very large photonic integrated circuits for applications in telecommunications, neuromorphic computing, sensing, programmable photonics, and quantum computing.

TI Engineering a Multilevel Bath for Transmons with Three-Wave Mixing and
   Parametric Drives
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A quantum system with a tunable bath temperature provides an additional degree of freedom for quantum simulators. Such a system can be realized by parametrically modulating the coupling between the system and the bath. Here, by coupling a transmon qubit to a lossy superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) mode, we experimentally create a tunable bath for the qubit mode. The effective temperature of this bath can be precisely controlled, ranging from negative to positive values. We show that the qubit can be thermalized to equilibrium with different population distributions under different parametric pumping conditions. We further extend our method to the third level of the transmon, demonstrating its potential utility beyond the two-level case. Our results provide a useful tool that can be readily integrated with quantum simulators that would benefit from a nontrivial photon population distribution.

TI Chiral Magnetic Josephson Junction as a Base for Low-Noise
   Superconducting Qubits
SO UNIVERSE
AB The lack of space inversion symmetry endows non-centrosymmetric superconducting materials with various interesting parity-breaking phenomena, including the anomalous Josephson effect. Our paper considers a Josephson junction of two non-centrosymmetric superconductors connected by a uniaxial ferromagnet. We show that this "Chiral Magnetic Josephson junction" (CMJ junction) exhibits a direct analog of the Chiral Magnetic Effect, which has already been observed in Weyl and Dirac semimetals. We suggest that the CMJ can serve as an element of a qubit with a Hamiltonian tunable by the ferromagnet's magnetization. The CMJ junction avoids using an offset magnetic flux in inductively shunted qubits, thus enabling a simpler and more robust architecture. Furthermore, when the uniaxial ferromagnet's easy axis is directed across the junction, the resulting "chiral magnetic qubit" provides robust protection from the noise caused by magnetization fluctuations.

TI Energy Efficient Path and Trajectory Optimization of Manipulators With
   Task Deadline Constraints
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Improving the energy efficiency of robots is an important issue for the widespread use of robots in society. However, previous methods plan motions to perform tasks in the shortest possible time in consideration of work efficiency. Other methods change the trajectory for same path to decrease unnecessary acceleration/deceleration. On the other hand, it would be efficient to plan a path and trajectory that proceeds to a goal position after waiting in an energy-efficient posture with low joint torque load. The energy-efficient posture is depending on a robot's structure such as length or mass of each link, joint specifications and a spring of a joint to support weight of a robot. Furthermore, there is a possibility to improve the calculation speed by using quantum computing technology, which can solve combinatorial optimization problems at high speed. In this study, we propose a method for generating low energy-consumption motions for robots using quantum computing technology. The problem is formulated by discretizing the transitions of end-effector positions that represent the robot's motion in terms of workspace and work time, and by using the total torque required for the motion as an objective function and constraints representing the robot's performance and the range and time of the target work. Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the total torque consumption by 10% compared to a simple linear motion, and the computation time could be reduced by 77%. Moreover, a torque consumption reduction of 2% was confirmed compared to the optimized motion without springs.

TI Composable security for multipartite entanglement verification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a composably secure protocol allowing n parties to test an entanglement generation resource controlled by a possibly dishonest party. The test consists only in local quantum operations and authenticated classical communication once a state is shared among them and provides composable security, namely, it can be used as a secure subroutine by n honest parties within larger communication protocols to test if a source is sharing quantum states that are at least E-close to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. This claim follows previous results on multipartite entanglement verification where the security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here we improve the protocol to make it more suitable for practical use in a quantum network and we study its security in the abstract cryptography framework to highlight composability issues and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a top-to-bottom theory that makes explicit any piece of information that each component (party or resource) gets at every time step of the protocol. Moreover, any security proof, which amounts to showing indistinguishability between an ideal resource having the desired security properties (up to local simulation) and the concrete resource representing the protocol, is composable for free in this setting. This allows us to readily compose our basic protocol in order to create a composably secure multiround protocol enabling honest parties to obtain a state close to a GHZ state or an abort signal, even in the presence of a noisy or malicious source. Our protocol can typically be used as a subroutine in a quantum Internet protocol, to securely share a GHZ state within the network before performing a communication or computation protocol.

TI Quantum jamming: Critical properties of a quantum mechanical perceptron
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this Letter, we analyze the quantum dynamics of the perceptron model: a particle is constrained on an N-dimensional sphere, with N -> infinity, and subjected to a set of randomly placed hard-wall potentials. This model has several applications, ranging from learning protocols to the effective description of the dynamics of an ensemble of infinite-dimensional hard spheres in Euclidean space. We find that the jamming transition with quantum dynamics shows critical exponents different from the classical case. We also find that the quantum jamming transition, unlike the typical quantum critical points, is not confined to the zero-temperature axis, and the classical results are recovered only at T = infinity. Our findings have implications for the theory of glasses at ultralow temperatures and for the study of quantum machine-learning algorithms.

SO ENTROPY
AB We report the step-by-step construction of the exact, closed and explicit expression for the evolution operator U(t) of a localized and isolated qubit in an arbitrary time-dependent field, which for concreteness we assume to be a magnetic field. Our approach is based on the existence of two independent dynamical invariants that enter the expression of SU(2) by means of two strictly related time-dependent, real or complex, parameters. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated by exactly solving the quantum dynamics of a qubit subject to a controllable time-dependent field that can be realized in the laboratory. We further discuss possible applications to any SU(2) model, as well as the applicability of our method to realistic physical scenarios with different symmetry properties.

TI Expressive equivalence of classical and quantum restricted Boltzmann
   machines
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The development of generative models for quantum machine learning has faced challenges such as trainability and scalability. A notable example is the quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (QRBM), where non-commuting Hamiltonians make gradient evaluation computationally demanding, even on fault-tolerant devices. In this work, we propose a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (sqRBM), a model designed to overcome difficulties associated with QRBMs. The sqRBM Hamiltonian commutes in the visible subspace while remaining non-commuting in the hidden subspace, enabling us to derive closed-form expressions for output probabilities and gradients. Our analysis shows that, for learning a given distribution, a classical model requires three times more hidden units than an sqRBM. Numerical simulations with up to 100 units validate this prediction. With reduced resource demands, sqRBMs provide a feasible framework for early quantum generative models.

TI Adverse Drug Reaction Detection From Social Media Based on Quantum
   Bi-LSTM With Attention
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Drug combination is very common in the course of disease treatment. However, it inevitably increases the overall risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). It is very important to early and accurately detect and identify the potential ADRs for combined medication safety and public health. Social media is an important pharmacovigilance data source for ADR detection. But the data are complex, mass, clutter, highly sparse, so it is difficult to detect the ADR information from these data. Deep learning stands out in terms of increased accuracy. However, it takes a lot of training time and requires a lot of computing power. Quantum computing has strong parallel computing capability, and requires less computing power. By introducing attention mechanism and quantum computing into Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), a quantum Bi-LSTM with attention (QBi-LSTMA) model is constructed for ADR detection from social media big data. QBi-LSTMA is composed of 6 variable component subcircuits (VQC) stacked. Under the condition that the main topology of Bi-LSTM remains unchanged, the biases of QBi-LSTMA in input gate, forgetting gate, candidate memory unit and output gate are removed to simplify the network structure, and the weight and active value qubits of the model are used to update the network weight. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the SMM4H dataset, comparing with one traditional ADR detection method and three deep learning based ADR detection approaches. The experiment results show that the proposed method has great potential in ADR detection.

TI Deep Learning-Optimized, Fabrication Error-Tolerant Photonic Crystal
   Nanobeam Cavities for Scalable On-Chip Diamond Quantum Systems
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Cavity-enhanced diamond color center qubits can be initialized, manipulated, entangled, and read individually with high fidelity, which makes them ideal for large-scale, modular quantum computers, quantum networks, and distributed quantum sensing systems. However, diamond's unique material properties pose significant challenges in manufacturing nanophotonic devices, leading to fabrication-induced structural imperfections and inaccuracies in defect implantation, which hinder reproducibility, degrade optical properties and compromise the spatial coupling of color centers to small mode-volume cavities. A cavity design tolerant to fabrication imperfections-such as surface roughness, sidewall slant, and nonoptimal emitter positioning-can improve coupling efficiency while simplifying fabrication. To address this challenge, a deep learning-based optimization methodology is developed to enhance the fabrication error tolerance of nanophotonic devices. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to promising designs, such as L2 and fishbone nanobeam cavities, predicting Q-factors at least one-million times faster than traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, enabling efficient optimization of complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces. The CNNs achieve prediction errors below 3.99% and correlation coefficients up to 0.988. Optimized structures demonstrate a 52% reduction in Q-factor degradation, achieving quality factors of 5 x 104 under real-world conditions and a 2-fold expansion in field distribution, enabling efficient coupling of nonoptimally positioned emitters. Compared to previous deep-learning optimization methods, this approach achieves twice the Q-factor performance in the presence of fabrication errors, significantly enhancing device robustness. Hence, this methodology enables scalable, high-yield manufacturing of robust nanophotonic devices, including the cavity-enhanced diamond quantum systems developed in this study.

TI Heteroatom-vacancy centres in molecular nanodiamonds: a computational
   study of organic molecules possessing triplet ground states through
   σ-overlap
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Small molecules possessing a triplet ground state are fundamentally intriguing but also in high demand for applications such as quantum sensing and quantum computing. Such molecules are rare, and most examples involve extended pi-systems. Topology and shape of the spin density will be very different for molecules where the triplet state arises from sigma-overlap. Drawing inspiration from NV- (anionic nitrogen-vacancy) centres in a diamond crystal, which possess triplet ground states that are robust due to the distortion-preventing crystal lattice, we investigate hetero-atom substituted diamondoids (molecular nanodiamonds) as molecular mimics for NV- centres. It is found that even in these small systems, distortions that stabilize singlet states are energetically costly, and the triplet states are more stable than the singlets. The stabilization of the triplet over the singlet is 13, 16, and 18 kcal mol-1, in anionic C3v-C33H36N- and in the charge-neutral molecules C3v-C33H36O and C3v-C33H36S, respectively, using CAM-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/Def2-QZVPP. Comparable numbers are obtained with other density functional theory (DFT) methods, including double-hybrids. Wavefunction-based approaches on the other hand disagree in their predictions: While the MP2 method applied with the DLPNO approximation predicts a preference for the singlet, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations qualitatively agree with DFT in their prediction of a triplet ground state, although by a small margin, for C3v-C33H36N- and C3v-C33H36O, but not for C3v-C33H36S. Weighing the evidence, we conclude, with reasonable confidence for C3v-C33H36N- and C3v-C33H36O and lesser confidence for C3v-C33H36S, that the ground state for the molecular nanodiamonds studied is a triplet state.
   Can doped nanodiamonds with a central vacancy be small-molecule-sized and still retain a desirable triplet ground state? Computational results are encouraging for doped and hollow decamantane derivatives of C3v symmetry.

TI Uniqueness of Noncontextual Models for Stabilizer Subtheories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We give a complete characterization of the (non)classicality of all stabilizer subtheories. First, we prove that there is a unique nonnegative and diagram-preserving quasiprobability representation of the stabilizer subtheory in all odd dimensions, namely Gross's discrete Wigner function. This representation is equivalent to Spekkens' epistemically restricted toy theory, which is consequently singled out as the unique noncontextual ontological model for the stabilizer subtheory. Strikingly, the principle of noncontextuality is powerful enough (at least in this setting) to single out one particular classical realist interpretation. Our result explains the practical utility of Gross's representation by showing that (in the setting of the stabilizer subtheory) negativity in this particular representation implies generalized contextuality. Since negativity of this particular representation is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation in the state injection model, it follows that generalized contextuality is also a necessary resource for universal quantum computation in this model. In all even dimensions, we prove that there does not exist any nonnegative and diagram-preserving quasiprobability representation of the stabilizer subtheory, and, hence, that the stabilizer subtheory is contextual in all even dimensions.

The conjecture pertains to the idea that Einstein-Rosen (ER) spacetime bridges and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quantum entanglement may be considered as dually equivalent. Since ER bridges refer to the connectivity between black holes, the "ER = EPR" conjecture implies that black holes connected by ER bridges are entangled, and conversely, that entangled black holes are connected by ER bridges. However, the instance of the maximally entangled tripartite (GHZ) quantum state points to the necessity of devising a model of non-classical Planck scale ER bridges going beyond the standard description of these bridges in spacetime. Based on the topological structure of the maximally entangled GHZ state, we propose that a universal topological link, called the Borromean rings, furnishes a particular linking structure that is able to unravel the equavalence between entanglement and wormholes, and thus, to address the validity of the "ER = EPR" conjecture beyond the initial context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. As a consequence, we propose the explicit construction of distinguishable extensions of the smooth classical spacetime manifold taking place in the transition to the quantum gravity regime according to a naturally induced physical criterion of gravitational generic properties following from this intrinsic topological qualification of the "ER = EPR" conjecture.

TI Analytical evidence of nonlinearity in qubits and continuous-variable
   quantum reservoir computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB The natural dynamics of complex networks can be harnessed for information processing purposes. A paradigmatic example are artificial neural networks used for machine learning. In this context, quantum reservoir computing (QRC) constitutes a natural extension of the use of classical recurrent neural networks using quantum resources for temporal information processing. Here, we explore the fundamental properties of QRC systems based on qubits and continuous variables. We provide analytical results that illustrate how nonlinearity enters the input-output map in these QRC implementations. We find that the input encoding through state initialization can serve to control the type of nonlinearity as well as the dependence on the history of the input sequences to be processed.

TI A failure in decryption process for bivariate polynomial reconstruction
   problem cryptosystem
SO HELIYON
AB In 1999, the Polynomial Reconstruction Problem (PRP) was put forward as a new hard mathematics problem. A univariate PRP scheme by Augot and Finiasz was introduced at Eurocrypt in 2003, and this cryptosystem was fully cryptanalyzed in 2004. In 2013, a bivariate PRP cryptosystem was developed, which is a modified version of Augot and Finiasz's original work. This study describes a decryption failure that can occur in both cryptosystems. We demonstrate that when the error has a weight greater than the number of monomials in a secret polynomial, p, decryption failure can occur. The result of this study also determines the upper bound that should be applied to avoid decryption failure.

TI Nitrogen-Related High-Spin Vacancy Defects in Bulk (SiC) and 2D (hBN)
   Crystals: Comparative Magnetic Resonance (EPR and ENDOR) Study
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The distinct spin, optical, and coherence characteristics of solid-state spin defects in semiconductors have positioned them as potential qubits for quantum technologies. Both bulk and two-dimensional materials, with varying structural properties, can serve as crystalline hosts for color centers. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of the spin-optical, electron-nuclear, and relaxation properties of nitrogen-bound vacancy defects using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques. We examine key parameters of the spin Hamiltonian for the nitrogen vacancy (NV-) center in 4H-SiC: D = 1.3 GHz, Azz = 1.1 MHz, and CQ = 2.53 MHz, as well as for the boron vacancy (VB-) in hBN: D = 3.6 GHz, Azz = 85 MHz, and CQ = 2.11 MHz, and their dependence on the material matrix. The spin-spin relaxation times T2 (NV- center: 50 mu s and VB-: 15 mu s) are influenced by the local nuclear environment and spin diffusion while Rabi oscillation damping times depend on crystal size and the spatial distribution of microwave excitation. The ENDOR absorption width varies significantly among color centers due to differences in crystal structures. These findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate material platform for developing quantum registers based on high-spin color centers in quantum information systems.

TI Electro-optic transduction in silicon via gigahertz-frequency
   nanomechanics
SO OPTICA
AB Interfacing electronics with optical fiber networks is key to the long-distance transfer of classical and quantum information. Piezo-optomechanical transducers enable such interfaces by using gigahertz-frequency acoustic vibrations as mediators for converting microwave photons to optical photons via the combination of optomechanical and piezoelectric interactions. However, despite successful demonstrations, efficient quantum transduction remains out of reach due to the challenges associated with hybrid material integration and increased loss from piezoelectric materials when operating in the quantum regime. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach in which we actuate 5-GHz phonons in a conventional silicon-on-insulator platform. In our experiment, microwave photons resonantly drive a phononic crystal oscillator via the electrostatic force realized in a charge-biased narrow-gap capacitor. The mechanical vibrations are subsequently transferred via a phonon waveguide to an optomechanical cavity, where they transform into optical photons in the sideband of a pump laser field. Operating at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, we measure a microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency of 1.72 +/- 0.14 +/- 10(-7) in a 3.3 MHz bandwidth. Our results mark a stepping stone towards quantum transduction with integrated devices made from crystalline silicon, which promise efficient high-bandwidth operation and integration with superconducting qubits. Additionally, the lack of need for piezoelectricity or other intrinsic nonlinearities makes our approach applicable to a wide range of materials for potential applications beyond quantum technologies.

TI Assessment of weak-coupling approximations on a driven two-level system
   under dissipation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The standard weak-coupling approximations associated to open quantum systems have been extensively used in the description of a two-level quantum system, qubit, subjected to relatively weak dissipation compared with the qubit frequency. However, recent progress in the experimental implementations of controlled quantum systems with increased levels of on-demand engineered dissipation has motivated precision studies in parameter regimes that question the validity of the approximations, especially in the presence of time-dependent drive fields. In this paper, we address the precision of weak-coupling approximations by studying a driven qubit through the numerically exact and non-perturbative method known as the stochastic Liouville-von Neumann equation with dissipation. By considering weak drive fields and a cold Ohmic environment with a high cutoff frequency, we use the Markovian Lindblad master equation as a point of comparison for the SLED method and study the influence of the bath-induced energy shift on the qubit dynamics. We also propose a metric that may be used in experiments to map the regime of validity of the Lindblad equation in predicting the steady state of the driven qubit. In addition, we study signatures of the well-known Mollow triplet and observe its meltdown owing to dissipation in an experimentally feasible parameter regime of circuit electrodynamics. Besides shedding light on the practical limitations of the Lindblad equation, we expect our results to inspire future experimental research on engineered open quantum systems, the accurate modeling of which may benefit from non-perturbative methods.

TI Dynamics of measurement-induced state transitions in superconducting
   qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We have investigated temporal fluctuation of superconducting qubits via the time-resolved measurement for an IBM Quantum system. We found that the qubit error rate abruptly changes during specific time intervals. Each high error state persists for several tens of seconds and exhibits an on-off behavior. The observed temporal instability can be attributed to qubit transitions induced by a measurement stimulus. Resonant transition between fluctuating dressed states of the qubits coupled with high-frequency resonators can be responsible for the error-rate change.

TI Second quantum revolution: The progressive design of an approach to
   value its cultural and conceptual scope
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Investigating and Improving Quantum Education through Research.] Quantum information science and technology is a growing field. Programs like Quantum Flagship in the EU and the National Quantum Initiative Act in the U.S. have called for science education and science education research to provide efforts and competencies for preparing the workforce and the next generations of quantum experts and promoting quantum literacy. The second quantum revolution is similar to the Newtonian one in that it has the potential to question worldviews in our society. We present our approach to design a teaching module for secondary school students that aims to value the cultural scope of the second quantum revolution. The model of educational reconstruction was used as a theoretical reference to reconstruct content for educational and cultural purposes. Renn's elaborated historical analysis of knowledge evolution provided the criteria for characterizing the cultural scope in content reconstruction. The module has been iteratively refined following a design-based approach involving back-and-forth dynamics between educational hypotheses and empirical results. The process started in 2018, and the module was refined through 5 rounds of implementation in extracurricular courses with secondary school students (for almost 130 students). The main finding underscores the importance of finding a balance between a process of simplification or elementarization of the content and its enrichment to foster learners to develop a deep understanding of quantum technologies, their conceptual intricacies, and their cultural scope.

TI Chiral Light Emission from a Hybrid Magnetic Molecule-Monolayer
   Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructure
SO ACS NANO
AB Hybrid layered materials assembled from atomically thin crystals and small molecules bring great promises in pushing the current information and quantum technologies beyond the frontiers. We demonstrate here a class of layered valley-spin hybrid (VSH) materials composed of a monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor and double-decker single molecule magnets (SMMs). We have materialized a VSH prototype by thermal evaporation of terbium bis-phthalocyanine onto a MoS2 monolayer and revealed its composition and stability by both microscopic and spectroscopic probes. The interaction of the VSH components gives rise to the intersystem crossing of the photogenerated carriers and moderate p-doping of the MoS2 monolayer, as corroborated by the density functional theory calculations. We further explored the valley contrast by helicity-resolved photoluminescence (PL) microspectroscopy carried out down to liquid helium temperatures and in the presence of the external magnetic field. The most striking feature of the VSH is the enhanced A exciton-related valley emission observed at the out-of-resonance condition at room temperature, which we elucidated by the proposed nonradiative energy drain transfer mechanism. Our study thus demonstrates the experimental feasibility and great promises of the ultrathin VSH materials with chiral light emission, operable by physical fields for emerging opto-spintronic, valleytronic, and quantum information concepts.

TI The contribution of coherence field theory to a model of consciousness:
   electric currents, EM fields, and EM radiation in the brain
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB A paradigm in neuroscience is developing which views resonance as the phenomenon responsible for consciousness. Much progress is being made in the investigation of how resonance as oscillating flows within the brain's electric field might result in production of mind from matter. But it's mostly unknown how vibrations among features of matter such as nanoscale atomic structures and photonic waves may participate in forming the basic substance of first-person consciousness, meaning percepts such as colors, textures, sounds, thoughts, feelings et cetera. Initial evidence at the leading edge of quantum biology suggests that light and atoms combine to form synchronously resonating structures of contiguous energy which I have termed coherence fields. My hypothesis is that coherence fields as atomic nodes within expanses of integrating photonic waves are the fundamental unit of first-person percepts insofar as they arise from electromagnetic matter. A concept of quantum coherence is formulated based on a new phenomenology of matter's nanoscale properties, and this is shown to tie what we have thus far discovered of neural anatomy into a comprehensive model of how electrical impulses travel through neurons as electron currents driven by coherence at the quantum scale. Transmembrane electric fields generated by ionic currents, synaptic phase regulation, and perhaps further mechanisms have been hypothesized as responsible for local field potentials (LFP) oscillations. Some insights into how emergent, macroscopic waves in the brain's electric field may reciprocally impact LFP propagation to control arousal, attention, and volition are briefly discussed. Activation of neural tissue is closely linked to temperature variation, and it is hypothesized that this is not merely a waste byproduct but constitutes a signature of coherence field modulation, with photonic waves of a primarily infrared spectral range functioning as an interstitial medium of the basic percept field. A variety of possible routes to coherence field modulation are outlined that derive from the mechanisms of electric currents, EM fields, EM radiation, and entanglement. If future experimental designs continue to validate coherence field theory, this could set science on course to resolve the mind/body problem.

TI Nitrogen Substitutions Aggregation and Clustering in Diamonds as
   Revealed by High-Field Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Diamonds have been shown to be an excellent platform for quantum computing and quantum sensing applications. These applications are enabled by the presence of defects in the lattice, which are also known as color centers. The most common nitrogen-based defect in synthetic diamonds is the paramagnetic nitrogen substitution (P1) center. While the majority of quantum applications rely on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, the properties of the latter are heavily influenced by the presence and the spatial distribution of the P1 centers. Hence, understanding the spatial distribution and mutual interactions of P1 centers is crucial for the successful development of diamond-based quantum devices. Unlike NV centers, P1 centers do not have a spin-dependent optical signature, and their spin-related properties, therefore, have to be detected and characterized using magnetic resonance methods. We show that using high-field (6.9 and 13.8 T) pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments, we can distinguish and quantify three distinct populations of P1 centers: isolated P1 centers, weakly interacting ones, and exchange-coupled ones that are clustered together. While such clustering was suggested before, these clusters were never detected directly and unambiguously. Moreover, by using electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) pump-probe experiments, we demonstrate that the latter clustered population does not exist in isolation but coexists with the more weakly interacting P1 centers throughout the diamond lattice. Its presence thus strongly affects the quantum properties of the diamond. We also show that the existence of this population can explain recent hyperpolarization results in type Ib high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds. We propose a combination of high-field pulsed EPR, ELDOR, and DNP as a tool for probing the aggregation state and interactions among different populations of nitrogen substitution centers.

TI Atom-surface physics: A review
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB An atom in front of a surface is one of the simplest and fundamental problem in physics. Yet, it allows testing quantum electrodynamics, while providing potential platforms and interfaces for quantum technologies. Despite its simplicity, combined with strong scientific and technological interests, atom-surface physics, at its fundamental level, remains largely unexplored mainly because of challenges associated with precise control of the atom-surface distance. Nevertheless, substantial breakthroughs have been made over the last two decades. With the development of cold and quantum atomic gases, one has gained further control on atom-surface position, naturally leading to improved precision in the Casimir-Polder interaction measurement. Advances have also been reported in finding experimental knobs to tune and even reverse the Casimir-Polder interaction strength. So far, this has only been achieved for atoms in short-lived excited states, however, the rapid progresses in material sciences, e.g., metamaterials and topological materials has inspired new ideas for controlling the atom-surface interaction in long-lived states. In addition, combining nano-photonic and atom-surface physics is now envisioned for applications in quantum information processing. The first purpose of this Review is to give a general overview on the latest experimental developments in atom-surface physics. The second main objective is to sketch a vision of the future of the field, mainly inspired by the abundant theoretical works and proposals available now in the literature.

TI Quantum remote sensing under the effect of dephasing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum remote sensing (QRS) is a scheme to add security about the measurement results of a qubit-based sensor. A client delegates a measurement task to a remote server that has a quantum sensor, and eavesdropper (Eve) steals every classical information stored in the server side. By using quantum properties, the QRS provides an asymmetricity about the information gain where the client gets more information about the sensing results than Eve. However, quantum states are fragile against decoherence, and so it is not clear whether such a QRS is practically useful under the effect of realistic noise. Here, we investigate the performance of the QRS with dephasing during the interaction with the target fields. In the QRS, the client and server need to share a Bell pair, and an imperfection of the Bell pair leads to a state preparation error in a systematic way on the server side for the sensing. We consider the effect of both dephasing and state preparation error. The uncertainty of the client side decreases with the square root of the repetition number M for small M, which is the same scaling as the standard quantum metrology. On the other hand, for large M, the state preparation error becomes as relevant as the dephasing, and the uncertainty decreases logarithmically with M. We compare the information gain between the client and Eve. This leads us to obtain the conditions for the asymmetric gain to be maintained even under the effect of dephasing. Then, we can quantify how much information the client can gain while preserving the information asymmetricity.

TI Heat transport in a two-level system driven by a time-dependent
   temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The field of thermotronics aims to develop thermal circuits that operate with temperature biases and heat currents just as how electronic circuits are based on voltages and electric currents. Here, we investigate a thermal half-wave rectifier based on a quantum two-level system (a qubit) that is driven by a periodically modulated temperature difference across it. To this end we present a nonequilibrium Green's function technique, which we extend to the time domain to account for the time-dependent temperature in one of two thermal reservoirs connected to the qubit. We find that the qubit acts a thermal diode in parallel with a thermal capacitor, whose capacitance is controlled by the coupling to the reservoirs. These findings are important for the efforts to design nonlinear thermal components such as heat rectifiers and multipliers that operate with more than one diode.

TI Microheater Controlled Crystal Phase Engineering of Nanowires Using In
   Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Crystal Phase Quantum Dots (CPQDs) offer promising properties for quantum communication. How CPQDs can be formed in Au-catalyzed GaAs nanowires using different precursor flows and temperatures by in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) experiments is studied. A III-V gas supply system controls the precursor flow and custom-built micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) chips with monocrystalline Si-cantilevers are used for temperature control, forming a micrometer-scale metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (mu MOVPE) system. The preferentially formed crystal phases are mapped at different precursor flows and temperatures to determine optimal growth parameters for either crystal phase. To control the position and length of CPQDs, the time scale for crystal phase change is investigated. The micrometer size of the cantilevers allows temperature shifts of more than 100 degrees C within 0.1 s at the nanowire growth temperature, which can be much faster than the growth time for a single lattice layer. For controlling the crystal phase, the temperature change is found to be superior to precursor flow, which takes tens of seconds for the crystal phase formation to react. This mu MOVPE approach may ultimately provide faster temperature control than bulk MOVPE systems and hence enable engineering sequences of CPQDs with quantum dot lengths and positions defined with atomic precision.
   Crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs) in GaAs nanowires are precisely controlled using resistively heated cantilever chips in an environmental transmission electron microscope. This work demonstrates that temperature adjustments, rather than precursor flow, dictate the crystal phase better in opposition to other studies, enabling rapid and precise CPQD engineering with atomic precision in position and length offering potential for advanced quantum technologies. image

TI Correlation redistribution by causal horizons
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The Minkowski vacuum 10 > M, which for an inertial observer is devoid of particles, is perceived as a thermal bath by Rindler observers living in a single Rindler wedge (Unruh in Phys Rev D 14:870, 1976) as a result of the discrepancy in the definition of positive frequency between the two classes of observers and a strong entanglement between degrees of freedom in the left and right Rindler wedges. We revisit the problem of quantification of the correlations in a two-mode state of a free neutral scalar field which is observed by an inertial observer Alice and left/right Rindler observers Rob/AntiRob, a problem that pertains to the field of relativistic quantum information and has been previously studied in Martin-Martinez et al. (Phys Rev D 82:064006, 2010) and Datta (Phys Rev A 80:052304, 2009). We focus on the analysis of informational quantities like the locally accessible and locally inaccessible information (Koashi and Winter in Phys Rev A 69:022309, 2004; Fanchini et al. in Phys Rev A 84:012313, 2011; Fanchini et al. in New J Phys 14:013027, 2012) and a closely associated entanglement measure, the entanglement of formation. We conclude that, with respect to the correlation structure probed by inertial observers alone, the introduction of a Rindler observer gives rise to a correlation redistribution which can be quantified by the entanglement of formation. Given the informational meaning of the derived correlations, we discuss on the capacity of a quantum channel to communicate classical information between accelerated parties.

TI Telecom Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Nanoconfined Self-Assembled
   Silicon-Based Color Centers
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Silicon color centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as potential building blocks for light emitters in Si photonics, quantum emitters with spin storage capabilities, and Si-based quantum repeaters. We have recently developed a noninvasive method to engineer carbon-related SiCCs confined to ultrathin nanolayers within a pristine crystalline environment, which is of utmost importance for the photostability of SiCCs. Here, we demonstrate embedding these C-doping-based SiCCs into the only 9 nm wide intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode using the epitaxial self-assembly of color centers. We report electrically pumped light emission with an exponential increase in the intensity as a function of the driving current until saturation. We associate this property with the shift of quasi-Fermi-level position upon electrical driving, which simultaneously improves the spectral homogeneity of the engineered SiCCs. Despite the low employed growth temperatures, our study demonstrates the electrical control and driving of near-infrared emitters in high-quality silicon diodes, an essential milestone for advancing classical and quantum optoelectronics.

TI Entanglement transfer from quantum matter to classical geometry in an
   emergent holographic dual description of a scalar field theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Applying recursive renormalization group transformations to a scalar field theory, we obtain an effective quantum gravity theory with an emergent extra dimension, described by a dual holographic Einstein-Klein-Gordon type action. Here, the dynamics of both the dual order-parameter field and the metric tensor field originate from densitydensity and energy-momentum tensor-tensor effective interactions, respectively, in the recursive renormalization group transformation, performed approximately in the Gaussian level. This linear approximation in the recursive renormalization group transformation for the gravity sector gives rise to a linearized quantum Einstein-scalar theory along the z-directional emergent space. In the large N limit, where N is the flavor number of the original scalar fields, quantum fluctuations of both dynamical metric and dual scalar fields are suppressed, leading to a classical field theory of the Einstein-scalar type in (D+1)-spacetime dimensions. We show that this emergent background gravity describes the renormalization group flows of coupling functions in the UV quantum field theory through the extra dimension. More precisely, the IR boundary conditions of the gravity equations correspond to the renormalization group beta-functions of the quantum field theory, where the infinitesimal distance in the extra-dimensional space is identified with an energy scale for the renormalization group transformation. Finally, we also show that this dual holographic formulation describes quantum entanglement in a geometrical way, encoding the transfer of quantum entanglement from quantum matter to classical gravity in the large N limit. We claim that this entanglement transfer serves as a microscopic foundation for the emergent holographic duality description.

TI A Portable Fluorometer Detects Significantly Elevated Cell-Free DNA in
   Tracheal Wash and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Horses with Severe
   Asthma
SO ANIMALS
AB Severe equine asthma (sEA) is characterized by increased lower airway neutrophils that contribute to dysregulated inflammation through the release of cytokines, reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are composed of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) intercalated with enzymatic proteins and are known to be increased in the lower airway of asthmatic horses. The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1. Determine if cfDNA can be accurately measured in equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and tracheal wash (TW) with a Qubit 4 fluorometer. 2. Determine whether Qubit-measured cfDNA in BALF or TW is significantly different in horses with sEA, mild/moderate neutrophilic equine asthma, mastocytic equine asthma and healthy horses. A total of sixty-three horses received a physical examination and clinical score followed by a BAL +/- TW. Cell-free DNA was measured using three methods in unfiltered BAL and TW as well as BAL and TW supernatant. Cell-free DNA concentrations were highly correlated between the Qubit 4 fluorometer and NanoDrop spectrophotometer as well as between the Qubit 4 fluorometer and SYTOX green plate-based assay. Cell-free DNA concentrations were highly correlated between unfiltered TW and TW supernatant as well as between unfiltered BALF and BAL supernatant. Cell-free DNA concentrations in BAL and TW supernatant were significantly higher in horses with sEA compared to healthy horses or horses with mild/moderate equine asthma. Cell-free DNA is a biomarker of sEA that can be easily measured in the field with the small portable Qubit 4 fluorometer in BAL and TW fluid. These findings support further investigation of NETs as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for severe equine asthma.

TI Quantum-like model for unconscious-conscious interaction and emotional
   coloring of perceptions and other conscious experiences
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Quantum measurement theory is applied to quantum-like modeling of coherent generation of perceptions and emotions and generally for emotional coloring of conscious experiences. In quantum theory, a system should be separated from an observer. The brain performs self-measurements. To model them, we split the brain into two subsystems, unconsciousness and consciousness. They correspond to a system and an observer. The states of perceptions and emotions are described through the tensor product decomposition of the unconscious state space; similarly, there are two classes of observables, for conscious experiencing of perceptions and emotions, respectively. Emotional coloring is coupled to quantum contextuality: emotional observables determine contexts. Such contextualization reduces degeneration of unconscious states. The quantum-like approach should be distinguished from consideration of the genuine quantum physical processes in the brain (cf. Penrose and Hameroff). In our approach the brain is a macroscopic system which information processing can be described by the formalism of quantum theory. The paper is concluded with experimental test of contextual emotional coloring of conscious experiences based on Bell type inequalities which are treated in the contextual framework.

TI DECODABLE QUANTUM LDPC CODES BEYOND THE \surdn DISTANCE BARRIER USING
   HIGH-DIMENSIONAL EXPANDERS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB Constructing quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with a minimum distance that grows faster than a square root of the length has been a major challenge of the field. With this challenge in mind, we investigate constructions that come from high-dimensional expanders, in particular Ramanujan complexes. These naturally give rise to very unbalanced quantum error correcting codes that have a large X-distance but a much smaller Z-distance. However, together with a classical expander LDPC code and a tensoring method that generalizes a construction of Hastings and also the Tillich--Ze'\mor construction of quantum codes, we obtain quantum LDPC codes whose minimum distance exceeds the square root of the code length and whose dimension comes close to a square root of the code length. When the ingredient is a 2-dimensional Ramanujan complex, or the 2-skeleton of a 3-dimensional Ramanujan complex, we obtain a quantum LDPC code of minimum distance n 1 / 2 log1/2 n. We then exploit the expansion properties of the complex to devise the first polynomial-time algorithm that decodes above the square root barrier for quantum LDPC codes. Using a 3-dimensional Ramanujan complex, we also obtain an overall quantum code of minimum distance n 1 / 2 log n, which sets a new record for quantum LDPC codes.

TI Fast classical simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics by simultaneous
   diagonalization using Clifford transformation with parallel computation
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Simulating quantum many-body dynamics is important both for fundamental understanding of physics and practical applications for quantum information processing. Therefore, classical simulation methods have been developed so far. Specifically, the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition can analyze a highly complex quantum dynamics, if the number of qubits is sufficiently small so that main memory can store the state vector. However, simulation of quantum dynamics via Trotter-Suzuki decomposition requires a huge number of steps, each of which accesses the state vector, and hence the simulation time becomes impractically long. To settle this issue, we propose a technique to accelerate simulation of quantum dynamics via simultaneous diagonalization of mutually commuting Pauli groups, which is also attracting a lot of attention to reduce the measurement overheads in quantum algorithms. We group the Hamiltonian into mutually commuting Pauli strings, and each of them is diagonalized in the computational basis via a Clifford transformation. Since diagonal operators are applied on the state vector simultaneously with minimum memory access, this method successfully uses performance of highly parallel processors such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU). Compared to both CPU and GPU implementations using fast quantum circuit simulator "qulacs," the numerical experiments have shown that our method provides a few tens of times acceleration.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Bases selection with pseudo-random functions in BB84 scheme
SO HELIYON
AB Because the spectrum of services available in modern telecommunication networks is constantly expanding, security has become increasingly important. Simultaneously, in an era of constant progress in mathematics and computing, the security of existing cryptographic solutions becomes questionable. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising secret key agreement primitive that enables long-awaited practical Information-Theoretical Secure (ITS) communications. The key generation rate, however, is one of the limitations of its widespread application to secure high throughput data flows. This paper addresses the aforementioned limitation by employing perfectly correlated bases selection defined by the output of Pseudo-Random Functions based on the keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code construction. In theory, the proposed variant of the BB84 scheme is ITS, reduces memory requirements, and reduces communication overhead during the post-processing stage. It can benefit QKD networks as a service by increasing capacity and accommodating users with varying security needs.

AB Integrated acoustic circuits leverage guided acoustic waves for applications ranging from radio frequency filters to quantum state transfer, biochemical sensing, and nanomechanical computing. In many applications, it is desirable to have a method for unidirectional acoustic wave emission. In this work, we demonstrate directional emission in an integrated single-mode, on-chip membrane waveguide, demonstrating over 99.9% directional suppression and reconfigurable directionality. This avoids both loss and unwanted crosstalk, allowing the creation of more complex and compact phononic circuits. (c) 2024 Author(s).

AB A colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay detects changes in pH during amplification based on color changes at a constant temperature. Currently, various studies have focused on developing and assessing molecular point-of-care testing instruments. In this study, we evaluated amplified DNA concentrations measured using the colorimetric LAMP assay of the 1POT (TM) Professional device (1drop Inc, Korea). Results of the 1POT analysis of clinical samples were compared with measurements obtained from the Qubit (TM) 4 and NanoDrop (TM) 2000 devices (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). These results showed a correlation of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98) between 1POT and the Qubit and NanoDrop. 1POT can measure amplified DNA accurately and is suitable for on-site molecular diagnostics.

We then extend this system into the deep non-Markovian regime and demonstrate the profound role that retardation plays on the dressed resonances, allowing one to significantly improve the polariton lifetimes (by several orders of magnitude), tune the resonances, as well as realize Fano-like resonances and simultaneous coupling to multiple cavity modes. Exact Green's function solutions are presented for the classical spectral resonances, and the full quantum dynamics are simulated using matrix product states, where we demonstrate additional control of the cavity-QED system using chiral probe qubits. We show example qubit dynamics with both one and two quantum excitations.

TI Testing Bell Inequalities at the LHC with Top-Quark Pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Correlations between the spins of top-quark pairs produced at a collider can be used to probe quantum entanglement at energies never explored so far. We show how the measurement of a single observable can provide a test of the violation of a Bell inequality at the 98% C.L. with the statistical uncertainty of the data already collected at the Large Hadron Collider, and at the 99.99% C.L. with the higher luminosity of the next run. Detector acceptance, efficiency, and migration effects are taken into account. The test relies on the spin correlations alone and does not require the determination of probabilities-in contrast to all other tests of Bell inequalities.

TI Secret Key Generation Over Multi-Mode Fiber: Channel Measurements, Key
   Rate Analysis, and System Implementation
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Secret keys are critical for many security mechanisms including secure data transmission. An efficient secret key generation and sharing scheme enhances the secure transmission rate. Meanwhile, secret keys are scarce resources for classical encryption schemes like the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem and its post-quantum security counterparts in quantum applications. Therefore, harnessing every available random source for secret key extraction is crucial for maximizing the key rate across a range of potential applications. In this paper, we investigate the achievable rate of the secret key generation (SKG)-channel-model based on an actual measured multi-mode fiber (MMF) channel, where there is an additional public discussion channel between the legitimate parties, which the adversary can perfectly overhear. In particular, we first measure the MMF transmission matrix using digital holography, then design power allocation schemes among the modes. Our schemes can achieve a positive secret key rate at 51.3 bit per channel use, under a mode-dependent loss of 1 dB and a transmit power of 20 dBm. In addition, we implement an SKG system via MMF by explicitly designing the wiretap codes and discussion protocol. More specifically, we design the hash function and point-to-point channel encoder/decoder for each mode in the MMF based on Hayashi's wiretap coding. The designed system can achieve a secret key rate-leakage trade-off at R-SK = 23.6 bits per channel use and an average leakage rate at 4.22 10(-3) bits per channel use per mode, at the transmit power PT at 50 dBm and mode-dependent loss at 1 dB with the error probability constraint at Bob as 10(-5). This demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of generating SKG via MMF, aligning with the common approaches of post-quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution in addressing the challenges posed by emerging quantum computers.

TI On the Security and Efficiency of TLS 1.3 Handshake with Hybrid Key
   Exchange from CPA-Secure KEMs
SO ENTROPY
AB TLS 1.3 is a crucial protocol for securing modern internet communications. To facilitate a smooth transition to post-quantum security, hybrid key exchange, which combines classical key exchange algorithms with post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), is proposed to enhance the security of the current TLS 1.3 handshake. However, existing drafts and implementations of hybrid key exchange for TLS 1.3 primarily rely on CCA-secure KEMs (i.e., secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks) based on the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform. The re-encryption step in their decapsulation algorithms not only introduces additional performance overhead but also raises the risk of side-channel attacks. Although Huguenin-Dumittan and Vaudenay (Eurocrypt 2022) and Zhou et al. (Asiacrypt 2024) demonstrated that the weaker CPA-secure KEMs (i.e., secure against chosen-plaintext attacks) suffice for constructing a secure TLS 1.3 handshake, their analyses were limited to single-KEM settings and did not consider the hybrid key exchange scenario. This work challenges the necessity of CCA security by proving that CPA-secure KEMs are sufficient for the TLS 1.3 handshake even in the hybrid key exchange setting. We provide the first formal security proofs for this claim, covering both the classical random oracle model (ROM) and the quantum random oracle model (QROM), thereby ensuring security against quantum adversaries. To validate the practical benefits, we conduct an extensive performance evaluation based on the latest OpenSSL implementation. Our results show that using CPA-secure KEMs yields up to 44.8% performance improvement at the key exchange layer and up to approximately 9% acceleration for the full TLS 1.3 handshake. Beyond performance gains, this approach reduces the codebase's attack surface by eliminating the re-encryption step, thereby mitigating a class of side-channel vulnerabilities. Our work positions CPA-secure KEMs as a secure, efficient, and practical alternative for standardizing and deploying post-quantum TLS 1.3 even with hybrid key exchange.

TI Topological dynamics of adiabatic cat states
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We consider a quantum topological frequency converter, realized by coupling a qubit to two slow harmonic modes. The dynamics of such a system is the quantum analog of topological pumping. Our quantum mechanical description shows that an initial state generically evolves into a superposition of two adiabatic states. The topological nature of the coupling between the qubit and the modes splits these two components apart in energy: for each component, an energy transfer at a quantized rate occurs between the two quantum modes, in opposite directions for the two components, reminiscent of the topological pumping. We denote such a superposition of two quantum adiabatic states distinguishable through measures of the modes' energy an adiabatic cat state. We show that the topological coupling enhances the entanglement between the qubit and the modes, and we unveil the role of the quantum or Fubini-Study metric in the characterization of this entanglement.

TI Superinductor-based ultrastrong coupling in a superconducting circuit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling mechanism in a circuit consisting of a flux qubit galvanically coupled to an LC resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated with granular aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface inductances. Despite the low persistent current exhibited by the qubit, I-p=11.6 nA, spectroscopy measurements reveal a Bloch-Siegert shift of 23 MHz and a coupling fraction of g/omega(r)similar or equal to 0.13, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime. An independent estimate of the coupler inductance by low-temperature resistance measurements leads to L-c=(0.74 +/- 0.14) nH, which is compatible with g/omega(r)greater than or similar to 0.1. Our results show that superinductors are a promising resource to study ultrastrong coupling physics in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents.

TI Generalized spin kitten states in a strongly coupled spin-oscillator
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Utilizing an adiabatic approximation method, a bipartite qudit-oscillator Hamiltonian is studied for low-spin values in both strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes. The quasiprobability densities on the hybrid factorized phase space are introduced. Integrating over a sector of the composite phase space, the quasiprobability distributions of its complementary subsystem are recovered. In the strong coupling regime, the qudit entropy displays a pattern of quasiperiodic collapses and revivals, where the latter coincide with locally minimum entropy configurations. Starting with a bipartite factorizable initial state, we observe that almost pure spin kitten type states dynamically develop at near-null values of entropy. The Hilbert-Schmidt distance measure of these states puts them metrically far away from the initial state. Other localized spin states form at locally minimum but significantly large values of entropy. The evolution to the nonclassical transitory spin states is displayed via the diagonal spin PQ representation. As another manifestation of nonclassicality the emergence of the spin-squeezed states during the bipartite evolution is observed. In the ultrastrong coupling domain, a large number of interaction-dependent modes and their harmonics are generated. The consequent randomization of the phases eliminates the quasiperiodicity of the system which is now driven towards a stabilization of the entropy that also undergoes stochastic fluctuations around a suitably stabilized value. In both the strong and ultrastrong coupling realms, antibunching of the photoemission events is realized particularly for the small spin values.

TI Theory and simulations of few-photon Fock state pulses strongly
   interacting with a single qubit in a waveguide: Exact population
   dynamics and time-dependent spectra
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a detailed quantum theory and simulations of few-photon Fock state pulses interacting with a two-level system (TLS) in an open waveguide-QED system. For a rectangular pulse shape, we present an exact temporal scattering theory to derive analytical expressions for the TLS population, using one-photon and two-photon pulses, for both chiral and symmetric emitters. We also derive the stationary (long-time) and time-dependent spectra for one-photon excitation, and show how these differ at a fundamental level when considering TLS population effects. Numerically, we also present matrix product state (MPS) simulations, which allow us to compute more general photon correlation functions for arbitrary quantum pulses, and we use this approach to also show results for Gaussian quantum pulses and to confirm the accuracy of our analytical solutions. In the case of a chiral TLS, we show how a one-photon pulse, of any temporal shape, yields a transmitted long-time spectrum that is identical to the input pulse, despite significant TLS population effects. However, the dynamical spectra and spectral intensity show rich population effects, allowing for their detection in spectroscopic experiments. We also show the striking differences between one-photon and two-photon excitation, where the latter shows clear signatures of nonlinear saturation effects. In addition, we demonstrate how significant population TLS dynamics also occur for pulses that are relatively long compared to the radiative decay time (showing that a weak excitation approximation, which neglects finite TLS population effects, cannot be made) and investigate the population signatures, nonlinear features and dynamical behavior as a function of quantum pulse length.

TI Phishing threat mitigation in E-commerce using a quantum-enhanced hybrid
   AI framework
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, exploiting URL structures to deceive users and bypass traditional detection systems. Most existing models rely solely on classical deep learning, which often incurs high computational overhead and lacks interpretability. In this context, this paper proposes a quantum-enhanced hybrid AI model that integrates a classical neural encoder with a parameterized quantum circuit, leveraging quantum entanglement and superposition for enriched feature representation. The model processes URL-based features and achieves a classification accuracy of 97.3% with significantly reduced trainable parameters compared to baseline methods. The results confirm the model's effectiveness, efficiency, and potential in next-generation phishing detection systems.

TI Defect Engineering in Large-Scale CVD-Grown Hexagonal Boron Nitride:
   Formation, Spectroscopy, and Spin Relaxation Dynamics
SO SMALL
AB Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, V B -, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. Different defect types are identified by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons and emitting at 800 nm) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (N B V N) and reveal the presence of additional "dark" paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.

TI Dissipative quantum Hopfield network: a numerical analysis
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present extensive simulations of a quantum version of the Hopfield neural network to explore its emergent behavior. The system is a network of N qubits oscillating at a given Omega frequency and which are coupled via Lindblad jump operators built with local fields hi depending on some given stored patterns. Our simulations show the emergence of pattern-antipattern oscillations of the overlaps with the stored patterns similar (for large Omega and small temperature) to those reported within a recent mean-field description of such a system, and which are originated deterministically by the quantum term including sxi qubit operators. However, in simulations we observe that such oscillations are stochastic due to the interplay between noise and the inherent metastability of the pattern attractors induced by quantum oscillations, and then are damped in finite systems when one averages over many quantum trajectories. In addition, we report the system behavior for large number of stored patterns at the lowest temperature we can reach in simulations (namely T=0.005TC). Our study reveals that for small-size systems the quantum term of the Hamiltonian has a negative effect on storage capacity, decreasing the overlap with the starting memory pattern for increased values of Omega and number of stored patterns. However, it also impedes the system to be trapped for long time in mixtures and spin-glass states. Interestingly, the system also presents a range of Omega values for which, although the initial pattern is destabilized due to quantum oscillations, other patterns can be retrieved and remain stable even for many stored patterns, implying a quantum-dependent nonlinear relationship between the recall process and the number of stored patterns.

TI Compact chirped fiber Bragg gratings for single-photon generation from
   quantum dots
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB A scalable source of single photons is a key constituent of an efficient quantum photonic architecture. To realize this, it is beneficial to have an ensemble of quantum emitters that can be collectively excited with high efficiency. Semiconductor quantum dots hold great potential in this context due to their excellent photophysical properties. Spectral variability of quantum dots is commonly regarded as a drawback introduced by the fabrication method. However, this is beneficial to realize a frequency-multiplexed single-photon platform. Chirped pulse excitation, relying on the so-called adiabatic rapid passage, is the most efficient scheme to excite a quantum dot ensemble due to its immunity to individual quantum dot parameters. Yet, the existing methods of generating chirped laser pulses to excite a quantum emitter are bulky, lossy, and mechanically unstable, which severely hampers the prospects of a quantum dot photon source. Here, we present a compact, robust, and high-efficiency alternative for chirped pulse excitation of solid-state quantum emitters. Our simple plug-and-play module consists of chirped fiber Bragg gratings, fabricated via femtosecond inscription, to provide high values of dispersion in the near-infrared spectral range, where the quantum dots emit. We characterize and benchmark the performance of our method via chirped excitation of a GaAs quantum dot, establishing high-fidelity single-photon generation. Our highly versatile chirping module coupled to a photon source is a significant milestone toward realizing practical quantum photonic devices.

AB We focus on using an architecture similar to the beta-Variational Autoencoder (beta-VAE) to discriminate if a quantum state is entangled or separable based on measurements. We split the data into two sets, the set of local and correlated measurements. Using the latent space, which is a low dimensional representation of the data, we show that restricting ourselves to the set of local data it is not possible to distinguish between entangled and separable states. Meanwhile, when considering both correlated and local measurements, an accuracy of over 80% is attained in the structure of the latent space. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantifying entanglement in terms of an operational way*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We establish entanglement monotones in terms of an operational approach, which is closely connected with the state conversion from pure states to the objective state by the local operations and classical communications. It is shown that any good entanglement quantifier defined on pure states can induce an entanglement monotone for all density matrices. Particularly, we show that our entanglement monotone is the maximal one among all those having the same form for pure states. In some special cases, our proposed entanglement monotones turn to be equivalent to the convex roof construction, which hence gain an operational meaning. Some examples are given to demonstrate different cases.

TI Probing Curved Spacetime with a Distributed Atomic Processor Clock
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum dynamics on curved spacetime has never been directly probed beyond the Newtonian limit. Although we can describe such dynamics theoretically, experiments would provide empirical evidence that quantum theory holds even in this extreme limit. The practical challenge is the minute spacetime curvature difference over the length scale of the typical extent of quantum effects. Here, we propose a quantum network of alkaline earth (like) atomic processors for constructing a distributed quantum state that is sensitive to the differential proper time between its constituent atomic processor nodes, implementing a quantum observable that is affected by post-Newtonian curved spacetime. Conceptually, we propose to delocalize one clock between three locations by encoding the presence or absence of a clock into the state of the local atoms. By separating three atomic nodes over approximately kilometer-scale elevation differences and distributing one clock between them via a W state, we demonstrate that the curvature of spacetime is manifest in the interference of the three different proper times that give rise to three distinct beat notes in our nonlocal observable. We further demonstrate that N-atom entanglement within each node enhances the interrogation bandwidth by a factor of N. We discuss how our proposed system can probe new facets of fundamental physics, such as the linearity, unitarity, and probabilistic nature of quantum theory on curved spacetime. Our protocol combines several recent advances with neutral atom and trapped ions to realize a novel quantum probe of gravity uniquely enabled by quantum networks.

   nonhealing traumatic ulcers of oral cavity
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
AB Chronic nonhealing ulcers of the oral mucosa and lateral tongue, in particular, can transform into invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Sometimes these ulcers do not heal even after the removal of the etiological agent that actually initiated these lesions, something similar to what happens in "neoplasia." Numerous factors have been postulated in the literature; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. We hereby would suggest few plausible factors that could be considered for future studies to shed light on some untapped territories in the pathogenesis of OSCC arising from chronic nonhealing traumatic ulcers in purview of chromoanagenesis and the concepts of "quantum entanglement and coherence."

TI Measuring Is Making: The Radical Indeterminacy of Music
SO LEONARDO
AB In Meeting the Universe Halfway, the feminist theorist Karen Barad explores the indeterminate nature of measurement. Drawing on empirical research into quantum entanglement, they develop an axiomatic approach to configuring the fundamental interconnections between processes of measurement and making. This article builds on this aspect of Barad's work and uses it to consider how an indeterminate measuring-as-making process might manifest in music. By staging an encounter between the composer John Cage's investigations of indeterminacy and two contemporary pieces of music-Space Golf by Hen Ogledd and Wildfires by SAULT-the author considers how a Baradian theory of measuring-as-making can be used to offer new perspectives on musical creativity.

Here, we report an experimental design that implements a CHSH test between bioelectric state variables for a human subject and bioelectric and/or biochemical state variables for cultured human cells in vitro. While we were unable to obtain evidence for entanglement with this design, observing only classical correlation, we report lessons learned and suggest possible avenues for future studies.

TI A novel two-party semiquantum key distribution protocol based on
   GHZ-like states
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB In this paper, we propose a novel two-party semiquantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol using only one type of GHZ-like state. The proposed SQKD protocol can create a private key shared between one quantum party with unlimited quantum abilities and one classical party with limited quantum abilities without the existence of a third party. The proposed SQKD protocol does not need a Hadamard gate or quantum entanglement swapping. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed SQKD protocol can resist various famous attacks from an outside eavesdropper, such as Trojan horse, entangle-measure, double CNOT, measure-resend, and intercept-resend attacks.

TI The Superiority of Quantum Strategy in 3-Player Prisoner's Dilemma
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we extend the quantum game theory of Prisoner's Dilemma to the N-player case. The final state of quantum game theory of N-player Prisoner's Dilemma is derived, which can be used to investigate the payoff of each player. As demonstration, two cases (2-player and 3-player) are studied to illustrate the superiority of quantum strategy in the game theory. Specifically, the non-unique entanglement parameter is found to maximize the total payoff, which oscillates periodically. Finally, the optimal strategic set is proved to depend on the selection of initial states.

We consider explicitly a non-linear Klein-Gordon theory leading to monopolar oscillating solitons. We show that the theory is able to reproduce the main results of the pilot-wave interpretation for non interacting particles in a external electromagnetic field. In this regime, using the time symmetry of the theory, we are also able to explain quantum entanglement between several solitons and we reproduce the famous pilot-wave nonlocality associated with the de Broglie-Bohm theory.

TI CQ-CNN: A lightweight hybrid classical-quantum convolutional neural
   network for Alzheimer's disease detection using 3D structural brain MRI
SO PLOS ONE
AB The automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using 3D volumetric MRI data is a complex, multi-domain challenge that has traditionally been addressed by training classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With the rise of quantum computing and its potential to replace classical systems in the future, there is a growing need to: (i) develop automated systems for AD detection that run on quantum computers, (ii) explore the capabilities of current-generation classical-quantum architectures, and (iii) identify their potential limitations and advantages. To reduce the complexity of multi-domain expertise while addressing the emerging demands of quantum-based automated systems, our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a simple preprocessing framework that converts 3D MRI volumetric data into 2D slices. Second, we propose CQ-CNN, a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)-based lightweight hybrid classical-quantum convolutional neural network that leverages the computational capabilities of both classical and quantum systems. Our experiments on the OASIS-2 dataset reveal a significant limitation in current hybrid classical-quantum architectures, as they face difficulties converging when class images are highly similar, such as between moderate dementia and non-dementia classes of AD, which leads to gradient failure and optimization stagnation. However, when convergence is achieved, the quantum model demonstrates a promising quantum advantage by attaining state-of-the-art accuracy with far fewer parameters than classical models. For instance, our beta 8-3-qubit model achieves 97.5% accuracy using only 13.7K parameters (0.05 MB), which is 5.67% higher than a classical model with the same parameter count. Nevertheless, our results highlight the need for improved quantum optimization methods to support the practical deployment of hybrid classical-quantum models in AD detection and related medical imaging tasks.

   states

AB High-dimensional maximally entangled orbital angular momentum (OAM) states are a promising resource for enhancing information capacity and robustness in quantum communication. However, it still lacks an effective method to increase the state dimensionality. Here, we theoretically propose an efficient scheme to generate maximally entangled OAM states of ultrahigh dimensionality by manipulating the radial components of a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) pump beam. By optimizing the complex amplitudes of multiple radial modes of the LG pump light, one can feasibly achieve 101-dimensional OAM-based maximally entangled states. Our scheme has potential applications in high capacity quantum communication networks. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI On the Development of a Protection Profile Module for Encryption Key
   Management Components
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The ability of a cryptographic system to protect information from attacks depends on many factors, including the secrecy of the encryption key. A crucial aspect of any cryptosystem is how it manages the encryption keys. Encryption Key Management (EKM) spans the entire life cycle of the key, including the key's generation, usage, distribution, renewal, and destruction. Given the security sensitivity, it is desirable to adopt a widely accepted standard when developing an encryption key management system. Through rigorous development of security requirements and following standardized validation, evaluation, and certification, the consumers' confidence in the security of the EKM system will be enhanced. The Protection Profile (PP), defined in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (often referred to as Common Criteria or CC), specifies the security functional and assurance requirements for a specific technology. In this work, we propose a PP Module that is the new evolution of the PP covering trusted security features for EKM, which is based on its compliance with the Network Device collaborative Protection Profile (NDcPP). In particular, by analyzing threats and vulnerabilities of EKM systems, corresponding security objectives and requirements are proposed in the PP, along with the specification of evaluation activities. The quantum-safe aspect of key distribution protocols is further investigated to support EKM products with quantum-resistant algorithms and quantum key distribution features. In addition to presenting the development methodology and implementation process for the PP Module of EKM, we distill lessons learned from developing and validating the PP Module to inspire future research efforts on defining security requirements with the CC.

In previous work the authors have developed an analytic extension to STA, called enhanced shortcuts to adiabaticity (eSTA), that extends STA methods to systems where STA cannot be applied directly (2020 Phys. Rev. Res. 2 023360). Here we generalize this approach and construct an alternative eSTA method that takes advantage of higher order terms. We apply this eSTA method to the expansion of both a Gaussian trap and accordion lattice potential, demonstrating the improved fidelity and robustness of eSTA.

TI On characterising assemblages in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Characterising non-classical quantum phenomena is crucial not only from a fundamental perspective, but also to better understand its capabilities for information processing and communication tasks. In this work, we focus on exploring the characterisation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen inference (a.k.a. steering): a signature of non-classicality manifested when one or more parties in a Bell scenario have their systems and measurements described by quantum theory, rather than being treated as black boxes. We propose a way of characterising common-cause assemblages from the correlations that arise when the trusted party performs tomographically-complete measurements on their share of the experiment, and discuss the advantages and challenges of this approach. Within this framework, we show that so-called almost quantum assemblages satisfy the principle of macroscopic noncontextuality, and demonstrate that a subset of almost quantum correlations recover almost quantum assemblages in this approach.

TI Correlated nanoelectronics and the second quantum revolution
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The growing field of correlated nanoelectronics exists at the intersection of two established fields: correlated oxide electronics and semiconductor nanoelectronics. The development of quantum technologies that exploit quantum coherence and entanglement for the purposes of computation, simulation, and sensing will require complex material properties to be controlled at nanoscale dimensions. Heterostructures and nanostructures formed at the interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 exhibit striking behavior that arises from the ability to program the conductive behavior at extreme nanoscale dimensions. The active electronic layer, SrTiO3, exhibits a wide range of gate-tunable phenomena such as ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, magnetism, superconductivity, and spin-orbit coupling, all of which can be controlled at the nanoscale using two reversible methods: conductive atomic force microscope lithography and ultra-low-voltage electron beam lithography. Mesoscopic devices such as single-electron transistors and quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides can be "sketched " using these techniques, and the properties of these devices differ significantly from those created from traditional semiconductors, such as Si or GaAs. The strongly correlated nature of the SrTiO3 system is evident from superconducting behavior as well as a state in which electrons are paired outside the superconducting state. A highly exotic phase was discovered in which a degenerate quantum liquid is formed from bound states of n = 2, 3, 4, horizontal ellipsis electrons. Further development of correlated nanoelectronics based on the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 system can potentially lead to a general platform for quantum simulation as well as a pathway for the development of highly entangled states of multiple photons.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Entanglement is fundamental inasmuch because it rephrases the quest for the classical-quantum demarcation line, and it also has potentially enormous practical applications in modern information technology. In this work, employing the approach of matrix decomposition, we introduce and formulate a practicable criterion for separability based on the correlation tensor. It is interesting that this criterion unifies several relevant separability criteria proposed before, even stronger than some of them. Theoretical analysis and detailed examples demonstrate its availability and feasibility for entanglement detection. Furthermore we build a family of entanglement witnesses using the criterion according to its linearity in the density operator space.

TI Entangled ripples and twists of light: radial and azimuthal
   Laguerre-Gaussian mode entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB It is well known that photons can carry a spatial structure akin to a 'twisted' or 'rippled' wavefront. Such structured light fields have sparked significant interest in both classical and quantum physics, with applications ranging from dense communications to light-matter interaction. Harnessing the full advantage of transverse spatial photonic encoding using the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis in the quantum domain requires control over both the azimuthal (twisted) and radial (rippled) components of photons. However, precise measurement of the radial photonic degree-of-freedom has proven to be experimentally challenging primarily due to its transverse amplitude structure. Here we demonstrate the generation and certification of full-field LG entanglement between photons pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion in the telecom regime. By precisely tuning the optical system parameters for state generation and collection, and adopting recently developed techniques for precise spatial mode measurement, we are able to certify fidelities up to 85% and entanglement dimensionalities up to 26 in a 43-dimensional radial and azimuthal LG mode space. Furthermore, we study two-photon quantum correlations between nine LG mode groups, demonstrating a correlation structure related to mode group order and inter-modal cross-talk. In addition, we show how the noise-robustness of high-dimensional entanglement certification can be significantly increased by using measurements in multiple LG mutually unbiased bases. Our work demonstrates the potential offered by the full spatial structure of the two-photon field for enhancing technologies for quantum information processing and communication.

The procedure allows us to test whether a given 4x4 complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by i. The method can be generalized to H-2 circle times H-d systems for d > 2 to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity.

AB Quantum information methods have been brought to bear on high-energy physics, including the study of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in collider experiments. Quantum information observables have also been employed to constrain possible new-physics effects. We improve on this point by introducing quantum information tools routinely used to compare quantum states: the trace distance and the fidelity. We find that the former outperforms other quantum information observables considered in the literature and, together with the cross section, yields the strongest bounds on possible departures from the Standard Model. The power of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with three examples of new-physics searches. The first concerns the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark and yields the first bound computed by means of quantum tomography and actual experimental data. The other two examples use Monte Carlo simulations and set the projected limits on the anomalous couplings of the tau leptons at Belle and at a future collider-which is taken to be LEP3. For these new-physics searches, we also compare the sensitivity of the trace distance to those of other quantum information quantities like concurrence, magic, and the fidelity distance. In passing, we provide the first determinations of magic in collider data by analyzing the top-quark pair production at the LHC and the charmonium decays. The significance is well above the 5 sigma level in both the cases.

TI Spontaneous Collapse by Entanglement Suppression
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A modified Schrodinger equation having an added nonlinear term, which gives rise to disentanglement, has been recently proposed. The process of quantum measurement is explored for the case of a pair of coupled spins. It is found that the deterministic time evolution generated by the modified Schrodinger equation mimics the process of wavefunction collapse. Added noise gives rise to stochasticity in the measurement process. Conflict with both principles of causality and separability can be avoided by postulating that the nonlinear term is active only during the time when subsystems interact. Moreover, in the absence of entanglement, all predictions of standard quantum mechanics are unaffected by the added nonlinear term.

TI A Mini-Review of the Kinetic Energy Partition Method in Quantum
   Mechanics
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Based on the idea of adiabatic symmetry, we present a novel basis set expansion method-the kinetic energy partition (KEP) method-for solving quantum eigenvalue problems. Broken symmetry is responsible for quantum entanglement in many-body systems via parametric non-adiabatic corrections. Starting from simple one-particle-in-one-dimension problems, we gradually increase the complexity in the number of particles and the interaction patterns. Our goal in the mini-review is to advocate for the utility of the KEP method in front-line research, in particular for research beginners in quantum many-body problems.

TI Simulating non-completely positive actions via exponentiation of
   Hermitian-preserving maps
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Legitimate quantum operations must adhere to principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the requirements of complete positivity and trace preservation. Yet, non-completely positive maps, especially Hermitian-preserving maps, play a crucial role in quantum information science. Here, we introduce the Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation algorithm, which can effectively simulate the action of an arbitrary Hermitian-preserving map by exponentiating its output, N(rho)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal{N}}(\rho )$$\end{document}, into a quantum process, e-iN(rho)t\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${e}<^>{-i{\mathcal{N}}(\rho )t}$$\end{document}. We analyze the sample complexity of this algorithm and prove its optimality in certain cases. Utilizing positive but not completely positive maps, this algorithm provides exponential speedups in entanglement detection and quantification compared to protocols based on single-copy operations. In addition, it facilitates the encoding-free recovery of noiseless quantum states from multiple noisy ones by simulating the inverse map of the corresponding noise channel, providing a new approach to handling quantum noises. This algorithm acts as a building block of large-scale quantum algorithms and presents a pathway for exploring potential quantum speedups across a wide range of information-processing tasks.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Cluster Detection in Physical Images
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Identifying clusters in data is an important task in many fields. In this paper, we consider situations in which data live in a physical world, so we first have to collect the images using sensors before clustering them. Using sensors enhanced by quantum entanglement, we can image surfaces more accurately than using purely classical strategies. However, it is not immediately obvious whether the advantage we gain is robust enough to survive data-processing steps such as clustering. It has previously been found that using quantum-enhanced sensors for imaging and pattern recognition can give an advantage for supervised learning tasks, and here we demonstrate that this advantage also holds for an unsupervised learning task, namely clustering.

TI Varieties of contextuality based on probability and structural
   nonembeddability
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Different analytic notions of contextuality fall into two major groups: probabilistic and strong notions of contextuality. Kochen and Specker's Theorem 0 [1] presents a demarcation criterion for differentiating between those groups. Whereas probabilistic contextuality still allows classical models, albeit with nonclassical probabilities, the logico-algebraic "strong" form of contextuality characterizes collections of quantum observables that have no faithfully embedding into (extended) Boolean algebras. Both forms indicate a classical in- or under-determination that can be termed "value indefinite" and formalized by partial functions of theoretical computer sciences. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Entanglement capacity of fermionic Gaussian states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the capacity of entanglement as an alternative to entanglement entropies in estimating the degree of entanglement of quantum bipartite systems over fermionic Gaussian states. In particular, we derive the exact and asymptotic formulas of average capacity of two different cases-with and without particle number constraints. For the later case, the obtained formulas generalize some partial results of average capacity in the literature. The key ingredient in deriving the results is a set of new tools for simplifying finite summations developed very recently in the study of entanglement entropy of fermionic Gaussian states.

TI Exciton-photocarrier interference in mixed lead-halide-perovskite
   nanocrystals
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The use of semiconductor nanocrystals in scalable quantum technologies requires characterization of the exciton coherence dynamics in an ensemble of electronically isolated crystals in which system-bath interactions are nevertheless strong. In this communication, we identify signatures of Fano-like interference between excitons and photocarriers in the coherent two-dimensional photoluminescence excitation spectral lineshapes of mixed lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals in dilute solution. Specifically, by tuning the femtosecond-pulse spectrum, we show such interference in an intermediate coupling regime, which is evident in the coherent lineshape when simultaneously exciting the exciton and the free-carrier band at higher energy. We conclude that this interference is an intrinsic effect that will be consequential in the quantum dynamics of the system and will thus dictate decoherence dynamics, with consequences in their application in quantum technologies.

TI Measure of Tripartite Quantum Correlation in Multiqubit Symmetric Pure
   State
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a direct measure of tripartite quantum correlation in an arbitrary symmetric pure state of N correlated two-level atoms (qubits). We compute the third-order moments of the collective pseudo-spin operators in terms of the individual atomic operators of the atoms in the assembly and find that all the bipartite quantum correlation terms among the atoms cancel out leaving only the all possible tripartite quantum correlation terms among them. We observe that the third-order moments are made up of solely the tripartite quantum correlations among the atoms. This helps to extract out only the tripartite quantum correlations among the N atoms and propose a measure and quantification of these correlations. We also propose the necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of tripartite quantum correlation in such multi-atomic systems. We conjecture the way of determining the third-order moments of the pseudo-spin operators of the two-level atoms in the assembly, experimentally.

TI Fluorine-terminated diamond (110) surfaces for nitrogen-vacancy quantum
   sensors
SO CARBON
AB Diamond (110) surface is one of the low-index diamond faces but its effects on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensor remain unclear. The fluorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surfaces used for the NV centers are proposed here, and their electronic properties are investigated based on first-principles calculations. The oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surface has inter-bandgap states and surface electron spins, the nitrogen-terminated (110) surface has inter-band gap states, and the hydrogen-terminated (110) surface has negative electron affinity. Thus, these three surfaces may not be suitable for shallow NV centers. The fluorine-terminated diamond (110) surface has positive electron affinity, no surface related inter bandgap states, and no surface electron spins, so it is a promising candidate for NV-based quantum sensors.

TI Spin operator, Bell nonlocality and Tsirelson bound in quantum-gravity
   induced minimal-length quantum mechanics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Theories of quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimal scale of length. Here the authors show that the minimal length dramatically affects dynamical observables, letting the spin operator become momentum dependent, and discuss the physical consequences of such mixing between space-time and internal degrees of freedom.
   Different approaches to quantum gravity converge in predicting the existence of a minimal scale of length. This raises the fundamental question as to whether and how an intrinsic limit to spatial resolution can affect quantum mechanical observables associated to internal degrees of freedom. We answer this question in general terms by showing that the spin operator acquires a momentum-dependent contribution in quantum mechanics equipped with a minimal length. Among other consequences, this modification induces a form of quantum nonlocality stronger than the one arising in ordinary quantum mechanics. In particular, we show that violations of the Bell inequality can exceed the maximum value allowed in ordinary quantum mechanics, the so-called Tsirelson bound, by a positive-valued function of the momentum operator. We introduce possible experimental settings based on neutron interferometry and quantum contextuality, and we provide preliminary estimates on the values of the physical parameters needed for actual laboratory implementations.

TI Formulation of Correction Term in QUBO Form for Phase-Field Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB In this study, we developed a method of estimating the correction terms that makes the Hamiltonian used in phase-field analysis by quantum annealing correspond to the free energy functional of the conventional phase-field analysis using the finite difference method. For the estimation of the correction terms, we employed a factorization machine. The inputs to the factorization machine were the phase-field variables in domain-wall encoding and the differences between the Gibbs free energy and Hamiltonian. We obtained the difference value in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form as the output of learning using the factorization machine. The QUBO form difference was subjected to the original Hamiltonian as the correction term. The performance of this correction term was evaluated by calculating the energy for a equilibrium state of diblock copolymer. In phase-field analysis, the time evolution equation is formulated so that the total free energy decreases; hence, a lower the free energy means a more accurate result close to that of a conventional method. When we performed annealing with correction terms, the microstructure showed a Gibbs free energy that was lower than that obtained without the correction terms.

The potential for applications of quantum technologies to high energy particle physics endeavors has however not yet been investigated to the same extent. In this paper, we propose a number of areas where specific approaches built on quantum systems such as low-dimensional systems (quantum dots, 2D atomic layers) or manipulations of ensembles of quantum systems (single atom or polyatomic systems in detectors or on detector surfaces) might lead to improved high energy particle physics detectors, specifically in the areas of calorimetry, tracking or timing.

TI Quantum-Field-Theoretic Simulation Platform for Observing the Fate of
   the False Vacuum
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We design and implement a quantum annealing simulation platform to observe and study dynamical processes in quantum field theory (QFT). Our approach encodes the field theory as an Ising model, which is then solved by a quantum annealer. As a proof of concept, we encode a scalar field theory and measure the probability for it to tunnel from the false vacuum to the true vacuum for various tunneling times, vacuum displacements, and potential profiles. The results are in accord with those predicted theoretically, showing that a quantum annealer is a promising platform for encoding QFTs. This is the first time it has been possible to measure instanton processes across a freely chosen QFT energy barrier. We argue that this novel and flexible method to study the dynamics of quantum systems has potential application to many field theories of interest. Measurements of the dynamical behavior of such encoded field theories are independent of theoretical calculations and can be used to infer their properties without being limited by the availability of suitable perturbative or nonperturbative computational methods. Soon, measurements using such a quantum annealing simulation platform could therefore be used to improve theoretical and computational methods conceptually and may enable the measurement and detailed study of previously unobserved quantum phenomena.

TI Photonic Simulation of Majorana-Based Jones Polynomials

AB By braiding non-Abelian anyons it is possible to realize fault-tolerant quantum algorithms through the computation of Jones polynomials. So far, this has been an experimentally formidable task. In this Letter, a photonic quantum system employing two-photon correlations and nondissipative imaginary-time evolution is utilized to simulate two inequivalent braiding operations of Majorana zero modes. The resulting amplitudes are shown to be mathematically equivalent to Jones polynomials. The high fidelity of our optical platform allows us to distinguish between a wide range of links, such as Hopf links, Solomon links, Trefoil knots, Figure Eight knots and Borromean rings, through determining their corresponding Jones polynomials. Our photonic quantum simulator represents a significant step towards executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms based on topological quantum encoding and manipulation.

TI Matter-wave Atomic Gradiometer Interferometric Sensor (MAGIS-100)
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB MAGIS-100 is a next-generation quantum sensor under construction at Fermilab that aims to explore fundamental physics with atom interferometry over a 100 m baseline. This novel detector will search for ultralight dark matter, test quantum mechanics in new regimes, and serve as a technology pathfinder for future gravitational wave detectors in a previously unexplored frequency band. It combines techniques demonstrated in state-of-the-art 10-meter-scale atom interferometers with the latest technological advances of the world's best atomic clocks. MAGIS-100 will provide a development platform for a future kilometer-scale detector that would be sufficiently sensitive to detect gravitational waves from known sources. Here we present the science case for the MAGIS concept, review the operating principles of the detector, describe the instrument design, and study the detector systematics.

TI Probing NV and SiV charge state dynamics using high-voltage nanosecond
   pulse and photoluminescence spectral analysis
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) color defects in diamond are promising systems for applications in quantum technology. The NV and SiV centers have multiple charge states, and their charge states have different electronic, optical and spin properties. For the NV centers, most investigations for quantum sensing applications are targeted on the negatively charged NV (NV-), and it is important for the NV centers to be in the NV- state. However, it is known that the NV centers are converted to the neutrally charged state (NV0) under laser excitation. An energetically favorable charge state for the NV and SiV centers depends on their local environments. It is essential to understand and control the charge state dynamics for their quantum applications. In this work, we discuss the charge state dynamics of NV and SiV centers under high-voltage nanosecond pulse discharges. The NV and SiV centers coexist in the diamond crystal. The high-voltage pulses enable manipulating the charge states efficiently. These voltage-induced changes in charge states are probed by their photoluminescence spectral analysis. The analysis result from the present experiment shows that the high-voltage nanosecond pulses cause shifts of the chemical potential and can convert the charge states of NV and SiV centers with the transition rates of similar to MHz. This result also indicates that the major population of the SiV centers in the sample is the doubly negatively charged state (SiV2-), which is often overlooked because of its non-fluorescent and non-magnetic nature. This demonstration paves a path for a method of rapid manipulation of the NV and SiV charge states in the future.

TI A statistical verification method of random permutations for hiding
   countermeasure against side-channel attacks
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Hiding countermeasure is among the best-known secure implementation techniques designed to counteract side-channel attacks. It uses a permutation algorithm to shuffle data. In today's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), hiding countermeasure has earned the limelight for its "shufflability"in lattice-based, and code-based, cryptographic algorithms. In this narrative, most importantly, as a rule, fast generation of permutations is paramount to both efficacy and security of an algorithm. The Fisher-Yates (FY) shuffling method has long been a popular choice for this purpose: the FY method generates randomly shuffled (finite) indices. However, despite its theoretical verity, with the FY method we anticipate the following risks of misuse, which can lead to biased shuffling sequences: (i) incorrect implementation, (ii) poor random source, and (iii) the chosen random number being too small. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical test called "approximate permutation criterion"("APC"). We use it to examine some known cases of misused FY shuffling (i-iii). APC takes into consideration the fact that the super-exponential rate of growth of the factorial function N!, which represents the number of permutations of N indices, defies any meaningful form of statistical tests. With APC one can verify whether the output permutations are biased or not with much lower testing cost. Mathematically, in this paper we introduce the so-called "kth order permutation verification", the underpinning notion upon which APC is based. We also compare APC with full sample space to demonstrate how well it encapsulates the statistical randomness of random permutations. We thereby provide a new method that identifies a bias that exists in the output permutations when implementing FY Shuffling through a visual ratio test and the chi-square (chi(2)) distribution test.

TI Minimum-entanglement protocols for function estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We derive a family of optimal protocols, in the sense of saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, for measuring a linear combination of d field amplitudes with quantum sensor networks, a key subprotocol of general quantum sensor network applications. We demonstrate how to select different protocols from this family under various constraints. Focusing primarily on entanglement-based constraints, we prove the surprising result that highly entangled states are not necessary to achieve optimality in many cases. Specifically, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal protocols using at most k-partite entanglement. We prove that the protocols which satisfy these conditions use the minimum amount of entanglement possible, even when given access to arbitrary controls and ancillas. Our protocols require some amount of time-dependent control, and we show that a related class of time-independent protocols fail to achieve optimal scaling for generic functions.

TI Mixed Multi-Chaos Quantum Image Encryption Scheme Based on Quantum
   Cellular Automata (QCA)
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB The advent of quantum computers could enable the resolution of complex computational problems that conventional cryptographic protocols find challenging. As a result, the formidable computing capabilities of quantum computers may render all present-day cryptographic schemes that rely on computational complexity ineffectual. Inspired by these possibilities, the primary purpose of this paper is to suggest a quantum image encryption scheme based on quantum cellular automata with mixed multi-chaos hybrid maps and a hyperchaotic system with quantum operations. To achieve desirable encryption outcomes, we designed an encryption scheme involving two main operations: (1) pixel-level diffusion and (2) pixel-level permutation. Initially, the secret keys generated using the hyperchaotic system were closely tied to the original image. During the first phase, the establishment of correlations among the image pixels, in addition to the three chaotic sequences obtained from the hyperchaotic system, was achieved with the application of a quantum-state superposition and measurement principle, wherein the color information of a pixel is described using a single qubit. Therefore, the three channels of the plain image were subjected to quantum operations, which involve Hadamard transformation and the quantum-controlled NOT gate, before the diffusion of each color channel with the hyperchaotic system. Subsequently, a quantum ternary Toffoli gate was used to perform the diffusion operation. Next, the appropriate measurement was performed on the three diffused channels. To attain the confusion phase, a blend of mixed multi-chaos hybrid maps and a two-dimensional quantum cellular automaton was used to produce random and chaotic sequence keys. Subsequently, the circular shift was utilized to additionally shuffle the rows and columns of the three diffused components, in order to alter the positions of their pixel values, which significantly contributes to the permutation process. Lastly, the three encoding channels, R, G, and B, were merged to acquire the encrypted image. The experimental findings and security analyses established that the designed quantum image encryption scheme possesses excellent encryption efficiency, a high degree of security, and the ability to effectively withstand a diverse variety of statistical attacks.

TI Black-box estimation of expanding parameter for de Sitter universe
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study the black-box parameter estimation of expanding parameters and the dynamics of Gaussian interferometric power for the de Sitter space. We find that the state between separated open charts can be employed as a probe state for the black-box quantum metrology. This is nontrivial because the open charts are causally disconnected and classical information can not be exchanged between them according to the general relativity. It is shown that the mass of the scalar field remarkably affects the accuracy of the black-box parameter estimation in the de Sitter space, which is quite different from the flat space case where the mass parameter does not influence the precision of estimation. Quantum discord is found to be a key resource for the estimation of the expanding parameter when there is no entanglement between the initially uncorrelated open charts. It is demonstrated that the role of the probe state between different open charts is quite distinct because the curvature effect of the de sitter space damages quantum resources for the initially correlated probe states, while it generates quantum resources for the initially uncorrelated probe states.

TI Cyber Threats in the Pharmaceutical Industry: A Deep Dive Into Recent
   Attacks and Future Implications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The pharmaceutical industry faces significant cybersecurity challenges, with increasing threats to sensitive data, intellectual property, and patient information. Traditional cybersecurity models, including signature-based and threshold-based intrusion detection systems (IDS), often fail to address the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats. This paper introduces a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI-driven) cryptographic system designed to enhance cybersecurity in the pharmaceutical sector, integrating advanced AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, game theory, and C*-algebra to optimize resource allocation, improve threat detection, and enhance cryptographic protocols. Through comprehensive evaluation, the AI model demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods, achieving a detection rate of 97.4%, significantly reducing false positive rates (2.6%) and response time (50ms), and attaining an F1-score of 0.95. Specifically, in the CICIDS 2017 dataset, the AI model reached a detection rate of 97.4%, compared to 85.2% for traditional IDS, while MITRE ATT&CK saw a detection rate of 91.5% and a false positive rate of 12.0%. The MIMIC-III dataset achieved 93.0% detection with a false positive rate of 6.5%, and in the UWF-ZeekData22 dataset, the AI model recorded a detection rate of 96.0% and a false positive rate of 3.5%. The AI model's ability to continuously adapt to emerging cyber threats makes it a future-proof solution for the pharmaceutical industry, with scalability ensuring applicability across various organizational sizes. Future research directions include integrating blockchain, cloud computing, and post-quantum cryptography to further strengthen system resilience. This paper presents a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution to address growing cybersecurity challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring critical data protection in an increasingly complex threat landscape.

TI Secure and practical multiparty quantum digital signatures
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum digital signatures (QDSs) promise information-theoretic security against repudiation and forgery of messages. Compared with currently existing three-party QDS protocols, multiparty protocols have unique advantages in the practical case of more than two receivers when sending a mass message. However, complex security analysis, numerous quantum channels and low data utilization efficiency make it intractable to expand three-party to multiparty scenario. Here, based on six-state non-orthogonal encoding protocol, we propose an effective multiparty QDS framework to overcome these difficulties. The number of quantum channels in our protocol only linearly depends on the number of users. The post-matching method is introduced to enhance data utilization efficiency and make it linearly scale with the probability of detection events even for five-party scenario. Our work compensates for the absence of practical multiparty protocols, which paves the way for future QDS networks.

TI Communication advantage of quantum compositions of channels from
   non-Markovianity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The combined use of quantum channels can grant communication advantages in the form of enhancements to communication capacities. One such channel composition is the quantum switch, which implements a system with indefinite causal order by coherent control of the orderings of two or more quantum channels, resulting in enhanced communication capacities. Here, using the monogamy relation, we studied the flow of entanglement monotone in these quantum compositions of channels in the environmental representation. We implemented the two-party quantum switch in this framework, and demonstrated that non-Markovianity is the source of revival of the entanglement monotone in this setup. The possibility and amount of revival was shown to depend on the entangling capability of the channels, and the perfect activation of coherent information with entanglement-breaking channels was also replicated with the perfect revival of entanglement monotone. Additionally, we showed that a more general non-Markovian circuit can still grant enhancements to coherent information and Holevo quantity without the presence of indefinite causal order.

TI Room-temperature biphoton source with a spectral brightness near the
   ultimate limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Biphotons, generated from a hot atomic vapor via the process of spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), have the following merits: Stable and tunable frequencies as well as linewidth. Such merits are very useful in the application of long-distance quantum communication. However, the hot-atom SFWM biphoton sources previously had far lower values of generation rate per linewidth, i.e., spectral brightness, as compared with the sources of biphotons generated by the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. Here we report a hotatom SFWM source of biphotons with a linewidth of 960 kHz and a generation rate of 3.7 x 10(5) pairs/s. The high generation rate, together with the narrow linewidth, results in a spectral brightness of 3.8 x 10(5) pairs/s/MHz, which is 17 times the previous best result with atomic vapors and also better than all known results with all kinds of media. The all-co-propagating scheme together with a large optical depth (OD) of the atomic vapor is the key improvement, enabling the achieved spectral brightness to be about one quarter of the ultimate limit. Furthermore, this biphoton source had a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 2.7, which violated the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for classical light by about 3.6-fold. Although an increasing spectral brightness usually leads to a decreasing SBR, our systematic study indicates that both of the present spectral brightness and SBR can be enhanced by further increasing the OD. This work demonstrates a significant advancement and provides useful knowledge in quantum technology using photons.

TI Transfer learning and the early estimation of single-photon source
   quality using machine learning methods
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The use of single-photon sources (SPSs) is central to numerous systems and devices proposed amidst a modern surge in quantum technology. However, manufacturing schemes remain imperfect, and single-photon emission purity must often be experimentally verified via interferometry. Such a process is typically slow and costly, which has motivated growing research into whether SPS quality can be more rapidly inferred from incomplete emission statistics. Hence, this study is a sequel to previous work that demonstrated significant uncertainty in the standard method of quality estimation, i.e. the least-squares fitting of a physically motivated function, and asks: can machine learning (ML) do better? The study leverages eight datasets obtained from measurements involving an exemplary quantum emitter, i.e. a single InGaAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot; these eight contexts predominantly vary in the intensity of the exciting laser. Specifically, via a form of 'transfer learning', five ML models, three linear and two ensemble-based, are trained on data from seven of the contexts and tested on the eighth. Validation metrics quickly reveal that even a linear regressor can outperform standard fitting when it is tested on the same contexts it was trained on, but the success of transfer learning is less assured, even though statistical analysis, made possible by data augmentation, suggests its superiority as an early estimator. Accordingly, the study concludes by discussing future strategies for grappling with the problem of SPS context dissimilarity, e.g. feature engineering and model adaptation.

TI On Quantum Causality
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
AB For Kant causality is an a priori category of the understanding, a necessary condition for the possibility of any experience. Later Wittgenstein's philosophy rejects transcendentalism. We can only speak of causes and effects if in some basic situations, or 'language games,' we already treat some things as causes of what happens. Since the notion of cause becomes meaningful only within a language game, it is not unambiguous. Quantum causal language games presuppose the use of quantum theory. We treat the latter as Wittgenstein's grammar of a quantum 'form of life,' or rule (norm), anchored in its applications - quantum phenomena as language games. Quantum correlations are often interpreted as a manifestation of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics. This is a view of quantum phenomena from the perspective of classical physics. Our contextual point of view rejects the nonlocality of quantum theory in the sense of instantaneous causal influence at a distance. But it does not admit its locality in the sense of classical causality either. We introduce the notion of quantum causality which allows us to treat quantum correlations as local, but context-dependent. Their formal cause is an entangled wave function. Any particular quantum correlation, identifiable in a context of its observation as a result of the wave function reduction, post factum can be treated as a classical causal correlation. From the point of view of the proposed contextual quantum realism, epistemology is secondary, and ontology is sensitive to context. Quantum correlations exist (are real) before application of the theory, independently of their identification (description, measurement), but have no identity, which appears only as a result of application of the theory and their identification in the context. In other words, they are real, but not pre-determined, not autonomous.

TI Highly efficient secure linear algebra for private machine learning
   classifications over malicious clients in the post-quantum world
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Over the last decade there has a been widespread usage of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers in cases such accurate disease diagnosis at clinics, credit card fraud detection in banks, cyber-attacks prevention of computer systems in different industries, etc. However, privacy and security concerns and law regulations have been an obstacle to the usage of ML classifiers. To this end, this paper addresses the scenario where a server has a private trained ML model, and one or more clients have private queries that they wish to classify using the server's model. During the process, the server learns nothing, while the clients learn only their final classifications and nothing else. Several ML classification algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, different flavors of Naive Bayes, etc., can be expressed in terms of linear algebra operations. To this end, initially, as building blocks, several novel secure linear algebra operations are proposed. On top of them novel secure ML classification algorithms are proposed for the aforementioned classifiers under strict security, privacy and efficiency constraints and their security is proven under the semi-honest model. Since the used underlying cryptographic primitives are shown to be resilient to quantum computer attacks, the proposed algorithms are also suitable for the post-quantum world. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are non-interactive and, based on where the bulk of the operations are done, they have the flexibility to be server or client centric. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations over benchmark datasets show that the proposed secure linear algebra operations, hence the secure ML algorithms build on top of them, outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of computation and communication costs as well as on security and privacy characteristics. Moreover, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, for the first time in literature the security of the proposed algorithms is proven when dealing with multiple malicious clients during classifications.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI Quantum Error Mitigation via Matrix Product Operators
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, the number of controllable hardware qubits is insufficient to implement quantum error correction. As an alternative, quantum error mitigation (QEM) can suppress errors in measurement results via repeated experiments and postprocessing of data. Typical techniques for error mitigation, e.g., the quasiprobability decomposition method, ignore correlated errors between different gates. Here, we introduce a QEM method based on the matrix product operator (MPO) representation of a quantum circuit that can characterize the noise channel with polynomial complexity. Our technique is demonstrated on a depth = 20 fully parallel quantum circuit of up to Nq = 20 qubits undergoing local and global noise. The circuit error is reduced by a several-times factor with only a small bond dimension D' = 1 for the noise channel. The MPO representation increases the accuracy of mod-eling noise without consuming more experimental resources, which improves the QEM performance and broadens its scope of application. Our method is hopeful of being applied to circuits in higher dimensions with more qubits and deeper depth.

TI Bichromatic Rabi Control of Semiconductor Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electrically driven spin resonance is a powerful technique for controlling semiconductor spin qubits. However, it faces challenges in qubit addressability and off-resonance driving in larger systems. We demonstrate coherent bichromatic Rabi control of quantum dot hole spin qubits, offering a spatially selective approach for large qubit arrays. By applying simultaneous microwave bursts to different gate electrodes, we observe multichromatic resonance lines and resonance anticrossings that are caused by the ac Stark shift. Our theoretical framework aligns with experimental data, highlighting interdot motion as the dominant mechanism for bichromatic driving.

TI Certifying dimension of quantum systems by sequential projective
   measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB This work analyzes correlations arising from quantum systems subject to sequential projective measurements to certify that the system in question has a quantum dimension greater than some d. We refine previous known methods and show that dimension greater than two can be certified in scenarios which are considerably simpler than the ones presented before and, for the first time in this sequential projective scenario, we certify quantum systems with dimension strictly greater than three. We also perform a systematic numerical analysis in terms of robustness and conclude that performing random projective measurements on random pure qutrit states allows a robust certification of quantum dimensions with very high probability.

TI Dipolar Order Induced Electron Spin Hyperpolarization
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The structure of coupled electron spin systems is of fundamental interest to many applications, including dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the generation of electron spin qubits for quantum information science (QIS), and quantitative studies of paramagnetic systems by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). However, the characterization of electron spin coupling networks is nontrivial, especially at high magnetic fields. This study focuses on a system containing high concentrations of trityl radicals that give rise to a DNP enhancement profile of( 1)H NMR characteristic of the presence of electron spin clusters. When this system is subject to selective microwave saturation through pump-probe ELectron DOuble Resonance (ELDOR) experiments, electron spin hyperpolarization is observed. We show that the generation of an out-of-equilibrium longitudinal dipolar order is responsible for the transient hyperpolarization of electron spins. Notably, the coupled electron spin system needs to form an AX-like system (where the difference in the Zeeman interactions of two spins is larger than their coupling interaction) such that selective microwave irradiation can generate signatures of electron spin hyperpolarization. We show that the extent of dipolar order, as manifested in the extent of electron spin hyperpolarization generated, can be altered by tuning the pump or probe pulse length, or the interpulse delay in ELDOR experiments that change the efficiency to generate or readout longitudinal dipolar order. Pump-probe ELDOR with selective saturation is an effective means for characterizing coupled electron spins forming AX-type spin systems that are foundational for DNP and quantum sensing.

TI Quantum-enhanced imaging and metrology with undetected photons via
   squeezed-light homodyne detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work a quantum imaging setup based on undetected squeezed photons is employed for metrological applications such as sensitive phase measurement and quantum imaging. Unlike traditional quantum imaging with undetected photons, as introduced by A. Zeilinger et al., the proposed setup incorporates a homodyne detection system and enhances the brightness of the quantum light using optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The inclusion of OPOs may challenge the validity of the low-gain approximation, necessitating the development of a new theoretical framework that extends beyond this approximation. The results demonstrate a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which serves as a key metric for both image quality and phase-measurement accuracy. Furthermore, an imaging protocol is introduced to effectively suppress background noise. Notably, this protocol enables the extraction of image information encoded in quantum fluctuations (noise), paving the way for non-disruptive imaging. This is particularly significant in the field of bio-imaging, since the object (a sensitive living cell) is interrogated by longer-wavelength idler light while detection is applied at optical frequency in which the sensors are less noisy and has more quantum efficiency.

TI Fully non-positive-partial-transpose genuinely entangled subspaces
SO QUANTUM
AB Genuinely entangled subspaces are a class of subspaces in the multipartite Hilbert spaces that are composed of only genuinely entangled states. They are thus an interesting object of study in the context of multipartite entanglement. Here we provide a construction of multipartite subspaces that are not only genuinely entangled but also fully non-positive-partial-transpose (NPT) in the sense that any mixed state supported on them has non-positive partial transpose across any bi-partition. Our construction originates from the stabilizer formalism known for its use in quantum error correction. To this end, we first introduce a couple of criteria allowing to assess whether any state from a given non-trivial stabilizer subspace is genuinely multipartite entangled. We then use these criteria to construct genuinely entangled stabilizer subspaces for any number of parties and prime local dimension and conjecture them to be of maximal dimension achievable within the stabi-lizer formalism. At the same time, we prove that every genuinely entangled subspace is fully NPT in the above sense, which implies a quite sur-prising fact that no genuinely entangled stabilizer subspace can support PPT entangled states.

TI Practical Verification of Quantum Properties in
   Quantum-Approximate-Optimization Runs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In order to assess whether quantum resources can provide an advantage over classical computation, it is necessary to characterize and benchmark the nonclassical properties of quantum algorithms in a practical manner. In this paper, we show that using measurements in no more than three out of the possible 3N bases, one can not only reconstruct the single-qubit reduced density matrices and measure the ability to create coherent superpositions, but also possibly verify entanglement across all N qubits participating in the algorithm. We introduce a family of generalized Bell-type observables for which we establish an upper bound to the expectation values in fully separable states by proving a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which may serve of independent interest. We demonstrate that a subset of such observables can serve as entanglement witnesses for states of the quantum-approximate-optimization algorithm for the MaxCut problem (QAOA MaxCut), and further argue that they are especially well tailored for this purpose by defining and computing an entanglement potency metric on witnesses. A subset of these observables also certifies, in a weaker sense, the entanglement in GHZ states, which share the Z(2) symmetry of QAOA MaxCut. The construction of such witnesses follows directly from the cost Hamiltonian to be optimized, and not through the standard technique of using the projector of the state being certified. It may thus provide insights to construct similar witnesses for other variational algorithms prevalent in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We demonstrate our ideas with proof-of-concept experiments on the Rigetti Aspen-9 chip for ansatz containing up to 24 qubits.

TI SMAUG (-T), Revisited: Timing-Secure, More Compact, Less Failure
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB SMAUG-T is a Module-LWE/LWR-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) scheme, one of the Round 2 candidates in the Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography (KpqC) Standardization Competition. It partly follows the design of Kyber, the NIST's PQC standard, while utilizing the sparse secret to achieve smaller sizes with better performance. Recently, Bernstein (KpqC-bulletin 2024) claimed that SMAUG-T contains sub-procedures that are not constant-time, which makes it vulnerable to an efficient key recovery attack. Additionally, Lee et al. (EPRINT 2024) presented an improved version of May's Meet-LWE attack (Crypto 2021) on LWE using sparse secrets of fixed weights, which lowered the security of SMAUG-T level-5 parameter than the claimed security. In this paper, we first examine potential mitigation enabling SMAUG-T to be constant-time and assess their impact on performance. The performance decreases significantly compared to the original SMAUG-T, losing one of its strengths. Moreover, to make SMAUG-T secure against the attack of Lee et al., either sizes or decryption failure probability increases by a lot. To overcome this, we introduce new designs for SMAUG-T that allow us to bypass potential non-constant time vulnerabilities and attacks exploiting the sparse secret of fixed weights. These designs not only allow efficient timing-secure implementation but also reduce the sizes and the probability of decryption failures. Notably, the public key and ciphertext sizes are reduced by 10-20% for the level-5 parameters. When comparing constant-time implementations, the new SMAUG-T outperforms Kyber, the NIST's PQC standard, by up to 1.6x for encapsulation and 1.4x for decapsulation.

TI Measurement of Coherence Time in Cold Atom-Generated Tunable Photon Wave
   Packets Using an Unbalanced Fiber Interferometer
SO PHOTONICS
AB In the realm of quantum communication and photonic technologies, the extension of coherence time for photon wave packets is essential for improving system efficacy. This research introduces a methodology for measuring coherence time utilizing an unbalanced fiber interferometer, specifically designed for tunable pulse-width photon wave packets produced by cold atoms. By synchronously generating write pulses, signal light, and frequency-locking light from a single laser source, the study effectively mitigated frequency discrepancies that typically arise from the use of multiple light sources. The implementation of frequency-resolved photon counting under phase-locked conditions was accomplished through the application of polarization filtering and cascaded filtering techniques. The experimental results indicated that the periodicity of frequency shifts in interference fringe patterns diminishes as the differences in delay arm lengths increase, while fluctuations in fiber length and high-frequency laser jitter adversely affect interference visibility. Through an analysis of the correlation between delay and photon counts, the coherence time of the write laser was determined to be 2.56 mu s, whereas the Stokes photons produced through interactions with cold atoms exhibited a reduced coherence time of 1.23 mu s. The findings suggest that enhancements in laser bandwidth compression and fiber phase stability could further prolong the coherence time of photon wave packets generated by cold atoms, thereby providing valuable technical support for high-fidelity quantum information processing.

TI Carbon efficient quantum AI: an empirical study of ansätz design
   trade-offs in QNN and QLSTM models
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rising environmental cost of deep learning has placed Green AI, which promotes focus on reducing the carbon footprint of AI, at the forefront of sustainable computing. In this study, we investigate Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a novel and energy-efficient alternative by benchmarking two quantum models, the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) and Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), on the N-BaIoT anomaly detection dataset. Our first phase of experiments compares the QNN and QLSTM models using ten distinct quantum circuit designs (ans & auml;tze A1-A10). We systematically compare trade-offs between classification performance, model complexity, training time, and energy consumption. The results indicate that simpler QNN ans & auml;tze can achieve accuracy comparable to more complex ones while consuming significantly less energy and converging faster. In particular, QNN with ansatz A4 provided the optimal balance between performance and energy efficiency, consistently outperforming QLSTM across most metrics. A detailed energy breakdown confirmed GPU usage as the dominant source of power consumption, underscoring the importance of circuit-efficient quantum design. To contextualize QML's viability, we conducted a second phase of experiments comparing quantum models with three benchmark classical machine learning models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and CatBoost. We find that the classical models demonstrated faster training times and lower energy consumption, highlighting and contrasting the maturity of algorithmic development that classical ML algorithms have already seen. Finally, we examined the energy implications of developing quantum models on actual quantum hardware. This third phase of experiments compared training on IBM Qiskit's emulation environment (running on GPU servers) versus execution on real IBM Quantum hardware. Highlighting the significant differences in execution time and energy footprint, extrapolated results indicate that quantum hardware still incurs higher energy costs. This suggests that further hardware-aware ans & auml;tz optimization and improvements in quantum infrastructure are essential to realizing carbon-efficient QML at scale.

For a finite-dimensional Hilbert space C, we find the necessary and sufficient condition on U for a causal influence of A on B and vice versa. We introduce an easily computable measure of the causal influence and use it to study the causal influence of different quantum gates, its mutuality, and quantum superpositions of different causal orders. For two two-level atoms dipole-interacting with a thermal bath of electromagnetic waves, the space-time dependence of causal influence almost perfectly reproduces the one of reservoir-induced entanglement.

TI Nonreciprocal unconventional magnon blockade induced by Barnett effect
   and parametric amplification
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to achieve nonreciprocal unconventional magnon blockade (UMB) via the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with a parametric amplifier. We show that, with a strong cavity-magnon coupling regime, giant nonreciprocal UMB can emerge by appropriately choosing two sets of parameters in this system, i.e., strong magnon antibunching occurs only from one direction of the magnetic field but not from the other side. This nonreciprocity originates from the fact that the Barnett shift induced by the Barnett effect can be adjusted from positive to negative values by changing the magnetic field direction, resulting in different frequencies of the magnon mode. Moreover, we demonstrate that parametric amplification is an indispensable factor for constructing the pathways of quantum destructive interference to achieve strong UMB. Furthermore, we give analytical parameter conditions to realize strong UMB, which is proven to be in great agreement with numerical results. Interestingly, the nonreciprocity against magnon thermal occupation is remarkably enhanced by increasing the amplitude of the driving field. Notably, the critical temperature for observing nonreciprocal UMB is as high as 133 mK, and the sphere needs to spin at MHz values to achieve the UMB effect. Our work provides an avenue to realize nonreciprocal single-magnon devices and has potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication.

TI Enhance Capacity Region of Multi-Class IIoT Network by Applying
   Entanglement Assistance Protocol
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) context, heterogeneous IIoT nodes need diverse performance requirements, including throughput and quality of service (QoS). These IIoT nodes transmit data over a common shared communication medium. The existing critical challenge arises in efficiently scheduling access to this shared medium among a large number of connected IIoT nodes. To address the challenge of random access in IIoT networks, the power of the entanglement-assisted (EA) protocol was exploited to expand the capacity region boundaries of the shared communication medium, thereby enhancing the throughput and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the heterogeneous IIoT network. In the literature, IIoT networks are mainly categorised into two types: centralised and distributed. In this paper, we proposed two distinct models: (1) a centralised multi-class IIoT network based on EA protocol and (2) a distributed multi-class IIoT network based on EA protocol. Next, the authors analytically demonstrated that integrating the EA protocol into both proposed types of multi-class IIoT networks significantly increases the capacity region boundaries compared to the classical reference model, namely slotted ALOHA (SA). Finally, the network performance boundaries were evaluated by analysing the throughput values for different network classes and varying numbers of IIoT nodes. The results demonstrate that, for both proposed models (1) and (2), the transmitted load generated by the IIoT nodes over the shared medium achieves dramatically higher throughput compared to the reference IIoT network based on SA.

TI Visualizing and witnessing first-order coherence, Bell nonlocality and
   purity by using a quantum steering ellipsoid in the non-inertial frame
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) is a visual characterization for bipartite qubit systems, and it is also a novel avenue for describing and detecting quantum correlations. Herein, by using a QSE, we visualize and witness the first-order coherence (FOC), Bell nonlocality (BN) and purity under non-inertial frames. Also, the collective influences of the depolarizing channel and the non-coherence-generating channel (NCGC) on the FOC, BN and purity are investigated in the QSE formalism. The results reveal that the distance from the center of the QSE to the center of the Bloch sphere visualizes the FOC of a bipartite system, the lengths of the QSE semiaxis visualize the BN, and the QSE's shape and position dominate the purity of the system. One can capture the FOC, BN and purity via the shape and position of the QSE in the non-inertial frame. The depolarizing channel (the NCGC) gives rise to the shrinking and degradation (the periodical oscillation) of the QSE. One can use these traits to visually characterize and detect the FOC, BN and purity under the influence of external noise. Of particular note is that the condition for the QSE to achieve the center of the Bloch sphere cannot be influenced by the depolarizing channel and the NCGC. The characterization shows that the conditions for the disappearance of the FOC are invariant under the additional influences of the depolarizing channel and NCGC.

TI Quantum Emitters in Rhombohedral Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) is an emerging wide-bandgap van der Waals (vdW) material that combines strong second-order nonlinear optical properties with the structural flexibility of layered 2D systems. It is shown that rBN hosts optically-addressable spin defects and single-photon emitters (SPEs). Both are fabricated deterministically, using site-specific techniques, and are compared to their analogues in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Emission spectra in hBN and rBN are compared, and computational models of defects in hBN and rBN are used to elucidate the debated atomic structure of the B-center SPE in BN. The results establish rBN as a monolithic vdW platform that uniquely combines second-order nonlinear optical properties, optically addressable spin defects, and high-quality SPEs, opening new possibilities for integrated quantum and nonlinear photonics.

TI On solving classes of positive-definite quantum linear systems with
   quadratically improved runtime in the condition number
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum algorithms for solving the Quantum Linear System (QLS) problem are among the most investigated quantum algorithms of recent times, with potential applications including the solution of computationally intractable differential equations and speed-ups in machitie learning. A fundamental parameter governing the efficiency of QLS solvers is is, the condition number of the coefficient matrix A, as it has been known since the inception of the QLS problem that for worst-case instances the runtime scales at least linearly in kappa [1]. However, for the case of positive-definite matrices classical algorithms can solve linear systems with a runtime scaling as root kappa, a quadratic improvement compared to the the indefinite case. It is then natural to ask whether QLS solvers may hold an analogous improvement. In this work we answer the question in the negative, showing that solving a QLS entails a runtime linear in kappa also when A is positive definite. We then identify broad classes of positive-definite QLS where this lower bound can be circumvented and present two new quantum algorithms featuring a quadratic speed-up in kappa: the first is based on efficiently implementing a matrix-block-encoding of A(-1), the second constructs a decomposition of the form A=LL dagger to precondition the system. These methods are widely applicable and both allow to efficiently solve BQP-complete problems.

TI A Neural Architecture Search-Driven Quantum Patch Attention Framework
   for Skin Disease Recognition and Classification With XAI Vision
   Transformers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Accurate early differentiation of morphologically similar viral exanthems, such as chickenpox, measles, and monkeypox, remains a significant diagnostic challenge in dermatology. To address this, we present Quantum Patch Attention Vision Transformer guided by Neural Architecture Search (QPAViT-NAS), a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning framework, designed to enhance both accuracy and transparency in skin disease classification. The architecture integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with a quantum-inspired feature encoding layer, leveraging quantum superposition principles to amplify subtle textural differences in dermoscopic images. A key innovation lies in the NAS-optimized patch attention module, which dynamically prioritizes diagnostically salient skin regions during classification, enabling fine-grained decision-making at the sub-image level. Trained on a curated dataset of 4,800 high-resolution dermoscopic images spanning four classes (normal skin, chickenpox, measles, monkeypox), the model achieved 90.2% accuracy (+/- 1.3%) under 5-fold cross-validation, while reaching 84.62% accuracy (95% CI: [83.8, 85.4]) on the independent held-out test set. The framework also attained superior sensitivity (89.7%) and specificity (91.5%) in distinguishing measles from monkeypox, a pair notorious for clinical confusion. To ensure translational relevance, we incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) tools (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) to visualize attention maps and validate model alignment with dermatological expertise. Additionally, ResNet-50-based embedding analysis quantifies inter-class visual similarity, revealing latent decision boundaries that correlate with pathological features (e.g., vesicle morphology, erythema patterns). The framework's computational efficiency (12 ms/inference on Kaggle GPU) supports integration into point-of-care workflows, while its modular design allows adaptation to emerging skin conditions. By bridging quantum machine learning with interpretable vision systems, QPAViT-NAS advances the paradigm of "glass-box" AI in healthcare, offering precision and diagnostic insight. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid architectures to transform teledermatology and AI-augmented clinical decision making.

TI High-dimensional multi-input quantum random access codes and mutually
   unbiased bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum random access codes (QRACs) provide a basic tool for demonstrating the advantages of quantum resources and protocols, which have a wide range of applications in quantum information processing tasks. However, the investigation and application of high-dimensional (d) multi-input (n) n((d)) -> 1 QRACs are still lacking. Here, we present a general method to find the maximum success probability of n((d)) -> 1 QRACs. In particular, we give the analytical solution for maximum success probability of 3((d)) -> 1 QRACs when measurement bases are mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Based on the analytical solution, we show the relationship between MUBs and n((d)) -> 1 QRACs. First, we provide a systematic method of searching for the operational inequivalence of MUBs (OI-MUBs) when the dimension d is a prime power. Second, we theoretically prove that, surprisingly, the commonly used Galois MUBs are not the optimal measurement bases to obtain the maximum success probability of n((d)) -> 1 QRACs, which indicates a breakthrough according to the traditional conjecture regarding the optimal measurement bases. Furthermore, based on high-fidelity high-dimensional quantum states of orbital angular momentum, we experimentally achieve two-input and three-input QRACs up to dimension 11. We experimentally confirm the OI-MUBs when d = 5. Our results open alternative avenues for investigating the foundational properties of quantum mechanics and quantum network coding.

TI Quantum deep reinforcement learning for clinical decision support in
   oncology: application to adaptive radiotherapy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Subtle differences in a patient's genetics and physiology may alter radiotherapy (RT) treatment responses, motivating the need for a more personalized treatment plan. Accordingly, we have developed a novel quantum deep reinforcement learning (qDRL) framework for clinical decision support that can estimate an individual patient's dose response mid-treatment and recommend an optimal dose adjustment. Our framework considers patients' specific information including biological, physical, genetic, clinical, and dosimetric factors. Recognizing that physicians must make decisions amidst uncertainty in RT treatment outcomes, we employed indeterministic quantum states to represent human decision making in a real-life scenario. We paired quantum decision states with a model-based deep q-learning algorithm to optimize the clinical decision-making process in RT. We trained our proposed qDRL framework on an institutional dataset of 67 stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated on prospective adaptive protocols and independently validated our framework in an external multi-institutional dataset of 174 NSCLC patients. For a comprehensive evaluation, we compared three frameworks: DRL, qDRL trained in a Qiskit quantum computing simulator, and qDRL trained in an IBM quantum computer. Two metrics were considered to evaluate our framework: (1) similarity score, defined as the root mean square error between retrospective clinical decisions and the AI recommendations, and (2) self-evaluation scheme that compares retrospective clinical decisions and AI recommendations based on the improvement in the observed clinical outcomes. Our analysis shows that our framework, which takes into consideration individual patient dose response in its decision-making, can potentially improve clinical RT decision-making by at least about 10% compared to unaided clinical practice. Further validation of our novel quantitative approach in a prospective study will provide a necessary framework for improving the standard of care in personalized RT.

TI Single-Photon Based Three-Party Quantum Secure Direct Communication with
   Identity Authentication
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Multipartite quantum secure direct communication (MQSDC) enables multiple message senders to simultaneously and independently transmit secret messages to a message receiver through quantum channels without sharing keys. Existing MQSDC protocols all assume that all the communication parties are legal, which is difficult to guarantee in practical applications. In this study, a single-photon based three-party QSDC protocol with identity authentication is proposed. In the protocol, the message receiver first authenticates the identity of two practical message senders. Only when the identity authentication is passed, the legal message senders can encode their messages by the hyper-encoding technology. In theory, two bits of messages can be transmitted to the message receiver in a communication round. The protocol can resist the external attack and internal attack, and guarantee the security of the transmitted messages and the identity codes of each legal message sender. The secret message capacity of the protocol is simulated with two-decoy-state method. The maximal communication distance between any two communication parties can reach approximate to 31.75 km with weak signal and decoy state pulses. The three-party QSDC protocol can be extended to a general MQSDC protocol and has important application in the further practical MQSDC field.
   This paper proposes a single-photon based three-party quantum secure direct communication protocol with identity authentication. Only the authenticated legal message senders can send their messages to the receiver simultaneously. The protocol can guarantee the absolute security of the transmitted messages and each legal message sender's identity codes in theory. It has important applications in the further quantum network field.image

AB Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has been gaining attention in the last few years due to the evolution of quantum computers and the need to replace traditional, quantum-attack-insecure cryptography schemes with quantum-attack-resistant schemes. Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) constitutes a highly promising post-quantum solution (Quantum Resistant), but implementations in software or hardware are challenging due to the use of operations based on large-size polynomials. LBC selected schemes for standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), rely on matrix-to-matrix multiplications of high-order polynomials, having performance bottlenecks that are solved using the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT). One of the NIST-selected schemes for digital signature (DS) is the CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme, which uses N = 256 degee polynomials. In this paper a Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design solution is proposed for all security levels of Dilithium, utilizing the OpenCL framework and Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. In our work, the HW/SW co-design OpenCL mechanisms are analyzed extensively and communication overheads between the hardware kernel and an ARM processor are identified, while appropriate techniques are proposed in order to bypass the I/O time-bottleneck on a real-world application. The proposed implementation runs on the ARM Processing System (PS) of a Xilinx Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) system, utilizing the MPSoC FPGA Programmable Logic (PL) in order to accelerate the calculations relative to the heavy matrix-multiplication operation. Finally, the proposed HW/SW codesigned solution is realized as a real-world Linux-based Dilithium DS executable and manages to achieve realistic performance gain, in terms of time execution, versus a CPU-only execution ranging from 2-23% (depending on the utilized CPU Clock Frequency).

   Scalability for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) demand authentication mechanisms that are both secure and privacy-preserving, particularly in light of emerging quantum-era threats. In this work, we propose a lattice-based identity authentication protocol that leverages pseudo-IDs to safeguard user privacy, while allowing the Trusted Authority (TA) to trace misbehaving vehicles when necessary. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed scheme strengthens accountability, improves scalability, and offers resistance against quantum attacks. A comprehensive complexity analysis is presented, addressing computational, communication, and storage overhead. Analysis results under practical parameter settings demonstrate that the protocol delivers robust security with manageable overhead, maintaining authentication latency within the real-time requirements of VANET applications.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Semi-quantum secret sharing (SQSS) is a branch of quantum cryptography which only requires the dealer to have quantum capabilities, reducing the difficulty of protocol implementation. However, the efficiency of the SQSS protocol still needs to be further studied. In this paper, we propose a semi-quantum secret sharing protocol, whose efficiency can approach 100% as the length of message increases. The protocol is based on single particles to reduce the difficulty of resource preparation. Particle reordering, a simple but effective operation, is used in the protocol to improve efficiency and ensure security. Furthermore, our protocol can share specific secrets while most SQSS protocols could not. We also prove that the protocol is secure against common attacks.

TI Revocable ring signatures with CCA-anonymity from standard lattices
SO COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES
AB Ring signatures are significant cryptographic primitives used for anonymous authentication due to their anonymity and spontaneity. . However, in some scenarios, they may offer excessive anonymity to the signer. Revocable ring signatures aim to preserve the desirable properties of ring signatures while incorporating the accountability aspect of group signatures, leading a better trade-off between anonymity and accountability. . Nevertheless, most revocable ring signature schemes only provide relatively weak CPA-Anonymity. In this paper, we present an instantiation of CCA-Anonymity from standard lattices, and prove its security under the random oracle model. Our construction achieves stronger anonymity and revocability, while relying on weaker assumptions than existing schemes from module lattices. Moreover, it boasts smaller sizes when the ring is large.

TI Geometric phases distinguish entangled states in wormhole quantum
   mechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We establish a relation between entanglement in simple quantum mechanical qubit systems and in wormhole physics as considered in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that in both cases, states with the same entanglement structure, indistinguishable by any local measurement, nevertheless are characterized by a different Berry phase. This feature is experimentally accessible in coupled qubit systems where states with different Berry phase are related by unitary transformations. In the wormhole case, these transformations are identified with a time evolution of one of the two throats.

TI Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Spectrum Analyzers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Characterization and suppression of noise are essential for the control of harmonic oscillators in the quantum regime. We measure the noise spectrum of a quantum harmonic oscillator from low frequency to near the oscillator resonance by sensing its response to amplitude modulated periodic drives with a qubit. Using the motion of a trapped ion, we experimentally demonstrate two different implementations with combined sensitivity to noise from 500 Hz to 600 kHz. We apply our method to measure the intrinsic noise spectrum of an ion trap potential in a previously unaccessed frequency range.

TI Simulating Effective QED on Quantum Computers
SO QUANTUM
AB In recent years simulations of chemistry and condensed materials has emerged as one of the preeminent applications of quantum computing, offering an exponential speedup for the solution of the electronic structure for certain strongly correlated electronic systems. To date, most treatments have ignored the question of whether relativistic effects, which are described most generally by quantum electrodynamics (QED), can also be simulated on a quantum computer in polynomial time. Here we show that effective QED, which is equivalent to QED to second order in perturbation theory, can be simulated in polynomial time under reasonable assumptions while properly treating all four components of the wavefunction of the ferrnionic field. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of such simulations in position and momentum basis using Trotter-Suzuki formulas. We find that the number of T-gates needed to perform such simulations on a 3D lattice of n(s) sites scales at worst as O(n(s)(3)/epsilon)(1+o(1)) in the thermodynamic limit for position basis simulations and O(n(s)(4+2/3)/epsilon)(1+o(1)) in momentum basis. We also find that qubitization scales slightly better with a worst case scaling of (O) over tilde (n(s)(2+2/3)/epsilon ) for lattice eQED and complications in the prepare circuit leads to a slightly worse scaling in momentum basis of (O) over tilde (n(s)(5+2/3)/epsilon). We further provide concrete gate counts for simulating a relativistic version of the uniform electron gas that show challenging problems can be simulated using fewer than 10(13) non-Clifford operations and also provide a detailed discussion of how to prepare multi-reference configuration interaction states in effective QED which can provide a reasonable initial guess for the ground state. Finally, we estimate the planewave cutoffs needed to accurately simulate heavy elements such as gold.

TI Leveraging quantum blockchain for secure multiparty space sharing and
   authentication on specialized metaverse platform
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the era of digital transformation, securing data on metaverse platforms poses significant challenges. This paper proposes Multiparty Space Sharing and Authentication (MSSA), a novel approach for secure user login and location access control within specialized metaverse platforms. MSSA leverages Quantum Multiparty Secret Computation (QMSC) integrated with a quantum blockchain network. This integration facilitates user verification within the presence of potentially untrusted metaverse authority. The underlying quantum blockchain employs a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism with a Borda voting scheme for authority node selection. By harnessing the principles of quantum cryptography, MSSA offers enhanced security against both classical and anticipated future quantum attacks. This research demonstrates the feasibility and potential of quantum blockchain for securing metaverse platforms, paving the way for secure and decentralized digital ecosystems.

Our theory reproduces the Josephson relations with the canonical current phase relation acquiring a weak second harmonic term, and it improves the standard lumped-element descriptions employed in circuit quantum electrodynamics by providing spatial resolution of the superconducting order parameter and electromagnetic field. By providing an ab initio derivation of the charge qubit Hamiltonian that relates traditionally free qubit parameters to geometric and material properties, we progress toward the quantum engineering of superconducting circuits at the subnanometer scale.

TI Bayesian estimation for Bell state rotations
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB This paper explores the effect of three-dimensional rotations on two-qubit Bell states and proposes a Bayesian method for the estimation of the parameters of the rotation. We use a particle filter to estimate the parameters of the rotation from a sequence of Bell state measurements, and we demonstrate that the resultant improvement over the optimal single qubit case approaches the root 2 factor that is consistent with the Heisenberg limit. We also demonstrate how the accuracy of the estimation method is a function of the purity of mixed states.

TI Low-temperature quantum thermometry boosted by coherence generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The precise measurement of low temperatures is significant for both the fundamental understanding of physical processes and technological applications. In this work, we present a method for low-temperature measurement that improves thermal range and sensitivity by generating quantum coherence in a thermometer probe. Typically, in temperature measurements, the probes thermalize with the sample being measured. However, we use a two-level quantum system, or qubit, as our probe and prevent direct probe access to the sample by introducing a set of ancilla qubits as an interface. We describe the open system dynamics of the probe using a global master equation and demonstrate that while the ancilla-probe system thermalizes with the sample, the probe per se evolves into a nonthermal steady state due to nonlocal dissipation channels. The populations and coherences of this steady state depend on the sample temperature, allowing for precise and wide-range low-temperature estimation. We characterize the thermometric performance of the method using quantum Fisher information and show that the quantum Fisher information can exhibit multiple and higher peaks at different low temperatures with increasing quantum coherence and the number of ancilla qubits. Our analysis reveals that the proposed approach, using a nonthermal qubit thermometer probe with temperature-dependent quantum coherence generated by a multiple qubit interface between a thermal sample and the probe qubit, can enhance the sensitivity of temperature estimation and broaden the measurable low-temperature range.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference in Quantum Optics, Monogamy of Entanglement,
   Nonorthogonality, and Untrusted Nodes
SO JETP LETTERS
AB Quantum key distribution systems with an untrusted intermediate node described by the so-called measurement device independent (MDI) protocol have been actively studied in the last decade. In early works, it was only argued why such a quantum key distribution system ensures the security of distributed keys mentioning that the security proof of the MDI protocol, which was not presented, is similar to that for the basic Bennett-Brassard 84 (BB84) protocol. For this reason, despite the existing experimental implementations of the MDI quantum key distribution system, physical reasons for the protocol security are still questionable. Such quantum key distribution systems provide a common key between two network nodes connected through the intermediate untrusted node, which does not require protection of the equipment on it, and an eavesdropper sees the entire operation of the equipment, including the results of the operation of photodetectors. In this work, the MDI protocol has been analyzed. It has been shown that the physical reasons for the protocol security are based on fundamental properties such as the interference of photons from different sources, monogamy of entanglement, and nonorthogonality of states. A simple and explicit derivation is given showing the equivalence of the MDI and BB84 protocols and physical reasons for the identity of the corresponding expressions for the length of the final key.

TI A self-locking Rydberg atom electric field sensor
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A crucial step toward enabling real-world applications for quantum sensing devices such as Rydberg atom electric field sensors is reducing their size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) requirements without significantly reducing performance. Laser frequency stabilization is a key part of many quantum sensing devices and, when used for exciting non-ground state atomic transitions, is currently limited to techniques that require either large SWaP-C optical cavities and electronics or use significant optical power solely for frequency stabilization. Here, we describe a laser frequency stabilization technique for exciting non-ground state atomic transitions that solves these challenges and requires only a small amount of additional electronics. We describe the operation, capabilities, and limitations of this frequency stabilization technique and quantitatively characterize its performance. We show experimentally that Rydberg electric field sensors using this technique are capable of data collection while sacrificing only 0.1% of available bandwidth for frequency stabilization of noise up to 900 Hz.

TI Dynamic Quantum Games
SO DYNAMIC GAMES AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum games represent the really twenty-first century branch of game theory, tightly linked to the modern development of quantum computing and quantum technologies. The main accent in these developments so far was made on stationary or repeated games. In this paper, we aim at initiating the truly dynamic theory with strategies chosen by players in real time. Since direct continuous observations are known to destroy quantum evolutions (so-called quantum Zeno paradox), the necessary new ingredient for quantum dynamic games must be the theory of non-direct observations and the corresponding quantum filtering. Apart from the technical problems in organizing feedback quantum control in real time, the difficulty in applying this theory for obtaining mathematically amenable control systems is due partially to the fact that it leads usually to rather non-trivial jump-type Markov processes and/or degenerate diffusions on manifolds, for which the corresponding control is very difficult to handle. The starting point for the present research is the remarkable discovery (quite unexpected, at least to the author) that there exists a very natural class of homodyne detections such that the diffusion processes on projective spaces resulting by filtering under such arrangements coincide exactly with the standard Brownian motions (BM) on these spaces. In some cases, one can even reduce the process to the plain BM on Euclidean spaces or tori. The theory of such motions is well studied making it possible to develop a tractable theory of related control and games, which can be at the same time practically implemented on quantum optical devices.

TI Experimental quantum kernel trick with nuclear spins in a solid
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The kernel trick allows us to employ high-dimensional feature space for a machine learning task without explicitly storing features. Recently, the idea of utilizing quantum systems for computing kernel functions using interference has been demonstrated experimentally. However, the dimension of feature spaces in those experiments have been smaller than the number of data, which makes them lose their computational advantage over explicit method. Here we show the first experimental demonstration of a quantum kernel machine that achieves a scheme where the dimension of feature space greatly exceeds the number of data using H-1 nuclear spins in solid. The use of NMR allows us to obtain the kernel values with single-shot experiment. We employ engineered dynamics correlating 25 spins which is equivalent to using a feature space with a dimension over 10(15). This work presents a quantum machine learning using one of the largest quantum systems to date.

TI Learning noise via dynamical decoupling of entangled qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Understanding noise in entangled systems is a prerequisite for developing scalable quantum computers. Here, we propose and apply multiqubit dynamical decoupling sequences that characterize noise during two-qubit gates. This noise is qualitatively different from the well-studied noise that leads to single-qubit dephasing; it simultane-ously affects the two qubits, inducing fluctuations in their entangling parameter. In our superconducting system, the experimentally observed noise comes from coupler flux fluctuations and is observed to be non-Gaussian, leading to the stepwise decay of signals.

AB Silicon nitride (SiN) is used extensively to complement the standard silicon photonics portfolio. However, thus far demonstrated light sources and detectors on SiN have predominantly focused on telecommunication wavelengths. Yet, to unlock the full potential of SiN, integrated photodetectors for wavelengths below 850 nm are essential to serve applications such as biosensing, imaging, and quantum photonics. Here, we report the first, to the best of our knowledge, microtransfer printed Si p-i-n photodiodes on a commercially available SiN platform to target wavelengths <850 nm. A novel heterogeneous integration process flow was developed to offer a high microtransfer printing yield. Moreover, these devices are fabricated with CMOS compatible and wafer-scale technology.

TI Benchmarking Simulated and Physical Quantum Processing Units Using
   Quantum and Hybrid Algorithms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Powerful hardware services and software libraries are vital tools for quickly and affordably designing, testing, and executing quantum algorithms. A robust large-scale study of how the performance of these platforms scales with the number of qubits is key to providing quantum solutions to challenging industry problems. This work benchmarks the runtime and accuracy for a representative sample of specialized high-performance simulated and physical quantum processing units. Results show the QMware simulator can reduce the runtime for executing a quantum circuit by up to 78% compared to the next fastest option for algorithms with fewer than 27 qubits. The Amazon Web Service State-Vector Simulator 1 offers a runtime advantage for larger circuits, up to the maximum 34 qubits. Beyond this limit, QMware can execute circuits as large as 40 qubits. Physical quantum devices, such as Rigetti's Aspen-M2, can provide an exponential runtime advantage for circuits with more than 30 qubits. However, the high financial cost of physical quantum processing units presents a serious barrier to practical use. Moreover, only IonQ's Harmony quantum device achieves high fidelity with more than four qubits. This study paves the way to understanding the optimal combination of available software and hardware for executing practical quantum algorithms.

TI A Systematic Survey on 5G and 6G Security Considerations, Challenges,
   Trends, and Research Areas
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB With the rapid rollout and growing adoption of 3GPP 5thGeneration (5G) cellular services, including in critical infrastructure sectors, it is important to review security mechanisms, risks, and potential vulnerabilities within this vital technology. Numerous security capabilities need to work together to ensure and maintain a sufficiently secure 5G environment that places user privacy and security at the forefront. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all pillars of a privacy and security framework that define major aspects of 5G operations. They are incorporated and considered in the design of the 5G standard by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with the goal of providing a highly reliable network operation for all. Through a comprehensive review, we aim to analyze the ever-evolving landscape of 5G, including any potential attack vectors and proposed measures to mitigate or prevent these threats. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research that has been conducted in recent years regarding 5G systems, focusing on the main components in a systematic approach: the Core Network (CN), Radio Access Network (RAN), and User Equipment (UE). Additionally, we investigate the utilization of 5G in time-dependent, ultra-confidential, and private communications built around a Zero Trust approach. In today's world, where everything is more connected than ever, Zero Trust policies and architectures can be highly valuable in operations containing sensitive data. Realizing a Zero Trust Architecture entails continuous verification of all devices, users, and requests, regardless of their location within the network, and grants permission only to authorized entities. Finally, developments and proposed methods of new 5G and future 6G security approaches, such as Blockchain technology, post-quantum cryptography (PQC), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) schemes, are also discussed to understand better the full landscape of current and future research within this telecommunications domain.

TI Comparing coherent and incoherent models for quantum homogenization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Here we investigate the role of quantum interference in the quantum homogenizer, whose convergence properties model a thermalization process. In the original quantum homogenizer protocol, a system qubit converges to the state of identical reservoir qubits through partial-swap interactions, that allow interference between reservoir qubits. We design an alternative, incoherent quantum homogenizer, where each system-reservoir interaction is moderated by a control qubit using a controlled-swap interaction. We show that our incoherent homogenizer satisfies the essential conditions for homogenization, being able to transform a qubit from any state to any other state to arbitrary accuracy, with negligible impact on the reservoir qubits' states. Our results show that the convergence properties of homogenization machines that are important for modeling thermalization are not dependent on coherence between qubits in the homogenization protocol. We then derive bounds on the resources required to re-use the homogenizers for performing state transformations. This demonstrates that both homogenizers are universal for any number of homogenizations, for an increased resource cost.

TI Generating non-classical correlations in two-level atoms
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB We address the effective generation of thermal non-classical correlations in two two-level atoms when exposed to a Fock-state cavity incorporated with classical decoherence effects. Using Bell non-locality, quantum coherence, and concurrence, we investigate the generation maps of non -locality, coherence, and entanglement. We show that the two atoms are initially separable, however, they become coherent and entangled within a short period of time when exploited with the Fock-state cavity. Interestingly, the Fock-state cavity shows dominant traits for the complete suppression of the classical decoherence effects. However, the decoherence effects appear initially and delay the generation of non-classical correlations. In addition, the generation delay of non-classical correla-tions is observed to be highly affected when the atom-cavity configuration is considered in a strong coupling regime. Compared to the entanglement and non-locality, the Fock-state cavity develops quantum coherence faster in the two-level systems. Finally, we also discuss the optimal feature set-tings of the Fock-state cavity, related significance, and experimental prospects of the study.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI Encryption, decryption, and control with fractional quantum bits,
   quantum chiral states and pyramidal quantum bits switching in graphene
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB A novel method for encryption, decryption, and control of data using the theory of rings and fields is proposed. A system comprising a ring or loop with a maximum of six vector tuples or sub-loops, which are changed into knots on a ring, is suggested, whereby these vector tuples at 0.4 <= n(f) <= 0.9 hold Dirac bosons. The Dirac bosons are precessed at characteristic frequencies and are integrated with a braid; the remaining fractional quantum bits (f-qubits) are occupied with Dirac fermions with the same braid, i.e., 0.1 <= n(f) <= 0.3. The fractional Fourier transform is used for modeling and simulating the eigenfunctions for stretching, twisting, and twigging. The fractional charges are quantized and invariant at knots, where subquanta-Dirac bosons-are held on the honeycomb lattice of graphene. The degeneracy of f-qubits is permanently established. The characteristic magnetic excitations due to different precessing frequencies of Dirac bosons are exploited for encryption and decryption. The spinning and precessing Dirac fermions are used for pyramidal switching. Addresses for f-qubits are evaluated by normalizing the Hamiltonian operator, which becomes Hermitian. The topological transitions for a quantized non-interacting electron as above are exploited. A method for encryption, decryption, and control of quantum information with seventy-two (72) "quantum chiral states" is suggested with graphene. The chiral matrix of n(f)xg(2)/hc, where 0.1 <= n(f) <= 0.9 and 0.02 <= g(2)/hc <= 0.08, is the most suitable option for f-qubits as compared to qubits especially when conformal mapping for quantum computation is accomplished.

TI High-fidelity single-spin shuttling in silicon
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The computational power and fault tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. In a first set of experiments, we form static quantum dots and study how spin coherence decays during bucket-brigade shuttling, where we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, for conveyor-mode shuttling, we create a travelling-wave potential, formed with either one or two sets of sine waves, to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This method shows a spin coherence an order of magnitude better than the bucket-brigade shuttling. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 mu m in under 200 ns while preserving the spin state with a fidelity of 99.5% on average. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.

TI Statistical verifications and deep-learning predictions for
   satellite-to-ground quantum atmospheric channels
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB This study confirms that a classical channel model can be used for describing random fluctuations in LEO-to-ground quantum atmospheric channels. It shows that practical engineering designs for future QKD missions can be conveniently conducted using the verified channel model, and that deep learning can predict channel fluctuations.
   Laser communications from small satellite platforms empowers the establishment of quantum key distribution (QKD), relying on quantum superposition states of single photons to realize unconditional security between distant parties at a global scale. Although recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of satellite-to-ground QKD links, the underlying statistical characteristics of quantum atmospheric channels have not been well-understood and experimentally verified in the literature. In this paper, we highlight that classical atmospheric statistical models can be applied for describing random fluctuations of the quantum channels. To verify this fact, we report a statistical verification study of quantum atmospheric channels from the world's first low-Earth orbit (LEO) 50-kg-class microsatellite-to-ground quantum-limited communication experiment. The verified statistical model is then applied to numerically investigate the quantum bit-error rate (QBER) and secret-key length (SKL) of a decoy-state efficient Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) QKD protocol with optimized parameters considering finite-key effects, implemented over a LEO 6-unit (6U)-CubeSat-to-ground link. Important insights of the physical channel effects including pointing errors and atmospheric turbulence on the QBER and SKL are then revealed. Finally, we present a study using a deep-learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) for predicting photon-count fluctuations over quantum atmospheric channels.

Lett. 45, 5688 (2020).], we proposed a new route to spectrally compress broadband photons to achieve spectral mode matching with narrowband memories, using a linear, time-variant optical cavity based on rapid switching of input coupling. In this work, we extend our approach to attain temporal mode matching as well by exploiting the time variation of output coupling of the cavity. We numerically analyze the mode matching and loss performance of our time-varying cavity and present a possi- ble implementation in integrated photonics. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is a fundamental problem in computer science. Finding efficient algorithms for SAT solving has broad implications in many areas of computer science and beyond. Quantum SAT solvers have been proposed in the literature based on Grover's algorithm. Although existing quantum SAT solvers can consider all possible inputs at once, they evaluate each clause in the formula one by one sequentially, making the time complexity O(m), linear to the number of clauses m, per Grover iteration. In this work, we develop a parallel quantum SAT solver, which reduces the time complexity in each iteration to constant time O(1) by utilising extra entangled qubits. To further improve the scalability of our solution in case of extremely large problems, we develop a distributed version of the proposed parallel SAT solver based on quantum teleportation such that the total qubits required are shared and distributed among a set of quantum computers (nodes), and the quantum SAT solving is accomplished collaboratively by all the nodes. We prove the correctness of our approaches and evaluate them in simulations and real quantum computers.

SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we present CTRU-Light, an IND-CCA-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) derived from NTRU and RLWE (and RLWR in variant) assumptions over power-of-two cyclotomic rings. Our CTRU-Light employs a compact NTT-compatible modulus q=641 while maintaining minimal public key and ciphertext dimensions with negligible error probability. Specifically, the design yields public key and ciphertext sizes of 1206 bytes under an error probability bound of <= 2-110. When benchmarked against Kyber (NIST's sole standardized KEM), CTRU-Light demonstrates 23.0-30.0% lower bandwidth consumption, accelerates key generation by at least 6.0%, and achieves over 1.3x speed enhancement in both encapsulation and decapsulation procedures.

TI Sub-micron spin-based magnetic field imaging with an organic light
   emitting diode
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensing and imaging of magnetic fields has attracted broad interests due to its potential for high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Common systems used for quantum sensing require either optical excitation (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, atomic vapor magnetometers), or cryogenic temperatures (e.g., SQUIDs, superconducting qubits), which pose challenges for chip-scale integration and commercial scalability. Here, we demonstrate an integrated organic light emitting diode (OLED) based solid-state sensor for magnetic field imaging, which employs spatially resolved magnetic resonance to provide a robust mapping of magnetic fields. By considering the monolithic OLED as an array of individual virtual sensors, we achieve sub-micron magnetic field mapping with field sensitivity of similar to 160 mu T Hz(-1/2) mu m(-2). Our work demonstrates a chip-scale OLED-based laser free magnetic field sensor and an approach to magnetic field mapping built on a commercially relevant and manufacturable technology.

The strengths of QC, which accelerates the training process and enables efficient handling of complex data representations through quantum superposition and entanglement, were combined with DNN, known for its ability to extract meaningful features and learn complex patterns from data. The proposed model can be trained using small datasets, reducing the need for extensive data, particularly useful in indoor localization, where data collection can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that the H-QDNN model significantly improves indoor localization accuracy compared to traditional techniques. Additionally, we provide insights into the factors contributing to enhanced performance, such as the quantum-inspired algorithms utilized and the integration of mixed fingerprints.

TI On the importance of data encoding in quantum Boltzmann methods
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In recent years, quantum Boltzmann methods have gained more and more interest as they might provide a viable path toward solving fluid dynamics problems on quantum computers once this emerging compute technology has matured and fault-tolerant many-qubit systems become available. The major challenge in developing a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists in encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating the streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary operation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes data encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline, assuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm. In this paper, we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings commonly discussed in the literature, either the collision or the streaming step cannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result, we propose a novel encoding in which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number of time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the total number of grid points. In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our encoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known that can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the collision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation.

TI A Highly Efficient ECPM Quantum Circuit for Binary Elliptic Curve
   Cryptanalysis
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper provides a detailed analysis and estimation of the quantum resources required for depth-optimized elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM), with a focus on qubits, Toffoli gates, CNOT gates, and circuit depth. The proposed ECPM quantum circuit, which is tailored for binary elliptic curve cryptanalysis using Shor's algorithm, incorporates improved arithmetic operations into optimized point addition (PA) and point doubling (PD) processes. The quantum resources required for single-step and full- step ECPM implementations (comprising 2n PD +2 PA) were systematically evaluated to enable in-depth cryptanalysis of binary elliptic curve cryptography using Shor's algorithm. The proposed approach offers a significant improvement in resource efficiency compared to circuits that rely solely on the existing PA, which typically require (2n+2)PA operations. The execution of a full iteration of quantum cryptanalysis using the Shor circuit was estimated to require 2n(3 )+ 2n(log3+1)+32n(2) logn+8n(2)+ O(n((log 3+1))) Toffoli gates, approximately 2n + 7n log(6)n+7 qubits, and a circuit depth of approximately 7+ n log(3) 9. Comparisons with leading Toffoli gate-level analysis results validate our findings, which demonstrate reduced quantum resource usage. In addition, key findings related to techniques for solving discrete logarithm problems are summarized, drawing from influential previous studies and current advancements.

TI Direct implementation of a perceptron in superconducting circuit quantum
   hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The utility of classical neural networks as universal approximators suggests that their quantum analogues could play an important role in quantum generalizations of machine-learning methods. Inspired by the proposal in Torrontegui and Garcia-Ripoll [Europhys. Lett. 125, 30004 (2019)], we demonstrate a superconducting qubit implementation of a controlled gate, which generalizes the action of a classical perceptron as the basic building block of a quantum neural network. In a two-qubit setup we show full control over the steepness of the perceptron activation function, the input weight and the bias by tuning the gate length, the coupling between the qubits, and the frequency of the applied drive, respectively. In its general form, the gate realizes a multiqubit entangling operation in a single step, whose decomposition into single-and two-qubit gates would require a number of gates that is exponential in the number of qubits. Its demonstrated direct implementation as perceptron in quantum hardware may therefore lead to more powerful quantum neural networks when combined with suitable additional standard gates.

TI Searching for gluon quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders using the
   autoencoder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB One of the difficulties one has to face in the future phenomenological studies of new physics (NP), is the need to deal with increasing amounts of data. It is therefore increasingly important to improve the efficiency in the phenomenological study of NP. Whether it is the use of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, or the use of quantum computing, all are means of improving the efficiency. In this paper, we use a ML algorithm, the autoencoder (AE), to study the dimension -8 operators in the SMEFT which contribute to the gluon quartic gauge couplings (gQGCs) at muon colliders. The AE is one of the ML algorithms that has the potential to be accelerated by the quantum computing. It is found that the AE -based anomaly detection algorithm can be used as event selection strategy to study the gQGCs at the muon colliders, and is effective compared with traditional event selection strategies.

TI Non-Hermitian sensing from the perspective of postselected measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB By employing the Naimark dilation, we establish a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian quantum sensing and postselected measurements. The sensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective quantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of postselection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors, regardless of the specific form of decoherence or the choice of probe states, cannot outperform their Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total QFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian subsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with the ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within the framework of postselected measurements with minimal experimental trials. In addition, the performances of non-Hermitian sensors versus different types of technical noises can be judged using our framework. Our work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating non-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum metrological protocols.

TI Indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack secure
   double-NTRU-based key encapsulation mechanism
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In this article, we propose a double-NTRU (D-NTRU)-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for the key agreement requirement of the post-quantum world. The proposed KEM is obtained by combining one-way D-NTRU encryption and Dent's KEM design method. The main contribution of this article is to construct a D-NTRU-based KEM that provides indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) security. The IND-CCA2 analysis and primal/dual attack resistance of the proposed D-NTRU KEM are examined in detail. A comparison with similar protocols is provided regarding parameters, public/secret keys, and ciphertext sizes. The proposed scheme presents arithmetic simplicity and IND-CCA2 security that does not require any padding mechanism.

TI New Approaches to Complexity via Quantum Graphs
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Problems based on the structure of graphs-for example, finding cliques, independent sets, or colorings-are of fundamental importance in classical complexity. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalization of graphs, presents several technical challenges. Consequently, the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored. In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We show that when quantifying over all channels, this problem is complete for QMA(2); in fact, it remains QMA(2) -complete when restricted to channels that are probabilistic mixtures of entanglement-breaking and partial trace channels. Quantifying over a subset of entanglementbreaking channels, this problem becomes QMA-complete, and restricting further to deterministic or classical noisy channels gives rise to complete problems for NP and MA, respectively. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantization is QMA(2), rather than QMA, and provide the first problem that allows for a direct comparison of the classes QMA(2), QMA, MA, and NP by quantifying over increasingly larger families of instances. We use methods that are inspired by self-testing to provide a direct proof of QMA(2)-completeness, rather than reducing to a previously studied complete problem. We also give a new proof of the celebrated reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2). In parallel, we study a version of the closely related independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case.

TI Computing for power system operation and planning: Then, now, and the
   future
SO IENERGY
AB With the global trend of pursuing clean energy and decarbonization, power systems have been evolving in a fast pace that we have never seen in the history of electrification. This evolution makes the power system more dynamic and more distributed, with higher uncertainty. These new power system behaviors bring significant challenges in power system modeling and simulation as more data need to be analyzed for larger systems and more complex models to be solved in a shorter time period. The conventional computing approaches will not be sufficient for future power systems. This paper provides a historical review of computing for power system operation and planning, discusses technology advancements in high performance computing (HPC), and describes the drivers for employing HPC techniques. Some high performance computing application examples with different HPC techniques, including the latest quantum computing, are also presented to show how HPC techniques can help us be well prepared to meet the requirements of power system computing in a clean energy future.

TI Novel Approach to FDSOI Threshold Voltage Model Validated at Cryogenic
   Temperatures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The paper presents a novel approach to the modeling of the back-gate dependence of the threshold voltage of Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) MOSFETs down to cryogenic temperatures by using slope factors with a gate coupling effect. The FDSOI technology is well-known for its capability to modulate the threshold voltage efficiently by the back-gate voltage. The proposed model analytically demonstrates the threshold voltage as a function of the back-gate voltage without the pre-defined threshold condition, and it requires only a calibration point, i.e., a threshold voltage with the corresponding back-gate voltage, front- and back-gate slope factors, and work functions of front and back gates. The model has been validated over a wide range of the back-gate voltages at room temperature and down to 3 K. It is suitable for optimizing low-power circuits at cryogenic temperatures for quantum computing applications.

TI Quantum neural network empowered spectral efficiency analysis in
   IRS-assisted communication systems
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The rapid increase in data consumption by mobile users has created a demand for innovative architectures to address this growing need. Concurrently, classical neural network-based intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have gained traction in 6G networks due to their capacity to enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, relying solely on classical computing for SE calculations imposes limitations on computational rates, stemming from the exponential increase in complexity. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) to improve the SE of communication systems facilitated by IRS configurations. To optimize IRS phase shifts, we first apply singular value decomposition to the received IRS-optimized data. The resulting information is then incorporated into the quantum data and subsequently processed by the parameterized quantum circuit. A dense layer is introduced after the proposed model to boost training performance. The proposed QCNN model demonstrates a significant enhancement in SE while maintaining lower complexity, leveraging the capabilities of qubits in the current era of quantum computing.

TI How Well Can Quantum Embedding Method Predict the Reaction Profiles for
   Hydrogenation of Small Li Clusters?
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics in novel ways to tackle complex chemistry problems that cannot be accurately addressed using traditional quantum chemistry methods. However, the high computational cost and available number of physical qubits with high fidelity limit its application to small chemical systems. This work employed a quantum-classical framework which features a quantum active space-embedding approach to perform simulations of chemical reactions that require up to 14 qubits. This framework was applied to prototypical example metal hydrogenation reactions: the coupling between hydrogen and Li2, Li3, and Li4 clusters. Particular attention was paid to the computation of barriers and reaction energies. The predicted reaction profiles compare well with advanced classical quantum chemistry methods, demonstrating the potential of the quantum embedding algorithm to map out reaction profiles of realistic gas-phase chemical reactions to ascertain qualitative energetic trends. Additionally, the predicted potential energy curves provide a benchmark to compare against both current and future quantum embedding approaches.

TI Going beyond gadgets: the importance of scalability for analogue quantum
   simulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum hardware has the potential to efficiently solve computationally difficult problems in physics and chemistry to reap enormous practical rewards. Analogue quantum simulation accomplishes this by using the dynamics of a controlled many-body system to mimic those of another system; such a method is feasible on near-term devices. We show that previous theoretical approaches to analogue quantum simulation suffer from fundamental barriers which prohibit scalable experimental implementation. By introducing a new mathematical framework and going beyond the usual toolbox of Hamiltonian complexity theory with an additional resource of engineered dissipation, we show that these barriers can be overcome. This provides a powerful new perspective for the rigorous study of analogue quantum simulators.
   Analogue quantum simulation has looser experimental requirements than its digital counterpart, but rigorous theoretical results on the capabilities of realisable experiments are scarce. Here, the authors fill this gap by proposing an alternative mathematical framework, and showing how to overcome barriers to scalable implementations using additional resources such as engineered dissipation.

TI Planar scanning probe microscopy enables vector magnetic field imaging
   at the nanoscale
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Planar scanning probe microscopy is a recently emerging alternative approach to tip-based scanning probe imaging. It can scan an extended planar sensor, such as a polished bulk diamond doped with magnetic-field-sensitive nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, in nanometer-scale proximity of a planar sample. So far, this technique has been limited to optical near-field microscopy and has required nanofabrication of the sample of interest. Here we extend this technique to magnetometry using NV centers and present a modification that removes the need for sample-side nanofabrication. We harness this new ability to perform a hitherto infeasible measurement- direct imaging of the three-dimensional vector magnetic field of magnetic vortices in a thin film magnetic heterostructure, based on repeated scanning with NV centers with different orientations within the same scanning probe. Our result opens the door to quantum sensing using multiple qubits within the same scanning probe, a prerequisite for the use of entanglement-enhanced and massively parallel schemes.

TI Many-body quantum chaos and space-time translational invariance
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Getting a grip on the chaotic properties of quantum systems is difficult. Now, the effect of translational invariance in space in time in an ensemble of random quantum circuits is shown to lead to largely universal scaling laws describing the system without the need of knowing microscopic details.
   We study the consequences of having translational invariance in space and time in many-body quantum chaotic systems. We consider ensembles of random quantum circuits as minimal models of translational invariant many-body quantum chaotic systems. We evaluate the spectral form factor as a sum over many-body Feynman diagrams in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension q. At sufficiently large t, diagrams corresponding to rigid translations dominate, reproducing the random matrix theory (RMT) behaviour. At finite t, we show that translational invariance introduces additional mechanisms via two novel Feynman diagrams which delay the emergence of RMT. Our analytics suggests the existence of exact scaling forms which describe the approach to RMT behavior in the scaling limit where both t and L are large while the ratio between L and L-Th(t), the many-body Thouless length, is fixed. We numerically demonstrate, with simulations of two distinct circuit models, that the resulting scaling functions are universal in the scaling limit.

AB The recent discovery of spin-exciton and magnon-exciton coupling in a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, CrSBr, is both fundamentally intriguing and technologically significant. This discovery unveils a unique capability to optically access and manipulate spin information using excitons, opening doors to applications in quantum interconnects, quantum photonics, and opto-spintronics. Despite their remarkable potential, materials exhibiting spin-exciton and magnon-exciton coupling remain limited. To broaden the library of such materials, we explore key parameters for achieving and tuning spin-exciton and magnon-exciton couplings. We begin by examining the mechanisms of couplings in CrSBr and drawing comparisons with other recently identified two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Furthermore, we propose various promising scenarios for spin-exciton coupling, laying the groundwork for future research endeavors.

TI Minimal two-body quantum absorption refrigerator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the phenomenon of absorption refrigeration, where refrigeration is achieved by heating instead of work, in two different setups: a minimal set up based on coupled qubits and two nonlinearly coupled resonators. Considering ZZ interaction between the two qubits, we outline the basic ingredients required to achieve cooling. Using local as well as global master equations, we observe that inclusion of an XX type term in the qubit-qubit coupling is detrimental to cooling. We compare the cooling effect obtained in the qubit case with that of nonlinearly coupled resonators (multilevel system) where the ZZ interaction translates to a Kerr-type nonlinearity. For small to intermediate strengths of nonlinearity, we observe that multilevel quantum systems, for example qutrits, give better cooling effect compared to the qubits. Using Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we go beyond first order sequential tunneling processes and study the effect of higher order processes on refrigeration. We find a reduced cooling effect compared to the master equation calculations.

TI Enhanced quantum phase estimation with q-deformed nonideal
   nonclassical light
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB q-deformed photon states arise from generalized oscillator algebras in which the standard bosonic commutation relations are modified by a deformation parameter q. They effectively model realistic nonideal photon statistics, including deviations such as sub- and super-Poissonian distributions. We investigate quantum phase estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using q-deformed photon states, including q-coherent and q-cat states, which model realistic deviations from ideal light sources. By deriving closed-form photon count likelihoods via the Jordan-Schwinger mapping, we compute the quantum and classical Fisher information and perform Bayesian inference on simulated detector data. Our results show that photon counting remains an optimal measurement strategy even for deformed states, with classical and quantum Fisher information in exact agreement. Furthermore, the phase sensitivity improves with increasing q-deformation, indicating enhanced metrological performance driven by nonclassical photon statistics. These findings highlight the utility of q-deformed states in quantum sensing.

TI Sensing spin wave excitations by spin defects in few-layer-thick
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optically active spin defects in wide bandgap semiconductors serve as a local sensor of multiple degrees of freedom in a variety of "hard" and "soft" condensed matter systems. Taking advantage of the recent progress on quantum sensing using van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials, here we report direct measurements of spin waves excited in magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) by boron vacancy V B - spin defects contained in few-layer-thick hexagonal boron nitride nanoflakes. We show that the ferromagnetic resonance and parametric spin excitations can be effectively detected by V B - spin defects under various experimental conditions through optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. The off-resonant dipole interaction between YIG magnons and V B - spin defects is mediated by multi-magnon scattering processes, which may find relevant applications in a range of emerging quantum sensing, computing, and metrology technologies. Our results also highlight the opportunities offered by quantum spin defects in layered two-dimensional vdW materials for investigating local spin dynamic behaviors in magnetic solid-state matters.

TI A Low-Insertion Loss Cryogenic Edge-Mode Isolator With 18 GHz Bandwidth
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF MICROWAVES
AB Cryogenic isolators play an important role in low-noise receiver systems widely employed in millimeter and submillimeter telescopes. To enable a significantly wider Intermediate Frequency (IF) band-width, there is strong demand for a wideband, low-loss isolator in modern facilities like the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In this article, we present a novel cryogenic edge-mode isolator that incorporates an innovative circuit design. Operating at a cryogenic temperature of 4 K, this isolator delivers unprecedented performance, covering a frequency range from 4 GHz to 22 GHz. It exhibits insertion loss of less than 1 dB, together with return loss below-15 dB. In particular, it provides an isolation better than 17 dB across most of the band, a significant improvement over the previous generation of edge-mode isolators. This new isolator design is suitable for a wide array of low-noise receiver applications, from radio-astronomy to quantum computing.

TI Sculpting harmonic comb states in terahertz quantum cascade lasers by
   controlled engineering
SO OPTICA
AB Optical frequency combs (OFCs), which establish a rigid phase -coherent link between the microwave and optical domains of the electromagnetic spectrum, are emerging as key high -precision tools for the development of quantum technology platforms. These include potential applications for communication, computation, information, sensing, and metrology and can extend from the near -infrared with micro -resonator combs, up to the technologically attractive terahertz (THz) frequency range, with powerful and miniaturized quantum cascade laser (QCL) FCs. The recently discovered ability of the QCLs to produce a harmonic frequency comb (HFC)-a FC with large intermodal spacings-has attracted new interest in these devices for both applications and fundamental physics, particularly for the generation of THz tones of high spectral purity for high data rate wireless communication networks, for radio frequency arbitrary waveform synthesis, and for the development of quantum key distributions. The controlled generation of harmonic states of a specific order remains, however, elusive in THz QCLs. Here, and by design, we devise a strategy to obtain broadband HFC emission of a pre -defined order in a QCL. By patterning n regularly spaced defects on the top surface of a double -metal Fabry-Perot QCL, we demonstrate harmonic comb emission with modes spaced by an ( n + 1) free spectral range and with an optical power/mode of similar to 270 mu W.

TI Microwave signatures of topological superconductivity in planar
   Josephson junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity, which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the half-slope feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.

TI Superconductive Coupling Effects in Selectively Grown Topological
   Insulator-Based Three-Terminal Junctions
SO ACS NANO
AB The combination of an ordinary s-type superconductor with three-dimensional topological insulators creates a promising platform for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing circuits based on Majorana braiding. The backbone of the braiding mechanism are three-terminal Josephson junctions. It is crucial to understand the transport in these devices for further use in quantum computing applications. We present low-temperature measurements of topological insulator-based three-terminal Josephson junctions fabricated by a combination of selective-area growth of Bi0.8Sb1.2Te3 and shadow mask evaporation of Nb. This approach allows for the in situ fabrication of Josephson junctions with an exceptional interface quality, important for the study of the proximity-effect. We map out the transport properties of the device as a function of bias currents and prove the coupling of the junctions by the observation of a multiterminal geometry-induced diode effect. We find good agreement of our findings with a resistively and capacitively shunted junction network model.

AB Optimal join order sequence significantly impacts query execution performance. Because the search space grows exponentially with the number of relations involved in the queries, DP-based approaches can compute optimal plans only for queries with a small number of relations. Many heuristic methods trade off solution quality for computational efficiency. Quantum computing excels at solving combinatorial optimization problems such as join order optimization. However, existing quantum-related methods either focus solely on left-deep join trees-thus narrowing the problem scope-or support bushy join trees but are constrained by quantum hardware and cannot scale to large queries. Importantly, neither branch has been integrated into an actual database system. In this paper, we present a hybrid quantum-classical optimization approach for bushy join trees, integrated within a real database system (PostgreSQL). This approach expands the search space for join order sequences and overcomes previous limitations. Evaluation on the Join Order Benchmark shows that our method can reduce query execution time by up to 92.7% and achieve a 1.42x improvement in end-to-end latency.

TI Cryo-CMOS Voltage References for the Ultrawide Temperature Range From

SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB This article presents a family of sub-1-V, fully-CMOS voltage references adopting MOS devices in weak inversion to achieve continuous operation from room temperature (RT) down to cryogenic temperatures. Their accuracy limitations due to curvature, body effect, and mismatch are investigated and experimentally validated. Implemented in 40-nm CMOS, the references show a line regulation better than 2.7%/V from a supply as low as 0.99 V. By applying dynamic element matching (DEM) techniques, a spread of 1.2% (3 sigma ) from 4.2 to 300 K can be achieved, resulting in a temperature coefficient (TC) of 111 ppm/K. As the first significant statistical characterization extending down to cryogenic temperatures, the results demonstrate the ability of the proposed architectures to work under cryogenic harsh environments, such as space-and quantum-computing applications.

TI Hard-instance learning for quantum adiabatic prime factorization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Prime factorization is a difficult problem with classical computing, whose exponential hardness is the foundation of Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptography. With programable quantum devices, adiabatic quantum computing has been proposed as a plausible approach to solve prime factorization, having promising advantage over classical computing. Here, we find there are certain hard instances that are consistently intractable for both classical simulated annealing and unconfigured adiabatic quantum computing (AQC). Aiming at an automated architecture for optimal configuration of quantum adiabatic factorization, we apply a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method to configure the AQC algorithm. By setting the success probability of the worst-case problem instances as the reward to RL, we show the AQC performance on the hard instances is dramatically improved by RL configuration. The success probability also becomes more evenly distributed over different problem instances, meaning the configured AQC is more stable as compared to the unconfigured case. Through a technique of transfer learning, we find prominent evidence that the framework of AQC configuration is scalable???the configured AQC as trained on five qubits remains working efficiently on nine qubits with a minimal amount of additional training cost.

TI Nuclear spin assisted magnetic field angle sensing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum sensing exploits the strong sensitivity of quantum systems to measure small external signals. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is one of the most promising platforms for real-world quantum sensing applications, predominantly used as a magnetometer. However, its magnetic field sensitivity vanishes when a bias magnetic field acts perpendicular to the NV axis. Here, we introduce a different sensing strategy assisted by the nitrogen nuclear spin that uses the entanglement between the electron and nuclear spins to restore the magnetic field sensitivity. This, in turn, allows us to detect small changes in the magnetic field angle relative to the NV axis. Furthermore, based on the same underlying principle, we show that the NV coupling strength to magnetic noise, and hence its coherence time, exhibits a strong asymmetric angle dependence. This allows us to uncover the directional properties of the local magnetic environment and to realize maximal decoupling from anisotropic noise.

TI Robust Topological Feature against Non-Hermiticity in Jaynes-Cummings
   Model
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM) is a fundamental model and building block for light-matter interactions, quantum information and quantum computation. The present work analytically analyzes the topological feature manifested by the JCM in the presence of non-Hermiticity which may arise from dissipation and decay rates. Indeed, the eigenstates of the JCM are topologically characterized by spin windings in 2D plane. The non-Hermiticity tilts the spin-winding plane and induces an out-of-plane component, while the topological feature is maintained. In particular, besides the invariant spin texture nodes, the study reveals a non-Hermiticity-induced reversal transition of the tilting angle and spin winding direction with a fractional phase gain at gap closing, a partially level-independent reversal transition without gap closing, and a completely level-independent super-invariant point with untilted angle and also without gap closing. The result demonstrates that the topological feature is robust against non-Hermiticity, which may be favorable in practical applications. On the other hand, one may conversely make use of the disadvantageous dissipation and decay rates to reverse the spin winding direction, which may add a controlled way for topological manipulation of quantum systems in light-matter interactions.
   Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM) is fundamental in light-matter interactions. The topological feature manifested by JCM is rigorously shown to be robust against a general non-Hermiticity induced by dissipation and decay rates. The non-Hermiticity only tilts the spin winding plane, while the winding number is preserved. The robustness is favorable for practical applications and the revealed properties useful for designing topological quantum devices. image

TI Critical Phenomena in Light-Matter Systems with Collective Matter

SO ENTROPY
AB We study the quantum phase diagram and the onset of quantum critical phenomena in a generalized Dicke model that includes collective qubit-qubit interactions. By employing semiclassical techniques, we analyze the corresponding classical energy surfaces, fixed points, and the smooth Density of States as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters to determine quantum phase transitions in either the ground (QPT) or excited states (ESQPT). We unveil a rich phase diagram, the presence of new phases, and new transitions that result from varying the strength of the qubits interactions in independent canonical directions. We also find a correspondence between the phases emerging due to qubit interactions and those in their absence but with varying the strength of the non-resonant terms in the light-matter coupling. We expect our work to pave the way and stimulate the exploration of quantum criticality in systems combining matter-matter and light-matter interactions.

TI Enhanced predictive capability for chaotic dynamics by modified quantum
   reservoir computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Deducing the states of spatiotemporally chaotic systems (SCSs) as they evolve in time is crucial for various applications. However, generally achieving this is a dramatic challenge due to the complexity of nonperiodic dynamics and the hardness of obtaining robust solutions. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in approaching the problem using both classical and quantum machine learning methods. Although effective for predicting SCSs within a relatively short time, the current schemes are not capable of providing robust solutions for longer times than the training time. Here we propose an approach for advancing the prediction of chaotic behavior. Our approach can be viewed as a unique quantum reservoir computing scheme, which can simultaneously capture the linear and the nonlinear features of input data and evolve under a modified Hamiltonian. Our work presents an alternative approach to handling SCSs.

TI Magnetic Imaging of Ferric Oxide Via Scanning Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Microscopy (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have important applications in quantum sensing and precision measurement owing to their unique photoluminescence and electron spin resonance properties. Through the integration of NV color centers as quantum sensors at the probe tip coupled with the combination of confocal and scanning probe technologies, this study designs a scanning microscopy system based on these centers. This method successfully breaks through the bottleneck of micro magnetic imaging required for detecting magnetic materials. This system was used to perform magnetic imaging of iron oxide samples, revealing their microscopic magnetic domain structure. Based on a comparative analysis with magnetic field microscopy imaging results, the advantages of scanning NV microscopy in microscopic magnetic imaging are demonstrated. Therefore, based on this study, future research can focus on the micro magnetic detection of two-dimensional iron oxide materials and their applications in catalysis and other fields.

TI Differential evolution VQE for crypto-currency arbitrage. Quantum
   optimization with many local minima
SO DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Crypto-currency markets are known to exhibit inefficiencies, which presents opportunities for profitable cyclic transactions or arbitrage, where one currency is traded for another in a way that results in a net gain without incurring any risk. Quantum computing has shown promise in financial applications, particularly in resolving optimization problems like arbitrage. In this paper, we introduce a differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using Qiskit framework. We elucidate the application of crypto-currency arbitrage using different VQE optimizers. Our findings indicate that the proposed DE-based method effectively converges to the optimal solution in scenarios where other commonly used optimizers, such as COBYLA, struggle to find the global minimum. We further test this procedure's feasibility on IBM's real quantum machines up to 127 qubits. With a scenario of three currencies, the algorithm converged in 417 steps over a 12 hour period on the "ibm_geneva" machine. These results suggest the potential to achieve a quantum advantage in solving increasingly complex problems.

TI The Game Theory in Quantum Computers: A Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA AND ARTIFICIAL
   INTELLIGENCE
AB Game theory has been studied extensively in recent centuries as a set of formal mathematical strategies for optimal decision making. This discipline improved its efficiency with the arrival, in the 20th century, of digital computer science. However, the computational limitations related to exponential time type problems in digital processors, triggered the search for more efficient alternatives. One of these choices is quantum computing. Certainly, quantum processors seem to be able to solve some of these complex problems, at least in theory. For this reason, in recent times, many research works have emerged related to the field of quantum game theory. In this paper we review the main studies about the subject, including operational requirements and implementation details. In addition, we describe various quantum games, their design strategy, and the used supporting tools. We also present the still open debate linked to the interpretation of the transformations of classical algorithms in fundamental game theory to their quantum version, with special attention to the Nash equilibrium.

TI Control, competition and coexistence of effective magnetic orders by
   interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates with high-Q cavities
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Ultracold atomic systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.

TI Quantum framework for reinforcement learning: Integrating the Markov
   decision process, quantum arithmetic, and trajectory search
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov decision process. By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.

TI Influence of an Al2O3 capping layer on the thermal
   reduction of the native niobium oxide: An in situ x-ray reflectivity
   study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Superconducting radio-frequency cavities, critical components of modern particle accelerators and quantum computing hardware, fundamentally rely on the surface properties of niobium. However, native oxide formation and impurity uptake in the near-surface region can degrade superconducting performance and increase radiofrequency losses during operation. In this study, we present a systematic in situ x-ray reflectivity investigation of (110) niobium single-crystal surfaces with and without an atomic layer deposited Al2O3 capping layer under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions up to 650 degrees C. Our results reveal a temperature-dependent reduction of the native niobium oxide layers in both capped and uncapped samples, with similarities in the overall behavior but clear differences in the reduction pathways. The Al2O3 capping layer modifies the reduction process, prevents oxide regrowth upon air exposure, and protects the niobium surface against impurity uptake during thermal treatment. These findings demonstrate that Al2O3 capping is an effective strategy to suppress native oxide formation during thermal cycling, offering clear benefits for the performance and operational lifetime of superconducting radiofrequency cavities and related quantum computing technologies.

TI High-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure with atomically sharp interface

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Germanium is a versatile material for realization of spin and topological quantum computing. Here, we report on the epitaxial growth of an undoped Ge/SiGe heterostructure in which a hole quantum well is formed in the sandwiched Ge layer. The heterostructure is grown on Si (001) via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Atomic force microscopy characterizations display a flat surface with a root mean square roughness of 0.956 nm, and spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy data show a sharp interface with a characteristic length of 0.49 nm. A mobility of up to 1.2 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) was achieved in the SiGe/Ge/SiGe two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG). The low percolation density of 3.70 x 10(10) cm(-2), light effective mass of 0.079 m(0) (where m(0) is the free electron mass), and large effective g-factor of 9.5 were obtained. These results show the potential of MBE-grown Ge 2DHG for semiconductor quantum computing.

TI Asynchronous Quantum-Resistant Blockchain for Secure Intelligence
   Sharing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB By aggregating intelligence on emerging threats, attack techniques, and vulnerabilities, organizations can establish a more comprehensive threat landscape awareness and proactively identify potential risks. However, in the process of sharing threat intelligence, companies often hesitate due to concerns over information leakage, which reduces their willingness to collaborate. Furthermore, the lack of transparency and credibility in intelligence sources has negatively impacted the quality and trustworthiness of shared data. To address these issues, authors aim to leverage blockchain technology, utilizing its decentralized and tamper-proof properties to ensure corporate privacy and the reliability of intelligence sources. Additionally, a dual blockchain architecture is implemented to enhance operational efficiency and reduce storage burdens. However, with the advent of large-scale quantum computing, traditional cryptographic mechanisms used in blockchain systems face potential vulnerabilities due to Shor's algorithm, which threatens widely adopted public key cryptographic schemes. To ensure long-term security and resilience in a quantum-enabled threat landscape, quantum-resistant cryptographic technologies, including SPHINCS+ and CRYSTALS-KYBER, are integrated to facilitate quantum-safe migration in blockchain applications, ensuring system security and resilience in future environments of quantum computing.

   focus on quantum-resistant cryptography
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB The integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) represents a novel approach to enhancing cryptographic methods, particularly in addressing challenges posed by quantum computing and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This research focuses on improving encryption strength, adaptability, and robustness against decryption attempts. By leveraging the optimization capabilities of GAs to evolve neural network architectures within a GAN framework, we significantly enhance the generator's ability to produce secure, quantum-resistant encryptions. The genetic algorithm optimized both the generator and discriminator networks over 300 generations, reducing generator loss from an initial 0.78 to a stable 0.65, while increasing discriminator loss, indicating improved encryption complexity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using evolutionary techniques and adversarial training to create a dynamic, self-evolving cryptographic system, providing a foundation for future cryptographic innovations in quantum-resistant security. The methodology combines GA-driven network optimization and GAN-based adversarial training to address the challenges of quantum decryption and advanced adversarial attacks, setting new benchmarks for cryptographic security.

TI Quantum double aspects of surface code models

AB We revisit the Kitaev model for fault tolerant quantum computing on a square lattice with underlying quantum double D(G) symmetry, where G is a finite group. We provide projection operators for its quasiparticles content as irreducible representations of D(G) and combine this with D(G)-bimodule properties of open ribbon excitation spaces L(s(0), s(1)) to show how open ribbons can be used to teleport information between their endpoints s(0), s(1). We give a self-contained account that builds on earlier work but emphasizes applications to quantum computing as surface code theory, including gates on D(S-3). We show how the theory reduces to a simpler theory for toric codes in the case of D(Z(n)) congruent to CZ(n)(n) , including toric ribbon operators and their braiding. In the other direction, we show how our constructions generalize to D(H) models based on a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H, including site actions of D(H) and partial results on ribbon equivariance even when the Hopf algebra is not semisimple.

AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely, the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by nondestructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.

TI Infrared single-photon detection with superconducting magic-angle

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The moire superconductor magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) shows exceptional properties, with an electron (hole) ensemble of only similar to 10(11) carriers per square centimeter, which is five orders of magnitude lower than traditional superconductors (SCs). This results in an ultralow electronic heat capacity and a large kinetic inductance of this truly two-dimensional SC, providing record-breaking parameters for quantum sensing applications, specifically thermal sensing and single-photon detection. To fully exploit these unique superconducting properties for quantum sensing, here, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment to detect single near-infrared photons by voltage biasing an MATBG device near its superconducting phase transition. We observe complete destruction of the SC state upon absorption of a single infrared photon even in a 16-square micrometer device, showcasing exceptional sensitivity. Our work offers insights into the MATBG-photon interaction and demonstrates pathways to use moire superconductors as an exciting platform for revolutionary quantum devices and sensors.

TI Path integrals, complex probabilities and the discrete Weyl
   representation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A discrete formulation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a functional of paths with respect to a complex probability on a sample space of discrete valued paths is explored. The formulation in terms of complex probabilities is motivated by a recent reinterpretation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a potential functional with respect to a complex probability distribution on cylinder sets of paths. The discrete formulation in this work is based on a discrete version of the Weyl algebra that can be applied to any observable with a finite number of outcomes. The origin of the complex probability in this work is the completeness relation. In the discrete formulation the complex probability exactly factors into products of conditional probabilities and exact unitarity is maintained at each level of approximation. The approximation of infinite dimensional quantum systems by discrete systems is discussed. The method is illustrated by applying it to scattering theory and quantum field theory. The implications of these applications for quantum computing is discussed.

TI Acoustic metamaterials for realizing a scalable multiple phi-bit unitary
   transformation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The analogy between acoustic modes in nonlinear metamaterials and quantum computing platforms constituted of correlated two-level systems opens new frontiers in information science. We use an inductive procedure to demonstrate scalable initialization of and scalable unitary transformations on superpositions of states of multiple correlated logical phi-bits, classical nonlinear acoustic analog of qubits. A multiple phi-bit state representation as a complex vector in a high-dimensional, exponentially scaling Hilbert space is shown to correspond with the state of logical phi-bits represented in a low-dimensional linearly scaling physical space of an externally driven acoustic metamaterial. Manipulation of the phi-bits in the physical space enables the implementation of a non-trivial multiple phi-bit unitary transformation that scales exponentially. This scalable transformation operates in parallel on the components of the multiple phi-bit complex state vector, requiring only a single physical action on the metamaterial. This work demonstrates that acoustic metamaterials offer a viable path toward achieving massively parallel information processing capabilities that can challenge current quantum computing paradigms.

TI LACT plus : Practical Post-Quantum Scalable Confidential Transactions
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB A "confidential monetary value" carries information about the real monetary value but does not disclose it. Post-quantum private blockchains with confidential monetary values-large-sized blockchains with large verification times-have the least scalability because they need to save and verify more information than those with "plain-text monetary values". High scalability is an essential security requirement for decentralized blockchain payment systems because the more honest peers who can afford to verify the blockchain copies are, the higher the security. We propose a quantum-safe transaction protocol for confidential monetary blockchains, LACT+ (Lattice-based Aggregable Confidential Transactions), which is more scalable than previous post-quantum confidential blockchains, i.e., many input/output transactions with logarithmic sized complexity.

AB The search for new physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the central problems of current high energy physics interest. As the luminosities of current and near-future colliders continue to increase, the search for new physics has increased the requirements for processing large amounts of data. Meanwhile, quantum computing which is rapidly evolving, has great potential to become a powerful tool to help search for new physics signals. Since the k-means algorithm is known to be able to be accelerated with the help of quantum computing, we investigate and propose an event selection strategy based on k-means algorithm to search for new physics signals. Taking the case of tri-photon processes at the muon colliders as an example, the event selection strategy is shown to be effective in helping to search for the signals of dimension-8 operators contributing to anomalous quartic gauge couplings. Compared with traditional event selection strategy, the expected constraints are generally tighter.

TI Quantum Inspired Task Optimization for IoT Edge Fog Computing
   Environment
SO MATHEMATICS
AB IoT-Edge-Fog Computing presents a trio-logical model for decentralized computing in a time-sensitive manner. However, to address the rising need for real-time information processing and decision modeling, task allocation among dispersed Edge Computing nodes has been a major challenge. State-of-the-art task allocation techniques such as Min-Max, Minimum Completion time, and Round Robin perform task allocation, butv several limitations persist including large energy consumption, delay, and error rate. Henceforth, the current work provides a Quantum Computing-inspired optimization technique for efficient task allocation in an Edge Computing environment for real-time IoT applications. Furthermore, the QC-Neural Network Model is employed for predicting optimal computing nodes for delivering real-time services. To acquire the performance enhancement, simulations were performed by employing 6, 10, 14, and 20 Edge nodes at different times to schedule more than 600 heterogeneous tasks. Empirical results show that an average improvement of 5.02% was registered for prediction efficiency. Similarly, the error reduction of 2.03% was acquired in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

TI Enhancing IoT security in smart grids with quantum-resistant hybrid
   encryption
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart grids has revolutionized the energy sector, enabling real-time data collection and efficient energy distribution. However, this integration also introduces significant security challenges, particularly data encryption. Traditional encryption algorithms used in IoT are vulnerable to various attacks, and the advent of quantum computing exacerbates these vulnerabilities. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel encryption mechanism, the Quantum-Resistant Hybrid Encryption for IoT (QRHE-IoT), designed to enhance the security of communications in IoT-enabled smart grids. QRHE-IoT combines the strengths of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms and incorporates quantum-resistant algorithms to provide robust security. This paper explains the QRHE-IoT mechanism, its theoretical basis, and how it addresses the security challenges in smart grid communications. It also presents the results of tests conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of QRHE-IoT in a simulated smart grid environment. The proposed QRHE-IoT mechanism presents a promising solution to these challenges, offering robust security for smart grid communications in the face of emerging threats, including quantum computing.

TI Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Approach for Incorporating
   Solvency Capital into Portfolio Optimization
SO RISKS
AB In this paper, we consider the inclusion of the solvency capital requirement (SCR) into portfolio optimization by the use of a quadratic proxy model. The Solvency II directive requires insurance companies to calculate their SCR based on the complete loss distribution for the upcoming year. Since this task is, in general, computationally challenging for insurance companies (and therefore, not taken into account during portfolio optimization), employing more feasible proxy models provides a potential solution to this computational difficulty. Here, we present an approach that is also suitable for future applications in quantum computing. We analyze the approximability of the solvency capital ratio in a quadratic form using machine learning techniques. This allows for an easier consideration of the SCR in the classical mean-variance analysis. In addition, it allows the problem to be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which benefits from the potential speedup of quantum computing. We provide a detailed description of our model and the translation into a QUBO. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our approach through experimental studies.

TI Quantum support vector machine for multi classification
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Classical machine learning algorithms seem to be totally incapable of processing tremendous data, while quantum machine learning algorithms could deal with big data unhurriedly and provide exponential acceleration over classical counterparts. In this paper, we propose two quantum support vector machine algorithms for multi classification. One is the quantum version of the directed acyclic graph support vector machine. The other one is to use the Grover search algorithm before measurement, which amplifies the amplitude of the phase storing of the classification result. For k classification, the former provides quadratic reduction in computational complexity when classifying. The latter accelerates the training speed significantly and more importantly, the classification result can be read out with a probability of at least 50% using only one measurement. We conduct numerical simulations on two algorithms, and their classification success rates are 96% and 88.7%, respectively.

TI Entanglement theory with limited computational resources
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The precise quantification of the limits to manipulating quantum resources lies at the core of quantum information theory. However, standard information-theoretic analyses do not consider the actual computational complexity involved in performing certain tasks. Here we address this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, finding that accounting for computational efficiency substantially changes what can be achieved using entangled resources. We consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost. These measures quantify the optimal rates of entangled bits that can be extracted from or used to dilute many identical copies of n-qubit bipartite pure states, using computationally efficient local operations and classical communication. We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures diverge considerably from their information-theoretic counterparts. Whereas the information-theoretic distillable entanglement is determined by the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state, we show that the min-entropy governs the computationally efficient setting. On the other hand, computationally efficient entanglement dilution requires maximal consumption of entangled bits, even for nearly unentangled states. Furthermore, in the worst-case scenario, even when an efficient description of the state exists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic protocols. Our findings establish sample-complexity bounds for measuring and testing the von Neumann entropy, fundamental limitations on efficient state compression and efficient local tomography protocols.

TI Quantum reservoir computing in atomic lattices
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) exploits the dynamical properties of quantum systems to perform machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that optimal performance in QRC can be achieved without relying on disordered systems. Systems with all-to-all topologies and random couplings are generally considered to minimize redundancies and enhance performance. In contrast, our work investigates the one-dimensional Bose- Hubbard model with homogeneous couplings, where a chaotic phase arises from the interplay between coupling and interaction terms. Interestingly, we find that performance in different tasks can be enhanced either in the chaotic regime or in the weak interaction limit. Our findings challenge conventional design principles and indicate the potential for simpler and more efficient QRC implementations tailored to specific tasks in Bose-Hubbard lattices.

AB We present a new post-quantum Public Key Encryption scheme (PKE) named Supersingular Isogeny Lollipop Based Encryption or SILBE. SILBE is obtained by leveraging the generalised lollipop attack of Castryck and Vercauteren on the M-SIDH Key exchange by Fouotsa, Moriya and Petit. Doing so, we can in fact make SILBE a post-quantum secure Updatable Public Key Encryption scheme (UPKE). SILBE is in fact the first isogeny-based UPKE which is not based on group actions. Hence, SILBE overcomes the limitations highlighted by Eaton, Jao, Komlo and Mokrani at SAC'21 regarding the design of an SIDH-style UPKE. This is possible by leveraging both the Deuring Correspondence and Kani's Lemma, two central concepts in Isogeny-Based Cryptography.

TI Transfer of quantum-enhanced information through a many-body system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single-qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multiqubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.

TI Controllable single-spin evolution at subharmonics of electric dipole
   spin resonance enhanced by four-level Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana
   interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Subharmonics of electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) mediated by Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana tunneling transitions are studied numerically and analytically in a Zeeman-split four-level system with strong spin-orbit coupling that can be realized, for example, in a GaAs-based double quantum dot in a single-hole regime. The spin qubit is formed in one of the dots and the second dot is used as an auxiliary element to enhance functionality of the spin qubit. In particular, it is found that the spin rotation rate can be essentially enhanced due to the tunnel coupling with the auxiliary dot on both the main EDSR frequency and at its high subharmonics allowing the coherent spin it rotations on a 10-ns timescale. Spin manipulation on high subharmonics is promising for new time-efficient schemes of the spin control and readout in qubit devices operating at high magnetic fields where the main harmonic is inaccessible due to hardware limitations.

TI Partial transpose moments, principal minors and entanglement detection
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently, it has been shown that locally randomized measurements can be employed to get partial transpose moments of a density matrix (Elben et al. in Phys Rev Lett 125:200501, 2020). Consequently, two general entanglement detection methods were proposed based on partial transpose moments of a density matrix (Yu et al. in Phys Rev Lett 127:060504, 2021). In this context, a natural question arises that how partial transpose moments are related with entanglement and with well known idea of principal minors. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that for qubit-qubit quantum systems, partial transpose moments can be expressed as simple functions of principal minors. We expect this relation to exist for every bipartite quantum systems. In addition, we have extended the idea of PT-moments for tripartite qubit systems and have shown that PT-moments can only detect the whole range of being NPT for GHZ and W states mixed with white noise.

TI Quantum beetle antennae search: a novel technique for the constrained
   portfolio optimization problem
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In this paper, we have formulated quantum beetle antennae search (QBAS), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, and a variant of beetle antennae search (BAS). We apply it to portfolio selection, a well-known finance problem. Quantum computing is gaining immense popularity among the scientific community as it outsmarts the conventional computing in efficiency and speed. All the traditional computing algorithms are not directly compatible with quantum computers, for that we need to formulate their variants using the principles of quantum mechanics. In the portfolio optimization problem, we need to find the set of optimal stock such that it minimizes the risk factor and maximizes the mean-return of the portfolio. To the best of our knowledge, no quantum meta-heuristic algorithm has been applied to address this problem yet. We apply QBAS on real-world stock market data and compare the results with other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The results obtained show that the QBAS outperforms swarm algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA).

TI Quantum nonlinear dimensionality reduction based on maximum variance
   unfolding
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Maximum variance unfolding is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm based on the local equidistance of manifolds. However, it is quite computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. Therefore, an efficient quantum maximum variance unfolding algorithm is proposed herein. First, we propose a quantum matrix square root algorithm with exponential speedup, which can be used to obtain the square root of the involved matrix. As a result, we can efficiently obtain the density operator of the Laplacian matrix. Then, a complete quantum dimensionality reduction algorithm is proposed to map the original high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional data space using Hamiltonian simulation and phase estimation. Finally, our research reveals that compared with its classical counterpart, the proposed quantum dimensionality reduction algorithm achieves an exponential speedup in terms of dimension and a polynomial speedup in terms of number of samples.

AB Controllable single-photon routing plays an important role in quantum networks. We investigate single-photon scattering in two one-dimensional (1D) waveguides by a three-level emitter with a cascade configuration, which is a dipole coupled to an extra cavity. The tunneling path for the transmission of a single photon is switched by whether the extra cavity contains photons. For the setup, the Autler-Townes splitting is modulated by the extra cavity, in which the transmission valley (reflection range) width is tunable in terms of the number of photons in the extra cavity. Our investigation will be beneficial to single-photon routing in quantum networks using quantifiable photon numbers in an extra cavity.

TI Massive-mode polarization entangled biphoton frequency comb
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A frequency-multiplexed entangled photon pair and a high-dimensional hyperentangled photon pair are useful to realize a high-capacity quantum communication. A biphoton frequency comb (BFC) with entanglement can be used to prepare both states. We demonstrate polarization entangled BFCs with over 1400 frequency modes, which is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than those of earlier entangled BFCs, by placing a singly resonant periodically poled LiNbO3 waveguide resonator within a Sagnac loop. The BFCs are demonstrated by measuring the joint spectral intensity, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation. Moreover, the polarization entanglement at representative groups of frequency modes is verified by quantum state tomography, where each fidelity is over 0.7. The efficient generation of a massive-mode entangled BFC is expected to accelerate the increase of capacity in quantum communication.

TI Strong coupling of second harmonic generation scattering spectrum in a
   diexcitionic nanosystem
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Diexcitonic strong coupling between quantum emitters and localized surface plasmon has attracted more attention recently because it can provide multiple qubit states for future quantum information technology at room temperature. In a strong coupling regime, nonlinear optical effects can offer new routes for developing quantum devices, but it is rarely reported. In this paper, we established the hybrid system consisting of J-aggregates-WS2-cuboid Au@Ag nanorods, which can realize diexcitonic strong coupling and second harmonic generation (SHG). We find that multimode strong coupling has been achieved not only in the fundamental frequency scattering spectrum but also in the SHG scattering spectrum. SHG scattering spectrum shows three plexciton branches, similar to the splitting in the fundamental frequency scattering spectrum. Furthermore, the SHG scattering spectrum can be modulated by tuning the armchair direction of the crystal lattice, pump polarization direction, and plasmon resonance frequency, which makes our system very promising in the quantum device at room temperature. Moreover, we develop coupled nonlinear harmonic oscillator model theory to explain the nonlinear diexcitonic strong coupling mechanism. The calculated results by the finite element method accord well with our theory. The nonlinear optical properties of the diexcitonic strong coupling can provide potential applications such as quantum manipulation, entanglement, and integrated logic devices.

TI Measuring the Optical Concurrence of Vector Beams with an Atomic-State
   Interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the transmission of vector beams, correlated in their polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, through cold atoms in the presence of a transverse magnetic coupling field. The resulting phasedependent dynamics allow us to imprint the spatially varying polarization of a vector beam onto atomic spin polarizations, thereby establishing a direct link between optical space-polarization correlations and atomic-state interference. We find that the resulting absorption profiles show interference fringes whose modulation strength is given by the squared concurrence of the vector beam, letting us identify optical concurrence from a single absorption image. We expect impact across a diverse range of applications, including spintronics, quantum memories, metrology, and clocks.

TI Hierarchical quantum circuit representations for neural architecture
   search
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum circuit algorithms often require architectural design choices analogous to those made in constructing neural and tensor networks. These tend to be hierarchical, modular and exhibit repeating patterns. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) attempts to automate neural network design through learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We propose a framework for representing quantum circuit architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search space design and architecture search. We use this framework to justify the importance of circuit architecture in quantum machine learning by generating a family of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and evaluating them on a music genre classification dataset, GTZAN. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm to perform Quantum Phase Recognition (QPR) as an example of architecture search with our representation. Finally, we implement the framework as an open-source Python package to enable dynamic circuit creation and facilitate circuit search space design for NAS.

TI A general learning scheme for classical and quantum Ising machines
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB An Ising machine is any hardware specifically designed for finding the ground state of the Ising model. Relevant examples are coherent Ising machines and quantum annealers. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model that is based on the Ising structure and can be efficiently trained using gradient descent. We provide a mathematical characterization of the training process, which is based upon optimizing a loss function whose partial derivatives are not explicitly calculated but estimated by the Ising machine itself. Moreover, we present some experimental results on the training and execution of the proposed learning model. These results point out new possibilities offered by Ising machines for different learning tasks. In particular, in the quantum realm, the quantum resources are used for both the execution and the training of the model, providing a promising perspective in quantum machine learning.

Soil analysis at scale with the use of Earth observation satellites coupled with on-board and on-the-ground artificial intelligence algorithms offers actionable items that may be exploited by practitioners to optimize their operations, including the fertilization process. Here, bare soil detection is a pivotal step in the processing chain to limit the detailed analysis to the areas of interest. In this paper, we tackle this task with quantum-kernel support vector machines and verify the utility of quantum machine learning in practical Earth observation. Our experimental study, performed over a real-world hyperspectral scene, indicates that the proposed quantum-kernel models are competitive with well-established classical support vector machines, as well as with approaches based on thresholding spectral indices that are widely exploited in the field.

TI Certificateless multi-source signcryption with lattice
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Network coding can improve network transmission performance and reduce data transmission delay. However, the nodes in network are vulnerable to pollution attacks. Previous network coding schemes are based on difficult problems in number theory and cannot resist the quantum computing attacks. Hence, certificateless multi-source signcryption with lattice (LCL-MSSC) is devised for network coding, it uses common public key to verify the combination ciphertext from different source node users. Based on learning with errors and inhomogeneous small integer solution problems, LCL-MSSC is unforgeable under the adaptive chosen-message attacks and indistinguishable under the adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks; in addition, it can resist the pollution attacks and quantum computing attacks. Efficient LCL-MSSC has broad application prospect in UAV wireless communication network, mobile wireless network, wireless sensor network or cyberspace security. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Quantum Propensity in Economics
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper describes an approach to economics that is inspired by quantum computing, and is motivated by the need to develop a consistent quantum mathematical framework for economics. The traditional neoclassical approach assumes that rational utility-optimisers drive market prices to a stable equilibrium, subject to external perturbations or market failures. While this approach has been highly influential, it has come under increasing criticism following the financial crisis of 2007/8. The quantum approach, in contrast, is inherently probabilistic and dynamic. Decision-makers are described, not by a utility function, but by a propensity function which specifies the probability of transacting. We show how a number of cognitive phenomena such as preference reversal and the disjunction effect can be modelled by using a simple quantum circuit to generate an appropriate propensity function. Conversely, a general propensity function can be quantized, via an entropic force, to incorporate effects such as interference and entanglement that characterise human decision-making. Applications to some common problems and topics in economics and finance, including the use of quantum artificial intelligence, are discussed.

CubeSat type satellites require less resources to develop and deploy and can be used to rapidly qualify technologies in orbit. The constraints of small satellites drive the development of compact quantum light sources, which will be useful even if the final satellite volume is large due to transmitter aperture requirements. In this article, we discuss the state-of-the-art in compact entangled photon-pair sources and suggest challenges that must be met by new source designs. (C) 2022 Author(s)

TI Probing the Evolution of the Electron Spin Wave Function of the
   Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond via Pressure Tuning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Understanding the profile of a qubit's wave function is key to its quantum applications. Unlike conduct-ing systems, where a scanning tunneling microscope can be used to probe the electron distribution, there is no direct method for solid-state-defect-based qubits in wide-band-gap semiconductors. In this work, we use pressure as a tuning method and a nuclear spin as an atomic scale probe to monitor the hyperfine structure of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (N -V) centers in diamonds under pressure. We present a detailed study on the nearest-neighbor 13C hyperfine splitting in the optically detected magnetic reso-nance spectrum of N -V centers at different pressures. By examining the 13C hyperfine interaction upon pressurizing, we show that the N -V hyperfine parameters have prominent changes, resulting in an increase in the N -V electron spin density and rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 bonds. The ab initio calculations of strain dependence of the N -V center's hyperfine levels are done independently. The theoretical results qualitatively agree well with experimental data without introducing any fitting parameters. Furthermore, this method can be adopted to probe the evolution of wave function in other defect systems. This potential capability could play a role in developing magnetometry and quantum information processing using the defect centers.

TI MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS WITH UNKNOWN COEFFICIENTS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB We introduce a novel class of equations defined over Euclidean domains. These abstract equations establish a unified framework for deriving new, concrete computational problems useful for cryptography. We prove that solving a single such equation is NP-hard. For systems of these equations, we further prove NP-hardness, average-case hardness, random self-reducibility, search-to-decision reducibility, and trapdoorizability. Based on the hardness of solving these systems, we construct various cryptographic primitives. Our results are proved in an abstract, domain-agnostic manner and hold for a wide range of Euclidean domains. This generality allows the framework to accommo date rich mathematical structures, providing both theoretical depth and flexibility for diverse cryptographic applications.

Specifically, established optimization strategies, including efficient parameter initialization, residual quantum circuit connections, and systematic quantum architecture exploration, are integrated to mitigate issues such as barren plateaus and error propagation. Moreover, the methodology incorporates current defensive mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Finally, Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is adopted within this framework to facilitate privacypreserving collaborative training across distributed quantum systems.

AB The ability of an eavesdropper to compromise the security of a quantum communication system by changing the angle of the incoming light is well-known. Randomizing the role of the detectors has been proposed to be an efficient countermeasure to this type of attack. Here we show that the proposed countermeasure can be bypassed if the attack is generalized by including more attack variables. Using the experimental data from existing literature, we show how randomization effectively prevents the initial attack but fails to do so when Eve generalizes her attack strategy. Our result and methodology could be used to scrutinize a free-space quantum communication receiver against detector-efficiency-mismatch type attacks.

TI High quality Ge layers for Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures using
   chemical vapor deposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB A great deal of interest is directed nowadays toward the development of innovative technologies in the field of quantum information and quantum computing, with emphasis on obtaining reliable qubits as building blocks. The realization of highly stable, controllable, and accessible hole spin qubits is strongly dependent on the quality of the materials hosting them. Ultraclean germanium/silicon-germanium heterostructures have been predicted and proven to be promising candidates and, due to their large scalability potential, they are opening the door toward the development of realistic and reliable solid state, all-electric, silicon-based quantum computers. In order to obtain ultraclean germanium/silicon-germanium heterostructures in a reverse grading approach, the understanding and control over the growth of Ge virtual substrates and thin films is key. Here we present a detailed study on the growth kinetics, morphology, and crystal quality of Ge thin films grown via chemical vapor deposition by investigating the effects of growth temperature, partial pressure of the precursor gas, and the use of Ar or H2 atmosphere. The presence of carrier gases catalyzes the deposition rate and induces a smoothening on the surfaces of films grown at low temperatures. We investigated the surface roughness and threading dislocation density as a function of deposition temperature, partial pressure, and gas mixture. Ge thin films deposited by diluting GeH4 in Ar or H2 were employed as virtual substrates for the growth of full Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures. Their defect density was analyzed and their electric transport properties were characterized via Hall measurements. Similar results were obtained for both carrier gases used.

TI Coupling Molecular Spin Qubits with 2D Magnets for Coherent Magnon
   Manipulation
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing, and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by titanocene bis(cyclooctatetraenyl) [CpTi(cot)] and vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.

TI Machine learning and time-series decomposition for phase extraction and
   symbol classification in CV-QKD
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The predictability of phase estimation and symbol classification using machine learning (ML) for experimental continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is investigated. ML outperforms standard techniques, with up to 2.3% enhancement in the symbol accuracy, showcasing classical noise impact. The time-series decomposition method upper-bounds the predictable space due to shot noise. Ultimately, a 1 kbits/s secret key rate is achieved at 20 km for a 1.8 pW symbol power.

TI Unambiguous State Discrimination with Intrinsic Coherence
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the discrimination of pure-mixed (quantum filtering) and mixed-mixed states and compare their optimal success probability with the one for discriminating other pairs of pure states superposed by the vectors included in the mixed states. We prove that under the equal-fidelity condition, the pure-pure state discrimination scheme is superior to the pure-mixed (mixed-mixed) one. With respect to quantum filtering, the coherence exists only in one pure state and is detrimental to the state discrimination for lower dimensional systems; while it is the opposite for the mixed-mixed case with symmetrically distributed coherence. Making an extension to infinite-dimensional systems, we find that the coherence which is detrimental to state discrimination may become helpful and vice versa.

TI Single-electron charge sensor self-aligned to a quantum dot array by
   double-gate patterning process
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The high sensitivity of a single electron transistor (SET) is essential to faithfully identify the number of electrons in a quantum dot (QD) towards a silicon-based quantum computer. The sensitivity depends on the critical dimension between the SET and the QD, which is limited by the resolution of the electron beam lithography and the layer-to-layer alignment accuracy. Here, we report integration of an SET charge sensor with a QD array by repeating the self-aligned double-gate patterning processes. This fabrication technique allowed us to place the SET adjacent to the QD array beyond the lithography resolution, enabling sensitive charge sensing. We confirm that our device can detect single electrons in the QD and demonstrate real-time detections of electron tunneling by monitoring the SET current.

TI Adaptive Generalized Measurement for Unambiguous State Discrimination of
   Quaternary Phase-Shift-Keying Coherent States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Generalized quantum measurements identifying nonorthogonal states without ambiguity often play an indispensable role in various quantum applications. For such an unambiguous state-discrimination scenario, we have a finite probability of obtaining inconclusive results and minimizing the probability of inconclusive results is of particular importance. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive generalized measurement that can unambiguously discriminate the quaternary phase-shift-keying coherent states with a near-optimal performance. Our scheme is composed of displacement operations, singlephoton detections and adaptive control of the displacements dependent on a history of photon-detection outcomes. Our experimental results show a clear improvement of both a probability of conclusive results and a ratio of erroneous decision caused by unavoidable experimental imperfections over conventional static generalized measurements.

TI Continuous-time quantum harmonic oscillator state engineering
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The center of mass motion of trapped ions and neutral atoms is suitable for approximation by a time-dependent driven quantum harmonic oscillator whose frequency and driving strength may be controlled with high precision. We show the time evolution for these systems with continuous differentiable time-dependent parameters in terms of the three basic operations provided by its underlying symmetry, rotation, displacement, and squeezing, using a Lie algebraic approach. Our factorization of the dynamics allows for the intuitive construction of protocols for state engineering, for example, creating and removing displacement and squeezing, as well as their combinations, optimizing squeezing, or more complex protocols that work for slow and fast rates of change in the oscillator parameters.

TI Quantum communications in a moderate-to-strong turbulent space
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Since the invention of the laser in the 60s, one of the most fundamental communication channels has been the free-space optical channel. For this type of channel, a number of effects generally need to be considered, including diffraction, refraction, atmospheric extinction, pointing errors and, most importantly, turbulence. Because of all these adverse features, the free-space optical (FSO) channel is more difficult to study than a stable fiber-based link. For the same reasons, only recently it has been possible to establish the ultimate performances achievable in quantum communications via free-space channels, together with practical rates for continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD). Differently from previous literature, mainly focused on the regime of weak turbulence, this work considers the FSO channel in the more challenging regime of moderate-to-strong turbulence, where effects of beam widening and breaking are more important than beam wandering. This regime may occur in long-distance free-space links on the ground, in uplink to high-altitude platform systems (HAPS) and, more interestingly, in downlink from near-horizon satellites. In such a regime we rigorously investigate ultimate limits for quantum communications and show that composable keys can be extracted using CV-QKD.
   As quantum communication networks mature and expand to global scale, free-space links will become increasingly important in bridging the distances involved. The authors provide a model for such links under conditions in which atmospheric turbulence is significant, showing that a finite key rate is possible even in challenging scenarios such as satellite operating at high zenith angle.

TI Enhanced cavity coupling to silicon vacancies in 4H silicon carbide
   using laser irradiation and thermal annealing
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The negatively charged silicon monovacancy V-Si(-) in 4H silicon carbide (SiC) is a spin-active point defect that has the potential to act as a qubit in solid-state quantum information applications. Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) can augment the optical emission of the V-Si(-), yet fine-tuning the defect-cavity interaction remains challenging. We report on two postfabrication processes that result in enhancement of the V1' optical emission from our PCCs, an indication of improved coupling between the cavity and ensemble of silicon vacancies. Below-bandgap irradiation at 785-nm and 532-nm wavelengths carried out at times ranging from a few minutes to several hours results in stable enhancement of emission, believed to result from changing the relative ratio of V-Si(0) ("dark state") to V-Si(-) ("bright state"). The much faster change effected by 532-nm irradiation may result from cooperative charge-state conversion due to proximal defects. Thermal annealing at 100 degrees C, carried out over 20 min, also results in emission enhancements and may be explained by the relatively low-activation energy diffusion of carbon interstitials C-i, subsequently recombining with other defects to create additional V(Si)(-)is. These PCC-enabled experiments reveal insights into defect modifications and interactions within a controlled, designated volume and indicate pathways to improved defect-cavity interactions.

Both the efficiency and performance of this new quantum version of the k-NN algorithm are compared to those of the classical k-NN and another quantum version proposed by Schuld et al. Results show that the efficiency of both quantum algorithms is similar to each other and superior to that of the classical algorithm. On the other hand, the performance of the proposed quantum k-NN algorithm is superior to the one proposed by Schuld et al. and similar to that of the classical k-NN.

TI Optical skyrmions and other topological quasiparticles of light
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Skyrmions are topologically stable quasiparticles that have been predicted and demonstrated in quantum fields, solid-state physics and magnetic materials, but only recently observed in electromagnetic fields. Here we review the recent advances in optical skyrmions within a unified topological framework. Starting from fundamental theories and classification of skyrmionic states, we describe generation and topological control of different kinds of skyrmions in evanescent, structured and spatiotemporal optical fields. We further highlight generalized classes of optical topological quasiparticles beyond skyrmions and outline the emerging applications, future trends and open challenges. A complex vectorial field structure of optical quasiparticles with versatile topological characteristics emerges as an important feature in modern spin optics, imaging, metrology, optical forces, structured light, and topological and quantum technologies.
   Advances in the understanding of optical skyrmions, within a unified topological framework, are reviewed. The field structure of such optical quasiparticles, and their topological characteristics, may be useful for fields ranging from imaging to quantum technologies.

The continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) protocol with dual-threshold/direct detection (DT/DD) receivers is employed. The system performance is analyzed by considering the spreading loss, atmospheric attenuation, and turbulence. Based on the design criteria for the proposed system, we investigate the feasibility of a case study for the Japan QKD network considering the unauthorized receiver attack (URA) and beam-splitting attack (BSA). In addition, we analyze the secret-key rate performance of the proposed system and perform Monte Carlo simulations to verify analytical results.

TI Engineered dissipation to mitigate barren plateaus
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum algorithms represent a powerful approach for solving optimization problems on noisy quantum computers, with a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging from chemistry to machine learning. However, their performances in practical implementations crucially depend on the effectiveness of quantum circuit training, which can be severely limited by phenomena such as barren plateaus. While, in general, dissipation is detrimental for quantum algorithms, and noise itself can actually induce barren plateaus, here we describe how the inclusion of properly engineered Markovian losses after each unitary quantum circuit layer allows for the trainability of quantum models. We identify the required form of the dissipation processes and establish that their optimization is efficient. We benchmark the generality of our proposal in both a synthetic and a practical quantum chemistry example, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential impact across different domains.

TI Enhancing the Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance Signal of Organic
   Molecular Qubits
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB In quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarization through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centers and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called color centers, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarization lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin pi-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarize by shelving triplet M-S = +/- 1 populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of <1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet M-S = 0 sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV center. Our proposal is based upon transition-orbital and group-theoretical analyses of beyond-nearest-neighbor spin-orbit couplings, which are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point toward high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest toward ground-state optically addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings, setting the scene for realizing electron spin qubit gates.

   Remote Electron-Phonon Systems
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The generation of quantum entanglement between phonons in photoirradiated remote electron-phonon systems is numerically studied. Upon excitation by a visible/ultraviolet laser pulse, the entanglement of electrons is immediately generated and that of phonons follows via electron-phonon interactions, i.e., the entanglement generation of phonons is a two-step process. Therefore, it is important to design the temporal properties of incident optical pulses in order to control the entanglement of electrons and/or phonons. These features are revealed by the quantum mutual information and the composite modes derived from the Heisenberg equation of motion. The calculated results also show that the dynamics of the phonon entanglement can be observed by time-resolved spectroscopy on the scattered light.

We extend this class of channels to higher dimensions in a way that is based on the Lie algebra so(d) and su(d). As a result, it retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions. The resulting channel is covariant with respect to the unitary group SU(d). We then modify this channel in a way that can act as a noisy channel on qudits. The resulting modified channel now interpolates between the identity channel and the Werner-Holevo channel, and its covariance is reduced to the subgroup of orthogonal matrices SO(d). We then investigate some of the properties of the resulting two-parameter family of channels, including their Holevo quantity, entanglement-assisted capacity, the zero-capacity region and a possible lower bound for their quantum capacity.

AB Differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution stands as a promising protocol due to its simple implementation, which can be realized with a train of coherent pulses and a passive measurement unit. To implement the DPS protocol, it is crucial to establish security proofs incorporating practical imperfections in users' devices, however, existing security proofs make unrealistic assumptions on the measurement unit using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this paper, we enhance the implementation security of the DPS protocol by incorporating a major imperfection in the measurement unit. Specifically, our proof enables us to use practical beam splitters with a known range of the transmittance rather than the one with exactly 50%, as was assumed in the existing security proofs. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that even with fluctuations of +/- 0.5% in the transmittance from the ideal value, the key rate degrades only by a factor of 0.57. This result highlights the feasibility of the DPS protocol with practical measurement setups.

TI Highly-Polarized Emission Provided by Giant Optical Orientation of
   Exciton Spins in Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Quantum technologic and spintronic applications require reliable material platforms that enable significant and long-living spin polarization of excitations, the ability to manipulate it optically in external fields, and the possibility to implement quantum correlations between spins, i.e., entanglement. Here it is demonstrated that these conditions are met in bulk crystals of lead halide perovskites. A giant optical orientation of 85% of excitons, approaching the ultimate limit of unity, in FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 crystals is reported. The exciton spin orientation is maintained during the exciton lifetime of 55 ps resulting in high circular polarization of the exciton emission. The optical orientation is robust to detuning of the excitation energy up to 0.3 eV above the exciton resonance and remains larger than 20% up to detunings of 0.9 eV. It evidences pure chiral selection rules and suppressed spin relaxation of electrons and holes, even with large kinetic energies. The exciton and electron-hole recombinations are distinguished by means of the spin dynamics detected via coherent spin quantum beats in magnetic field. Further, electron-hole spin correlations are demonstrated through linear polarization beats after circularly polarized excitation. These findings are supported by atomistic calculations. All-in-all, the results establish lead halide perovskite semiconductors as suitable platform for quantum technologies.

   Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communications
SO VEHICLES
AB We provide a practical implementation of a free space optical quantum key distribution (FSO-QKD) system within a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) application developed under the Innovate UK AirQKD project. The FSO-QKD system provides the quantum secure encryption keys that serve as the foundation for secure communications throughout the V2I application to address known concerns over V2I security. This document includes summaries of the quantum key generation process and the deployed V2I technology. Subsequently, a high-level view of the system design, the practical experiment, and its execution are presented. Multiple AirQKD project partners developed technologies ranging from semiconductors and hardware to security protocols and software, to enable the QKD-secured V2I system. The developed technology includes a novel zero-trust security protocol used to protect the V2I communications, ensuring that spoofed V2I messages from a compromised device are not accepted by the system.

TI Valley splitting correlations across a silicon quantum well containing
   germanium
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array, formed in a Si0.972Ge0.028 quantum well, manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100 nm (single gate) and > 1 mu m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.

TI Flux-tunable regimes and supersymmetry in twisted cuprate
   heterostructures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative to each other. In a narrow range of angles close to 45 degrees, the junction exhibits a regime where time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken, and it can be used to encode an inherently protected qubit called flowermon. In this work, we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are integrated in a superconducting quantum interference device circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the magnetic field, and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both charge and flux noise. For larger external fluxes, the interplay between the inherent twisted d-wave nature of the order parameter and the external magnetic flux enables the implementation of different artificial atoms, including a flux-biased protected qubit and a supersymmetric quantum circuit.

TI Hamiltonian learning for 300 trapped ion qubits with long-range
   couplings
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum simulators with hundreds of qubits and engineerable Hamiltonians have the potential to explore quantum many-body models that are intractable for classical computers. However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a prerequisite for any quantitative applications of a quantum simulator, remains an outstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit number and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of a two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We use global manipulations and single-qubit-resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all-coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. We further demonstrate a physically guided learning scheme with the quantum sample complexity independent of system sizes by carefully fitting the anharmonic trap potential. Our work paves the way for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators.

TI Multiplexed Photon Number Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB When a two-level system-a qubit-is used as a probe of a larger system, it naturally leads to answering a single yes-no question about the system state. Here we propose a method where a single qubit is able to extract, not a single, but many bits of information about the photon number of a microwave resonator using continuous measurement. We realize a proof-of-principle experiment by recording the fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit reflecting a frequency comb, thus implementing multiplexed photon counting where the information about each Fock state-from 0 to 8-is simultaneously encoded in independent measurement channels. Direct Wigner tomography of the quantum state of the resonator evidences the backaction of the measurement as well as the optimal information extraction parameters. Our experiment unleashes the full potential of quantum meters by replacing sequential quantum measurements with simultaneous and continuous measurements separated in the frequency domain.

TI Implementing Quantum Walk⁃Based Graph Similarity Algorithm on a
   Programmable Photonic Processor (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Graph similarity measurement is a fundamental task in complex network analysis, widely used in bioinformatics, social network analysis, and telecommunications infrastructure optimization. Classical algorithms for this purpose-particularly those designed to distinguish highly similar graphs such as strongly regular graphs-often face significant limitations. Methods including graph edit distance, spectral techniques, and random walk-based kernels typically exhibit high computational complexity, frequently falling into the NP-hard category, which restricts their scalability to large real-world networks. The inherent symmetry and structural regularity of graphs like strongly regular graphs further challenge classical approaches, leading to inadequate discrimination accuracy. Quantum computing, however, offers a promising alternative by leveraging quantum mechanical principles such as superposition and entanglement to process graph-structured data more efficiently. Specifically, the continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) model has emerged as a powerful tool for graph-theoretic quantum algorithms. In this model, the evolution of a quantum walker on a graph reflects its structural characteristics in ways that classical random walks cannot capture. This work proposes a novel quantum graph similarity algorithm (QGSA) based on CTQW, which achieves polynomial-time complexity while maintaining high effectiveness in distinguishing similar graphs. The algorithm is experimentally validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and its practical feasibility is demonstrated through implementation on a programmable silicon photonic processor. Methods The core of the approach involves using the CTQW model to efficiently compute graph similarity. The process initiates by enriching graph structures through the addition of self-loops-a technique that amplifies local topological features and enhances the algorithm's sensitivity. Subsequently, quantum walk dynamics are simulated based on these modified graphs, producing probability distributions of the quantum walker at each site. The similarity between two graphs is then quantified by calculating the Euclidean distances of their respective probability distributions to a reference distribution derived from an empty graph. This design ensures the algorithm operates in polynomial time, making it a computationally efficient solution for distinguishing even highly similar graph structures. To demonstrate the proposed algorithm, we constructed a programmable quantum processor based on a silicon photonic chip, which serves as a scalable and robust platform for implementing CTQWs. The chip comprises a heralded single-photon source and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer network. Photon pairs are generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1.5-cm spiral-wrapped waveguide, followed by an arrayed waveguide grating that splits the signal and idler photons. Idler photons are directly coupled to a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector as triggers, while signal photons pass through the Mach - Zehnder interferometer network to complete CTQWs. Coincidence detection of signal and idler photons heralds the probability distributions of the quantum walker at each site of the graph. Results and Discussions The proposed QGSA was rigorously evaluated through three key experiments. First, edge-removal tests on Erd & odblac;s-R & eacute;nyi random graphs (ER) and complete graphs demonstrated strong negative correlations (Kendall coefficients ranging from-0.9604 to-0.9937 in Fig.
   2) between similarity scores and the number of removed edges, confirming the algorithm's sensitivity to structural perturbations. Notably, adding self-loops to the graph adjacency matrix significantly enhanced discrimination capability, particularly for complete graphs where the uniform probability distribution of CTQW would otherwise hinder differentiation. Second, comparative tests on the real-world Fingerprint dataset showed that QGSA with self-loops achieved high Pearson coefficients (Fig. 4) with the exponential-complexity graph edit distance (GED) method, outperforming polynomial-time classical algorithms like VEO and DeltaCon in aligning with GED's accuracy while maintaining efficient computation. Third, in distinguishing non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs (e.g., SRG(25, 12,5, 6)), QGSA with self-loops successfully identified graph pairs with similarity scores less than 1, matching GED's performance and surpassing VEO, which failed to differentiate these highly symmetric structures. These results validate QGSA's effectiveness in handling both synthetic and real-world graphs, its scalability via self-loop optimization, and its potential as a polynomial-time alternative to classical exponential-complexity methods. The edge-removal test on the 5-node complete graph was demonstrated on the programmable silicon photonic chip. We configured the chip to run up to 280 CTQW evolutions, with an average fidelity of 0.9878. Conclusions Graph similarity measurement is widely applied in graph-related tasks such as complex network analysis. However, classical algorithms effective in distinguishing extremely similar graphs (e.g., strongly regular graphs) typically exhibit high complexity. In the CTQW model, the evolution of quantum systems reflects graph topological information, enabling the construction of quantum algorithms for numerous graph problems. In this work, we propose a CTQW-based QGSA with polynomial-time complexity. Edge-removal tests on random graphs, algorithm comparisons on real-world datasets, and distinguishability tests on strongly regular graphs all confirm the algorithm's effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been experimentally demonstrated on a programmable silicon photonic chip, with an average fidelity of 0.9878, verifying its feasibility.

AB We report the existence of entangled steady-states in bipartite quantum magnonic systems at elevated temperatures. We consider dissipative dynamics of two magnon modes in a bipartite antiferromagnet, subjected to interaction with a phonon mode and an external rotating magnetic field. To quantify the bipartite magnon-magnon entanglement, we use entanglement negativity and compute its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. We provide evidence that the coupling between magnon and phonon modes is necessary for the entanglement, and that, for any given phonon frequency and magnon-phonon coupling rate, there are always ranges of the magnetic field amplitudes and frequencies for which magnon-magnon entanglement persists at room temperature.

TI Quantum higher-order Fourier analysis and the Clifford hierarchy
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many recent advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of "quantum measures" on linear transformations on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the uniformity norms introduced by Timothy Gowers. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum computation. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the kth level of the Clifford hierarchy. Significance Quantum Fourier analysis is a powerful tool in mathematical physics. Here, we introduce quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis (q-HOFA). We explore some mathematical properties of this theory and show that it provides a way to quantify the complexity of unitary gates in quantum computation. This should provide a natural starting point for a more general study of q-HOFA.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Sperm Motility Algorithm
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Sperm Motility Algorithm (SMA), inspired by the human fertilization process, was proposed by Abdul-Raof and Hezam [1] to solve global optimization problems. Sperm flow obeys the Stokes equation or the Schrodinger equation as its derived equivalent. This paper combines a classical SMA with quantum computation features to propose two novel Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms: The first is called the Quantum Sperm Motility Algorithm (QSMA), and the second is called the Improved Quantum Sperm Motility Algorithm (IQSMA). The IQSMA is based on the characteristics of QSMA and uses an interpolation operator to generate a new solution vector in the search space. The two proposed algorithms are global convergence guaranteed population-based optimization algorithms, which outperform the original SMA in terms of their search-ability and have fewer parameters to control. The two proposed algorithms are tested using thirty-three standard dissimilarities benchmark functions. Performance and optimization results of the QSMA and IQSMA are compared with corresponding results obtained using the original SMA and those obtained from three state-of-the-art metaheuristics algorithms. The algorithms were tested on a series of numerical optimization problems. The results indicate that the two proposed algorithms significantly outperform the other presented algorithms.

TI A Blockchain System Based on Quantum-Resistant Digital Signature
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Blockchain, which has a distributed structure, has been widely used in many areas. Especially in the area of smart cities, blockchain technology shows great potential. The security issues of blockchain affect the construction of smart cities to varying degrees. With the rapid development of quantum computation, elliptic curves cryptosystems used in blockchain are not secure enough. This paper presents a blockchain system based on lattice cipher, which can resist the attack of quantum computation. The most challenge is that the size of public keys and signatures used by lattice cryptosystems is typically very large. As a result, each block in a blockchain can only accommodate a small number of transactions. It will affect the running speed and performance of the blockchain. For overcoming this problem, we proposed a way that we only put the hash values of public keys and signatures on the blockchain and store the complete content of them on an IPFS (interplanetary file system). In this way, the number of bytes occupied by each transaction is greatly reduced. We design a bitcoin exchange scheme to evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum-resistant blockchain system. The simulation platform is verified to be available and effective.

TI Nonlocal phase modulation of multimode, continuous-variable twin beams
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We investigate experimentally the nonlocal phase modulation of multiple-frequency-mode, continuous-variable entangled twin beams. We use a pair of electro-optical phase modulators to modulate the entangled probe and conjugate light beams produced by four-wave mixing in hot rubidium vapor. A single phase modulator in either one of the twin beams reduces the two-mode squeezing signal. The overall quantum entanglement is preserved, however, as the modulator nonlocally distributes the beam correlations among frequency modes of the multimode fields. The two-mode squeezing can be recovered by reversing the mixing with an additional out-of-phase electrooptical phase modulator (EOM) in the other beam.
