TI Improving the Stationary Entanglement of a Laguerre-Gaussian Cavity Mode
   with a Rotating Mirror via Nonlinear Cross-Kerr Interactions and
   Parametric Interactions
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quantum entanglement is essential in performing many quantum information tasks. Here, we theoretically investigate the stationary entanglement between a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) cavity field and a rotating end mirror in an LG-cavity optorotational system with a nonlinear cross-Kerr (CK) interaction and a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We calculate the logarithmic negativity of the system to quantify the stationary entanglement. We examine the influence of various system parameters such as the cavity detuning, the strength of the nonlinear CK interaction, the parametric gain and phase of the OPA, the power of the input Gaussian laser, the topological charge of the LG-cavity field, the mass of the rotating end mirror, and the ambient temperature on the stationary entanglement. Under the combined effect of the nonlinear CK interaction and the OPA, we find that the stationary entanglement can be substantially enhanced at lower Gaussian laser powers, smaller topological charges of the LG-cavity field, and larger masses of the rotating end mirror. We show that the combination of the nonlinear CK interaction and the OPA can make the stationary entanglement more robust against the ambient temperature.

TI Measurement of topological charges of optical vortices by antiphased
   semicircular slit pair
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Determination of orbital angular momentum (OAM) states is a subject of crucial importance for their applications in areas ranging from classical physics to quantum information. Here, we propose the antiphase semicircular slit pair (ASSP) as a novel approach to determine the topological charge of OAM states. The ASSP contains two semicircular slits with a diameter increment and symmetrically arranged in upper and lower circle. It converts an incident OAM state into light field with two bright spots, of which the relative shift is twice as spot shift for a semicircular slit. Physically, we introduce the two models of equivalent spiral slit and the Young's-like interference, obtaining two approximate linear relations between the shift and the incident topological charge. Analytically, the antiphase of the diffracted fields for the two semicircular slits cancels a main Bessel vortex term, and doubles the complement fields contained in that for a single semicircular slit, realizing the field with two bright intensity spots with the relative shift doubled. The diffracted field is fundamentally approximated as the weighted superposition of finite Bessel vortex eigenstates. Using shift between the bright spots, the determination of topological charge of OAM states becomes a feasible and convenient, and the experimental measurement conforms to the theory with satisfying accuracy.

TI Enabling multiple intercavity polariton coherences by adding quantum
   confinement to cavity molecular polaritons
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB In this study, the "particle in a box" idea, which was broadly developed in semiconductor quantum dot research, was extended into mid-infrared (IR) cavity modes by applying lateral confinement in an optical cavity. The discrete cavity modes hybridized with molecular vibrational modes, resulting in a quartet of polariton states that can support multiple coherence states in the IR regime. We applied tailored pump pulse sequences to selectively prepare these coherences and verified the multi-coherence existence. The simulation based on Lindblad equation showed that because the quartet of polariton states resided in the same cavity, they were specifically robust toward decoherence caused by fluctuations in space. The multiple robust coherences paved the way for entangled states and coherent interactions between cavity polaritons, which would be critical for advancing polariton-based quantum information technology.

TI Quantum noise as a symmetry-breaking field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the effect of quantum noise on the measurement-induced quantum phase transition in monitored random quantum circuits. Using the efficient simulability of random Clifford circuits, we find that the transition is broadened into a crossover and that the phase diagram as a function of projective measurements and noise exhibits several distinct regimes. We show that a mapping to a classical statistical mechanics problem accounts for the main features of the random circuit phase diagram. The bulk noise maps to an explicit permutation symmetry-breaking coupling; this symmetry is spontaneously broken when the noise is switched off. These results have implications for the realization of entanglement transitions in noisy quantum circuits.

AB The Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage through quantum-enhanced combinatorial optimization. In a typical QAOA setup, a set of quantum circuit parameters is optimized to prepare a quantum state used to find the optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. Several empirical observations about optimal parameter concentration effects for special QAOA MaxCut problem instances have been made in recent literature, however, a rigorous study of the subject is still lacking. We show that convergence of the optimal QAOA parameters around specific values and, consequently, successful transferability of parameters between different QAOA instances can be explained and predicted based on the local properties of the graphs, specifically the types of subgraphs (lightcones) from which the graphs are composed. We apply this approach to random regular and general random graphs. For example, we demonstrate how optimized parameters calculated for a 6-node random graph can be successfully used without modification as nearly optimal parameters for a 64-node random graph, with less than 1% reduction in approximation ratio as a result. This work presents a pathway to identifying classes of combinatorial optimization instances for which such variational quantum algorithms as QAOA can be substantially accelerated.

TI Variational quantum recommendation system with embedded latent vectors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As digital content expands, the need to deliver recommendations quickly becomes increasingly important. In traditional recommendation methods the online recommendation time scales linearly with the number of items, making such approaches less effective as datasets grow. Quantum computing offers novel techniques for parallel computation and sampling, yet current hardware remains constrained by noise and limited scalability. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which rely on shallow circuits, are better suited for noisy quantum machines. In this work, we explore a scheme for variational quantum recommendation system (VQRS), which combines classical matrix factorization (MF) and data re-uploading in the offline phase with quantum sampling in the online phase, aiming to accelerate inference. Using noiseless simulations on small-size standard datasets, we assess the method's performance and analyze its computational resource requirements. Our findings indicate that the scheme is capable of learning accurate recommendations on small datasets, but faces scalability challenges and may requires long offline training. Nonetheless, the results show that the proposed quantum circuit design supports the inference of user preferences, and that a relatively small number of online circuit executions suffices to yield moderately accurate predictions. This highlights a trade-off between inference time and accuracy, which may be of interest in applications where online speed is prioritized over precision.

AB Quantum computing is quickly turning from a promise to reality, witnessing the launch of several cloud-based services that provide access to quantum resources, simulators, runtimes, and programming tools, all through the cloud. Unfortunately, however, existing solutions typically implicitly assume intimate knowledge about quantum computing concepts and operators. This vision paper introduces Quantum Service-Oriented Computing (QSOC), a model for building applications using a well-balanced mix of classical and quantum (hybrid) computing approaches. We propose a model-driven methodology that allows application developers, classical service developers, and quantum programmers to build hybrid enterprise applications collaboratively. As a result, quantum programmers and service developers can develop and publish quantum and classical components. At the same time, the application developers can discover, compose, configure and compose pre-built components to build and operate enterprise applications without intimate knowledge on the underlying quantum infrastructure, advocating knowledge reuse and separation of concerns.

TI Direct observation of chirality-induced spin selectivity in electron
   donor-acceptor molecules
SO SCIENCE
AB The role of chirality in determining the spin dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer in donor-acceptor molecules remains an open question. Although chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been demonstrated in molecules bound to substrates, experimental information about whether this process influences spin dynamics in the molecules themselves is lacking. Here we used time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that CISS strongly influences the spin dynamics of isolated covalent donor-chiral bridge-acceptor (D-B chi-A) molecules in which selective photoexcitation of D is followed by two rapid, sequential electron-transfer events to yield D center dot+-B chi-A(center dot-). Exploiting this phenomenon affords the possibility of using chiral molecular building blocks to control electron spin states in quantum information applications.

TI Deep reinforcement learning for quantum multiparameter estimation
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Estimation of physical quantities is at the core of most scientific research, and the use of quantum devices promises to enhance its performances. In real scenarios, it is fundamental to consider that resources are limited, and Bayesian adaptive estimation represents a powerful approach to efficiently allocate, during the estimation process, all the available resources. However, this framework relies on the precise knowledge of the system model, retrieved with a fine calibration, with results that are often computationally and experimentally demanding. We introduce a model-free and deep-learning-based approach to efficiently implement realistic Bayesian quantum metrology tasks accomplishing all the relevant challenges, without relying on any a priori knowledge of the system. To overcome this need, a neural network is trained directly on experimental data to learn the multiparameter Bayesian update. Then the system is set at its optimal working point through feedback provided by a reinforcement learning algorithm trained to reconstruct and enhance experiment heuristics of the investigated quantum sensor. Notably, we prove experimentally the achievement of higher estimation performances than standard methods, demonstrating the strength of the combination of these two black-box algorithms on an integrated photonic circuit. Our work represents an important step toward fully artificial intelligence-based quantum metrology.

TI Extracting a function encoded in amplitudes of a quantum state by tensor
   network and orthogonal function expansion
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB There are quantum algorithms for finding a function f satisfying a set of conditions, such as solving partial differential equations, and these achieve exponential quantum speedup compared to existing classical methods, especially when the number d of the variables of f is large. In general, however, these algorithms output the quantum state which encodes f in the amplitudes, and reading out the values of f as classical data from such a state can be so time-consuming that the quantum speedup is ruined. In this study, we propose a general method for this function readout task. Based on the function approximation by a combination of tensor network and orthogonal function expansion, we present a quantum circuit and its optimization procedure to obtain an approximating function of f that has a polynomial number of degrees of freedom with respect to d and is efficiently evaluable on a classical computer. We also conducted a numerical experiment to approximate a finance-motivated function to demonstrate that our method works.

AB Encapsulated atomic hydrogen in polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cages is a promising candidate for spin-based quantum technologies. Key parameters such as spin relaxation times and magnetic interactions with surrounding electron and nuclear spins can be typically probed with advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. Here we present a detailed pulsed EPR study of the species H@Si8O12R8 with R=CH3, namely encapsulated atomic hydrogen in the octamethyl POSS derivative. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/ is analyzed in terms of a Raman process with a Debye temperature of K and a thermally activated process with (552 cm(-1)), whereas, the phase memory time shows the typical shortening behaviour at K observed for all methyl-containing derivatives. The hyperfine coupling of the cage Si nuclei is measured by hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy and is found to fulfil the so-called "matching condition" at the low-field EPR transition. The potential of this paramagnetic molecule to perform one-qubit quantum operations is probed by room-temperature Rabi oscillations.

TI Unambiguous Quantum State Discrimination in a PT$\mathcal
   {PT}$-Symmetric System of a Single Trapped Ion
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB An unambiguous quantum state discrimination of two qubit states is experimentally demonstrated under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal () symmetry in a single trapped 40Ca+ ion. It is shown that any two non-orthogonal states can become orthogonal subjected to time evolution of a -symmetric Hamiltonian in both the -symmetry preserving and broken regimes, thus can be discriminated unambiguously. For a given pair of candidate states, it is shown that the parameters of the Hamiltonian must be confined in a proper range, within which there exists an optimal choice to realize quantum brachistochrone for the fastest orthogonalization. Besides, a clear geometric picture and some analytic results are provided to understand the main conclusions. This work shows a promising application of non-Hermitian physics in quantum information processing.

TI Controlled-phase gate by dynamic coupling of photons to a two-level

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose an architecture for achieving high-fidelity deterministic quantum logic gates on dual-rail encoded photonic qubits by letting photons interact with a two-level emitter (TLE) inside an optical cavity. The photon wave packets that define the qubit are preserved after the interaction due to a quantum control process that actively loads and unloads the photons from the cavity and dynamically alters their effective coupling to the TLE. The controls rely on nonlinear wave mixing between cavity modes enhanced by strong externally modulated electromagnetic fields or on AC Stark shifts of the TLE transition energy. We numerically investigate the effect of imperfections in terms of loss and dephasing of the TLE as well as control field miscalibration. Our results suggest that III-V quantum dots in GaAs membranes is a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing.

TI Epitaxial Growth of Planar Hutwires on Silicon-on-Insulator Substrates

AB Quantum devices based on holes confined in crystalline Ge nanostructures have emerged as a promising platform in the field of quantum technology. Epitaxial Ge hutwires (HWs) successfully used in pioneering quantum bit (qubit) experiments are the logical next choice for long-distance coherent spin-spin coupling experiments. However, leakage currents are currently limiting the device performance of HWs on bulk Si substrates. This drawback can be mitigated by the HW growth on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. Herein, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) HW growth developed on technologically relevant SOI substrates with different device layer thicknesses is shown. Using atomic force microscopy characterization, the fabrication of HWs on SOI with lengths of up to 600 nm is demonstrated. In addition, the very narrow window of growth parameters for which successful HW growth can be achieved and the distinct differences of HW growth on SOI versus bulk Si substrates are addressed.

TI Real-time simulation of light-driven spin chains on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this work, we study the real-time evolution of periodically driven (Floquet) systems on a quantum computer using IBM quantum devices. We consider a driven Landau-Zener model and compute the transition probability between the Floquet steady states as a function of time. We find that for this simple one-qubit model, Floquet states can develop in real time, as indicated by the transition probability between Floquet states. Next, we model light-driven spin chains and compute the time-dependent antiferromagnetic order parameter. We consider models arising from light coupling to the underlying electrons as well as those arising from light coupling to phonons. For the two-spin chains, the quantum devices yield time evolutions that match the effective Floquet Hamiltonian evolution for both models once readout error mitigation is included. For three-spin chains, zero-noise extrapolation yields a time dependence that follows the effective Floquet time evolution. Therefore, the current IBM quantum devices can provide information on the dynamics of small Floquet systems arising from light drives once error mitigation procedures are implemented.

TI Chemistry beyond the scale of exact diagonalization on a quantum-centric
   supercomputer
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. Although current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and a large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N2 and the ground state properties of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wave functions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.

TI Efficient phase-factor evaluation in quantum signal processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a powerful quantum algorithm to exactly implement matrix polynomials on quantum computers. Asymptotic analysis of quantum algorithms based on QSP has shown that asymptotically optimal results can in principle be obtained for a range of tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation and the quantum linear system problem. A further benefit of QSP is that it uses a minimal number of ancilla qubits, which facilitates its implementation on near-to-intermediate term quantum architectures. However, there is so far no classically stable algorithm allowing computation of the phase factors that are needed to build QSP circuits. Existing methods require the use of variable precision arithmetic and can only be applied to polynomials of a relatively low degree. We present here an optimization-based method that can accurately compute the phase factors using standard double precision arithmetic operations. We demonstrate the performance of this approach with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, eigenvalue filtering, and quantum linear system problems. Our numerical results show that the optimization algorithm can find phase factors to accurately approximate polynomials of a degree larger than 10 000 with errors below 10(-12).

TI Magnon-photon cross-correlations via optical nonlinearity in cavity
   magnonical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose an alternative scheme to achieve the cross-cor relations between magnon and photon in a hybrid nonlinear system including two microwave cavities and one yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, where two cavities nonlinearly interact and meanwhile one of cavities couples to magnon representing the collective excitation in YIG sphere via magnetic dipole interaction. Based on dispersive couplings between two cavities and between one cavity and magnon with the larger detunings, the nonlinear interaction occurs between the other cavity and magnon, which plays a crucial role in generating quantum correlations. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions via numerical simulations and analytical calculations, the remarkable nonclassical correlations are existent in such a system, where the magnon blockade and photon antibunching could be obtainable on demand. The scheme we present is focused on the magnon-photon crosscor relations in the weak coupling regime and relaxes the requirements of experimental conditions, which may have potential applications in quantum information processing in the hybrid system.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Designing of Reversible Functions in Classical and Quantum Domains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB First sections of the paper contain some considerations relevant to the reversibility of quantum gates. The Solovay-Kitayev theorem shows that using proper set of quantum gates one can build a quantum version of the nondeterministic Turing machine. On the other hand the Gottesmann-Knill theorem shows the possibility to simulate the quantum machine consisting of only Clifford/Pauli group of gates. This paper presents also an original method of designing the reversible functions. This method is intended for the most popular gate set with three types of gates CNT (Control, NOT and Toffoli). The presented algorithm leads to cascade with minimal number CNT gates. This solution is called optimal reversible circuits. The paper is organized as follows. Section 5 recalls basic concepts of reversible logic. Section 6 contain short description of CNT set of the reversible gates. In Section 7 is presented form of result of designing as the cascade of gates. Section 8 describes the algorithm and section 9 simple example.

TI Fundamental limitations to key distillation from Gaussian states with
   Gaussian operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We establish fundamental upper bounds on the amount of secret key that can be extracted from quantum Gaussian states by using local Gaussian operations, local classical processing, and public communication. For one-way public communication or when two-way public communication is allowed but Alice and Bob first perform destructive local Gaussian measurements, we prove that the key is bounded by the Renyi-2 Gaussian entanglement of formation EGF,2. The saturation of this inequality for pure Gaussian states provides an operational interpretation of the Renyi-2 entropy of entanglement as the secret key rate of pure Gaussian states accessible with Gaussian operations and one-way communication. In the general setting of two-way communication and arbitrary interactive protocols, we argue that 2EGF,2 still serves as an upper bound on the extractable key. We conjecture that the factor of 2 is spurious, suggesting that EGF,2 coincides with the secret key rate of Gaussian states under Gaussian measurements and two-way public communication. We use these results to prove a gap between the secret key rates obtainable with arbitrary versus Gaussian operations. This gap is observed for states produced by sending one half of a two-mode squeezed vacuum through a pure loss channel, in the regime of sufficiently low squeezing or sufficiently high transmissivity. Finally, for a wide class of Gaussian states, including all two-mode states, we prove a recently proposed conjecture on the equality between EGF,2 and the Gaussian intrinsic entanglement. The unified entanglement quantifier emerging from such an equality is then endowed with a direct operational interpretation as the value of a quantum teleportation game.

TI Highly Efficient and Tunable Linear-to-Circular Polarization Conversion
   Enabled by Topological Unidirectional Guided Resonance
SO PHOTONICS
AB The absence of natural sources of circularly polarized light has created a critical demand for high-performance polarization converters in emerging technologies such as quantum information processing, biomedical diagnostics, and advanced magneto-optical recording systems. Despite significant efforts, linear-to-circular polarization converters that combine high efficiency with tunability remain scarce. In this paper, we present a multifunctional and tunable device with 99.9% efficiency for converting linear to circular polarization in the telecom wavelength range. It can also function as a phase-only compensator with a controllable phase range of 1.93 pi while maintaining a reflectance above 99%. The angular sensitivity analysis indicates that the device can tolerate incidence angles ranging from 8 to 10.4 degrees. This high-efficiency polarization conversion device offers significant advantages in integrated optics due to its multifunctionality and tunability and has promising applications in optical phased-array radars and quantum communication.

TI Millimetre-scale magnetocardiography of living rats with thoracotomy
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Causes of heart failure can be investigated by tracing imperfections in electrical current propagation on the millimetre scale; however, the spatial resolution of current magnetocardiograph methods are limited to the centimetre-scale. Here, the authors report a millimetre-scale nitrogen vacancy-based quantum sensing to measure the magnetic field generated by the heart of a living rat, from which the cardiac electrical currents can be extrapolated.
   Magnetocardiography is a contactless imaging modality for electric current propagation in the cardiovascular system. Although conventional sensors provide sufficiently high sensitivity, their spatial resolution is limited to a centimetre-scale, which is inadequate for revealing the intra-cardiac electrodynamics such as rotational waves associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Here, we demonstrate invasive magnetocardiography of living rats at a millimetre-scale using a quantum sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The acquired magnetic images indicate that the cardiac signal source is well explained by vertically distributed current dipoles, pointing from the right atrium base via the Purkinje fibre bundle to the left ventricular apex. We also find that this observation is consistent with and complementary to an alternative picture of electric current density distribution calculated with a stream function method. Our technique will enable the study of the origin and progression of various cardiac arrhythmias, including flutter, fibrillation, and tachycardia.

TI Suppression of decoherence by multiple joint measurements in entangled
   systems
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB We propose a method to suppress decoherence in entangled systems by applying the series of joint measurements. While the standard Quantum Zeno Effect approach can only compensate for the slow enough Hamiltonian dynamics of the quantum system, the characteristic frequencies of the thermal bath contacting system may be greater than the maximal achievable frequencies of measurements. In this case, they cannot cancel out non-Hamiltonian evolution leading to the decoherence. We propose to use entanglement between the qubits of a quantum register to mitigate the negative effects of the interaction with the thermal bath, even with the lower frequencies of measurement. We show that even though this protocol does not lead to a complete freezing of the initial state, it still allows effective preservation of the entanglement in the system.

TI Fractional Dynamics of Information Entropy in Quantum Wire System Under
   Rashba Interaction
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB We present a theoretical examination of the fractional dynamics of information entropy within a semiconductor nanowire system influenced by Rashba spin-orbit interaction and external magnetic fields. Moreover, we determine the fractional nanowire state through the analytical solution of the fractional Schr & ouml;dinger equation, considering various initial states of the nanowire system. Our research emphasizes the impact of the fractional order and the interaction parameters on the behavior of information entropy. Our findings reveal that the temporal behavior of information entropy is highly sensitive to any variations in the magnetic field length, the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and the fractional order parameter. The results demonstrate that these parameters are pivotal in determining the coherence and correlation properties of the nanowire system. Therefore, precise control of these factors paves the way for enhancing entanglement performance and facilitating information transfer in spintronic and quantum communication applications.

AB Often in Software Engineering a modelling formalism has to support scenarios of inconsistency in which several requirements either reinforce or contradict each other. Paraconsistent transition systems are proposed in this paper as one such formalism: states evolve through two accessibility relations capturing weighted evidence of a transition or its absence, respectively. Their weights come from a specific residuated lattice. A category of these systems, and the corresponding algebra, is defined providing a formal setting to model different application scenarios. One of them, dealing with the effect of quantum decoherence in quantum programs, is used for illustration purposes.

TI Toward Real Chemical Accuracy on Current Quantum Hardware Through the
   Transcorrelated Method
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and connectivity) hamper the implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. We propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach to target these major roadblocks directly. This method transfers, without any approximation, correlations from the wave function directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy quantum devices. We show that the TC approach allows for shallower circuits and improves the convergence toward the complete basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, thus, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using two and four qubits, respectively. To demonstrate our approach's current and near-term potential, we perform hardware experiments, where our results confirm that the TC method paves the way toward accurate quantum chemistry calculations already on today's quantum hardware.

TI Efficient separation of quantum from classical correlations for mixed
   states with a fixed charge
SO QUANTUM
AB Entanglement is the key resource for quantum technologies and is at the root of exciting many-body phenomena. How-ever, quantifying the entanglement be-tween two parts of a real-world quan-tum system is challenging when it inter-acts with its environment, as the latter mixes cross-boundary classical with quan-tum correlations. Here, we efficiently quantify quantum correlations in such re-alistic open systems using the operator space entanglement spectrum of a mixed state. If the system possesses a fixed charge, we show that a subset of the spectral values encode coherence between different cross-boundary charge configura-tions. The sum over these values, which we call "configuration coherence", can be used as a quantifier for cross-boundary co-herence. Crucially, we prove that for pu-rity non-increasing maps, e.g., Lindblad -type evolutions with Hermitian jump op-erators, the configuration coherence is an entanglement measure. Moreover, it can be efficiently computed using a tensor net-work representation of the state's density matrix. We showcase the configuration co-herence for spinless particles moving on a chain in presence of dephasing. Our approach can quantify coherence and en-tanglement in a broad range of systems and motivates efficient entanglement de-tection.

TI Single V2 defect in 4H silicon carbide Schottky diode at low temperature
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nanoelectrical and photonic integration of quantum optical components is crucial for scalable solid-state quantum technologies. Silicon carbide stands out as a material with mature quantum defects and a wide variety of applications in semiconductor industry. Here, we study the behaviour of single silicon vacancy (V2) colour centres in a metal-semiconductor (Au/Ti/4H-SiC) epitaxial wafer device, operating in a Schottky diode configuration. We explore the depletion of free carriers in the vicinity of the defect, as well as electrical tuning of the defect optical transition lines. By detecting single charge traps, we investigate their impact on V2 optical line width. Additionally, we investigate the charge-photon-dynamics of the V2 centre and find its dominating photon-ionisation processes characteristic rate and wavelength dependence. Finally, we probe the spin coherence properties of the V2 system in the junction and demonstrate several key protocols for quantum network applications. Our work shows the first demonstration of low temperature integration of a Schottky device with optical microstructures for quantum applications and paves the way towards fundamentally scalable and reproducible optical spin defect centres in solids.

TI High-EJ/EC transmon qudits with up to 12 levels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Qudits provide a resource-efficient alternative to qubits for quantum information processing. The multilevel nature of the transmon, with its individually resolvable transition frequencies, makes it an attractive platform for superconducting circuit-based qudits. In this work, we systematically analyze the trade-offs associated with encoding high-dimensional quantum information in fixed-frequency transmons. Designing high E-J/E-C ratios of up to 325, we observe up to 12 levels (d = 12) on a single transmon. Despite the decreased anharmonicity, we demonstrate process infidelities ef < 3 x 10(-3 )for qubitlike operations in each adjacent-level qubit subspace in the lowest ten levels. Furthermore, we achieve a ten-state readout assignment fidelity of 93.8% with the assistance of deep neural network classification of a multitone dispersive measurement. We find that the Hahn echo time T2E for the higher levels is close to the limit of T-1 decay, primarily limited by bosonic enhancement. We verify the recently observed Josephson harmonic model, finding that it yields better predictions for the transition frequencies and charge dispersion. Finally, we show strong ZZ-like coupling between the higher energy levels in a two-transmon system. Our high-fidelity control and readout methods, in combination with our comprehensive characterization of the transmon model, suggest that the high-E-J/E-C transmon is a powerful tool for exploring excited states in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

TI Generation of quantum coherence for continuous variables between
   causally disconnected regions in dilaton spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study the dynamics of Gaussian quantum coherence under the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilaton black hole. It is shown that the dilaton field has evident effects on the degree of coherence for all the bipartite subsystems. The bipartite Gaussian coherence is not affected by the frequency of the scalar field for an uncharged or an extreme dilaton black hole. It is found that the initial coherence is not completely destroyed even for an extreme dilaton black hole, which is quite different from the behavior of quantum steering because the latter suffers from a "sudden death" under the same conditions. This is nontrivial because one can employ quantum coherence as a resource for quantum information processing tasks even if quantum correlations have been destroyed by the strong gravitational field. In addition, it is demonstrated that the generation of quantum coherence between the initial separable modes is easier for low-frequency scalar fields. At the same time, quantum coherence is smoothly generated betweenone pair of partners and exhibits a "sudden birth" behavior between another pairs in the curved spacetime.

TI Eternal adiabaticity in quantum evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We iteratively apply a recently formulated adiabatic theorem for the strong-coupling limit in finite-dimensional closed and open quantum systems. This allows us to improve approximations to a perturbed dynamics, beyond the standard approximation based on quantum Zeno dynamics and adiabatic elimination. The effective generators describing the approximate evolutions are endowed with the same block structure as the unperturbed part of the generator, and exhibit adiabatic evolutions. This iterative adiabatic theorem reveals that adiabaticity holds eternally, that is, the system evolves within each eigenspace of the unperturbed part of the generator, with an error bounded by O(1/gamma) uniformly in time, where gamma is the strength of the unperturbed part of the generator. We prove that the iterative adiabatic theorem reproduces Bloch's perturbation theory in the unitary case, and is therefore a full generalization to open systems. We furthermore prove the equivalence of the Schrieffer-Wolff and des Cloizeaux approaches in the unitary case and generalize both to arbitrary open systems, showing that they share the eternal adiabaticity, and providing explicit error bounds. Finally we discuss the physical structure of the effective adiabatic generators and show that ideal effective generators for open systems do not exist in general.

TI Nanophotonic Materials for Twisted-Light Manipulation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), offers not only fundamental new insights into structured light-matter interactions, but also a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. However, current OAM experiments still rely on bulky, expensive, and slow-response diffractive or refractive optical elements, hindering today's OAM systems to be largely deployed. In the last decade, nanophotonics has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic devices harnessing the generation and detection of OAM modes. Recent metasurface devices developed for OAM generation in both real and momentum space, presenting design principle and exemplary devices, are summarized. Moreover, recent development of whispering-gallery-mode-based passive and tunable microcavities, capable of extracting degenerate OAM modes for on-chip vortex emission and lasing, is summarized. In addition, the design principle of different plasmonic devices and photodetectors recently developed for on-chip OAM detection is discussed. Current challenges faced by the nanophotonic field for twisted-light manipulation and future advances to meet these challenges are further discussed. It is believed that twisted-light manipulation in nanophotonics will continue to make significant impact on future development of ultracompact, ultrahigh-capacity, and ultrahigh-speed OAM systems-on-a-chip.

TI Generation of four-dimensional hyperentangled NOON states and beyond
   with photonic orbital angular momentum and detection-basis control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hyperentanglement of photonic light modes is a valuable resource in quantum information processing and quantum communication. Here we propose a protocol using the interference of two optical nonlinearities and control of the heralding (detection) basis in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom. This setup is capable of generating states which are both maximally entangled and hyperentangled in at least four dimensions. The resultant state in the four-dimensional case is a generalization of the so-called NOON state (a maximally path-entangled state well known in quantum optics). The production of this state is "perfect" (in other words noiseless) at least in the ideal case, excluding experimental imperfections. The presented setup is very versatile, and with control of the detection and pumping protocols a massively large parameter space, of arbitrarily large dimensionality, may be searched for other states of interest. Also, we present a few specific cases to demonstrate the versatility of the system.

TI Remote preparation for single-photon state in two degrees of freedom
   with hyper-entangled states
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Remote state preparation (RSP) provides a useful way of transferring quantum information between two distant nodes based on the previously shared entanglement. In this paper, we study RSP of an arbitrary single-photon state in two degrees of freedom (DoFs). Using hyper-entanglement as a shared resource, our first goal is to remotely prepare the single-photon state in polarization and frequency DoFs and the second one is to reconstruct the single-photon state in polarization and time-bin DoFs. In the RSP process, the sender will rotate the quantum state in each DoF of the photon according to the knowledge of the state to be communicated. By performing a projective measurement on the polarization of the sender's photon, the original single-photon state in two DoFs can be remotely reconstructed at the receiver's quantum systems. This work demonstrates a novel capability for longdistance quantum communication.

TI Information-theoretic measures of superconductivity in a two-dimensional
   doped Mott insulator
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB A key open issue in condensed-matter physics is how quantum and classical correlations emerge in an unconventional superconductor from the underlying normal state. We study this problem in a doped Mott insulator with information-theory tools on the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model at finite temperature with cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find that the local entropy detects the superconducting state and that the difference in the local entropy between the superconducting and normal states follows the same difference in the potential energy. We find that the thermodynamic entropy is suppressed in the superconducting state and monotonically decreases with decreasing doping. The maximum in entropy found in the normal state above the overdoped region of the superconducting dome is obliterated by superconductivity. The total mutual information, which quantifies quantum and classical correlations, is amplified in the superconducting state of the doped Mott insulator for all doping levels and shows a broad peak versus doping, as a result of competing quantum and classical effects.

TI Optimal entanglement generation in GHZ-type states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The entanglement production is key for many applications in the realm of quantum information, but so is the identification of processes that allow to create entanglement in a fast and sustained way. Most of the advances in this direction have been circumscribed to bipartite systems only, and the rate of entanglement in multipartite system has been much less explored. Here we contribute to the identification of processes that favor the fastest and sustained generation of tripartite entanglement in a class of 3-qubit GHZ-type states. By considering a three-party interaction Hamiltonian, we analyze the dynamics of the 3-tangle and the entanglement rate to identify the optimal local operations that supplement the Hamiltonian evolution in order to speed-up the generation of three-way entanglement, and to prevent its decay below a predetermined threshold value. The appropriate local operation that maximizes the speed at which a highly-entangled state is reached has the advantage of requiring access to only one of the qubits, yet depends on the actual state of the system. Other universal (state-independent) local operations are found that conform schemes to maintain a sufficiently high amount of 3-tangle. Our results expand our understanding of entanglement rates to multipartite systems, and offer guidance regarding the strategies that improve the efficiency in various quantum information processing tasks.

TI Unambiguous Quantum State Discrimination in a PT-Symmetric System
   of a Single Trapped Ion
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB An unambiguous quantum state discrimination of two qubit states is experimentally demonstrated under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal (PT ) symmetry in a single trapped Ca-40(+) ion. It is shown that any two non-orthogonal states can become orthogonal subjected to time evolution of a PT -symmetric Hamiltonian in both the PT -symmetry preserving and broken regimes, thus can be discriminated unambiguously. For a given pair of candidate states, it is shown that the parameters of the Hamiltonian must be confined in a proper range, within which there exists an optimal choice to realize quantum brachistochrone for the fastest orthogonalization. Besides, a clear geometric picture and some analytic results are provided to understand the main conclusions. This work shows a promising application of non-Hermitian physics in quantum information processing.

TI Studying critical parameters of superconductor via diamond quantum
   sensors
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Critical parameters are the key to superconductivity research, and reliable instrumentations can facilitate the study. Traditionally, one has to use several different measurement techniques to measure critical parameters separately. In this work, we develop the use of a single species of quantum sensor to determine and estimate several critical parameters with the help of independent simulation data. We utilize the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the diamond, which recently emerged as a promising candidate for probing exotic features in condensed matter physics. The non-invasive and highly stable nature provides extraordinary opportunities to solve scientific problems in various systems. Using a high-quality single-crystalline YBa2Cu4O8 (YBCO) as a platform, we demonstrate the use of diamond particles and a bulk diamond to probe the Meissner effect. The evolution of the vector magnetic field, the H - T phase diagram, and the map of fluorescence contour are studied via NV sensing. Our results reveal different critical parameters, including lower critical field Hc1, upper critical field Hc2, and critical current density jc, as well as verifying the unconventional nature of this high-temperature superconductor YBCO. Therefore, NV-based quantum sensing techniques have huge potential in condensed matter research.

TI MuReQua Chain: Multiscale Relativistic Quantum Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we introduce a new approach to fix the validation of a block and the assignment of a new block in a blockchain infrastructure by using a novel negotiation procedure. The block validation and assignment are reached thanks to negotiation procedures based on an extended probability environment. Also, by using a multiscale approach (typical of Complexity Theory) and Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics, the result appears to solve some of the most relevant questions in the Blockchain context, which are the democracy and the randomness of the validator of a block and the assignment of the new one. The selection of actors to mine is invariant concerning the number of addresses, i.e., the coins of owners, which have more chance to be selected generally. This work is the companion of CQKD (Computational Quantum Key Distribution), as we will see in the introduction, where we considered the infrastructural question of the key distribution; also, it is a very effective application of the decision and reasoning in incompleteness or uncertainty conditions as described in the previous and prodromic paper as described in the introduction too.

TI Floquet-Rydberg quantum simulator for confinement in Z2 gauge theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent advances in the field of quantum technologies have opened up the road for the realization of small-scale quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories which, among other goals, aim at improving our understanding on the nonperturbative mechanisms underlying the confinement of quarks. In this work, considering periodically driven arrays of Rydberg atoms in a tweezer ladder geometry, we devise a scalable Floquet scheme for the quantum simulation of the real -time dynamics in a Z2 LGT, in which hardcore bosons/spinless fermions are coupled to dynamical gauge fields. Resorting to an external magnetic field to tune the angular dependence of the Rydberg dipolar interactions, and by a suitable tuning of the driving parameters, we manage to suppress the main gauge-violating terms and show that an observation of gauge-invariant confinement dynamics in the Floquet-Rydberg setup is at reach of current experimental techniques. Depending on the lattice size, we present a thorough numerical test of the validity of this scheme using either exact diagonalization or matrix-product-state algorithms for the periodically modulated real -time dynamics.

SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Cluster states are key resources for measurement-based quantum information processing. Photonic cluster and graph states, in particular, play indispensable roles in quantum network and quantum metrology. We demonstrate a semiconductor quantum dot based device in which the confined hole spin acts as a needle in a quantum knitting machine producing continuously and deterministically at sub-Gigahertz repetition rate single indistinguishable photons which are all polarization entangled to each other and to the spin in a one dimensional cluster state. By projecting two nonadjacent photons onto circular polarization bases we disentangle the spin from the photons emitted in between. This way we demonstrate a novel way for producing deterministic and continuous all-photonic cluster states. We use polarization tomography on four sequentially detected photons to demonstrate and to directly quantify the robustness of the cluster's entanglement and the determinism in its photon generation.

TI Near-ultrastrong nonlinear light-matter coupling in superconducting
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Light-matter interaction between an atom and an electromagnetic resonator is ubiquitous in quantum technologies. Although linear light-matter coupling g sigma<^>x(a<^>+a<^>dagger) can reach the ultrastrong regime g/omega > 10(-1), nonlinear light-matter coupling (chi)/(2)sigma<^>za<^>dagger a<^> is typically perturbative and limited to chi/omega < 10(-2). Nonlinear coupling has the advantage of commuting with the atomic sigma<^>z and photonic a<^>dagger a<^> Hamiltonian, allowing for fundamental operations such as quantum-non-demolition measurement. Here, we use a superconducting circuit to demonstrate the experimental realization of near-ultrastrong chi/omega = (4.852 +/- 0.006) x 10(-2). We also show signatures of light-light nonlinear coupling (chi a<^>dagger a<^>b<^>dagger b<^>) and chi/2 pi = 580.3 +/- 0.4 MHz matter-matter nonlinear coupling (chi 4 sigma<^>z,a sigma<^>z,b), representing the largest reported ZZ interaction between two coherent qubits. Such advances in the nonlinear coupling strength of light, matter modes enable new physical regimes and could lead to orders of magnitude faster qubit readout and gates.

TI Steering nonlocality in high-speed telecommunication system without
   detection loophole
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, and is an exploitable resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues and the associated applicability compromises hamper the practical applications. We report the first time-bin entangled detection-loophole-free steering nonlocality demonstration in a fully chip-fiber telecommunication system, with an ultra-fast measurement switching rate (1.25 GHz). In this endeavor, we propose the phase-encoding measurement scheme to adapt the system to time-bin degree of freedom, and design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation. An asymmetric configuration is introduced to mimic the active measurement implementation at the steering party thus bypassing the phase modulation loss. Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency required by conclusive quantum steering with multiple actively switched measurement settings. Our setup presents an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.

TI Robust semi-device-independent certification of all pure bipartite
   maximally entangled states via quantum steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The idea of self-testing is to render guarantees concerning the inner workings of a device based on the measurement statistics. It is one of the most formidable quantum certification and benchmarking schemes. Recently it was shown [A. Coladangelo, K. T. Goh, and V. Scarani, Nat. Commun. 8, 15485 (2017)] that all pure bipartite entangled states can be self-tested in the device-independent scenario by employing subspace methods introduced by Yang and Navascues [Phys. Rev. A 87, 050102(R) (2013)]. Here, we have adapted their method to show that any bipartite pure entangled state can be certified in the semi-device-independent scenario through quantum steering. Analogous to the tilted Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, we use a steering inequality called the tilted steering inequality for certifying any pure two-qubit entangled state. Furthermore, we use this inequality to certify any bipartite pure entangled state by certifying two-dimensional subspaces of the qudit state by observing the structure of the set of assemblages obtained on the trusted side after measurements are made on the untrusted side. As a feature of quantum state certification via steering, we use the notion of assemblage-based robust state certification to provide robustness bounds for the certification result in the case of pure maximally entangled states of any local dimension.

TI Formation of two-dimensional multichannel vertical optical waveguides in
   a nitrogen-vacancy center diamond using a femtosecond Bessel beam laser
   for local quantum sensing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds can function as quantum sensors for measuring magnetic fields, temperature, and stress with high sensitivity. They are useful in various biological applications, such as for measuring the local magnetic and electrical fields and signal propagation in tissues as well as their local interaction dynamics. However, to enable measurements suitable for medical applications, an observation system that can noninvasively map neural activity from the magnetic fields generated by brain nerve cells with high spatial resolution and sensitivity is required. We fabricated a vertical waveguide array in a diamond containing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with cell size dimension using a green femtosecond Bessel beam laser. The red emission from NV centers within the waveguide is confined inside the waveguide (typically with a cell size of 15 mu m) by the total internal reflection at its walls. This enables efficient optical confinement and improves the light collection performance of the NV center emission. We have also developed a sensor-called the diamond micro-NV center array device (MAED)-that allows the observation of local magnetic field distributions and have measured spatial distribution of magnetic field with cell-size accuracy. This approach makes it possible to perform localized measurements of electrical and magnetic properties, as well as dynamic mapping of biological systems. This technological innovation holds a significant potential for the noninvasive observation of functional networks in cortical neurons. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Quantum artificial intelligence: A survey
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are two highly topical fields of research that can benefit from each other's discoveries by opening a completely new scenario in computation, that of quantum artificial intelligence. Indeed, on the one hand, artificial intelligence algorithms can be made computationally more efficient due to the potential speedup enabled by quantum phenomena; on the other hand, the complex development of quantum computing technologies and methodologies can be properly supported by the use of classical artificial intelligence approaches. The "entanglement" of these two disciplines is opening up completely new directions in computer science research, and this survey aims to provide a systematic and taxonomic overview of the work that has already been done and that which will begin in the near future.

TI Simulating photosynthetic energy transport on a photonic network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum effects in photosynthetic energy transport in nature, especially for the typical Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, are extensively studied in quantum biology. Such energy transport processes can be investigated as open quantum systems that blend the quantum coherence and environmental noise, and have been experimentally simulated on a few quantum devices. However, the existing experiments always lack a solid quantum simulation for the FMO energy transport due to their constraints to map a variety of issues in actual FMO complexes that have rich biological meanings. Here we successfully map the full coupling profile of the seven-site FMO structure by comprehensive characterisation and precise control of the evanescent coupling of the three-dimensional waveguide array. By applying a stochastic dynamical modulation on each waveguide, we introduce the base site energy and the dephasing term in coloured noise to faithfully simulate the power spectral density of the FMO complexes. We show our photonic model well interprets the phenomena including reorganisation energy, vibrational assistance, exciton transfer and energy localisation. We further experimentally demonstrate the existence of an optimal transport efficiency at certain dephasing strength, providing a window to closely investigate environment-assisted quantum transport.

TI Single-photon radiation enhancement and far-field regulation based on
   twist angle defects lattice cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Efficient and versatile single-photon sources are crucial components for practical quantum communication. The weak coupling of micro-nano photonic structures with quantum dots significantly enhances single-photon performance by accelerating the photon radiation rate, regulating the far-field distribution, and enhancing photon collection efficiency. We propose a novel defect design, twist angle defects (TADs), which greatly improve far-field radiation patterns based on the band-folding principle. Through systematic optimization of the structural parameters, the TADs lattice cavity has achieved a collection efficiency approaching 90% and a Purcell factor exceeding 40. Furthermore, this cavity exhibits excellent robustness, with tolerances for positional shifts and hole radius variations being +/- 100 nm and +/- 5 nm, respectively. The TADs lattice cavity is fully compatible with existing micro-nano processing techniques, offering a promising new device for future quantum information experiments.

TI Quantum-randomized polarization of laser pulses derived from zero-point
   diamond motion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Intrinsic randomness in quantum systems is a vital resource for cryptography and other quantum information protocols. To date, randomizing macroscopic polarization states requires randomness from an external source, which is then used to modulate the polarization e.g. for quantum key-distribution protocols. Here, we present a Raman-based device for directly generating laser pulses with quantum-randomized polarizations. We show that crystals of diamond lattice symmetry provide a unique operating point for which the Raman gain is isotropic, so that the spontaneous symmetry breaking initiated by the quantum-random zero-point motion determines the output polarization. Experimentally measured polarizations are demonstrated to be consistent with an independent and identical uniform distribution with an estimated quantum entropy rate of 3.8 bits/pulse.

TI Bounding generalized relative entropies: Nonasymptotic quantum speed
   limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Information theory has become an increasingly important research field to better understand quantum mechanics. Noteworthy, it covers both foundational and applied perspectives, also offering a common technical language to study a variety of research areas. Remarkably, one of the key information-theoretic quantities is given by the relative entropy, which quantifies how difficult is to tell apart two probability distributions, or even two quantum states. Such a quantity rests at the core of fields like metrology, quantum thermodynamics, quantum communication, and quantum information. Given this broadness of applications, it is desirable to understand how this quantity changes under a quantum process. By considering a general unitary channel, we establish a bound on the generalized relative entropies (Renyi and Tsallis) between the output and the input of the channel. As an application of our bounds, we derive a family of quantum speed limits based on relative entropies. Possible connections between this family with thermodynamics, quantum coherence, asymmetry, and single-shot information theory are briefly discussed.

TI Distributing long-distance trust in optomechanics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Quantum steering displays an inherent asymmetric property that differs from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Besides being of fundamental interest, steering is relevant to many asymmetric quantum information tasks. Here, we propose a scheme to generate and manipulate Gaussian quantum steering between two spatially distant mechanical modes of two optomechanical cavities coupled via an optical fiber and driven by blue detuned lasers. In the unresolved sideband regime, we show, under realistic experimental conditions, that strong asymmetric steering can be generated between the two considered modes. Also, we show that one-way steering can be achieved and practically manipulated through the lasers drive powers and the temperatures of the cavities. Further, we reveal that the direction of one-way steering depends on the sign of the difference between the energies of the mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss how to access the generated steering. This work opens up new perspectives for the distribution of long-distance trust which is of great interest in secure quantum communication.

TI Enhancing the coherence of superconducting quantum bits with electric
   fields
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In the endeavor to make quantum computers a reality, integrated superconducting circuits have become a promising architecture. A major challenge of this approach is decoherence originating from spurious atomic tunneling defects at the interfaces of qubit electrodes, which may resonantly absorb energy from the qubit's oscillating electric field and reduce the qubit's energy relaxation time T-1. Here, we show that qubit coherence can be improved by tuning dominating defects away from the qubit resonance using an applied DC-electric field. We demonstrate a method that optimizes the applied field bias and enhances the average qubit T-1 time by 23%. We also discuss how local gate electrodes can be implemented in superconducting quantum processors to enable simultaneous in situ coherence optimization of individual qubits.

TI Single photon superradiance enhanced light-matter interaction in
   spatially ordered shape and volume controlled single quantum dots:
   enabling on-chip photonic networks
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nanometer scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weak CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, an enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to similar to 30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM findings provides corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by similar to 2.5-3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to mid-infrared wavelength range.

TI Reaching the equilibrium state of the frustrated triangular Ising magnet
   Ca3Co2O6
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Ca3Co2O6 is a frustrated magnet consisting of a triangular arrangement of chains of Ising spins. It shows regular magnetization steps versus magnetic field every 1.2 T that are metastable with very slow dynamics. This has puzzled the community for many years and given rise to numerous potential theories. Here we approach the problem by seeking the elusive magnetic equilibrium state at T = 2 K. To this end, we explore two approaches: (1) bypassing the slow dynamics produced by changing fields by instead field-cooling directly to the target temperature and (2) quantum annealing in transverse magnetic fields. While we observe no measurable effect of the quantum annealing in fields up to 7 T, which is likely due to the large Ising anisotropy of Co spins in this material, we find that for the field cooling in longitudinal fields we achieve the predicted equilibrium 1/3 magnetization. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state phase diagram and we also simulate the quantum annealing process and find good agreement between experiment and theory. Thus we present an investigation of the elusive ground state properties of the canonical frustrated triangular system Ca3Co2O6.

TI A General and Modular Approach to Solid-State Integration of

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Here, we present an all-electrical readout mechanism for quasi-0D quantum states (0D-QS), such as point defects, adatoms, and molecules, that is modular and general, providing an approach that is amenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum technologies. Our approach relies on the creation of high-quality tunnel junctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multilayer graphene (MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target system in an MLG/hBN/0D-QS/hBN/MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for all-electronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate systems through a combination of coulomb and spin-blockade. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate electronic tunneling spectroscopy of point defects in hBN and the molecular qubit vanadyl phthalocyanine. Our approach demonstrates a new pathway for the incorporation of molecules and atomic defects into solid-state quantum devices and circuits along with a readout scheme that does not rely on highly constrained optical processes for photonic readout.

TI Limits and security of free-space quantum communications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The study of free-space quantum communications requires tools from quantum information theory, optics, and turbulence theory. Here we combine these tools to bound the ultimate rates for key and entanglement distribution through a free-space link, where the propagation of quantum systems is generally affected by diffraction, atmospheric extinction, turbulence, pointing errors, and background noise. Besides establishing ultimate limits, we also show that the composable secret-key rate achievable by a suitable (pilot-guided and postselected) coherent-state protocol is sufficiently close to these limits, therefore showing the suitability of free-space channels for high-rate quantum key distribution. Our paper provides analytical tools for assessing the composable finite-size security of coherent-state protocols in general conditions from the standard assumption of a stable communication channel (as is typical in fiber-based connections) to the more challenging scenario of a fading channel (as is typical in free-space links).

TI Parametric-Resonance Entangling Gates with a Tunable Coupler
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-fidelity parametric gates have been demonstrated with superconducting qubits via rf flux modulation of the qubit frequency. The modulation however leads to renormalization of the bare qubit-qubit coupling, thereby reducing the gate speed. Here, we realize a parametric-resonance gate, which is activated by bringing the average frequency of the modulated qubit in resonance with a static-frequency qubit while approximately retaining the bare qubit-qubit coupling. The activation of parametric-resonance gates does not depend on the frequency of modulation, allowing us to choose the modulation frequencies and avoid frequency collisions. Moreover, we show that this approach is compatible with tunable coupler architectures, which reduce always-on residual couplings. Using these techniques, we demonstrate iSWAP and controlled-Z gates between two qubits coupled via a tunable coupler with average process fidelities as high as 99.3% and 97.9%, respectively. The flexibility in activating parametric-resonance gates combined with a tunable coupler architecture provides a pathway for building large-scale quantum computers.

AB The development of quantum computing is following a substantial growth. This leads us closer to the implementation of practical solutions based on quantum software that address problems that are not computable by classical software in a practical timeframe. Hence, some companies will need to adapt their development practices and, so, their information systems to take advantage of quantum computing. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of tools, frameworks, and processes to support the evolution of current systems towards the combination of the quantum and classical paradigms into information systems. Hence, this paper presents a reverse engineering technique to generate abstract models based on the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) by analyzing quantum software written in OpenQASM3. The main implication is that KDM models represent, in a technology-agnostic way, the different components and interrelationships of quantum software. These models then can be used to restructure and redesign the target hybrid information system.

TI Triggered Single-Photon Emission of Resonantly Excited Quantum Dots
   Grown on (111)B GaAs Substrate
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB In the recent decades, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have proven to be valuable candidates as sources for various photonic applications. Of particular interest are, due to their wide-ranging applicability in quantum communication and computation, indistinguishable photons as well as entangled photon pairs, which can be emitted on demand. The latter require highly symmetric QDs with a small to vanishing excitonic fine-structure splitting. Herein, quantum optical properties of QDs grown via molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on (111)B-GaAs substrate are reported to study their emission in terms of triggered single-photon emission under quasi-resonant p-shell excitation, and under strict resonant s-shell excitation. The investigations reveal very good emission properties of these types of QDs, especially under s-shell resonant excitation. In fact, the results yield almost background-free triggered single photons with excellent multiphoton suppression associated with g((2))(0) = (0.033 +/- 0.027) and a degree of indistinguishability of (41 +/- 10)%. The achieved results underline the high optical quality of (111)-QDs and show their high potential for applications in photonic quantum technologies.

TI On good encodings for quantum annealer and digital optimization solvers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Several optimization solvers inspired by quantum annealing have been recently developed, either running on actual quantum hardware or simulating it on traditional digital computers. Industry and academics look at their potential in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Formally, they provide heuristic solutions for Ising models, which are equivalent to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Constraints on solutions feasibility need to be properly encoded. We experiment on different ways of performing such an encoding. As benchmark we consider the cardinality constrained quadratic knapsack problem (CQKP), a minimal extension of QUBO with one inequality and one equality constraint. We consider different strategies of constraints penalization and variables encoding. We compare three QUBO solvers: quantum annealing on quantum hardware (D-Wave Advantage), probabilistic algorithms on digital hardware and mathematical programming solvers. We analyze their QUBO resolution quality and time, and the persistence values extracted in the quantum annealing sampling process. Our results show that a linear penalization of CQKP inequality improves current best practice. Furthermore, using such a linear penalization, persistence values produced by quantum hardware in a generic way allow to match a specific CQKP metric from literature. They are therefore suitable for general purpose variable fixing in core algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

TI Inqasm: InQuIR compiler to NetQASM
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field, with almost every aspect open to change or improvement. This includes moving from using a single quantum processing unit to interconnecting multiple quantum processing units (or several of them), establishing a new paradigm called distributed quantum computing and increasing the overall computing capability. Some research is already underway in this area to prepare the ground for an eventual architecture with these characteristics. This is the case of InQuIR (Nishio and Wakizaka in arXiv:2302.00267 2023) and NetQASM (Dahlberg et al in QST 7:035023 2022), two languages developed for distributed quantum computing. This paper presents the development of the InQASM compiler with the aim of translating code from the InQuIR language to NetQASM, establishing a compilation stack for the new distributed paradigm. An example of this compilation and a simulation of the compiled code are shown to showcase it.

TI Time delay of mean-field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gases
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Mean-field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in a thermal Rydberg gas. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gases, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criterion and monogamy relation via
   correlation matrices in tripartite systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum steering is considered one of the most well-known nonlocal phenomena in quantum mechanics. Unlike entanglement and Bell nonlocality, the asymmetry of quantum steering makes it vital for one-sided device-independent quantum information processing. Although there has been much progress on steering detection for bipartite systems, the criterion for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in tripartite systems remains challenging and inadequate. In this paper we first derive a promising steering criterion for any three-qubit states via correlation matrix. Furthermore, we propose the monogamy relation between the tripartite steering of system and the bipartite steering of subsystems based on the derived criterion. Finally, as illustrations, we demonstrate the performance of the steering criterion and the monogamy relation by means of several representative examples. We believe that the results and methods presented in this work could be beneficial to capture genuine multipartite steering in the near future.

TI Detection rate dependence of the inherent detection efficiency in
   single-photon detectors based on avalanche diodes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Single-photon detectors are a pivotal component in photonic quantum technologies. A precise and comprehensive calibration of the inherent detection efficiency is of utmost importance to ensure the proper evaluation of the performance in view of the specific technological application of interest, such as the protection against security breaches in quantum cryptographic solutions. Here we report on a systematic study and comprehensive analysis of the estimation of the inherent detection efficiency of two commercial single-photon detectors based on single-photon avalanche diodes for various mean photon numbers and at high laser pulse repetition rates using different techniques. We observe an unexpected and significant drop in the inherent detection efficiency at detection rates of 10% and higher relative to the maximum detection rate. It is demonstrated that for data analysis a statistical model for the detection rate conveniently can be used if no time-stamped data are available. We conclude that the full characterization of single-photon detectors used in critical applications should include the sensitivity of their inherent detection efficiency to high event rates.

TI Highly sensitive and efficient 1550 nm photodetector for room
   temperature operation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Photonic quantum technologies such as effective quantum communication require room temperature (RT) operating single- or few-photon sensors with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photodetectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. However, for superior performance, a trade-off has to be made between temperature of operation, device thickness, and EQE. Two-dimensional (2D) materials can be used to reduce the absorber thickness and thus dark current, leading to an increase in the operating temperature, but they suffer from low EQE. We use specifically stacked bilayer hexagonal BAs, with material properties calculated from first principles, on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by three orders of magnitude at RT and maintain an EQE of >99%. The device can potentially be used in avalanche mode and hence can form a basis for single photon detection. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Realization of a Multi-Output Quantum Pulse Gate for Decoding
   High-Dimensional Temporal Modes of Single-Photon States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Temporal modes (TMs) of photons provide an appealing high-dimensional encoding basis for quantum information. While techniques to generate TM states have been established, high-dimensional decoding of single-photon TMs remains an open challenge. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate demulti-plexing of five-dimensional TMs of single photons with an average fidelity of 0.96 +/- 0.01, characterized via measurement tomography. This is achieved with use of a newly developed device, the multi-output quantum pulse gate (MQPG). We demonstrate a proof-of-principle complete decoder based on the MQPG that operates on any basis from a set of six five-dimensional mutually unbiased bases and is therefore suitable as a receiver for high-dimensional quantum key distribution. Furthermore, we confirm the high -quality operation of the MQPG by performing resource-efficient state tomography with an average fidelity of 0.98 +/- 0.02.

TI Quantum state interrogation using a preshaped free electron wavefunction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a comprehensive theory for interrogation of the quantum state of a two-level system (TLS) based on a free-electron-bound-electron resonant interaction scheme. The scheme is based on free electrons, whose quantum electron wavefunction is preshaped or optically modulated by lasers in an electron microscope setup and then inelastically scattered by a quantum TLS target (e.g., atom, quantum dot, and crystal defect center) upon traversing in proximity to the target. Measurement of the postinteraction energy spectrum of the electrons probes and quantifies the full Bloch sphere parameters of a pre-excited TLS and enables coherent control of the qubit states. The exceptional advantage of this scheme over laser-based ones is atomic-scale spatial resolution of addressing individual TLS targets. Thus, this scheme opens horizons for electron microscopy in material interrogation and quantum information technology.

AB The optimal control of open quantum systems is a challenging task but has a key role in improving existing quantum information processing technologies. We introduce a general framework based on reinforcement learning to discover optimal thermodynamic cycles that maximize the power of out-of-equilibrium quantum heat engines and refrigerators. We apply our method, based on the soft actor-critic algorithm, to three systems: a benchmark two-level system heat engine, where we find the optimal known cycle; an experimentally realistic refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit that generates coherence, where we find a non-intuitive control sequence that outperforms previous cycles proposed in literature; a heat engine based on a quantum harmonic oscillator, where we find a cycle with an elaborate structure that outperforms the optimized Otto cycle. We then evaluate the corresponding efficiency at maximum power.

TI Robustness of dynamic quantum control: Differential sensitivity bounds
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Dynamic control via optimized, piecewise-constant pulses is a common paradigm for open-loop control to implement quantum gates. While numerous methods exist for the synthesis of such controls, there are many open questions regarding the robustness of the resulting control schemes in the presence of model uncertainty; unlike in classical control, there are generally no analytical guarantees on the control performance with respect to inexact modeling of the system. In this paper, a new robustness measure based on the differential sensitivity of the gate fidelity error to parametric (structured) uncertainties is introduced, and bounds on the differential sensitivity to parametric uncertainties are used to establish performance guarantees for optimal controllers for a variety of quantum gate types, system sizes, and control implementations. Specifically, it is shown how a maximum allowable perturbation over a set of Hamiltonian uncertainties that guarantees a given fidelity error can be reliably computed. This measure of robustness is inversely proportional to the upper bound on the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error evaluated under nominal operating conditions. Finally, the results show that the nominal fidelity error and differential sensitivity upper bound are positively correlated across a wide range of problems and control implementations, suggesting that in the high-fidelity control regime, rather than there being a trade-off between fidelity and robustness, higher nominal gate fidelities are positively correlated with increased robustness of the controls in the presence of parametric uncertainties.

TI Simulating Quantum Instruments with Projective Measurements and Quantum
   Postprocessing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum instruments describe both the classical outcome and the updated state associated with a quantum measurement. We ask whether these processes can be simulated using only a natural subset of resources, namely projective measurements on the system and quantum processing of the postmeasurement states. We show that the simulability of instruments can be connected to an entanglement classification problem. This leads to a computationally efficient necessary condition for simulation of generic instruments and to a complete characterisation for qubits. We use this to address relevant quantum information tasks, namely (i) the noise tolerance of standard qubit unsharp measurements, (ii) nonprojective advantages in information-disturbance trade-offs, and (iii) increased sequential Bell inequality violations under projective measurements. Moreover, we consider also d-dimensional L & uuml;ders instruments that correspond to weak versions of standard basis measurements and show that for large d these can permit scalable noise advantages over projective implementations.

TI Quantum Thermal Amplifiers with Engineered Dissipation
SO ENTROPY
AB A three-terminal device, able to control the heat currents flowing through it, is known as a quantum thermal transistor whenever it amplifies two output currents as a response to the external source acting on its third terminal. Several efforts have been proposed in the direction of addressing different engineering options of the configuration of the system. Here, we adhere to the scheme in which such a device is implemented as a three-qubit system that interacts with three separate thermal baths. However, another interesting direction is how to engineer the thermal reservoirs to magnify the current amplification. Here, we derive a quantum dynamical equation for the evolution of the system to study the role of distinct dissipative thermal noises. We compare the amplification gain in different configurations and analyze the role of the correlations in a system exhibiting the thermal transistor effect, via measures borrowed from the quantum information theory.

TI General Mixed-State Quantum Data Compression With and Without
   Entanglement Assistance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We consider the most general finite-dimensional quantum mechanical information source, which is given by a quantum system A that is correlated with a reference system R. The task is to compress A in such a way as to reproduce the joint source state rho(AR) at the decoder with asymptotically high fidelity. This includes Schumacher's original quantum source coding problem of a pure state ensemble and that of a single pure entangled state, as well as general mixed state ensembles. Here, we determine the optimal compression rate (in qubits per source system) in terms of the Koashi-Imoto decomposition of the source into a classical, a quantum, and a redundant part. The same decomposition yields the optimal rate in the presence of unlimited entanglement between compressor and decoder, and indeed the full region of feasible qubit-ebit rate pairs.

TI Magnetic Gradient Fluctuations from Quadrupolar 73Ge in
   Si/SiGe Exchange-Only Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the time-fluctuating magnetic gradient noise mechanisms in pairs of Si/SiGe quantum dots using exchange echo noise spectroscopy. We find through a combination of spectral inversion and correspondence to theoretical modeling that quadrupolar precession of the Ge-73 nuclei play a key role in the spin-echo decay time T-2, with a characteristic dependence on the magnetic field and the width of the Si quantum well. The Ge-73 noise peaks appear at the fundamental and first harmonic of the Ge-73 Larmor resonance, superimposed over 1/f noise due to Si-29 dipole-dipole dynamics, and are dependent on material epitaxy and the applied magnetic field. These results may inform the needs of dynamical decoupling when using Si/SiGe quantum dots as qubits in quantum information processing devices.

TI Property-guided inverse design of metal-organic frameworks using quantum
   natural language processing
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language processing (QNLP) for property-guided inverse design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures consisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and CO2 Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e., the bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and CO2 Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore volume and CO2 Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 97.75% for pore volume and 90% for CO2 Henry's constant, respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of MOFs.

TI High-fidelity distribution of triggered polarization-entangled telecom
   photons via a 36 km intra-city fiber network
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Fiber-based distribution of triggered, entangled, single-photon pairs is a key requirement for the future development of terrestrial quantum networks. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for deterministic sources of on-demand polarization-entangled photon pairs. So far, the best QD polarization-entangled-pair sources emit in the near-infrared wavelength regime, where the transmission distance in deployed fibers is limited. Here, to be compatible with existing fiber network infrastructures, bi-directional polarization-conserving quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is employed to convert the QD emission from 780 nm to telecom wavelengths. We show the preservation of polarization entanglement after QFC (fidelity to Bell state F phi+,conv = 0.972 +/- 0.003) of the biexciton transition. As a step toward real-world applicability, high entanglement fidelities (F phi+,loop = 0.945 +/- 0.005) after the propagation of one photon of the entangled pair along a 35.8 km field-installed standard single mode fiber link are reported. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a second polarization-conserving QFC step back to 780 nm preserving entanglement (F phi+,back = 0.903 +/- 0.005). This further prepares the way for interfacing quantum light to various quantum memories. Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Bipartite entanglement and Gaussian quantum steering in a whispering
   gallery mode coupled with two magnon modes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme to generate and control continuous variable bipartite entanglement and Gaussian quantum steering in an optical whispering gallery mode (WGM)-based cavity optomagnonical system that consists of two macroscopic YIG resonator. Owing to the well-known Faraday effect, both the magnon modes are coupled to single-mode optical WGM through nonlinear interaction. We investigate in detail the impact of several physical parameters such as effective cavity detuning, input laser power, environment temperature, optomagnonical coupling strengths and magnon decay rate on different bipartite entanglement. We also found a suitable parameter regime to obtain maximum cavity-magnon and magnon-magnon bipartite entanglement in our proposed system. It is interesting to note that the numerical simulation result shows that magnon-magnon entanglement persists up to 60K. With a proper choice of optomagnonical coupling strengths and normalized effective cavity detuning, we can effectively control the nature and strength of Gaussian quantum steering. In the WGM-based cavity optomagnonical system, our current work will offer a new way of greatly controlling a variety of nonclassical quantum correlations of macroscopic objects, which may find use in a number of contemporary quantum technology fields.

TI Phase-Driving Hole Spin Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The spin-orbit interaction in spin qubits enables spin-flip transitions, resulting in Rabi oscillations when an external microwave field is resonant with the qubit frequency. Here, we introduce an alternative driving mechanism mediated by the strong spin-orbit interactions in hole spin qubits, where a far-detuned oscillating field couples to the qubit phase. Phase-driving at radio frequencies, orders of magnitude slower than the microwave qubit frequency, induces highly nontrivial spin dynamics, violating the Rabi resonance condition. By using a qubit integrated in a silicon fin field-effect transistor, we demonstrate a controllable suppression of resonant Rabi oscillations and their revivals at tunable sidebands. These sidebands enable alternative qubit control schemes using global fields and local far-detuned pulses, facilitating the design of dense large-scale qubit architectures with local qubit addressability. Phase-driving also decouples Rabi oscillations from noise, an effect due to a gapped Floquet spectrum and can enable Floquet engineering high-fidelity gates in future quantum processors.

TI Quantum physics cannot be captured by classical linear hidden variable
   theories even in the absence of entanglement
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Recent experimental tests of Bell inequalities confirm that entangled quantum systems cannot be described by local classical theories but still do not answer the question whether or not quantum systems could, in principle, be modeled by linear hidden variable theories. In this paper, we study the quantum trajectories of a single qubit that experiences a sequence of repeated generalized measurements. It is shown that this system, which constitutes a hidden quantum Markov model, is more likely to produce complex time correlations than any classical hidden Markov model with two output symbols. From this, we conclude that quantum physics cannot be replaced by linear hidden variable theories. Indeed, it has already been recognized that not only entanglement but also non-classical time correlations of quantum systems with quantum feedback are a valuable resource for quantum technology applications.

TI Proposal for sequential Stern-Gerlach experiment with programmable
   quantum processors
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The historical significance of the Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment lies in its provision of the initial evidence for space quantization. Over time, its sequential form has evolved into an elegant paradigm that effectively illustrates the fundamental principles of quantum theory. To date, the practical implementation of the sequential SG experiment has not been fully achieved. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of programmable quantum processors to simulate the sequential SG experiment. The specific parametric shallow quantum circuits, which are suitable for the limitations of current noisy quantum hardware, are given to replicate the functionality of SG devices with the ability to perform measurements in different directions. Surprisingly, it has been demonstrated that Wigner's SG interferometer can be readily implemented in our sequential quantum circuit. With the utilization of the identical circuits, it is also feasible to implement Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment. We propose the utilization of cross-shaped programmable quantum processors to showcase sequential experiments, and the simulation results demonstrate a strong alignment with theoretical predictions. With the rapid advancement of cloud-based quantum computing, such as BAQIS Quafu, it is our belief that the proposed solution is well-suited for deployment on the cloud, allowing for public accessibility. Our findings not only expand the potential applications of quantum computers, but also contribute to a deeper comprehension of the fundamental principles underlying quantum theory.

According to the existing data of electron interference experiments in electron microscopes, the values of the parameters in our effective theory are chosen. With these values, we find that weak decoherence by vacuum fluctuations may have blurred the interference pattern in Ref. [1].

TI Accurate quantum-centric simulations of intermolecular interactions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Modelling and simulating non-covalent interactions is challenging, as they are inherently weak, dynamic, and system-specific. Common predictive methods often require trading the accuracy for reducing the otherwise cumbersome computational cost. To date, the most accurate approaches, achieving chemical accuracy, rely on quantum mechanical descriptions of non-covalent interactions, which limits their scalability. Whether quantum computing could overcome these limitations is still unclear, as such methods need to be redesigned for quantum hardware. Here, we take the first step in this direction by presenting quantum-centric simulations of non-covalent interactions using a supramolecular approach for binding energy calculations. We use a sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) approach to simulate the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the water and methane dimers, featuring hydrogen bond and dispersion interactions, respectively. We benchmark our quantum simulations (27- and 36-qubit circuits) against classical methods, registering deviations within 1.000 kcal/mol from the leading ones. Finally, we test the limits of the quantum methods for capturing dispersion interactions with an experiment on 54 qubits. Beyond reaching state-of-the-art accuracy, our work lays out a framework for electronic structure calculations of non-covalent interactions on quantum hardware.

TI Lightweight Quantum Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in the Smart
   Grid Environment
SO ENTROPY
AB Smart grids leverage smart terminal devices to collect information from the user side, achieving accurate load forecasting and optimized dispatching of power systems, effectively improving power supply efficiency and reliability while reducing energy consumption. However, the development of quantum technology poses severe challenges to the communication security of smart grids that rely on traditional cryptography. To address this security risk in the quantum era, this paper draws on the core idea of quantum private comparison and proposes a quantum-secure identity authentication and key agreement scheme suitable for smart grids. This scheme uses Bell states as quantum resources, combines hash functions and XOR operations, and can adapt to resource-constrained terminal devices. Through a security proof, it verifies the scheme's ability to resist various attacks; the experimental results further show that the scheme still has good robustness in different noise environments, providing a feasible technical path for the secure communication of smart grids in the quantum environment and having clear practical engineering value.

TI Quantum community detection via deterministic elimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a quantum algorithm for calculating the structural properties of complex networks and graphs. The corresponding protocol-deteQt-is designed to perform large-scale community and botnet detection, where a specific subgraph of a larger graph is identified based on its properties. We construct a workflow relying on ground state preparation of the network modularity matrix or graph Laplacian. The corresponding maximum modularity vector is encoded into a log2(N)-qubit register that contains community information. We develop a strategy for "signing" this vector via quantum signal processing, such that it closely resembles a hypergraph state, and project it onto a suitable linear combination of such states to detect botnets. As part of the workflow, and of potential independent interest, we present a readout technique that allows filtering out the incorrect solutions deterministically. This can reduce the scaling for the number of samples from exponential to polynomial. The approach serves as a building block for graph analysis with quantum speedup and enables the cybersecurity of large-scale networks.

TI Quantum and classical annealing in a continuous space with multiple
   local minima
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The protocol of quantum annealing is applied to an optimization problem with a one-dimensional continuous degree of freedom, a variant of the problem proposed by Shinomoto and Kabashima. The energy landscape has a number of local minima, and the classical approach of simulated annealing is predicted to have a logarithmically slow convergence to the global minimum. We show by extensive numerical analyses that quantum annealing yields a power-law convergence, thus an exponential improvement over simulated annealing. The power is larger, and thus the convergence is faster, than a prediction by an existing phenomenological theory for this problem. Performance of simulated annealing is shown to be enhanced by introducing quasiglobal searches across energy barriers, leading to a power-law convergence but with a smaller power than in the quantum case and thus a slower convergence classically even with quasiglobal search processes. We also reveal how diabatic quantum dynamics, quantum tunneling in particular, steers the systems toward the global minimum by a meticulous choice of annealing schedule. This latter result explicitly contrasts the role of tunneling in quantum annealing against the classical counterpart of stochastic optimization by simulated annealing.

TI Two-Party Quantum Private Comparison with Pauli Operators
SO AXIOMS
AB Quantum private comparison (QPC) is a quantum cryptographic protocol designed to enable two mutually distrustful parties to securely compare sensitive data without disclosing their private information to each other or any external entities. This study proposes a novel QPC protocol that leverages Bell states to ensure data privacy, utilizing the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Within this framework, two participants, each possessing a secret integer, encode the binary representation of their values using Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators applied to quantum states transmitted from a semi-honest third party (TP). The TP, which is bound to protocol compliance and prohibited from colluding with either participant, measures the received sequences to determine the comparison result without accessing the participants' original inputs. Theoretical analyses and simulations validate the protocol's strong security, high efficiency, and practical feasibility in quantum computing environments. An advantage of the proposed protocol lies in its optimized utilization of Bell states, which enhances qubit efficiency and experimental practicality. Moreover, the proposed protocol outperforms several existing Bell-state-based QPC schemes in terms of efficiency.

TI Selective Generation of Luminescent Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Single photon emitters from atomic defects in crystals like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are vital for quantum technologies. Although various techniques are devised to obtain defects emission in hBN, simultaneous control over defects position, type, and emission spectrum has not been achieved yet. Here, ion implantation with 12C, 20Ne, and 69Ga are used to create a composite defects population with emission approximate to 820 nm. The correlation of Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy helps to identify the defects' type. After selecting Ga as the ion species yielding the maximum emitter brightness, a strategy based on thermal annealing is developed to modify the composition of the induced defects. This results in an emitter ensemble with selected spectral properties, even when starting from different implantation conditions. Specifically, thermal annealing induces a defect transmutation from one type to another, shifting the emission wavelength from 820 to 625 nm. Moreover, sample patterning is combined with focused ion beam implantation and subsequent annealing in an efficient method to deterministically set the defects position as well as the PL spectral composition. These results offer a practical avenue to achieve in situ positioning and tuning of ensembles of emitters in hBN, promising for quantum information and sensing applications.
   Through a combination of ion implantation and thermal annealing, a dramatical wavelength tuning and enhancement of the emission from defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is demonstrated, whose atomic structures' insights are provided by Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, a focused ion beam allows to further control the position of the defects, with the potential of a full control over emitters for quantum applications. image

TI Controlling Rydberg Excitations Using Ion-Core Transitions in
   Alkaline-Earth Atom-Tweezer Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Scalable local control over gate operations is an outstanding challenge in the field of quantum computing and programmable quantum simulation with Rydberg-atom arrays. One approach is to use a global field to excite atoms to the Rydberg state and tune individual atoms in and out of resonance via local light shifts. In this work, we point out that photon-scattering errors from light shifts can be significantly reduced if the light shift is applied to the Rydberg state instead of the ground state, which can be realized in Rydberg states of alkaline-earth atoms using optical transitions in the ion core. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate global control of Rydberg excitations in an Yb optical-tweezer array via light shifts induced by a laser tuned near the Yb+ 6s -> 6(p1/2) transition. We also perform detailed spectroscopy of the induced light shift and scattering rates of the 6sns S-3(1) Rydberg states and reveal the existence of satellite lines where losses from autoionization are strongly suppressed. This work can be readily extended to implement local gate operations in Rydberg-atom arrays.

AB Unlike classical computing, quantum program verification (QPV) is much more challenging due to the non-duplicability of quantum states that collapse after measurement. Prior approaches rely on deductive verification that shows poor scalability. Or they require exhaustive assertions that cannot ensure the program is correct for all inputs. In this paper, we propose MorphQPV, a confident assertion-based verification methodology. Our key insight is to leverage the isomorphism in quantum programs, which implies a structure-preserve relation between the program runtime states. In the assertion statement, we define a tracepoint pragma to label the verified quantum state and an assume-guarantee primitive to specify the expected relation between states. Then, we characterize the ground-truth relation between states using an isomorphism-based approximation, which can effectively obtain the program states under various inputs while avoiding repeated executions. Finally, the verification is formulated as a constraint optimization problem with a confidence estimation model to enable rigorous analysis. Experiments suggest that MorphQPV reduces the number of program executions by 107.9x when verifying the 27-qubit quantum lock algorithm and improves the probability of success by 3.3x-9.9x when debugging five benchmarks.

TI Spinor Matter-Wave Control with Nanosecond Spin-Dependent Kicks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Significant aspects of advanced quantum technology today rely on rapid control of atomic matterwaves with hyperfine Raman transitions. Unfortunately, efficient Raman excitations are usually accompanied by uncompensated dynamic phases and coherent spin leakages, preventing accurate and repetitive transfer of recoil momentum to large samples. We provide a systematic study to demonstrate that the limitations can be substantially overcome by dynamically programming an adiabatic pulse sequence. Experimentally, counterpropagating frequency-chirped pulses are programmed on an optical delay line to parallelly drive five Am = 0 hyperfine Raman transitions of 85Rb atoms for spin-dependent kick (SDK) within r = 40 ns, with an fSDK approximate to 97.6% inferred fidelity. Aided by numerical modeling, we demonstrate that by alternating the chirps of successive pulses in a balanced fashion, accumulation of nonadiabatic errors including the spin leakages can be managed, while the dynamic phases can be robustly cancelled. Operating on a phase-stable delay line, the method supports precise, fast, and flexible control of spinor matterwave with efficient Raman excitations.

TI Succinct Description and Efficient Simulation of Non-Markovian Open
   Quantum Systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Non-Markovian open quantum systems represent the most general dynamics when the quantum system is coupled with a bath environment. The quantum dynamics arising from many important applications are non-Markovian. Although for special cases, such as Hamiltonian evolution and Lindblad evolution, quantum simulation algorithms have been extensively studied, efficient quantum simulations for the dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems remain underexplored. The most immediate obstacle for studying such systems is the lack of a universal succinct description of their dynamics. In this work, we fulfill the gap of studying such dynamics by (1) providing a succinct representation of the dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems with quantifiable error, and (2) developing an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating such dynamics with cost O(t polylog(t/is an element of)) for evolution time t and precision is an element of. Our derivation of the succinct representation is based on stochastic Schrodinger equations, which could lead to new alternatives to deal with open quantum systems as well.

TI Bounds on amplitude-damping-channel discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Amplitude-damping (AD) channels are good models for many physical scenarios, and so the development of protocols to discriminate between them is an important task in quantum information science. It is therefore important to bound the performance of such protocols. Since adaptivity has been shown to improve the performance of discrimination protocols, bounds on the distinguishability of AD channels must take this into account. In this paper, we use both channel simulation and a bound based on the diamond norm to significantly tighten the upper bound on the trace norm between the possible outputs of binary channel discrimination protocols acting on AD channels (and hence the lower bound on the error probability of such protocols). The diamond norm between any two AD channels is found analytically, giving the optimal error probability for a one-shot discrimination protocol. We also present a tighter lower bound on the achievable trace norm between protocol outputs (and a corresponding upper bound on the achievable error probability). The upper and lower bounds are compared with existing bounds and then applied to quantum hacking and biological quantum sensing scenarios.

TI Non-volatile tuning of cryogenic silicon photonic micro-ring modulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computing, ultra-low-noise sensing, and high-energy physics experiments often rely on superconducting circuits or semiconductor qubits and devices operating at deep cryogenic temperatures (4K and below). Photonic integrated circuits and interconnects have been demonstrated for scalable communications and optical domain transduction in these systems. Due to energy and area constraints, many of these devices need enhanced light-matter interaction, provided by photonic resonators. A key challenge, however, for using these resonators is the sensitivity of resonance wavelength to process variations and thermal fluctuations. While thermo-optical tuning methods are typically employed at room temperature to mitigate this problem, the thermo-optic effect is ineffective at 4K. To address this issue, we demonstrate a non-volatile approach to tune the resonance of photonic resonators using integrated phase-change materials (PCMs) at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we report a 10 Gb/s free-carrier dispersion based resonant photonic modulator that can be tuned in a non-volatile fashion at sub-4K temperatures using a commercial silicon photonics process. This method paves the way for realizing scalable cryogenic integrated photonics with thousands of resonant devices for quantum and high-energy physics applications.

TI The Quantum Multiple-Access Channel With Cribbing Encoders
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.

TI Reducing two-level systems dissipations in 3D superconducting niobium
   resonators by atomic layer deposition and high temperature heat
   treatment
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubits have arisen as a leading technology platform for quantum computing, which is on the verge of revolutionizing the world's calculation capacities. Nonetheless, the fabrication of computationally reliable qubit circuits requires increasing the quantum coherence lifetimes, which are predominantly limited by the dissipations of two-level system defects present in the thin superconducting film and the adjacent dielectric regions. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency niobium resonators by atomic layer deposition of a 10 nm aluminum oxide Al2O3 thin films, followed by a high vacuum heat treatment at 650 degrees C for few hours. By probing the effect of several heat treatments on Al2O3-coated niobium samples by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy plus scanning and conventional high resolution transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we witness a dissolution of niobium native oxides and the modification of the Al2O3-Nb interface, which correlates with the enhancement of the quality factor at low fields of two 1.3 GHz niobium cavities coated with 10 nm of Al2O3.

TI High-fidelity entangling gates in a three-dimensional ion crystal under
   micromotion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB An ion trap is one of the most promising candidates for quantum computing. Current schemes mainly focus on a linear chain of up to about 100 ions in a Paul trap. To further scale up the qubit number, one possible direction is to use 2D or 3D ion crystals (Wigner crystals). In these systems, ions are generally subjected to large micromotion due to the strong fast-oscillating electric field, which can significantly influence the performance of entangling gates. In this paper, we develop an efficient numerical method to design high-fidelity entangling gates in a general 3D ion crystal. We present numerical algorithms to solve the equilibrium configuration of the ions and their collective normal modes. We then give a mathematical description of the micromotion and use it to generalize the gate scheme for linear ion chains into a general 3D crystal. The involved time integral of highly oscillatory functions is expanded into a fast-converging series for accurate and efficient evaluation and optimization. As a numerical example, we show a high-fidelity entangling gate design between two ions in a 100-ion crystal, with a theoretical fidelity above 99.9%.

TI Quantum Circuit Template Matching Optimization Method for Constrained
   Connectivity
SO AXIOMS
AB The execution of quantum algorithms requires two key considerations. On the one hand, it should meet the connectivity constraint requirements of quantum circuit mapping for quantum architectures, and on the other hand, it needs to consider reducing the probability of errors in the execution of quantum circuits as much as possible. This paper proposes a novel optimization technique based on template matching that to satisfy both requirements. The template matching optimization method can significantly reduce the number of gates in a quantum circuit and further enhance its practicality. It stands as advanced optimization technology available today. Our method optimizes quantum logic circuits mapped onto quantum architecture by initially selecting their linear substructure. We then zone the circuit according to the gate dependency graph and optimize each block through template matching. Finally, we reorganize the circuit to obtain the optimized version as the final result. Our proposed method is amenable to various quantum architectures. To evaluate its efficacy, we conduct a comparative analysis with the t|ket & rang; and Qiskit compiler using a set of benchmark test circuits. Specifically, compare to the t|ket & rang; compiler method, the highest average optimization rate of our method can reach 25.75%. Compare with the Qiskit compiler method, the highest average optimization rate can reach 32.72%. Overall, our approach has significant optimization advantages.

TI Multi-Dimensional Quantum Capacitance of the Two-Site Hubbard Model: The
   Role of Tunable Interdot Tunneling
SO ENTROPY
AB Few-electron states confined in quantum-dot arrays are key objects in quantum computing. The discrimination between these states is essential for the readout of a (multi-)qubit state, and can be achieved through a measurement of the quantum capacitance within the gate-reflectometry approach. For a system controlled by several gates, the dependence of the measured capacitance on the direction of the oscillations in the voltage space is captured by the quantum capacitance matrix. Herein, we apply this tool to study a double quantum dot coupled to three gates, which enable the tuning of both the bias and the tunneling between the two dots. Analytical solutions for the two-electron case are derived within a Hubbard model, showing the overall dependence of the quantum capacitance matrix on the applied gate voltages. In particular, we investigate the role of the tunneling gate and reveal the possibility of exploiting interdot coherences in addition to charge displacements between the dots. Our results can be directly applied to double-dot experimental setups, and pave the way for further applications to larger arrays of quantum dots.

TI Biexcitons-plasmon coupling of Ag@Au hollow nanocube/MoS2
   heterostructures based on scattering spectra
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The strong interaction between light and matter is one of the current research hotspots in the field of nanophotonics, and provides a suitable platform for fundamental physics research such as on nanolasers, high -precision sensing in biology, quantum communication and quantum computing. In this study, double Rabi splitting was achieved in a composite structure monolayer MoS2 and a single Ag@Au hollow nanocube (HNC) in room temperature mainly due to the two excitons in monolayer MoS2. Moreover, the tuning of the plasmon resonance peak was realized in the scattering spectrum by adjusting the thickness of the shell to ensure it matches the energy of the two excitons. Two distinct anticrossings are observed at both excitons resonances, and large double Rabi splittings (90 meV and 120 meV) are obtained successfully. The finite -difference time domain (FDTD) method was also used to simulate the scattering spectra of the nanostructures, and the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the local electromagnetic field ability of the Ag@Au hollow HNC was proved to be stronger by calculating and comparing the mode volume of different nanoparticles. Our findings provides a good platform for the realization of strong multi -mode coupling and open up a new way to construct nanoscale photonic devices.

TI Mitigating measurement errors in multiqubit experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reducing measurement errors in multiqubit quantum devices is critical for performing any quantum algorithm. Here we show how to mitigate measurement errors by a classical postprocessing of the measured outcomes. Our techniques apply to any experiment where measurement outcomes are used for computing expected values of observables. Two error-mitigation schemes are presented based on tensor product and correlatedMarkovian noise models. Error rates parametrizing these noise models can be extracted from the measurement calibration data using a simple formula. Error mitigation is achieved by applying the inverse noise matrix to a probability vector that represents the outcomes of a noisy measurement. The error-mitigation overhead, including the number of measurements and the cost of the classical postprocessing, is exponential in epsilon n, where epsilon is the maximum error rate and n is the number of qubits. We report experimental demonstration of our error-mitigation methods on IBM Quantum devices using stabilizer measurements for graph states with n <= 12 qubits and entangled 20-qubit states generated by low-depth random Clifford circuits.

TI Superconducting on-chip microwave cavity for tunable hybrid systems with
   optically trapped Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges in quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically nontrivial since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work toward a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultracold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We present detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in 87Rb atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results highlight the considerations required for realizing a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.

TI Revisiting Higher-Order Masked Comparison for Lattice-Based
   Cryptography: Algorithms and Bit-Sliced Implementations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Marked comparison is one of the most expensive operations in side-channel secure implementations of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography, especially for higher masking orders. First, we introduce two new masked comparison algorithms, which improve the arithmetic comparison of D'Anvers et al. (2021) and the hybrid comparison method of Coron et al. (2021) respectively. We then look into implementation-specific optimizations, and show that small specific adaptations can have a significant impact on the overall performance. Finally, we implement various state-of-the-art comparison algorithms and benchmark them on the same platform (ARM-Cortex M4) to allow a fair comparison between them. We improve on the arithmetic comparison of D'Anvers et al. with a factor asymptotic to 20% by using Galois Field multiplications and the hybrid comparison of Coron et al. with a factor asymptotic to 25% by streamlining the design. Our implementation-specific improvements allow a speedup of a straightforward comparison implementation of asymptotic to 33%. We discuss the differences between the various algorithms and provide the implementations and a testing framework to ease future research.

TI Optimal lattice depth on lifetime of D-band ultracold atoms in a
   triangular optical lattice
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a flexible and effective platform for quantum precision measurement, and the lifetime of high-band atoms is an essential parameter for the performance of quantum sensors. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the lattice depth and the lifetime of D-band atoms in a triangular optical lattice and show that there is an optimal lattice depth for the maximum lifetime. After loading the Bose-Einstein condensate into D band of optical lattice by shortcut method, we observe the atomic distribution in quasi-momentum space for the different evolution time, and measure the atomic lifetime at D band with different lattice depths. The lifetime is maximized at an optimal lattice depth, where the overlaps between the wave function of D band and other bands (mainly S band) are minimized. Additionally, we discuss the influence of atomic temperature on lifetime. These experimental results are in agreement with our numerical simulations. This work paves the way to improve coherence properties of optical lattices, and contributes to the implications for the development of quantum precision measurement, quantum communication, and quantum computing.

TI Raman signatures of single point defects in hexagonal boron nitride
   quantum emitters
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations. The ability to resolve spin configurations offers a pathway to identifying defects with spins suitable for quantum sensing. Finally, an experimental concept using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has been proposed in this work. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experimental framework to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials with spin configurations specific to any quantum application.

TI Quantum phase transition in the one-dimensional Dicke-Hubbard model with
   coupled qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We use a numerical method combining the cluster mean-field theory and the matrix product state to study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional two-qubit Dicke-Hubbard model with XY qubit-qubit interaction. When counterrotating wave terms (CRTs) in the qubit-cavity coupling are neglected, we observe a rich phase diagram including a quantum phase transition between the Mott-insulating phase and the superfluid phase. This phase transition can be either first-order or the second-order type depending on whether the total angular momentum changes across the phase boundary. The finite qubit-qubit interaction gives rise to the emergence of two quantum triple points at which three different phases coexist. The structure of this phase diagram remains unchanged even when CRTs are considered.

TI Generation of Spin Defects by Ion Implantation in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Optically addressable spin defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors as promising systems for quantum information and sensing applications have recently attracted increased attention. Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are expected to show superiority in quantum sensing due to their atomic thickness. Here, we demonstrate that an ensemble of negatively charged boron vacancies (V-B(-)) with good spin properties in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can be generated by ion implantation. We carry out optically detected magnetic resonance measurements at room temperature to characterize the spin properties of ensembles of V-B(-) defects, showing a zero-field splitting frequency of similar to 3.47 GHz. We compare the photoluminescence intensity and spin properties of V-B(-) defects generated using different implantation parameters, such as fluence, energy, and ion species. With the use of the proper parameters, we can successfully create V-B(-) defects with a high probability. Our results provide a simple and practicable method to create spin defects in hBN, which is of great significance for realizing integrated hBN-based devices.

TI Non-classicality and non-adiabaticity in a single trapped ion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Trapped ion systems present non-classical characteristics such as squeezed states that show a quantum advantage in quantum sensing, quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics. We analyze the non-classical characteristics of a system described by a single ion trapped by a periodic potential field. Within the regime of non-adiabatic manipulation of the potential field, the dynamics of motion of the center of mass of the ion can be described by a dimensionless parameter called the non-adiabatic parameter Q & lowast;. This parameter allows us to distinguish the classical and non-classical characteristics of the system. Using the equations of motion of observables in the Heisenberg picture, we propose an analysis of the unitary time evolution operator and discuss the squeezing behavior in the state of motion of the ion. The results shown can serve as a basis to discuss the presence of squeezing as a resource in quantum thermodynamics in the non-adiabatic regime in actual achievable experimental limitations.

TI Quantum state tomography with locally purified density operators and
   local measurements
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding quantum systems is of significant importance for assessing the performance of quantum hardware and software, as well as exploring quantum control and quantum sensing. An efficient representation of quantum states enables realizing quantum state tomography with minimal measurements. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to state tomography that uses tensor network representations of mixed states through locally purified density operators and employs a classical data postprocessing algorithm requiring only local measurements. Through numerical simulations of one-dimensional pure and mixed states and two-dimensional pure states up to size 8 x 8, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of our proposed methods. Experiments on the IBM and Quafu Quantum platforms complement these numerical simulations. Our study opens avenues in quantum state tomography for two-dimensional systems using tensor network formalism.
   Quantum state tomography is a fundamental tool for assessing the performance of quantum hardware and plays a crucial role in advancing quantum information processing. The authors present a method based on tensor network representations and local measurements, demonstrating accuracy and efficiency in characterizing noisy quantum states.

TI Gaussian quantum estimation of the loss parameter in a thermal
   environment
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Lossy bosonic channels play an important role in a number of quantum information tasks, since they well approximate thermal dissipation in an experiment. Here, we characterize their metrological power in the idler-free and entanglement-assisted cases, using respectively single- and two-mode Gaussian states as probes. In the problem of estimating the loss parameter, we study the power-constrained quantum Fisher information (QFI) for generic temperature and loss parameter regimes, showing qualitative behaviours of the optimal probes. We show semi-analytically that the two-mode squeezed-vacuum state optimizes the QFI for any value of the loss parameter and temperature. We discuss the optimization of the total QFI, where the number of probes is allowed to vary by keeping the total power constrained. In this context, we elucidate the role of the 'shadow-effect', or passive signature, for reaching a quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the quantum illumination and quantum reading protocols.

TI Phonon-Assisted Luminescence in Defect Centers from Many-Body
   Perturbation Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Phonon-assisted luminescence is a key property of defect centers in semiconductors, and can be measured to perform the readout of the information stored in a quantum bit, or to detect temperature variations. The investigation of phonon-assisted luminescence usually employs phenomenological models, such as that of Huang and Rhys, with restrictive assumptions that can fail to be predictive. In this work, we predict luminescence and study exciton-phonon couplings within a rigorous many-body perturbation theory framework, an analysis that has never been performed for defect centers. In particular, we study the optical emission of the negatively charged boron vacancy in 2D hexagonal boron nitride, which currently stands out among defect centers in 2D materials thanks to its promise for applications in quantum information and quantum sensing. We show that phonons are responsible for the observed luminescence, which otherwise would be dark due to symmetry. We also show that the symmetry breaking induced by the static Jahn-Teller effect is not able to describe the presence of the experimentally observed peak at 1.5 eV.

TI Fundamental charges for dual-unitary circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1H-1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1H-1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-w conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over w consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-w solitons- operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension d = 2) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.

TI Quantum Attacks on MIBS Block Cipher Based on Bernstein-Vazirani
   Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Because of the substantial progress in quantum computing technology, the safety of traditional cryptologic schemes is facing serious challenges. In this study, we explore the quantum safety of the lightweight cipher MIBS and propose quantum key-recovery attacks on the MIBS cipher by utilizing Grover's algorithm and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. We first construct linear-structure functions based on the 5-round MIBS cipher according to the characteristics of the linear transformations, and then we obtain a quantum distinguisher of the 5-round MIBS cipher by applying Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm to the constructed functions. Finally, utilizing this distinguisher and Grover's algorithm, we realize a 7-round key-recovery attack on the MIBS cipher, and then we expand the attack to more rounds of MIBS based on a similar idea. The quantum attack on the 7-round MIBS requires 156 qubits and has a time complexity of 210.5. An 8-round attack requires 179 qubits and has a time complexity of 222. Compared with existing quantum attacks, our attacks have better time complexity when attacking the same number of rounds.

TI Quantum-entangled neuro-symbolic swarm federation for privacy-preserving
   IoMT-driven multimodal healthcare
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems with multimodal data, real-time sensors, fMRI/EEG, genomics, and clinical text, holds transformative potential for rare disease diagnostics and personalized medicine. However, ultra-scarce datasets (n < 15 per institution), quantum-era threats (e.g., Shor and Grover algorithms), and stringent regulatory requirements expose critical limitations in centralized AI and classical federated learning. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum-Entangled Neuro-Symbolic Swarm Federation (QENSSF), a pioneering framework that unifies quantum-entangled differential privacy (QEDP), neuro-symbolic swarm intelligence, and privacy-aware large language model (LLM) fine-tuning within an IoMTdriven architecture. QENSSF introduces four foundational innovations: (1) QEDP, leveraging 9-qubit W-states and variational quantum circuits to achieve (& varepsilon;, delta)-differential privacy with & varepsilon; = 0.08-0.17 and delta = 10(-17), resilient to quantum inference attacks; (2) Neuro-symbolic swarm agents that fuse CNNs, GNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers with symbolic logic, optimized via Quantum-Entangled Particle Swarm Optimization for O(log(1/& varepsilon;)) convergence; (3) Federated LLM adaptation using QEDP-masked gradients and symbolic guards to prevent hallucination-induced leaks; and (4) Ethical, explainable AI via dynamic knowledge graphs secured by quantum multi-party computation. Evaluated on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor (QV = 128, F-gate = 0.995) and 128 NVIDIAA100 GPUs across synthetic and real-world datasets (ADNI, UK Biobank, MIMIC-IV), QENSSF achieves 45% higher F1-score, 30% improved ROUGE-L, and < 0.5% attack success rate under membership inference. It delivers 6.3 million ops/s (58% faster than FedAvg), consumes only 0.38 kWh (52% less energy), reduces communication overhead to 2.1 Mb/iter (66% lower), and attains 99% fault recovery, all while ensuring regulatory compliance and clinician-trustworthy explanations. QENSSF sets a new standard for secure, efficient, and interpretable AI in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive healthcare environments.

TI Enhancing Scalability of Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary
   Matrices for Ground State Preparation through Adaptive Finer Filtering
SO QUANTUM
AB Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is increasing the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace bined with spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probsults in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.

TI Valley-Hybridized Gate-Tunable 1D Exciton Confinement in
   MoSe2
SO ACS NANO
AB Controlling excitons at the nanoscale in semiconductor materials represents a formidable challenge in the quantum photonics and optoelectronics fields. Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer inherent 2D confinement and possess significant exciton binding energies, making them promising candidates for achieving electric-field-based confinement of excitons without dissociation. Exploiting the valley degree of freedom associated with these confined states further broadens the prospects for exciton engineering. Here, we show electric control of light polarization emitted from one-dimensional (1D) quantum-confined states in MoSe2. Building on previous reports of tunable trapping potentials and linearly polarized emission, we extend this understanding by demonstrating how nonuniform in-plane electric fields enable in situ control of these effects and highlight the role of gate-tunable valley hybridization in these localized states. Their polarization is entirely engineered through either the 1D confinement potential's geometry or an out-of-plane magnetic field. Controlling nonuniform in-plane electric fields in TMDs enables control of the energy (up to five times its line width), polarization state (from circular to linear), and position of 1D confined excitonic states (5 nm V-1).

TI Purcell-Enhanced Single-Photon Emission in the Telecom C-Band
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Purcell-enhanced quantum dot single-photon emission in the telecom C-band from InAs quantum dots inside circular Bragg grating cavities is shown. The InAs quantum dots are grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy on an InP substrate and are embedded into a quaternary In0.53Al0.23Ga0.24As membrane structure. In a post-growth flip-chip process with subsequent substrate removal and electron beam-lithography, circular Bragg grating ("bullseye") resonators are defined. Micro-photoluminescence studies of the devices at cryogenic temperatures of T=5 T = 5 K reveal individual quantum dot emission lines into a pronounced cavity mode. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements under above-band gap excitation yield Purcell-enhanced excitonic decay times of tau = (180 +/- 3)tau corresponding to a Purcell factor of FP=(6.7 +/- 0.6). Pronounced photon antibunching with a background limited g(2)(0)=(0.057 +/- 0.004) is observed, which demonstrates that the light originated mostly from one single quantum dot.
   On-demand single-photon sources are a key element of photonic quantum communication and quantum computing. Here, Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission in the telecom C-band from InAs quantum dots embedded into circular Bragg grating optical micro-resonators is shown.image

TI Analytic semi-device-independent entanglement quantification for
   bipartite quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We define a property called nondegeneracy for Bell inequalities, which describes the situation that in a Bell setting, if a Bell inequality and involved local measurements are fixed, any quantum state with a given dimension and its orthogonal quantum state cannot violate remarkably the inequality simultaneously. By choosing a proper nondegenerate Bell inequality, we prove that for an unknown bipartite quantum state of given dimension, based on the measurement statistics only, we can provide an analytic lower bound for the entanglement of formation or even the distillable entanglement, making the whole process semi device independent. We characterize the mathematical structure of nondegeneracy, and prove that quite a lot of well-known Bell inequalities are nondegenerate. We demonstrate our approach by quantifying entanglement for qutrit-qutrit states based on their violations of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Masser-Popescu inequality.

TI Quantum magic and multipartite entanglement in the structure of nuclei
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the quantum complexity of pshell and sd-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear shell-model wave functions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the p shell and 24 qubits for the sd shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement (n-tangles) and magic (nonstabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly applicable Pauli-string IZ exact (PSIZe) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wave functions), by factors of approximate to 8 for some nuclei. Significant multinucleon entanglement is found in the sd shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

TI Boson bloom
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The year 2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the first article on Bose statistics. Bose breathed life into the Planck distribution of radiation by a microscopic derivation (Bose 1924 Z. Phys. 26 178), adding a new insight, namely indistinguishability into the then evolving quantum theory. Einstein recognized the importance of this article and got it published. Using Bose statistics Einstein wrote an article on the theory (Einstein 1924 Sutzungsber. Preuss. Akad. Wiss Phys.-Math Kl. 261) of an ideal Bose gas and Bose-Einstein condensation. The groundbreaking discovery of Bose, an unveiling of a secret of quantum mechanics, continues to reverberate after a century. Bose's paper is considered the fourth important paper in old quantum theory, following Planck's (1900) article (Planck 1900 Verh. Disch Phys. Ges. 2 202), Einstein's (1905) photoelectric effect (Einstein 1905 Ann. Phys., Lpz. 17 132) and Bohr's model (1913) of the atom (Bohr 1913 London, Edinburgh Dublin Phil. Mag. J. Sci. 26 1). Dirac (1926 Proc. R. Soc. A 112 661) coined the name boson for one of the two families of indistinguishable particles, the other family being fermion. The edifice of modern quantum field theory, many-body quantum theory, quantum-information and quantum-computing are built on bosons, fermions and anyons. The ever-blooming quantum garden of bosons has photons, gluons, W-bosons, mesons, Higgs-bosons, gravitons, phonons, magnons, excitons, plasmons, polaritons and so on. We present a brief historical account of Bose's life and his discovery, followed by a bird's eye view of the impacts of bosons in modern science and technology: from Bose's distribution of 3-degree background radiation reaching us in the form of cosmic microwave background from the big bang era to boson sampling, a novel quantum computing method.Bosogenesis before Baryogenesis?: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light (Genesis, 1:4)

TI Quantum gradient descent algorithms for nonequilibrium steady states and
   linear algebraic systems
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB The gradient descent approach is the key ingredient in variational quantum algorithms and machine learning tasks, which is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of an objective function. The quantum versions of gradient descent have been investigated and implemented in calculating molecular ground states and optimizing polynomial functions. Based on the quantum gradient descent algorithm and Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we present approaches to simulate efficiently the nonequilibrium steady states of Markovian open quantum many-body systems. Two strategies are developed to evaluate the expectation values of physical observables on the nonequilibrium steady states. Moreover, we adapt the quantum gradient descent algorithm to solve linear algebra problems including linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications, by converting these algebraic problems into the simulations of closed quantum systems with well-defined Hamiltonians. Detailed examples are given to test numerically the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the dissipative quantum transverse Ising models and matrix-vector multiplications.

TI Research communities in cyber security: A comprehensive literature
   review
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB In order to provide a coherent overview of cyber security research, the Scopus academic abstract and citation database was mined to create a citation graph of 98,373 authors active in the field between 1949 and early 2020. The Louvain community detection algorithm was applied to the graph in order to identify existing research communities. The analysis discovered twelve top-level communities: access control, authentication, biometrics, cryptography (I & II), cyber-physical systems, information hiding, intrusion detection, malwares, quantum cryptography, sensor networks, and usable security. These top-level communities were in turn composed of a total of 80 sub-communities. The analysis results are presented for each community in descriptive text, sub-community graphs, and tables with, for example, the most-cited papers and authors. A comparison between the detected communities and topical areas defined by other related work, is also presented, demonstrating a greater researcher emphasis on cryptography, quantum cryptography, information hiding and biometrics, at the expense of laws and regulation, risk management and governance, and security software lifecycle.

TI Hybrid classical-quantum approach to solve the heat equation using
   quantum annealers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The numerical solution of partial differential equations by discretization techniques is ubiquitous in computational physics. In this work we investigate this approach in the quantum realm by solving the heat equation for a square plate subject to fixed temperatures at the edges and random heat sources and sinks within the domain. The hybrid classical-quantum approach consists of the solution on a quantum computer of the coupled linear system of equations that results from the discretization step. Owing to the limitations on the number of qubits and their connectivity, we use the Gauss-Seidel method to divide the full system of linear equations into subsystems, which are solved iteratively in block fashion. Each of the linear subsystems was solved using 2000Q and Advantage quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems Inc. By comparing classical numerical and quantum solutions, we observe that the errors and chain break fraction are, on average, greater on the 2000Q system. Unlike in the classical Gauss-Seidel method, the errors of the quantum solutions level off after a few iterations of our algorithm. This is partly a result of the span of the real-number line available from the mapping of the chosen size of the set of qubit states. We verified this by using techniques to progressively shrink the range mapped by the set of qubit states at each iteration (increasing floating-point accuracy). As a result, no leveling off is observed. However, an increase in qubits does not translate to an overall lower error. This is believed to be indicative of the increasing length of chains required for the mapping to real numbers and the ensuing limitations of hardware.

TI Entanglement instability in the interaction of two qubits with a common
   non-Markovian environment
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this work, we study the steady-state entanglement between two qubits interacting asymmetrically with a common non-Markovian environment. Depending on the initial two-qubit state, the asymmetry in the couplings between each qubit and the non-Markovian environment may lead to enhanced entanglement in the steady state of the system, measured in terms of the two-qubit concurrence. Our results indicate that, if a qubit-qubit interaction is also present, the two-qubit steady-state concurrence is always favored by the symmetric or anti-symmetric coupling configuration. Although finite, the steady concurrence is predicted to be highly unstable in this regime as long as the interaction between the two qubits is larger than the couplings between each qubit and the non-Markovian reservoir. In comparison with the previous work, the features we have uncovered extend the work of Yang Li et al. Phys. Rev. A 79, 012309 (2009).

The criterion for detecting faithful coherent states can be restricted to a subclass of the fidelity-based criterion under unitary transformations for single and bipartite systems. We can realize these unitary transformations by using quantum gates and circuits, and establish the connection between faithful coherence states and coherence distillation as well as maximum relative entropy of coherence.

TI An Extended Survey Concerning the Vector Commitments
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Commitment schemes represent foundational cryptographic primitives enabling secure verification protocols across diverse applications, from blockchain systems to zero-knowledge proofs. This paper presents a systematic survey of vector, polynomial, and functional commitment schemes, analyzing their evolution from classical constructions to post-quantum secure alternatives. We examine the strengths and limitations of RSA-based, Diffie-Hellman, and lattice-based approaches, highlighting the critical shift toward quantum-resistant designs necessitated by emerging computational threats. The survey reveals that while lattice-based schemes (particularly those using the Short Integer Solution problem) offer promising security guarantees, they face practical challenges in proof size and verification efficiency. Functional commitments emerge as a powerful generalization, though their adoption is constrained by computational overhead and setup requirements. Key findings identify persistent gaps in adaptive security, composability, and real-world deployment, while proposed solutions emphasize optimization techniques and hybrid approaches. By synthesizing over 90 research works, this paper provides both a comprehensive reference for cryptographic researchers and a roadmap for future developments in commitment schemes, particularly in addressing the urgent demands of post-quantum cryptography and decentralized systems.

TI Fast parallel computation of reduced row echelon form to find the
   minimum distance of linear codes
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Finding the distance of linear codes is a key aspect to build error correcting codes, and also to design attacks in code-based post-quantum cryptography; however, it is a NP-hard problem difficult to be addressed. Metaheuristics, and more specifically genetic algorithms, have proven to be a promising tool to improve the search of an upper bound for the distance of a given linear code. In a previous work, it was demonstrated that the there exists a column permutation of a code matrix whose Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) contains a row of minimum weight, i.e. the code distance, although calculating RREF during fitness evaluation increases the time complexity of the algorithm substantially. In this work, we propose parallelization of multiple calculations of Reduced Row Echelon Forms simultaneously, and its integration into a fully parallelized design of a CHC evolutionary algorithm to overcome this limitation. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically a substantial improvement in time complexity for the approach in practical case studies to find the distance of linear codes over different finite fields.

TI Quantum-safe cryptography: crossroads of coding theory and cryptography
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB We present an overview of quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) with a focus on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and information-theoretic security. From a cryptographic point of view, lattice and code-based schemes are among the most promising PQC solutions. Both approaches are based on the hardness of decoding problems of linear codes with different metrics. From an information-theoretic point of view, lattices and linear codes can be constructed to achieve certain secrecy quantities for wiretap channels as is intrinsically classical- and quantum-safe. Historically, coding theory and cryptography are intimately connected since Shannon's pioneering studies but have somehow diverged later. QSC offers an opportunity to rebuild the synergy of the two areas, hopefully leading to further development beyond the NIST PQC standardization process. In this paper, we provide a survey of lattice and code designs that are believed to be quantum-safe in the area of cryptography or coding theory. The interplay and similarities between the two areas are discussed. We also conclude our understandings and prospects of future research after NIST PQC standardisation.

TI Local quantum overlapping tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reconstructing the full quantum state of a many-body system requires the estimation of a number of parameters that grows exponentially with system size. Nevertheless, there are situations in which one is only interested in a subset of these parameters, and a full reconstruction is not needed. A paradigmatic example is a scenario in which one aims at determining all the reduced states only up to a given size. Overlapping tomography provides constructions to address this problem with a number of product measurements much smaller than what is obtained when performing independent tomography of each reduced state. There are, however, many relevant physical systems with a natural notion of locality where one is mostly interested in the reduced states of neighboring particles. In this work, we study this form of local overlapping tomography. First of all, we show that, contrary to its full version, the number of product-measurement settings needed for local overlapping tomography does not grow with system size. Then, we present strategies for qubit and fermionic systems in selected lattice geometries. The developed methods find a natural application in the estimation of many-body systems prepared in current quantum simulators or quantum computing devices, where interactions are often local.

TI Microscopic relaxation channels in materials for superconducting qubits
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Despite mounting evidence that materials imperfections are a major obstacle to practical applications of superconducting qubits, connections between microscopic material properties and qubit coherence are poorly understood. Here, we combine measurements of transmon qubit relaxation times (T-1) with spectroscopy and microscopy of the polycrystalline niobium films used in qubit fabrication. By comparing films deposited using three different techniques, we reveal correlations between T-1 and intrinsic film properties such as grain size, enhanced oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries, and the concentration of suboxides near the surface. Qubit and resonator measurements show signatures of two-level system defects, which we propose to be hosted in the grain boundaries and surface oxides. We also show that the residual resistance ratio of the polycrystalline niobium films can be used as a figure of merit for qubit lifetime. This comprehensive approach to understanding qubit decoherence charts a pathway for materials-driven improvements of superconducting qubit performance. Understanding the connection between qubit coherence and microscopic materials properties is vital for improving device performance. Here, the relaxation times of superconducting transmon qubits are found to be directly correlated with Nb film properties such as grain size and surface oxide composition.

TI Building a Quantum Engineering Undergraduate Program
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB Contribution: A roadmap is provided for building a quantum engineering education program to satisfy U.S. national and international workforce needs. Background: The rapidly growing quantum information science and engineering (QISE) industry will require both quantum-aware and quantum-proficient engineers at the bachelor's level. Research Question: What is the best way to provide a flexible framework that can be tailored for the full academic ecosystem? Methodology: A workshop of 480 QISE researchers from across academia, government, industry, and national laboratories was convened to draw on best practices; representative authors developed this roadmap. Findings: 1) For quantum-aware engineers, design of a first quantum engineering course, accessible to all STEM students, is described; 2) for the education and training of quantum-proficient engineers, both a quantum engineering minor accessible to all STEM majors, and a quantum track directly integrated into individual engineering majors are detailed, requiring only three to four newly developed courses complementing existing STEM classes; 3) a conceptual QISE course for implementation at any postsecondary institution, including community colleges and military schools, is delineated; 4) QISE presents extraordinary opportunities to work toward rectifying issues of inclusivity and equity that continue to be pervasive within engineering. A plan to do so is presented, as well as how quantum engineering education offers an excellent set of education research opportunities; and 5) a hands-on training plan on quantum hardware is outlined, a key component of any quantum engineering program, with a variety of technologies, including optics, atoms and ions, cryogenic and solid-state technologies, nanofabrication, and control and readout electronics.

TI Belief propagation with quantum messages for quantum-enhanced classical
   communications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB For space-based laser communications, when the mean photon number per received optical pulse is much smaller than one, there is a large gap between communications capacity achievable with a receiver that performs individual pulse-by-pulse detection, and the quantum-optimal "joint-detection receiver" that acts collectively on long codeword-blocks of modulated pulses; an effect often termed "superadditive capacity". In this paper, we consider the simplest scenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel with a coherent-state binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) modulation. The two BPSK states can be mapped conceptually to two non-orthogonal states of a qubit, described by an inner product that is a function of the mean photon number per pulse. Using this map, we derive an explicit construction of the quantum circuit of a joint-detection receiver based on a recent idea of "belief-propagation with quantum messages" (BPQM). We quantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs optimal pulse-by-pulse detection, which represents the best "classical" approach. We analyze the scheme rigorously and show that it achieves the quantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating 8 (BPSK) codewords of a length-5 binary linear code with a tree factor graph. Our result suggests that a BPQM receiver might attain the Holevo capacity of this BPSK-modulated pure-loss channel. Moreover, our receiver circuit provides an alternative proposal for a quantum supremacy experiment, targeted at a specific application that can potentially be implemented on a small, special-purpose, photonic quantum computer capable of performing cat-basis universal qubit logic.

TI Microfabrication techniques and device applications of single
   crystalline diamond
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Diamond has many excellent physicochemical properties including ultrahigh hardness, wide bandgap, outstanding thermal conductivity, and high electron mobility, which has emerged as a critical material for high-power electronics, quantum technologies, and micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). Single crystalline diamond tends to have better performance than polycrystalline diamond in some fields including thermal management, optics and quantum information. However, its extreme hardness and chemical inertness pose significant challenges for scalable microfabrication and require specialized techniques beyond conventional silicon-based processes. This paper systematically summarizes the latest progress in single crystalline diamond (SCD) MEMS manufacturing, including the diamond growth achieved through high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures achieved through inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching and focused ion beam (FIB) milling and three-dimensional (3D) structures achieved through ion implant-assisted exfoliation (IAL), diamond on insulator (DOI), and angled etching strategies. We focused on introducing the applications of SCD in thermal management, photonic device, quantum systems, and heterojunctions. However, there are still some challenges, such as high fabrication costs, interfacial thermal resistance in hetero-integrated devices, and limitations in n-type doping efficiency. Emerging approaches like deep elastic strain engineering (DESE) can offer novel pathways to regulate SCD's electronic and quantum properties. In the future, interdisciplinary combination in materials science, nanofabrication, and quantum engineering are critical to for next-generation electronics, quantum information, and MEMS technologies of diamond.

TI Efficient Commutative PQC Algorithms on Isogenies of Edwards Curves
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The article presents the author's works in the field of modifications and modeling of the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH) algorithm on non-cyclic supersingular Edwards curves and its predecessor Couveignes-Rostovtsev-Stolbunov (CRS) scheme on ordinary non-cyclic Edwards curves are reviewed. Lower estimates of the computational speed gains of the modified algorithms over the original ones are obtained. The most significant results were obtained by choosing classes of non-cyclic Edwards curves connected as quadratic twist pairs instead of cyclic complete Edwards curves, as well as the method of algorithm randomization as an alternative to "constant time CSIDH". It is shown that in the CSIDH and Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (CSIKE) algorithms, there are two independent cryptosystems with the possibility of parallel computation, eliminating the threat of side-channel attacks. There are four such cryptosystems for the CRS scheme. Integral lower bound estimates of the performance gain of the modified CSIDH algorithm are obtained at 1.5 x 29, and for the CRS scheme are 3 x 29.

TI HybridPKE: A forward-secure non-interactive quantum-safe hybrid key
   exchange scheme
SO ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL-JESTECH
AB The schemes submitted to NIST call for standardization of post-quantum cryptography have some common drawbacks in terms of decryption failure probability, scalability, and switching issues from prequantum to post- quantum cryptography. In this paper, we address all these issues and propose a novel quantum-safe scheme HybridPKE for key exchange and encryption. HybridPKE is based on Ring Learning with Error lattice problem and uses Advance Encryption Standard symmetric-key algorithm. The scheme is non-interactive as both the parties establish the same key without sharing any reconciliation information. HybridPKE provides forward secrecy and authenticated quantum-safe communication with zero decryption failure. The uniqueness of this paper lies in the first to integrate both pre-quantum and post-quantum scheme to provide a robust hybrid key exchange. The paper presents the efficient implementation and supported parameter set of purposed HybridPKE scheme by fine-tuning the parameters through rigorous experimentation and security analysis under different attacks.

TI Self-testing quantum systems of arbitrary local dimension with minimal
   number of measurements
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Bell nonlocality as a resource for device-independent certification schemes has been studied extensively in recent years. The strongest form of device-independent certification is referred to as self-testing, which given a device, certifies the promised quantum state as well as quantum measurements performed on it without any knowledge of the internal workings of the device. In spite of various results on self-testing protocols, it remains a highly nontrivial problem to propose a certification scheme of qudit-qudit entangled states based on violation of a single d-outcome Bell inequality. Here we address this problem and propose a self-testing protocol for the maximally entangled state of any local dimension using the minimum number of measurements possible, i.e., two per subsystem. Our self-testing result can be used to establish unbounded randomness expansion, log 2d perfect random bits, while it requires only one random bit to encode the measurement choice.

TI Recent progress of superconducting electronics in China
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB It has been nearly 110 years since the discovery of superconductors, and more than 30 years since the discovery of high temperature superconductors (HTS). Great progress has been made in the application of superconducting electronics in the last two decades. HTS microwave devices have shown much higher perfomance than the traditional ones and have found their ways to the industry applications in mobile communication, radar, and special communication applications. Owing to the ultrahigh sensitivity to magnetic fields and currents, superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) have been used as the irresplacible sensors in geological surveying, magnetic resonant imaging, biomagnetic imaging, and other areas. The sensitivity of superconducting radiation detectors such as superconduction SIS mixer, superconducting hot electron bolometer, superconducting transition edge sensor, superconducting nanowire single photon detector, and superconducting superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detector are near the quantum limitation. They are now key technology in geophysics, astrophysics, quantum information science, biomedicine, and so on. Superconducting Josephson parametric amplifier has become a key element for superconducting quantum computing. Superconducting integrated circuit has been included in the international roadmap for devices and systems, and shows that having the potential to become one of the mainstreams for post-Moore information processing technology. In metrology, superconducting Josephson effect and Josephson junction array devices have been widely used in the redefinition of quantum voltage reference and basic units of the international system of Units. Superconducting electronics plays an important role in the current quantum information technology boom, which in turn promotes the development of superconducting electronics. This review will brief introduce the research and application of superconducting electronics in China in recent years.

TI GaAs-on-insulator ridge waveguide nanobeam cavities with integrated InAs
   quantum dots
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study investigates nanobeam cavities on a GaAs-on-insulator (GaAsOI) chip with InAs quantum dots (QDs), including design, fabrication, and experimental characterization. The nanobeam cavities are optimized for high photon coupling efficiency and pronounced light-matter interaction. Numerical studies yield Q factors up to about 1400, a coupling efficiency of nearly 70 % and a maximum Purcell factor of approximately 100. Experimentally, these devices have a Q factor of about 1300, and comparing the lifetime of QDs in on-resonance and off-resonance conditions, a Purcell factor of 10.46 +/- 0.14 is obtained. Moreover, in the single-emitter regime, we observe strong multiphoton suppression with g(2)(0)=0.297 . Our results demonstrate the high potential of nanobeam cavities on a GaAsOI platform for quantum photonic applications.

TI T-depth reduction method for efficient SHA-256 quantum circuit
   construction
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB To perform a quantum brute force attack on a cryptosystem based on Grover's algorithm, it is necessary to implement a quantum circuit of the cryptographic algorithm. Therefore, an efficient quantum circuit design of a given cryptographic algorithm is essential, especially in terms of quantum security analysis, and it is well known that T-depth should be reduced for time complexity efficiency. In this paper, the authors propose a novel technique to reduce T-depth (and T-count) when some quantum circuits located in between two Toffoli-gates are interchangeable with a controlled phase gate (CP gate), and the authors apply this technique to five types of quantum adders, reducing T-depth by more than 33%. The authors also present new SHA-256 quantum circuits which have a critical path with only three quantum adders while the critical paths of quantum circuits in the previous studies consist of seven or 10 quantum adders, and the authors also apply our technique to the proposed SHA-256 quantum circuits. Four versions of SHA-256 quantum circuit are presented. Among the previous results, T-depth of the circuit with the smallest Width (the number of qubits) 801 was approximately 109,104. On the other hand, T-depth of the proposed SHA-256 quantum circuit with the Width 797 is 16,055, which is remarkably reduced by about 85%. Another proposed quantum circuit only requires 768 qubits, which is the smallest Width compared to the previous results to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, one other version is the most time-efficient circuit with an overall Toffoli-depth (and T-depth) that is less than 5000.

TI Trade-off between bagging and boosting for quantum
   separability-entanglement classification
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Certifying whether an arbitrary quantum system is entangled or not, is, in general, an NP-hard problem. Though various necessary and sufficient conditions have already been explored in this regard for lower-dimensional systems, it is hard to extend them to higher dimensions. Recently, an ensemble bagging and convex hull approximation (CHA) approach (together, BCHA) was proposed and it strongly suggests employing a machine learning technique for the separability-entanglement classification problem. However, BCHA does only incorporate the balanced dataset for classification tasks which results in lower average accuracy. In order to solve the data imbalance problem in the present literature, an exploration of the boosting technique has been carried out, and a trade-off between the boosting and bagging-based ensemble classifier is explored for quantum separability problems. For the two-qubit and two-qutrit quantum systems, the pros and cons of the proposed random under-sampling boost CHA (RUSBCHA) for the quantum separability problem are compared with the state-of-the-art CHA and BCHA approaches. As the data are highly unbalanced, performance measures such as overall accuracy, average accuracy, F-measure, and G-mean are evaluated for a fair comparison. The outcomes suggest that RUSBCHA is an alternative to the BCHA approach. Also, for several cases, performance improvements are observed for RUSBCHA since the data are imbalanced.

TI Approximate Solutions of Combinatorial Problems via Quantum Relaxations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Combinatorial problems are formulated to find optimal designs within a fixed set of constraints and are commonly found across diverse engineering and scientific domains. Understanding how to best use quantum computers for combinatorial optimization remains an ongoing area of study. Here, we propose new methods for producing approximate solutions to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, which are based on relaxations to local quantum Hamiltonians. We look specifically at approximating solutions for the maximum cut problem and its weighted version. These relaxations are defined through commutative maps, which in turn are constructed borrowing ideas from quantum random access codes. We establish relations between the spectra of the relaxed Hamiltonians and optimal cuts of the original problems, via two quantum rounding protocols. The first one is based on projections to random magic states. It produces average cuts that approximate the optimal one by a factor of least 0.555 or 0.625, depending on the relaxation chosen, if given access to a quantum state with energy between the optimal classical cut and the maximal relaxed energy. The second rounding protocol is deterministic and is based on the estimation of Pauli observables. The proposed quantum relaxations inherit memory compression from quantum random access codes, which allowed us to test the performances of the methods presented for 3-regular random graphs and a design problem motivated by industry for sizes up to 40 nodes, on superconducting quantum processors.

TI Configurable Mixed-Radix Number Theoretic Transform Architecture for
   Lattice-Based Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Lattice-based cryptography continues to dominate in the second-round finalists of the National Institute of Standards and Technology post-quantum cryptography standardization process. Computational efficiency is primarily considered to evaluate promising candidates for final round selection. In lattice-based cryptosystems, polynomial multiplication is the most expensive computation and critical to improve the performance. This paper proposes an efficient number theoretic transform (NTT) architecture to accelerate the polynomial multiplication. The proposed design applies mixed-radix multi-path delay feedback architecture and flexibly adopts various polynomial sizes. Configurable NTT design is realized to perform forward and inverse NTT computations on a unified hardware, which is then used to develop an efficient polynomial multiplier. The proposed architectures were successfully accelerated on several Xilinx FPGA platforms to directly compare with state-of-the-art works. The implementation results show that the proposed NTT architectures have comparable area-time product and demonstrate 1.7 similar to 17x performance improvement, and the proposed polynomial multipliers achieve higher performance compared with previous works. Experimental results confirmed the proposed design's applicability for high-speed large-scale data cryptoprocessors.

TI Pulse variational quantum eigensolver on cross-resonance-based hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB State-of-the-art noisy digital quantum computers can only execute short-depth quantum circuits. Variational algorithms are a promising route to unlock the potential of noisy quantum computers since the depth of the corresponding circuits can be kept well below hardware-imposed limits. Typically, the variational parameters correspond to virtual RZ gate angles, implemented by phase changes of calibrated pulses. By encoding the variational parameters directly as hardware pulse amplitudes and durations, we succeed in further shortening the pulse schedule and overall circuit duration. This decreases the impact of qubit decoherence and gate noise. As a demonstration, we apply our pulse-based variational algorithm to the calculation of the ground state of different hydrogen-based systems (H-2, H-3, and H-4) using IBM cross-resonance-based hardware. We observe a reduction in schedule duration of up to 5x compared to CNOT-based Ansatze, while also reducing the measured energy. In particular, we observe a sizable improvement of the minimal energy configuration of H-3 compared to a CNOT-based variational form. Finally, we discuss possible future developments including error-mitigation schemes and schedule optimizations, which will enable further improvements of our approach, paving the way towards the simulation of larger systems on noisy quantum devices.

TI Quantum X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval From MDS
   Coded Storage With Unresponsive and Byzantine Servers
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB A communication-efficient protocol is introduced over a many-to-one quantum network for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, i.e., quantum private information retrieval with MDS-X-secure storage and T-private queries. The protocol is resilient to any set of up to E unresponsive servers (erased servers or stragglers) and any set of up to B Byzantine servers. The underlying coding scheme incorporates an enhanced version of a Cross Subspace Alignment (CSA) code, namely a Modified CSA (MCSA) code, into the framework of CSS codes. The error-correcting capabilities of CSS codes are leveraged to encode the dimensions that carry desired computation results from the MCSA code into the error space of the CSS code, while the undesired interference terms are aligned into the stabilized code space. The challenge is to do this efficiently while also correcting quantum erasures and Byzantine errors. The protocol achieves superdense coding gain over comparable classical baselines for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, recovers as special cases the state of art results for various other quantum PIR settings previously studied in the literature, and paves the way for applications in quantum coded distributed computation, where CSA code structures are important for communication efficiency, while security and resilience to stragglers and Byzantine servers are critical.

TI Quasiprobability distribution of work in the quantum Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB A complete understanding of the statistics of the work done by quenching a parameter of a quantum many-body system is still lacking in the presence of an initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. In this case, the work can be represented by a class of quasiprobability distributions. Here, we try to clarify the genuinely quantum features of the process by studying the work quasiprobability for an Ising model in a transverse field. We consider both a global and local quench by focusing mainly on the thermodynamic limit. We find that, while for a global quench there is a symmetric noncontextual representation with a Gaussian probability distribution of work, for a local quench we can get quantum contextuality as signaled by a negative fourth moment of the work. Furthermore, we examine the critical features related to a quantum phase transition and the role of the initial quantum coherence as a useful resource.

TI Protocols for trainable and differentiable quantum generative modeling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an approach for learning probability distributions as differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) that enable efficient quantum generative modeling (QGM) and synthetic data generation. Contrary to existing QGM approaches, we perform training of a DQC-based model, where data is encoded in a latent space with the proposed phase feature map of exponential capacity. This is followed by a trainable quantum circuit, forming the model. We then map the trained model to the bit basis using a fixed unitary transformation, in this case corresponding to a quantum Fourier transform circuit. It allows fast sampling from parametrized distributions using a single-shot readout. Importantly, latent space training provides models that are automatically differentiable, and we show how samples from solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be accessed by solving stationary and time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations with a quantum protocol. Our approach opens a route to multidimensional generative modeling with qubit registers explicitly correlated via a (fixed) entangling layer. In this case quantum computers can offer advantage as efficient samplers, which perform complex inverse transform sampling enabled by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. On a technical side the advances are multiple, as we introduce the phase feature map, analyze its properties, and develop frequency-taming techniques that include qubitwise training and feature map sparsification.

TI Highly Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond via Rational
   High-Pressure and High-Temperature Synthesis and Treatment
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds with well-controlled defects and low stress offer an ideal host substrate for the fields of quantum information science; however, fabrication of quantum-grade HPHT diamonds remains a pressing challenge. Here, a major advance in generating highly coherent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, a promising spin defect in diamonds, via tailored HPHT synthesis and postgrown annealing treatment is reported. The resulting well-dispersed single NV- centers in type-IIa diamonds exhibit long spin coherence times comparable to that of the reported chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Moreover, high-density NV- ensembles in & LANGBRAC;100 & rang;-grown type-Ib diamonds with superb zero-phonon lines considerably sharper than those of native NV- centers in as-grown diamonds, together with low splitting of resonances are produced. These findings demonstrate a superior synthesis and optimization protocol for creating high-quality NV- centers avoiding lattice damage in diamond to meet the stringent requirements for a wide range of emerging quantum technologies.
   This study reports an efficient way to fabricate high-quality NV- centers by controlling nitrogen content, growth orientation, and high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing conditions. The HPHT synthesized and postgrowth annealed diamonds contain highly coherent single and ensemble NV- centers, showcasing outstanding performance benchmarks that are comparable to those reported for quantum-grade chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Thus, the HPHT diamond is successfully developed into quantum-grade.image

TI Space-time trade-off in networked virtual distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In contrast to monolithic devices, modular, networked quantum architectures are based on interconnecting smaller quantum hardware nodes using quantum communication links and offer a promising approach to scalability. Virtual distillation (VD) is a technique that can, under ideal conditions, suppress errors exponentially as the number of quantum state copies increases. However, additional gate operations required for VD introduce further errors, which may limit its practical effectiveness. In this work, we analyze three practical implementations of VD that correspond to edge cases that maximize space-time trade-offs. Specifically, we consider an implementation that minimizes the number of qubits but introduces significantly deeper quantum circuits and contrast it with implementations that parallelize the preparation of copies using additional qubits, including a constant-depth implementation. We rigorously characterize their circuit depth and gate count requirements and develop explicit architectures for implementing them in networked quantum systems-while also detailing implementations in early fault-tolerant quantum architectures. We numerically compare the performance of the three implementations under realistic noise characteristics of networked ion trap systems and conclude the following. First, VD effectively suppresses errors even for very noisy states. Second, the constant-depth implementation consistently outperforms the implementation that minimizes the number of qubits. Finally, the approach is highly robust to errors in remote entangling operations, with noise in local gates being the main limiting factor to its performance.

TI Realizing a compact, high-fidelity, telecom-wavelength source of
   multipartite entangled photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multipartite entangled states are an essential building block for advanced quantum networking applications. Realizing such tasks in practice puts stringent requirements on the characteristics of the states in terms of fidelity and generation rate, along with a desired compatibility with telecommunication network deployment. Here, we demonstrate a photonic platform design capable of producing high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, at telecom wavelength and in a compact and scalable configuration. Our source relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a layered Sagnac interferometer, which only requires a single nonlinear crystal. This enables the generation of highly indistinguishable photon pairs, followed by entanglement fusion to create four-qubit polarization-entangled GHZ states with fidelity up to (94.73 +/- 0.21)% with respect to the ideal state, at a rate of 1.7 Hz. We provide a complete characterization of our source and highlight its suitability for practical quantum network applications.

TI Nanophotonic Materials and Devices: Recent Advances and Emerging
   Applications
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Nanophotonics, the study of light-matter interactions at the nanometer scale, has emerged as a transformative field that bridges photonics and nanotechnology. Using engineered nanomaterials-including plasmonic metals, high-index dielectrics, two-dimensional (2D) materials, and hybrid systems-nanophotonics enables light manipulation beyond the diffraction limit, unlocking novel applications in sensing, imaging, and quantum technologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances (post-2020) in nanophotonic materials, fabrication methods, and their cutting-edge applications. We first discuss the fundamental principles governing nanophotonic phenomena, such as localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), Mie resonances, and exciton-polariton coupling, highlighting their roles in enhancing light-matter interactions. Next, we examine state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, including top-down (e.g., electron beam lithography and nanoimprinting) and bottom-up (e.g., chemical vapor deposition and colloidal synthesis) approaches, as well as hybrid strategies that combine scalability with nanoscale precision. We then explore emerging applications across diverse domains: quantum photonics (single-photon sources, entangled light generation), biosensing (ultrasensitive detection of viruses and biomarkers), nonlinear optics (high-harmonic generation and wave mixing), and integrated photonic circuits. Special attention is given to active and tunable nanophotonic systems, such as reconfigurable metasurfaces and hybrid graphene-dielectric devices. Despite rapid progress, challenges remain, including optical losses, thermal management, and scalable integration. We conclude by outlining future directions, such as machine learning-assisted design, programmable photonics, and quantum-enhanced sensing, and offering insights into the next generation of nanophotonic technologies. This review serves as a timely resource for researchers in photonics, materials science, and nanotechnology.

TI Post-Quantum Authentication Framework Based on Iris Recognition and
   Homomorphic Encryption
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper proposes an authentication protocol based on post-quantum cryptography and iris recognition. The process uses a modified version of the original McEliece cryptographic algorithm that provides post-quantum security. Additionally, iris recognition is included in the decryption process, ensuring that only authentic users have access to confidential information, or can operate critical infrastructures or systems that must be protected against malicious users or impostors. A distributed framework, in which several autonomous entities interact with each other, participates in the whole process to reduce the odds of a successful attack. Biometric templates are encrypted and safely stored in a database. These templates meet all requirements described in the ISO/IEC 24745 standard regarding data protection. Due to the homomorphic property of McEliece, the decryption process operates using the encrypted version of these biometric templates, ensuring that critical information is not revealed. The use of McEliece does not affect the overall accuracy of the recognition process, so that the same False Acceptance and False Rejection rates are obtained when compared with the non-protected scheme.

TI Detecting High-Dimensional Entanglement in Cold-Atom Quantum Simulators
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum entanglement has been identified as a crucial concept underlying many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter systems, such as topological phases or many-body localization. Recently, instead of considering mere quantifiers of entanglement such as entanglement entropy, the study of entanglement structure in terms of the entanglement spectrum has shifted to a focus leading to new insights into fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators, among others. What remains a challenge is the experimental detection of such fine-grained properties of quantum systems. The development of protocols for detecting features of the entanglement spectrum in cold-atom systems, which are one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation, is thus highly desirable and will open up new avenues for experimentally exploring quantum many-body physics. Here, we present a method to bound the width of the entanglement spectrum, or entanglement dimension, of cold atoms in lattice geometries, requiring only measurements in two experimentally accessible bases and utilizing ballistic time-of-flight (TOF) expansion. Building on previous proposals for entanglement certification for photon pairs, we first consider entanglement between two atoms of different atomic species and later generalize to higher numbers of atoms per species and multispecies configurations showing multipartite high-dimensional entanglement. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and thus will enable high-dimensional entanglement certification in systems of up to eight atoms using currently available experimental techniques.

TI Quasi-Shor Algorithms for Global Benchmarking of Universal Quantum
   Processors
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This work generalizes Shor's algorithm into quasi-Shor algorithms by replacing the modular exponentiation with alternative unitary operations. By using the quantum circuits to generate Bell states as the unitary operations, a specific example called the Bell-Shor algorithm was constructed. The system density matrices in the quantum circuits with four distinct input states were calculated in ideal conditions and illustrated through chromatic graphs to witness the evolution of quantum states in the quantum circuits. For the real part of the density matrices, it was revealed that the number of zero elements dramatically declined to only a few points after the operation of the inverse quantum Fourier transformation. Based on this property, a protocol constituting a pair of error metrics gamma(a) and gamma(b) is proposed for the global benchmarking of universal quantum processors by looking at the locations of the zero entries and normalized average values of non-zero entries. The protocol has polynomial resource requirements with the scale of the quantum processor. The Bell-Shor algorithm is capable of being a feasible setting for the global benchmarking of universal quantum processors.

TI Resource-efficient algorithm for estimating the trace of quantum state
   powers
SO QUANTUM
AB Estimating the trace of quantum state powers, Tr(rho(k)), for k identical quantum states is a fundamental task with numerous applications in quantum information processing, including nonlinear function estimation of quantum states and entanglement detection. On near-term quantum devices, reducing the required quantum circuit depth, the number of multi-qubit quantum operations, and the copies of the quantum state needed for such computations is crucial. In this work, inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we significantly improve upon existing results by introducing an algorithm that requires only O((r) over tilde) qubits and O((r) over tilde) multi-qubit gates, where r= min {rank(rho), inverted right perpendicularln (2k/epsilon)inverted left perpendicular}. This approach is efficient, as it employs the r-entangled copy measurement instead of the conventional k-entangled copy measurement, while asymptotically preserving the known sample complexity upper bound. Furthermore, we prove that estimating {Tr(rho(i))}(i=1)((r) over tilde) is sufficient to approximate Tr(rho(k)) even for large integers k > (r) over tilde. This leads to a rank-dependent complexity for solving the problem, providing an efficient algorithm for low-rank quantum states while also improving existing methods when the rank is unknown or when the state is not low-rank. Building upon these advantages, we extend our algorithm to the estimation of Tr(M rho(k)) for arbitrary observables and Tr(rho(k)sigma(l)) for multiple quantum states.

TI Quantum-information theory of magnetic field influence on circular dots
   with different boundary conditionsQuantum-information theory of magnetic
   field influence on circular dots with different boundary conditions
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Influence of the transverse uniform magnetic field B on position (subscript rho) and momentum (gamma) Shannon quantum-information entropies S-rho,S-gamma Fisher informations I-rho,I-gamma and informational energies O-rho,O-gamma is studied theoretically for the 2D circular quantum dots (QDs) whose circumference supports homogeneous either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition (BC). Comparative analysis reveals similarities and differences of the influence on the properties of the structure of the surface interaction with the magnetic field. A conspicuous distinction between the two spectra are crossings at the increasing induction of the Neumann energies with the same radial quantum number n and adjacent non-positive angular indicesm. At the growing B, either system undergoes Landau condensation when its characteristics turn into their uniform field counterparts. It is shown that for the Dirichlet system this transformation takes place at the smaller magnetic intensities; e.g. the Dirichlet sum S-rho 00 + S-gamma 00 on its approach fromabove to a fundamental limit 2(1 + ln pi) is at any B smaller than the corresponding Neumann quantity what physically means that the former geometry provides more total information about the position and motion of the particle. It is pointed out that the widely accepted disequilibriumuncertainty relation O rho O gamma <= (2 pi)(-d), with d being a dimensionality of the system, is violated by the Neumann QD in the magnetic field. Comparison with electrostatic harmonic confinement is performed; in particular, contrary to the hard-wall QDs, for this configuration the sums S-rho + S-gamma and the products I rho I gamma and O rho O gamma do not depend on the field. Physical interpretation is based on the different roles of the two BCs and their interplay with the field: Dirichlet (Neumann) surface is a repulsive (attractive) interface.

TI Dynamical evolution of a five-level atom interacting with an

Through a comprehensive examination of the quantum system, it is observed that both the detuning and the Kerr-like parameters exert a significant impact on the degree of entanglement and coherence. However, the impacts of detuning and the Kerr effect become less pronounced when the photon multiplicity is high. In addition, we conduct a comparison between the five-level atomic system and a four-level system, revealing that the number of energy levels has a profound impact on the behavior of entanglement and coherence. These findings highlight the importance of atomic structure and photon multiplicity in controlling and optimizing quantum processes, particularly in applications involving quantum communication and information processing.

TI Holographic Simulation of Correlated Electrons on a Trapped-Ion Quantum
   Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We develop holographic quantum simulation techniques to prepare correlated electronic ground states in quantum matrix-product-state (QMPS) form, using far fewer qubits than the number of orbitals represented. Our approach starts with a holographic technique to prepare a compressed approximation to electronic mean-field ground states, known as fermionic Gaussian matrix-product states (GMPSs), with a polynomial reduction in qubit and (in select cases gate) resources compared to existing techniques. Correlations are then introduced by augmenting the GMPS circuits in a variational technique, which we denote GMPS+X. We demonstrate this approach on Quantinuum's System Model H1 trapped-ion quantum processor for one-dimensional (1D) models of correlated metal and Mott-insulating states. Focusing on the 1D Fermi-Hubbard chain as a benchmark, we show that GMPS+X methods faithfully capture the physics of correlated electron states, including Mott insulators and correlated Luttinger liquid metals, using considerably fewer parameters than problem-agnostic variational circuits.

TI Quantum-enabled operation of a microwave-optical interface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Solid-state microwave systems offer strong interactions for fast quantum logic and sensing but photons at telecom wavelength are the ideal choice for high-density low-loss quantum interconnects. A general-purpose interface that can make use of single photon effects requires <1 input noise quanta, which has remained elusive due to either low efficiency or pump induced heating. Here we demonstrate coherent electro-optic modulation on nanosecond-timescales with only 0.16(-0.01)(+0.02) microwave input noise photons with a total bidirectional transduction efficiency of 8.7% (or up to 15% with 0.41(-0.02)(+0.02)), as required for near-term heralded quantum network protocols. The use of short and high-power optical pump pulses also enables near-unity cooperativity of the electro-optic interaction leading to an internal pure conversion efficiency of up to 99.5%. Together with the low mode occupancy this provides evidence for electro-optic laser cooling and vacuum amplification as predicted a decade ago.

TI Robustness of Entanglement for Dicke-W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
   Mixed States
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental characteristic of quantum mechanics, and understanding the robustness of entanglement across different mixed states is crucial for comprehending the entanglement properties of general quantum states. In this paper, the robustness of entanglement of Dicke-W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) mixed states under different mixing ratios is calculated using the entanglement witness method. The robustnesses of entanglement of Dicke-W and GHZ mixed states are different when the probability ratio of Dicke to W is greater than 32 and less than 32. For the probability of Dicke and W states greater than or equal to 32, we study the robustness of entanglement of Dicke and GHZ mixed states and analyze and calculate their upper and lower bounds. For the probability of Dicke and W states less than 32, we take the equal probability ratio of Dicke and W states as an example and calculate and analyze the upper and lower bounds of their robustness of entanglement in detail.

TI Measurement-Based Quantum Thermal Machines with Feedback Control
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigated coupled-qubit-based thermal machines powered by quantum measurements and feedback. We considered two different versions of the machine: (1) a quantum Maxwell's demon, where the coupled-qubit system is connected to a detachable single shared bath, and (2) a measurement-assisted refrigerator, where the coupled-qubit system is in contact with a hot and cold bath. In the quantum Maxwell's demon case, we discuss both discrete and continuous measurements. We found that the power output from a single qubit-based device can be improved by coupling it to the second qubit. We further found that the simultaneous measurement of both qubits can produce higher net heat extraction compared to two setups operated in parallel where only single-qubit measurements are performed. In the refrigerator case, we used continuous measurement and unitary operations to power the coupled-qubit-based refrigerator. We found that the cooling power of a refrigerator operated with swap operations can be enhanced by performing suitable measurements.

Traditional AI systems often lack robust security measures, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks, data breaches, and privacy violations. Cryptography has emerged as a crucial component in enhancing AI security by ensuring data confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric review to understand the intersection between cryptography, AI, and security. A total of 495 journal articles and reviews were identified using Scopus as the primary database. The results indicate a sharp increase in research interest between 2020 and January 2025, with a significant rise in publications in 2023 and 2024. The key application areas include computer science, engineering, and materials science. Key cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and quantum cryptography have gained prominence in AI security. Blockchain has also emerged as an essential technology for securing AI-driven applications, particularly in data integrity and secure transactions. This paper highlights the crucial role of cryptography in safeguarding AI systems and provides future research directions to strengthen AI security through advanced cryptographic solutions.

TI Spin-energy entanglement of a time-focused neutron
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Intraparticle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the modulated intensity with zero effort configuration. We verified the mode entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt contextuality witness S defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of S <= 2, obtaining S = 2.40 +/- 0.02. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.

TI Resonator-assisted quantum transduction between superconducting qubits
   and trapped atomic systems via Rydberg levels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Using a shared microwave resonator, we propose a transduction scheme between superconducting qubits and qubit states encoded in the low-lying internal levels of trapped atomic systems. The approach employs atomic Rydberg levels together with laser pulses that connect them to the low-lying qubit states. We explore two coupling protocols: one based on resonant interactions between the subsystems and another operating in the dispersive regime, where the resonator is far detuned from the transition frequencies of the matter qubits. These protocols enable the transfer of a general qubit state from the superconducting qubit to the atomic qubit. Transfer fidelity is evaluated across different coupling regimes and under various sources of dissipation and decoherence, including resonator decay, Rydberg state decay, and both relaxation and pure dephasing of the superconducting qubit, providing a detailed assessment of the performance of the proposed scheme.

Experimental results show that our noise-aware compilation approach yields significant improvements in the preparation rate, compared to non-noise-aware implementations on the same devices. In particular, the combination of the techniques considered in this work yields savings in space and time resources from 23% to 81%, for the implementation of fault-tolerant preparation protocols of polar codes with 6 to 24 physical qubits.

TI Small-world complex network generation on a digital quantum processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum cellular automata (QCA) evolve qubits in a quantum circuit depending only on the states of their neighborhoods and model how rich physical complexity can emerge from a simple set of underlying dynamical rules. The inability of classical computers to simulate large quantum systems hinders the elucidation of quantum cellular automata, but quantum computers offer an ideal simulation platform. Here, we experimentally realize QCA on a digital quantum processor, simulating a one-dimensional Goldilocks rule on chains of up to 23 superconducting qubits. We calculate calibrated and error-mitigated population dynamics and complex network measures, which indicate the formation of small-world mutual information networks. These networks decohere at fixed circuit depth independent of system size, the largest of which corresponding to 1,056 two-qubit gates. Such computations may enable the employment of QCA in applications like the simulation of strongly-correlated matter or beyond-classical computational demonstrations.
   The study of complexity in quantum systems is a fascinating topic, which however is still in its infancy, especially at the experimental level. Here, the authors report on the observation of "small-world" characteristics in the network of quantum correlations within chains of up to 23 superconducting qubits long.

TI The compatibility dimension of quantum measurements
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce the notion of compatibility dimension for a set of quantum measurements: it is the largest dimension of a Hilbert space on which the given measurements are compatible. In the Schrodinger picture, this notion corresponds to testing compatibility with ensembles of quantum states supported on a subspace, using the incompatibility witnesses of Carmeli, Heinosaari, and Toigo [Phys. Rev. A 98,012126 (2018) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 130402 (2019).]. We provide several bounds for the compatibility dimension using approximate quantum cloning or algebraic techniques inspired by quantum error correction. We analyze in detail the case of two orthonormal bases and, in particular, that of mutually unbiased bases.

TI Speed-up and suppression effect of side chain in quantum searching on a
   graph
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Searching efficiency, which biologists and roboticists are ever concerned about, has become important in physics and information science nowadays. In classical probability-based searching problems, as stigmergy, the increase in graph complexity will decrease the searching efficiency. Here we study the searching efficiency based on the first-passage probability and find a counterintuitive phenomenon in quantum walk on a graph with floating vertices. Connecting one vertex in the floating layer to that in the base layer will speed up the searching rapidity, but such a speed-up effect will be suppressed at once if one more vertex is connected to the already connected vertex in the floating layer. This is a counterintuitive phenomenon in comparison to its classical counterpart, where additional vertices at the side chain will retard the searching rapidity. We also propose an ancillary model that bridges the measurement of the probability and the first-passage probability, which is expected to provide new ideas for quantum simulation by means of qubit chips.

TI Calibrating the Classical Hardness of the Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The trading of fidelity for scale enables approximate classical simulators such as matrix product states (MPSs) to run quantum circuits beyond exact methods. A control parameter, the so-called bond dimension chi for MPSs, governs the allocated computational resources and the output fidelity. Here, we characterize the fidelity for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm by the expectation value of the cost func-tion that it seeks to minimize and find that it follows a scaling law F(ln chi IN), where N is the number of qubits. With ln chi amounting to the entanglement that a MPS can encode, we show that the relevant variable for investigating the fidelity is the entanglement per qubit. Importantly, our results calibrate the classical computational power required to achieve the desired fidelity and benchmark the performance of quantum hardware in a realistic setup. For instance, we quantify the hardness of performing better classically than a noisy superconducting quantum processor by readily matching its output to the scaling function. Moreover, we relate the global fidelity to that of individual operations and establish its relation-ship with chi and N. We sharpen the requirements for noisy quantum computers to outperform classical techniques at running a quantum optimization algorithm in speed, size, and fidelity.

TI Quantum Lego Expansion Pack: Enumerators from Tensor Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We provide the first tensor-network method for computing quantum weight enumerator polynomials in the most general form. If a quantum code has a known tensor-network construction of its encoding map, our method is far more efficient, and in some cases exponentially faster than the existing approach. As a corollary, it produces decoders and an algorithm that computes the code distance. For non-(Pauli)- stabilizer codes, this constitutes the current best algorithm for computing the code distance. For degenerate stabilizer codes, it can be substantially faster compared to the current methods. We also introduce novel weight enumerators and their applications. In particular, we show that these enumerators can be used to compute logical error rates exactly and thus construct (optimal) decoders for any independent and identically distributed single qubit or qudit error channels. The enumerators also provide a more efficient method for computing nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body states. As the power for these speedups rely on a quantum Lego decomposition of quantum codes, we further provide systematic methods for decomposing quantum codes and graph states into a modular construction for which our technique applies. As a proof of principle, we perform exact analyses of the deformed surface codes, the holographic pentagon code, and the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code under (biased) Pauli noise and limited instances of coherent error at sizes that are inaccessible by brute force.

TI Chlorine vacancy in 4H-SiC: An NV-like defect with telecom-wavelength
   emission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center remains an ever-increasing topic of interest. At present, it is considered an ideal example of a solid-state qubit applicable in quantum communication, computing, and sensing alike. With its success, the search for defects that share or improve upon its advantageous features is an ongoing endeavor. By performing large-scale high-throughput screening of 52 600 defects in 4H silicon carbide (SiC), we identify a collection of NV-like color centers of particular interest. From this list, the single most promising candidate consists of a silicon vacancy and chlorine substituted on the carbon site, and is given the name of chlorine vacancy (ClV) center. Through high-accuracy first-principle calculations, we confirm that the ClV center is similar to the NV center in diamond in its local structure and shares many qualitative and quantitative features in the electronic structure and spin properties. In contrast to the NV center, however, the ClV center in SiC exhibits emission in the telecom range near the C band.

TI Optomechanical Ground-State Cooling in a Continuous and Efficient
   Electro-Optic Transducer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The demonstration of a quantum link between microwave and optical frequencies would be an important step toward the realization of a quantum network of superconducting processors. A major impediment to quantum electro-optic transduction in all platforms explored to date is noise added by thermal occupation of modes involved in the transduction process, and it has proved difficult to realize low thermal occupancy concurrently with other desirable features like high duty cycle and high efficiency. In this work, we present an efficient and continuously operating electro-optomechanical transducer whose mechanical mode has been optically sideband cooled to its quantum ground state. The transducer achieves a maximum efficiency of 47% and minimum input-referred added noise of 3.2 photons in upconversion. Moreover, the thermal occupancy of the transducer's microwave mode is minimally affected by continuous laser illumination with power more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than that required for optomechanical ground-state cooling.

TI Offset Charge Dependence of Measurement-Induced Transitions in Transmons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons-the most widely used superconducting qubit-the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate-charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate-charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively calibrating the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.

TI Methods of constructing superposition measures
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The resource theory of quantum superposition is an extension of the quantum coherent theory, in which linear independence relaxes the requirement of orthogonality. It can be used to quantify the nonclassical in superposition of finite number of optical coherent states. Based on convex roof extended, state transformation and weight, we give three methods of constructing superposition measures of quantum states, respectively. We also generalize the superposition resource theory from two perspectives.

TI First principles studies of defect centers in two-dimensional NaCl
   associated with spin qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Spin defects in solids offer promising quantum bits (qubits) for quantum applications. However, the precise control of defect centers in three-dimensional (3D) crystals remains challenging. In contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a superior platform for both the controlled creation and precise manipulation of defect qubits. This work employs first-principles calculations to demonstrate that 2D NaCl exhibits high stability, a wide bandgap, and negligible spin-orbit coupling, making it a potential candidate for qubit host material. Among the eleven designed defects in 2D NaCl, the S e Cl V Na defect exhibits advantages of spin triplet ground states, spin conservation in optical transitions, and the excited state energy of the dark state is higher than that of its triplet bright state. However, the critical qubit operation parameter, the zero-phonon line, remains relatively small. Notably, the zero-field splitting of the S e Cl V Na defect falls within the microwave range, which is particularly suitable for quantum manipulation. Finally, the hyperfine tensors are calculated to assess the interaction between electron spin and nuclear spin. This study provides fundamental insights into the design principles of solid-state spin qubits in 2D materials for quantum technology application. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Einstein-Rosen bridge from the minimal length
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We use a string T-duality corrected pair of regular black holes to construct an Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridge with the wormhole throat proportional to the zero-point (Planck) length. This may be a geometric realization of quantum entanglement for particle/antiparticle pairs. We point out that for an extreme mass configuration consisting of a black hole pair, one can have an ER bridge with a horizon area that coincides with the Bekenstein minimal area bound along with a wormhole mass proportional to the Planck mass. This could be related to gravitational self-completeness with quantum mechanical mass limits. We also discuss the ER bridge for sub-Planckian mass horizonless wormholes and show this admits a region of negative energy at the throat, which we posit to be related to a particle of negative mass generated by quantum fluctuations or the Casimir effect. We argue that Hawking radiation could be the best way for the geometric realization of quantum entanglement for particle/antiparticle pairs emitted by black holes. This sheds new light on the ER=EPR conjecture.

TI Magnetic-Field Dependent VB- Spin Decoherence in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitrides: A First-Principles Study
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB -) in h-BN is a spin-1 defect functioning as an optically addressable spin qubit in 2D materials. A precise understanding of its spin decoherence is essential to advance it into a robust qubit platform. First-principles quantum many-body simulations are employed to investigate VB - decoherence in dense nuclear spin baths of h-BN under magnetic fields from 0.01 to 3 T, considering isotopic variants h-10B14N, h-11B14N, h-10B15N, and h-11B15N. A transition boundary (TB) is observed where the dominant decoherence mechanism changes: below the TB, sub-microsecond decoherence is governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics, whereas above it, pairwise flip-flops dominate, extending T2 to tens of microseconds. Analytical predictions place the TB at 0.502 T for h-10B14N and 0.205 T for h-11B14N. The larger TB in h-10BN results from the larger nuclear spin of 10B (I = 3), which produces stronger nuclear modulation over a wider field range. The analytical approach also explains the magnetic-field-insensitive fast modulation observed below the TB. These findings clarify the role of dense nuclear spin baths with large nuclear spins (I >= 1) in VB - decoherence and provide design principles for isotopically engineered h-BN spin qubits.

TI Relativistic dips in entangling power of gravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The salient feature of both classical and quantum gravity is its universal and attractive character. However, less is known about the behavior and build-up of quantum correlations when quantum systems interact via graviton exchange. In this work, we show that quantum correlations can remain strongly suppressed for certain choices of parameters even when considering two adjacent quantum systems in delocalized states. Using the framework of linearized quantum gravity with post-Newtonian contributions, we find that there are special values of delocalization where gravitationally induced entanglement drops to negligible values, albeit nonvanishing. We find a pronounced cancellation point far from the Planck scale, where the system tends toward classicalization. In addition, we show that quantum correlations begin to reemerge for large and tiny delocalizations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the universal coupling of gravity to the energy-momentum tensor, forming a valley of gravitational entanglement.

TI Optical demonstration of quantum fault-tolerant threshold
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB A major challenge in practical quantum computation is the ineludible errors caused by the interaction of quantum systems with their environment. Fault-tolerant schemes, in which logical qubits are encoded by several physical qubits, enable to the output of a higher probability of correct logical qubits under the presence of errors. However, strict requirements to encode qubits and operators render the implementation of a full fault-tolerant computation challenging even for the achievable noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology. Especially the threshold for fault-tolerant computation still lacks experimental verification. Here, based on an all-optical setup, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of the threshold for the fault-tolerant protocol. Four physical qubits are represented as the spatial modes of two entangled photons, which are used to encode two logical qubits. The experimental results clearly show that when the error rate is below the threshold, the probability of correct output in the circuit, formed with fault-tolerant gates, is higher than that in the corresponding non-encoded circuit. In contrast, when the error rate is above the threshold, no advantage is observed in the fault-tolerant implementation. The developed high-accuracy optical system may provide a reliable platform to investigate error propagation in more complex circuits with fault-tolerant gates.

TI Long-lived valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Bilayer graphene is a promising platform for electrically controllable qubits in a two-dimensional material. Of particular interest is the ability to encode quantum information in the valley degree of freedom, a two-fold orbital degeneracy that arises from the symmetry of the hexagonal crystal structure. The use of valleys could be advantageous, as known spin- and orbital-mixing mechanisms are unlikely to be at work for valleys, promising more robust qubits. The Berry curvature associated with valley states allows for electrical control of their energies, suggesting routes for coherent qubit manipulation. However, the relaxation time of valley states-which ultimately limits these qubits' coherence properties and therefore their suitability as practical qubits-is not yet known. Here we measure the characteristic relaxation times of these spin and valley states in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum dot devices. Different valley states can be distinguished from each other with a fidelity of over 99%. The relaxation time between valley triplets and singlets exceeds 500 ms and is more than one order of magnitude longer than for spin states. This work facilitates future measurements on valley-qubit coherence, demonstrating bilayer graphene as a practical platform hosting electrically controlled, long-lived valley qubits.
   Using the valley degree of freedom in analogy to spin to encode qubits could be advantageous as many of the known decoherence mechanisms do not apply. Now long relaxation times are demonstrated for valley qubits in bilayer graphene quantum dots.

Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. However, there is no established baseline on which to judge current and future progress in equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In order to close this gap, we conduct a detailed case study of two of the most promising equivalence checking methodologies-one based on decision diagrams and one based on the ZX-calculus-and compare their strengths and weaknesses.

TI Heisenberg-limited quantum phase estimation of multiple eigenvalues with
   few control qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum phase estimation is a corner-stone in quantum algorithm design, al-lowing for the inference of eigenvalues of exponentially-large sparse matrices. The maximum rate at which these eigenvalues may be learned, -known as the Heisen-berg limit-, is constrained by bounds on the circuit complexity required to simulate an arbitrary Hamiltonian. Single-control qubit variants of quantum phase estima-tion that do not require coherence between experiments have garnered interest in re-cent years due to lower circuit depth and minimal qubit overhead. In this work we show that these methods can achieve the Heisenberg limit, also when one is un-able to prepare eigenstates of the system. Given a quantum subroutine which pro-vides samples of a 'phase function' g(k) = sigma(j) A(j)e(i Phi)j(k) with unknown eigenphases phi(j )and overlaps A(j )at quantum cost O(k), we show how to estimate the phases {phi(j}) with (root-mean-square) error delta for total quantum cost T = O(delta(-1)). Our scheme com-bines the idea of Heisenberg-limited multi -order quantum phase estimation for a single eigenvalue phase [1, 2] with subroutines with so-called dense quantum phase estimation which uses classical processing via time-series analysis for the QEEP problem [3] or the matrix pencil method. For our algorithm which adaptively fixes the choice for k in g(k) we prove Heisenberg -limited scaling when we use the time-series/QEEP subroutine. We present numerical evidence that using the matrix pencil technique the algorithm can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling as well.

TI A quantum game decision-making analysis of parking sharing behavior
   considering fairness preferences
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES
AB Parking constraints are particularly acute in the urban city center, but the many negative impacts of sharing private parking make owners living in central areas reluctant to share private parking. Hence, we employ the quantum game to analyze the interactions among heterogeneous parking providers. This study explores quantum non-entanglement and entanglement strategies in the context of parking sharing and investigates the impact of heterogeneous and fairness preferences on gaming strategies. The findings indicate that in the absence of quantum entanglement, achieving a Pareto optimal strategy in which both parties share private parking is challenging. However, at the maximum quantum entanglement, the cost incurred by the unwilling side must be borne individually, whereas adopting mutual-sharing quantum strategy leads to a win-win situation. Furthermore, owners' fairness preferences significantly motivate parties with higher sharing revenues. When the disparity in revenues is too high, leading to distinctly unfair aversion to the side with lower sharing revenues, owners' willingness to engage in sharing is reduced.

TI Gauge-fixing quantum density operators at scale
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We provide a theory, algorithms, and simulations of nonequilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator (rho) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP rho factorization naturally emerges. In this setting, we analytically and numerically examine the virtual gauge freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Based on this perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to speed up the integration of the canonical-form master-equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance in the near term. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, because of loss from environmental interactions, nonlocal complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional nonequilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.

TI Measuring topological invariants for higher-order exceptional points in
   quantum three-mode systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Owing to the presence of exceptional points (EPs), non-Hermitian (NH) systems can display intriguing topological phenomena without Hermitian analogs. However, experimental characterizations of exceptional topological invariants have been restricted to second-order EPs (EP2s) in classical or semiclassical systems. We here propose an NH multi-mode system with higher-order EPs, each of which is underlain by a multifold-degenerate multipartite entangled eigenstate. We implement the NH model by controllably coupling a Josephson-junction-based electronic mode to two microwave resonators. We experimentally quantify the topological invariant for an EP3, by mapping out the complex eigenspectra of the tripartite system along a loop surrounding this EP3 in the parameter space. The nonclassicality of the realized topology is manifested by the observed quantum correlations in the corresponding eigenstates. Our results extend research of exceptional topology to fully quantum-mechanical models with multipartite entangled eigenstates.
   Exceptional topology associated with higher-order exceptional points has not been completely characterised in quantum systems. Here, the authors fill this gap performing full quantum state tomography in a system composed of a superconducting qubit coupled to two cavities, one lossless and one lossy, featuring third-order exceptional points.

TI Extremal steering assemblages
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocal correlations between a fully characterized quantum system and an untrusted black box device are described by an assemblage of conditional quantum states. These assemblages form a convex set, whose extremal points are relevant in many operational contexts. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an assemblage to be extremal using linear independence conditions and an algorithm to decompose a generic assemblage into extremal points. A MATLAB implementation of this algorithm is also provided.

TI Spotlighting quantum phase transition in spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg
   diamond chain employing Measurement-Induced Nonlocality
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We examine thermal quantum correlations characterized by Measurement-Induced Non-locality (MIN) in an infinite spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg spin chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We evaluate MIN analytically in the thermodynamic limit using the transfer matrix approach and show that the MIN and its first-order derivative may spotlight the quantum criticality and quantum phase transition (QPT). We observe that the DM interaction reduces the role of anisotropy parameter in initiating QPT. Further, the DM interaction also induces the nonlocality in the system if the spins are unentangled and greatly enhances the quantum correlations if the spins are correlated. The impact of the magnetic field and temperature on quantum correlations is also brought out at a critical point. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Achieving Robust Single-Photon Blockade with a Single Nanotip
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Backscattering losses (BSL), arising from intrinsic imperfections or unavoidable external perturbations in optical resonators, can severely impact photonic devices. In single-photon systems, robust quantum correlations against BSL remain largely unexplored despite their significance for various applications. Here, we demonstrate that single-photon blockade (SPB), a purely quantum effect, can be preserved against BSL by introducing a nanotip near a Kerr nonlinear resonator with intrinsic defects. Without the tip, BSL disrupts SPB, but tuning the tip's position restores robustness even under strong BSL. Notably, quantum correlations emerge while the classical mean photon number remains suppressed due to the interplay between resonator nonlinearity and tip-induced optical coupling. Our findings highlight nanoscale engineering as a powerful tool to protect and harness fragile quantum correlations, paving the way for robust single-photon sources and backscattering-immune quantum devices.

TI Variational preparation of the thermofield double state of the
   Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We provide an algorithm for preparing the thermofield double (TFD) state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model without the need for an auxiliary bath. Following previous work, the TFD can be cast as the approximate ground state of a Hamiltonian, H-TFD. Using variational quantum circuits, we propose and implement a gradientbased algorithm for learning parameters that find this ground state, an application of the variational quantum eigensolver. Concretely, we find shallow quantum circuits that prepare the ground state of H-TFD for the q = 4 SYK model for N = 8 Majoranas per side. For N = 12, we achieve a variational energy within 1% of the true ground-state energy.

TI Satellite-based positioning enhanced by quantum synchronization
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB This study focuses on the innovative field of quantum synchronization for satellite-based navigation systems including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) and the Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) component of future 6G networks integrating both communication and navigation services. By combining a four-qubit system with the theoretical approach of the Lindblad master equation, we transcend the inherent limits of standard synchronization techniques. This achievement represents a quantum leap in satellite-based positioning, highlighting the scalability and cost-effectiveness of our technique for smaller satellites. The study demonstrates the possibility of reducing synchronization errors to less than one meter, significantly improving the reliability and precision of satellite-based navigation systems. The results of this study may contribute to the future development of both user-centric localization systems (typically GNSS systems) and network-centric localization systems (typically through the NTN component of 6G networks), leading to better positioning performance, more flexible multi-functional systems with the potential to limit both cost and size of satellites.

TI Enabling Quantum Privacy and Security by Design: Imperatives for
   Contemporary State-of-the-Art in Quantum Software Engineering
SO JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
AB With the advent of Quantum Computing and its exponential research endeavors in the past couple of decades, we are looking at a Golden Era of Quantum Computing. We are transitioning into an age of Hybrid Classical-Quantum Computers, where the quantum computational resources are selectively harnessed for resource-intensive tasks. On the one hand, Quantum Computing promises immense future computational innovation, and it also comes with privacy and security challenges. To date, Privacy by Design (PbD) and Security by Design (SbD) frameworks and guidelines in the Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) domain are still nebulous, and there are no comprehensive studies on the same. In this study, therefore, we identify the current state-of-the-art in the relevant literature and investigate the principles of PbD and SbD in the domain of QSE. This is the first study to identify state-of-the-art Quantum PbD and Quantum SbD in QSE. Furthermore, we also identified the gaps in the current literature, which were extended into action points for a robust literature for Quantum PbD and SbD. We recognize the crucial role of researchers, academics, and professionals in the field of Quantum Computing and Software Engineering in conducting more empirical studies and shaping the future of PbD and SbD principles in QSE.

TI Detection of ultra-weak laser pulses by free-running single-photon
   detectors: Modeling dead time and dark counts effects
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In quantum communication systems, the precise estimation of the detector ' s response to the incoming light is necessary to avoid security breaches. The typical working regime uses a free-running single-photon avalanche diode in combination with attenuated laser pulses at telecom wavelength for encoding information. We demonstrate the validity of an analytical model for this regime that considers the effects of dark counts and dead time on the measured count rate. For the purpose of gaining a better understanding of these effects, the photon detections were separated from the dark counts via a software-induced gating mechanism. The model was verified by experimental data for mean photon numbers covering three orders of magnitude as well as for laser repetition frequencies below and above the inverse dead time. Consequently, our model would be of interest for predicting the detector response not only in the field of quantum communications, but also in any other quantum physics experiment where high detection rates are needed.

TI Phonon Blockade in Parametrically Pumped Acoustic Cavity at Finite
   Temperature
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this study, we investigated the phonon blockade effect in a parametrically driven and dissipative acoustic cavity at finite temperature. With the approximated analytical results based on the steady-state density-matrix master equation, we found that a quantum-interference-induced phonon blockade exists at finite temperature. We found a crossover between the quantum and thermal regimes on the curve of the second-order correlation function of the acoustic mode as the temperature increases. This phenomenon implies an asymmetry about the quantum and classic regimes. We also numerically simulated the single-phonon emission using the Monte Carlo wave function method. The results showed that a wide and deep dip around the zero time delay exists on the curve of the time-delayed second-order correlation function, which implies the possibility of observing a strong phonon blockade with pulse driving. Our study outlines a potential candidate for a efficient single-phonon source and applications in quantum information and phononic quantum networks.

TI Single-photon nonreciprocal excitation transfer with non-Markovian
   retarded effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study at the single-photon level the nonreciprocal excitation transfer between emitters coupled with a common waveguide. Non-Markovian retarded effects are taken into account due to the large separation distance between different emitter-waveguide coupling ports. It is shown that the excitation transfer between the emitters of a small-atom dimer can be obviously nonreciprocal by introducing between them a coherent coupling channel with nontrivial coupling phase. We prove that for dimer models the nonreciprocity cannot coexist with the decoherence-free giant-atom structure although the latter markedly lengthens the lifetime of the emitters. In view of this, we further propose a giant-atom trimer which supports both nonreciprocal transfer (directional circulation) of the excitation and greatly lengthened lifetime. Such a trimer model also exhibits incommensurate emitter-waveguide entanglement for different initial states in which case the excitation transfer is, however. reciprocal. We believe that the proposals in this paper are of potential applications in large-scale quantum networks and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum control in open and periodically driven systems
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Quantum technology resorts to efficient utilization of quantum resources to realize technique innovation. The systems are controlled such that their states follow the desired manners to realize different quantum protocols. However, the decoherence caused by the system-environment interactions causes the states deviating from the desired manners. How to protect quantum resources under the coexistence of active control and passive decoherence is of significance. Recent studies have revealed that the decoherence is determined by the feature of the system-environment energy spectrum: Accompanying the formation of bound states in the energy spectrum, the decoherence can be suppressed. It supplies a guideline to control decoherence. Such idea can be generalized to systems under periodic driving. By virtue of manipulating Floquet bound states in the quasienergy spectrum, coherent control via periodic driving dubbed as Floquet engineering has become a versatile tool not only in controlling decoherence, but also in artificially synthesizing exotic topological phases. We will review the progress on quantum control in open and periodically driven systems. Special attention will be paid to the distinguished role played by the bound states and their controllability via periodic driving in suppressing decoherence and generating novel topological phases.

TI Quantum Fuzzy Regression Model for Uncertain Environment
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In the era of big data, traditional regression models cannot deal with uncertain big data efficiently and accurately. In order to make up for this deficiency, this paper proposes a quantum fuzzy regression model, which uses fuzzy theory to describe the uncertainty in big data sets and uses quantum computing to exponentially improve the efficiency of data set preprocessing and parameter estimation. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the degree of importance of each data point. Mean-while, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm and quantum swap circuits are used to improve the efficiency of high-dimensional data matrix calculation. The application of the quantum fuzzy regression model to small-scale financial data proves that its accuracy is greatly improved compared with the quantum regression model. Moreover, due to the introduction of quantum computing, the speed of dealing with high-dimensional data matrix has an exponential improvement compared with the fuzzy regression model. The quantum fuzzy regression model proposed in this paper combines the advantages of fuzzy theory and quantum computing which can efficiently calculate high-dimensional data matrix and complete parameter estimation using quantum computing while retaining the uncertainty in big data. Thus, it is a new model for efficient and accurate big data processing in uncertain environments.

TI Quantum spin liquids
SO CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS
AB A glance at recent research on magnetism turns up a curious set of articles discussing, or claiming evidence for, a state of matter called a quantum spin liquid (QSL). These articles are notable in their invocation of exotic notions of topological physics, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum numbers, anyon statistics and gauge field theories. So what is a QSL and why do we need this complicated technical vocabulary to describe it? Our aim in this article is to introduce some of these concepts and provide a discussion of what a QSL is, where it might occur in Nature and why it is of interest. As we'll see, this is a rich subject which is still in development, and unambiguous evidence for the realisation of the QSL state in a magnetic material remains hotly debated. However, the payoff in terms of the special nature of quantum entanglement in the QSL, and its diverse spectrum of unusual excitations and topological status will (at least to some extent) justify the need to engage with some powerful, occasionally abstract, technical material.

TI Multimode quantum squeezing generation via multiple four-wave mixing
   processes within a single atomic vapor cell
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Multimode quantum squeezing plays an essential role in the fields of quantum metrology and quantum information. In this paper, we first construct a three- and four-mode energy-level cascaded four-wave mixing system in a single 85Rb vapor, and then analyze the quantum properties of the produced states, including the covariance matrix and the intensity squeezing with 11 possible Hamiltonians. In addition, the dressing field is applied to modulate the nonlinear susceptibility and the multimode quantum states. Our scheme allows active modulation of the quantum states integrated within the generation step, without the need for any post-operation of the optics. The mode number of the states also can be extended using more pump fields and the dressing effect. Our study provides a promising candidate to generate multimode quantum states and multimode quantum squeezing within a quantum device involved in the construction of practical quantum networks.

TI Multi-class quantum classifiers with tensor network circuits for quantum
   phase recognition
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on variational circuits are a promising approach to quantum machine learning problems for near-term devices, but the selection of the variational ansatz is an open issue. Recently, tensor network-inspired circuits have been proposed as a natural choice for such ansatz. Their employment on binary classification tasks provided encouraging results. However, their effectiveness on more difficult tasks is still unknown. In particular, the best approach to extend them to multi-class classification problems remains unclear. Here, we present numerical experiments on multi-class classifiers based on tree tensor network and multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz circuits. We conducted experiments on image classification with the MNIST dataset and on quantum phase recognition with the XXZ model by Cirq and TensorFlow Quantum. In the former case, we reduced the number of classes to four to match the aimed output based on 2 qubits. The quantum data of the XXZ model consist of three classes of ground states prepared by a checkerboard circuit used for the ansatz of the variational quantum eigensolver, corresponding to three distinct quantum phases. Test accuracy turned out to be 59%-93% and 82%-96% respectively, depending on the model architecture and on the type of preprocessing. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Precise Characterization of a Waveguide Fiber Interface in Silicon
   Carbide
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Spin-active optical emitters in silicon carbide are excellent candidates toward the development of scalable quantum technologies. However, efficient photon collection is challenged by undirected emission patterns from optical dipoles, as well as low total internal reflection angles due to the high refractive index of silicon carbide. Based on recent advances with emitters in silicon carbide waveguides, we now demonstrate a comprehensive study of nanophotonic waveguide-to-fiber interfaces in silicon carbide. We find that across a large range of fabrication parameters, our experimental collection efficiencies remain above 90%. Further, by integrating silicon vacancy color centers into these waveguides, we demonstrate an overall photon count rate of 181 kilo-counts per second, which is an order of magnitude higher compared to standard setups. We also quantify the shift of the ground state spin states due to strain fields, which can be introduced by waveguide fabrication techniques. Finally, we show coherent electron spin manipulation with waveguide-integrated emitters with state-of-the-art coherence times of T-2 similar to 42 mu s. The robustness of our methods is very promising for quantum networks based on multiple orchestrated emitters.

TI Minimal physicalism as a scale-free substrate for cognition and
   consciousness
SO NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AB Theories of consciousness and cognition that assume a neural substrate automatically regard phylogenetically basal, nonneural systems as nonconscious and noncognitive. Here, we advance a scale-free characterization of consciousness and cognition that regards basal systems, including synthetic constructs, as not only informative about the structure and function of experience in more complex systems but also as offering distinct advantages for experimental manipulation. Our "minimal physicalist" approach makes no assumptions beyond those of quantum information theory, and hence is applicable from the molecular scale upwards. We show that standard concepts including integrated information, state broadcasting via small-world networks, and hierarchical Bayesian inference emerge naturally in this setting, and that common phenomena including stigmergic memory, perceptual coarse-graining, and attention switching follow directly from the thermodynamic requirements of classical computation. We show that the self-representation that lies at the heart of human autonoetic awareness can be traced as far back as, and serves the same basic functions as, the stress response in bacteria and other basal systems.

AB QUIC is a new network protocol standardized in 2021. It was designed to replace the TCP/ TLS stack and is based on UDP. The most current web standard HTTP / 3 is specifically designed to use QUIC as transport protocol. QUIC claims to provide secure and fast transport with low-latency connection establishment, flow and congestion control, reliable delivery, and stream multiplexing. To achieve the security goals, QUIC enforces the usage of TLS 1.3. It uses authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms to not only protect the payload but also parts of the header. The handshake relies on asymmetric cryptography, which will be broken with the introduction of powerful quantum computers, making the use of post-quantum cryptography inevitable.
   This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the impact of cryptography on QUIC performance. The high-performance QUIC implementations LSQUIC, quiche, and MsQuic are evaluated under different aspects. We break symmetric cryptography down to the different security features. To be able to isolate the impact of cryptography, we implemented a NOOP AEAD algorithm which leaves plaintext unaltered. We show that QUIC performance increases by 10 to 20% when removing packet protection. The header protection has negligible impact on performance, especially for AES ciphers. We integrate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into QUIC, demonstrating its feasibility without major changes to the QUIC libraries by using a TLS library that implements post-quantum algorithms. Kyber, Dilithium, and FALCON are promising candidates for post-quantum secure QUIC, as they have a low impact on the handshake duration. Algorithms like SPHINCS+ with larger key sizes or more complex calculations significantly impact the handshake duration and cause additional issues in our measurements.

TI Fidelity-estimation method for graph states with depolarizing noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Graph states are entangled states that are useful for several quantum information processing tasks, such as measurement-based quantum computation and quantum metrology. As the size of graph states realized in experiments increases, it becomes more essential to devise efficient methods for estimating the fidelity between the ideal graph state and an experimentally realized actual state. Any efficient fidelity-estimation method, in general, must use multiple experimental settings, i.e., needs to switch between at least two measurements. Recently, it has been shown that a single measurement is sufficient if the noise can be modeled as the phase-flip error. Since the bit-flip error should also occur in several experiments, it is desired to extend this simplest method to noise models that include phase and bit-flip errors. However, it seems to be nontrivial because their result strongly depends on properties of the phase-flip error. In this paper, by analyzing effects of the bit-flip error on stabilizer operators of graph states, we achieve the extension to the depolarizing noise, which is a major noise model including phase and bit-flip errors. We also numerically evaluate our simplest method for noise models interpolating between the phase-flip and depolarizing noises.

AB Finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves is a natural algorithmic problem which is known to be equivalent to computing the curves' endomorphism rings.
   When the isogeny is additionally required to have a specific known degree d, the problem appears to be somewhat different in nature, yet its hardness is also required for isogeny-based cryptography.
   Let E-1, E-2 be supersingular elliptic curves over F-p2. We present improved classical and quantum algorithms that compute an isogeny of degree d between E-1 and E-2 if it exists. Let d approximate to p(1/2+epsilon) for some epsilon > 0. Our essentially memory-free algorithms have better time complexity than meet-in-the-middle algorithms, which require exponential memory storage, in the range 1/2 <= epsilon <= 3/4 on a classical computer. For quantum computers, we improve the time complexity in the range 0 < epsilon < 5/2.
   Our strategy is to compute the endomorphism rings of both curves, compute the reduced norm form associated to Hom(E-1, E-2) and try to represent the integer d as a solution of this form. We present multiple approaches to solving this problem which combine guessing certain variables exhaustively (or use Grover's search in the quantum case) with methods for solving quadratic Diophantine equations such as Cornacchia's algorithm and multivariate variants of Coppersmith's method. We provide implementations and experimental results for the different approaches. A solution to the norm form can then be efficiently translated to recover the sought-after isogeny using well-known techniques. As a consequence of our results we show that a recently introduced signature scheme from [3] does not reach NIST level I security.

TI Reversible Tuning of Nanowire Quantum Dot to Atomic Transitions
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Quantum dots embedded in semiconductor photonic nanowires (NW-QDs) can deterministically produce single-photons and entangled photon pairs at high repetition rates. These photons can be efficiently coupled from the photonic nanowire into free space or optical fibers thanks to the sharp tip of the nanowire, which provides impedance matching. However, precise control of the NW-QD emission frequency in a way that is reversible, does not degrade the properties of the emitted photons, and can be used independently for individual NW-QDs on the same chip has so far remained a challenge. Resolving this issue is crucial for applications when interfacing the photons with quantum systems that require MHz to sub-GHz precision, such as atomic ensembles acting as memories in a quantum network. Here, we demonstrate a reversible tuning method that can tune the emission frequency of a NW-QD by more than 300 GHz with sub-GHz precision. We achieve this through gas condensation that is then partially reversed with localized laser ablation. This process finely adjusts stress applied to the quantum dots, thereby tuning their emission frequency. We validate the precision and stability of this method by tuning the frequency of the emitted single-photons across an atomic resonance to probe its absorption and dispersion. We observed up to 80% absorption of the single-photons from NW-QD in hot cesium vapor at the D1-line resonances and a 75-fold decrease in group velocity associated with the hyperfine transitions of the D1-line ground states. We observed no discernible effects in the second-order autocorrelation function, lifetime, or linewidth of the NW-QD emission for up to 300 GHz of tuning and we saw minimal effects on the fine structure splitting of the NW-QD when tuning up to 100 GHz.

TI Simplest Kochen-Specker Set
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, it is because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the simplest KS sets known in dimension three are asymmetrical and require a large number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here, we present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Cabello Simplest bipartite perfect quantum strategies, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025), setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number of inputs: 5-9. We establish the fundamental nature of this set in quantum theory.

TI QISS: Quantum-Enhanced Sustainable Security Incident Handling in the IoT
SO INFORMATION
AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more integral across diverse sectors, including healthcare, energy provision and industrial automation, the exposure to cyber vulnerabilities and potential attacks increases accordingly. Facing these challenges, the essential function of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in safeguarding vital information assets comes to the fore. Within this framework, risk management is key, tasked with the responsibility of adequately restoring the system in the event of a cybersecurity incident and evaluating potential response options. To achieve this, the ISMS must evaluate what is the best response. The time to implement a course of action must be considered, as the period required to restore the ISMS is a crucial factor. However, in an environmentally conscious world, the sustainability dimension should also be considered to choose more sustainable responses. This paper marks a notable advancement in the fields of risk management and incident response, integrating security measures with the wider goals of sustainability and corporate responsibility. It introduces a strategy for handling cybersecurity incidents that considers both the response time and sustainability. This approach provides the flexibility to prioritize either the response time, sustainability or a balanced mix of both, according to specific preferences, and subsequently identifies the most suitable actions to re-secure the system. Employing a quantum methodology, it guarantees reliable and consistent response times, independent of the incident volume. The practical application of this novel method through our framework, MARISMA, is demonstrated in real-world scenarios, underscoring its efficacy and significance in the contemporary landscape of risk management.

TI Correlation Spectroscopy with Multiqubit-Enhanced Phase Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Ramsey interferometry is a widely used tool for precisely measuring transition frequencies between two energy levels of a quantum system, with applications in time keeping, precision spectroscopy, quantum optics, and quantum information. Often, the coherence time of the quantum system surpasses the one of the oscillator probing the system, thereby limiting the interrogation time and associated spectral resolution. Correlation spectroscopy overcomes this limitation by probing two quantum systems with the same noisy oscillator for a measurement of their transition frequency difference; this technique has enabled very precise comparisons of atomic clocks. Here, we extend correlation spectroscopy to the case of multiple quantum systems undergoing strong correlated dephasing. We model Ramsey correlation spectroscopy with N particles as a multiparameter phase estimation problem and demonstrate that multiparticle correlations can assist in reducing the measurement uncertainties even in the absence of entanglement. We derive precision limits and optimal sensing techniques for this problem and compare the performance of probe states and measurement with and without entanglement. Using one- and two-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals with up to 91 qubits, we experimentally demonstrate the advantage of measuring multiparticle correlations for reducing phase uncertainties and apply correlation spectroscopy to measure ion -ion distances, transition frequency shifts, laser -ion detunings, and path-length fluctuations. Our method can be straightforwardly implemented in experimental setups with globally coherent qubit control and qubit-resolved single-shot readout and is, thus, applicable to other physical systems such as neutral atoms in tweezer arrays.

TI Breaking local quantum speed limits with steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show how quantum correlations allow us to break the local speed limits of physical processes using only local measurements and classical communication between two parties that share an entangled state. Inequalities that bound the minimal time of evolution of a quantum state by energy fluctuations can be violated in the presence of steering by conditioning on the measurement outcomes of a remote system. Our results open up pathways for studying how quantum correlations influence the dynamical properties of states and observables.

TI Construction of Quantum Codes from Constacyclic Codes Over the Class of
   Commutative Rings
SO CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB This paper primarily investigates the structural properties of constacyclic codes over the ring R-k, defined as R-k = F(p)m[w(1), w(2), ... , w(k)]/< w(i)(2) - 1, w(i)w(j)-w(j)w(i)> where i, j = 1, 2, 3, ... , k, and k, m are positive integers. Here, F-pm denotes a finite field of order p(m) with characteristic p, an odd prime. Furthermore, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the duals of constacyclic codes to exist. These findings make it easier to create new Quantum Error-Correcting (QEC) codes throughout the ring R-1 (i.e., when k = 1), as well as optimal linear codes that make use of the Gray images of constacyclic codes. Additionally, Table 4 presents several Linear Complementary Dual (LCD) codes obtained using the Gray map.

TI Cyclic codes over F2 X (F2+vF2) and binary quantum codes
SO FILOMAT
AB In the present study, we define cyclic codes over the commutative principal ideal ring F2 X (F2 + vF2) with v2 = v and obtain some results on cyclic codes over F2 X (F2 + vF2). We also investigate the dual of a cyclic code over F2 X (F2 + vF2) depending on two inner products. We determine a generator polynomial of cyclic codes and give the calculation of the number of cyclic codes over F2 X (F2 + vF2). Furthermore, we show that the Gray images of a cyclic code over F2 X (F2 + vF2) of length n are binary quasi-cyclic codes of length 3n and of index 3. We find numerous binary codes as Gray images of cyclic codes over F2 X (F2 + vF2) and tabulate the optimal ones. Moreover, we show that it is possible to obtain binary quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) from cyclic codes over F2 X (F2 + vF2).

TI Ideal Quantum Teleamplification up to a Selected Energy Cutoff Using
   Linear Optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a linear optical technique that can implement ideal quantum teleamplification up to the nth Fock state, where n can be any positive integer. Here teleamplification consists of both quantum teleportation and noiseless linear amplification (NLA). This simple protocol consists of a beam splitter and an (n + 1) splitter, with n ancillary photons and detection of n photons. For a given target fidelity, our technique improves success probability and physical resource costs by orders of magnitude over current alternative teleportation and NLA schemes. We show how this protocol can also be used as a loss-tolerant quantum relay for entanglement distribution and distillation.

TI Postselection-Free Entanglement Dynamics via Spacetime Duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The dynamics of entanglement in "hybrid" nonunitary circuits (for example, involving both unitary gates and quantum measurements) has recently become an object of intense study. A major hurdle toward experimentally realizing this physics is the need to apply postselection on random measurement outcomes in order to repeatedly prepare a given output state, resulting in an exponential overhead. We propose a method to sidestep this issue in a wide class of nonunitary circuits by taking advantage of spacetime duality. This method maps the purification dynamics of a mixed state under nonunitary evolution onto a particular correlation function in an associated unitary circuit. This translates to an operational protocol which could be straightforwardly implemented on a digital quantum simulator. We discuss the signatures of different entanglement phases, and demonstrate examples via numerical simulations. With minor modifications, the proposed protocol allows measurement of the purity of arbitrary subsystems, which could shed light on the properties of the quantum error correcting code formed by the mixed phase in this class of hybrid dynamics.

TI Quantum adversarial generation of high-resolution images
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB As a promising model in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) are rapidly advancing, offering applications in image processing and generation. However, another emerging paradigm represents an image as a Quantum Implicit Neural Representation (QINR). In this work, we propose a novel architectural technique for building QINR-based QGAN to enhance the quality of images generated by QGANs. Additionally, we integrate classical techniques, such as Gradient Penalty and Wasserstein distance, to train QINR-QGAN. In image generation tasks, we demonstrated that QINR-QGAN can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing the number of trainable quantum parameters. Specifically, QINR-QGAN reduced the trainable quantum parameters by nearly 10 times compared to PQWGAN (Tsang et al. in IEEE Trans. Quantum Eng. 4:1-19, 2023) and Quantum AnoGAN (Herr et al. Quantum Sci. Technol. 6(4): 045004, 2021), demonstrating its superior efficiency in parameter optimization without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on the CelebA dataset to tackle a more complex task and generate larger images (78x64\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$78\times 64$\end{document}). The results indicate that our model is capable of successfully completing the face generation task.

TI Toward heralded single-photon storage via chiral cavity-enhanced
   spontaneous Raman scattering
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose a scheme of heralded storages of single photons via spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) enhanced by a chiral standing-wave cavity, which creates a non-classically correlated pair of a spin wave and a Stokes photon (heralded photon) when a single-photon "write" pulse is applied to an atomic ensemble. In this scheme, to decrease the power of the write pulse for SRS, the write laser and the Stokes fields are aligned to propagate near-collinearly through the atoms. The short storage lifetime remains a challenge in standing-wave cavity-enhanced SRS. To prolong the storage lifetime, we achieve a long-wavelength spin-wave memory by removing the backward-scattering Stokes field from the cavity, which is realized by using non-reciprocal couplings between the Stokes fields and the atoms. In the experiment, the memory lifetime is demonstrated up to similar to 100 mu s, which is beyond the limitation (similar to 350 ns) of the storage in the atomic ensembles coupled to standing-wave cavities. We achieve a spin-wave memory for the write pulse containing a mean photon number of similar to 4. The quantum correlation of the Stokes-spin-wave pairs is beyond 2, which gives strong evidence of non-classical behavior.

TI Resonator-mediated quantum gate between distant charge qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Strong charge-photon coupling allows the coherent coupling of a charge qubit, realized by a single charge carrier (either an electron or a hole) in a double quantum dot, to photons of a microwave resonator. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the dispersive regime, the photons can mediate both an iSWAP gate as well as a iSWAP gate between two distant charge qubits. We provide a thorough discussion of the impact of the dominant noise sources, resonator damping and charge qubit dephasing on the average gate fidelity. Assuming a state-of-the art resonator decay rate and charge qubit dephasing rate, the predicted average gate fidelities are below 90%. However, a decrease of the charge qubit dephasing rate by one order of magnitude is conjectured to result in gate fidelities surpassing 95%.

TI Unraveling the Nexus of ML and 6G: Challenges, Opportunities, and Future
   Directions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Machine learning (ML) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks together present a revolutionary paradigm ready to meet hitherto unheard-of needs in connection, scalability, and intelligence. Including physical-layer signal processing, edge computing, resource optimisation, network slicing, and security, this study provides a thorough and cross-layer study of ML integration into 6G systems. Unlike previous works that concentrate on isolated use cases, this paper systematically classifies and evaluates developing techniques such as federated learning (FL), quantum machine learning (QML), swarm intelligence, and explainable AI within the framework of key 6G performance indicators including ultra-low latency, energy efficiency, and privacy. Presenting a thorough taxonomy and comparative benchmarking, we show the operational trade-offs of centralised, distributed, and meta-learning models. We also find important difficulties like model heterogeneity across ultra-dense networks, adversarial vulnerability in FL, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted privacy risks. Moreover, we describe open research areas and suggest a single orchestration design to support intelligent, scalable, and reliable 6G systems. Researchers and professionals aiming to create strong, ML-driven wireless infrastructures beyond 5G find basic reference in this work.

TI Toward the Realization of Single-Photon Sources for Radiometry
   Applications at Room Temperature
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Single-photon sources based on single emitters, such as 2-D materials and impurities in diamond, are of great interest for many application fields, including quantum communication, quantum metrology, and quantum sensing. In photometry and radiometry, a single-photon source, having the ability to emit only one photon in a well-defined time and frequency domain, represents a promising candidate to realize a photon number-based primary standard for quantum radiometry. At the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), we have realized three kinds of single-photon sources based on various single emitters at room temperature: silicon vacancy (SiV) in diamond, defects in gallium nitride (GaN), and vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We found common factors related to the relaxation times of the internal states that indirectly affect the photon number stability. We observed a high photon number stability in the GaN emitter due to faster relaxation times compared with the hBN emitter, which, on the other hand, produced high rates of photons per second (>10(6)). Moreover, we demonstrate repeatable radiant flux measurements of a bright hBN single-photon emitter for a wide radiant flux range from a few tens of femtowatts to one picowatt.

TI Quantum Kernel Learning for Small Dataset Modeling in Semiconductor
   Fabrication: Application to Ohmic Contact
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Omega<middle dot>mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.

TI Room-temperature electron spin polarization exceeding 90% in an
   opto-spintronic semiconductor nanostructure via remote spin filtering
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB An exclusive advantage of semiconductor spintronics is its potential for opto-spintronics, which will allow integration of spin-based information processing/storage with photon-based information transfer/communications. Unfortunately, progress has so far been severely hampered by the failure to generate nearly fully spin-polarized charge carriers in semiconductors at room temperature. Here we demonstrate successful generation of conduction electron spin polarization exceeding 90% at room temperature without a magnetic field in a non-magnetic all-semiconductor nanostructure, which remains high even up to 110 degrees C. This is accomplished by remote spin filtering of InAs quantum-dot electrons via an adjacent tunnelling-coupled GaNAs spin filter. We further show that the quantum-dot electron spin can be remotely manipulated by spin control in the adjacent spin filter, paving the way for remote spin encoding and writing of quantum memory as well as for remote spin control of spin-photon interfaces. This work demonstrates the feasibility to implement opto-spintronic functionality in common semiconductor nanostructures.

TI Quantum Deep Neural Network Based Classification of Attack Vectors on
   the Ethereum Blockchain
SO EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB INTRODUCTION: The implementation of robust security protocols is imperative in light of the exponential growth of blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. The importance of developing more effective strategies to detect and counter potential attacks is growing in tandem with the sophistication of the methods employed by attackers. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages quantum computing to identify and predict attack vectors on the Ethereum OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to suggest an innovative methodology for enhancing the security of Ethereum by leveraging quantum computing. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that QRBM and QDN are efficient in identifying and predicting security flaws in blockchain transactions. METHODS: We combined methods from quantum computing with social network research approaches. An enormous dataset containing both genuine Ethereum transactions and a carefully chosen spectrum of malicious activity indicative of popular attack vectors was used to train our model, the QRBM. Thanks to the dataset, the QRBM was able to learn to distinguish between typical and out-of-the-ordinary activities. RESULTS: In comparison to more conventional deep learning models, the QRBM showed substantially better accuracy when it came to identifying transaction behaviours. The model's improved scalability and efficiency were made possible by its quantum nature, which is defined by features like entanglement and superposition. Specifically, the QRBM handled non-informative inputs better and solved problems faster. CONCLUSION: This study paves the way for further investigation into quantum-enhanced cybersecurity measures and highlights the promise of quantum neural networks in strengthening the security of blockchain technology. According to our research, quantum computing has the potential to be an essential tool in creating Ethereum-style blockchain security systems that are more advanced, efficient, and resilient.

TI Optical vortex spin-orbit control of refractive index in iron garnets
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB The interaction between light's angular momentum (AM) and material systems has unlocked new avenues in structured photonics, including in magneto-optical (MO) materials. While spin angular momentum (SAM) effects in MO systems are well-established, orbital angular momentum (OAM) introduces novel opportunities for new nonreciprocal light-matter interactions. We demonstrate a unique optical phenomenon where OAM states undergo state-specific nonreciprocal operation within an MO medium, reducing Faraday rotation. In this study, we derive the perturbation to the Hamiltonian for the electronic transition in the presence of optical OAM. The reduction of Faraday rotation is verified experimentally using OAM Mach-Zehnder interferometry. This effect arises from transverse momentum transfer into the material, inducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at a perturbed electronic transition rate. The resulting OAM-dependent optical SOC modifies the material's refractive index, directly linking structured light and MO response. Our findings extend previous observations of paraxial beams and reveal a deeper fundamental mechanism governing OAM-driven nonreciprocal interactions. These insights pave the way for OAM-selective nonreciprocal photonic devices, chiral optical logic, quantum memory elements, and ultrafast spintronic architectures. This work advances MO integration with structured light for enhanced control over photonic and spintronic systems.

TI NOON-state interference in the frequency domain
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The examination of entanglement across various degrees of freedom has been pivotal in augmenting our understanding of fundamental physics, extending to high dimensional quantum states, and promising the scalability of quantum technologies. In this paper, we demonstrate the photon number path entanglement in the frequency domain by implementing a frequency beam splitter that converts the single-photon frequency to another with 50% probability using Bragg scattering four-wave mixing. The two-photon NOON state in a single-mode fiber is generated in the frequency domain, manifesting the two-photon interference with two-fold enhanced resolution compared to that of single-photon interference, showing the outstanding stability of the interferometer. This successful translation of quantum states in the frequency domain will pave the way toward the discovery of fascinating quantum phenomena and scalable quantum information processing.
   We report the NOON-state interference in the frequency domain. Two photons with distinct colors, blue and red, are injected into an interferometer constructed with two frequency beam splitters. The resultant interference pattern is then observed.

TI Relation between spectra of Narain CFTs and properties of associated
   boolean functions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recently, the construction of Narain CFT from a certain class of quantum error correcting codes has been discovered. In particular, the spectral gap of Narain CFT corresponds to the binary distance of the code, not the genuine Hamming distance. In this paper, we show that the binary distance is identical to the so-called EPC distance of the boolean function uniquely associated with the quantum code. Therefore, seeking Narain CFT with large spectral gap can be addressed by getting a boolean function with high EPC distance. Furthermore, this problem can be undertaken by finding lower Peak-to-Average Power ratio (PAR) with respect to the binary truth table of the boolean function. Though this is neither sufficient nor necessary condition for high EPC distance, we construct some examples of relatively high EPC distances referring to the constructions for lower PAR. We also see that codes with high distance are related to induced graphs with low independence numbers.

TI A Fault-Tolerant Honeycomb Memory
SO QUANTUM
AB Recently, Hastings & Haah introduced a quantum memory defined on the honeycomb lattice [24]. Remarkably, this honeycomb code assembles weight-six parity checks using only two-local measurements. The sparse connectivity and two-local measurements are desirable features for certain hardware, while the weight-six parity checks enable robust performance in the circuit model.
   In this work, we quantify the robustness of logical qubits preserved by the honeycomb code using a correlated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the "teraquop regime" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably. We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a threshold of 0.2% - 0.3% for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of 0.5% - 0.7% for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a threshold of 1.5% < p < 2.0%, where p is the collective error rate of the two-body measurement gate including both measurement and correlated data depolarization error processes. With such gates at a physical error rate of 10(-3), we project that the honeycomb code can reach the teraquop regime with only 600 physical qubits.

TI CONSTRUCTION OF LINEAR CODES WITH VARIOUS HERMITIAN HULL DIMENSIONS AND
   RELATED EAQECCS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB The hull of a linear code is the intersection of the code and its dual code, which is effective for determining parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). There are few constructions of linear codes with various Hermitian hull dimensions, aside from Hermitian LCD and self-orthogonal codes. The object of this paper is to introduce a building-up construction for constructing linear [n + 2, k + 1] codes with l or (l + 1)-dimensional Hermitian hull from a given linear [n, k] code with l-dimension Hermitian hull of a smaller length. This construction includes the converse of the famous shortening technique as a special case. Using this method, we construct optimal quaternary linear codes of lengths up to 13 with Hermitian hull dimensions 2-5. As an application, we construct many EAQECCs, which improve the parameters of EAQECCs of Grassl's code table.

TI Persistent Charging of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals
   Confined in Glass Matrix
SO SMALL
AB Manipulation of persistent charges in semiconductor nanostructure is the key point to obtain quantum bits towards the application of quantum memory and information devices. However, realizing persistent charge storage in semiconductor nano-systems is still very challenge due to the disturbance from crystal defects and environment conditions. Herein, the two-photon persistent charging induced long-lasting afterglow and charged exciton formation are observed in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in glass host with effective lifetime surpassing one second, where the glass inclosure provides effective protection. A method combining the femtosecond and second time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy is explored to determine the persistent charging possibility of perovskite NCs unambiguously. Meanwhile, with temperature-dependent spectroscopy, the underlying mechanism of this persistent charging is elucidated. A two-channel carrier transfer model is proposed involving athermal quantum tunneling and slower thermal-assisted channel. On this basis, two different information storage devices are demonstrated with the memory time exceeding two hours under low-temperature condition. These results provide a new strategy to realize persistent charging in perovskite NCs and deepen the understanding of the underlying carrier kinetics, which may pave an alternative way towards novel information memory and optical data storage applications.

TI A hyperparameter study for quantum kernel methods
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum kernel methods are a promising method in quantum machine learning thanks to the guarantees connected to them. Their accessibility for analytic considerations also opens up the possibility of prescreening datasets based on their potential for a quantum advantage. To do so, earlier works developed the geometric difference, which can be understood as a closeness measure between two kernel-based machine learning approaches, most importantly between a quantum kernel and a classical kernel. This metric links the quantum and classical model complexities, and it was developed to bound generalization error. Therefore, it raises the question of how this metric behaves in an empirical setting. In this work, we investigate the effects of hyperparameter choice on the model performance and the generalization gap between classical and quantum kernels. The importance of hyperparameters is well known also for classical machine learning. Of special interest are hyperparameters associated with the quantum Hamiltonian evolution feature map, as well as the number of qubits to trace out before computing a projected quantum kernel. We conduct a thorough investigation of the hyperparameters across 11 datasets, and we identify certain aspects that can be exploited. Analyzing the effects of certain hyperparameter settings on the empirical performance, as measured by cross validation accuracy, and generalization ability, as measured by geometric difference described above, brings us one step closer to understanding the potential of quantum kernel methods on classical datasets.

TI Hydrophilic direct bonding of (100) diamond and deposited
   SiO2 substrates
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Diamond has emerged as a leading material for solid-state spin quantum systems and extreme environment electronics. However, a major limitation is that most diamond devices and structures are fabricated using bulk diamond plates. The absence of a suitable diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate hinders the advanced nanofabrication of diamond quantum and electronic devices, posing a significant roadblock to large-scale, on-chip diamond quantum photonics and electronics systems. In this work, we demonstrate the direct bonding of (100) single-crystal diamond plates to PECVD-grown SiO2/Si substrates at low temperatures and atmospheric conditions. The surfaces of the SiO2 and diamond plates are then activated using oxygen plasma and Piranha solution, respectively. Bonding occurs when the substrates are brought into contact with water in between and annealed at 200 degrees C under atmospheric conditions, resulting in a DOI substrate. We systematically studied the influence of Piranha solution treatment time and diamond surface roughness on the shear strength of the bonded substrate, devising an optimal bonding process that achieves a high yield rate of 90% and a maximum shear strength of 9.6 MPa. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used for quantitative analysis of the surface chemicals at the bonding interface. It appears that the amount of -OH bindings increases with the initial roughness of the diamond, facilitating the strong bonding with SiO2. This direct bonding method will pave the way for scalable manufacturing of diamond nanophotonic devices and enable large-scale integration of diamond quantum and electronic systems.

TI Fast Cycling Speed with Multimillion Cycling Endurance of Ultra-Low Loss
   Phase Change Material (Sb2Se3) by Engineered Laser
   Pulse Irradiation
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Programmable and reconfigurable photonics is revolutionized the next generation of Si/SiN-based photonics processors, optical signal processing, and neural and quantum networks. Ultra-low loss phase-change technology has the enormous potential to offer energy-efficient, extra large-scale integrated (ELSI) nonvolatile programmable photonics that can overcome the limitations of commonly used volatile and energy-hungry programmable photonic systems. So far, most of the phase change materials (PCM) devices have already shown to be suitable for programmable and reconfigurable photonic circuit applications that do not require extreme endurance or ultra-fast switching speeds. However, applications with ultra-fast speed and multi-million cycling requirements, such as memory cells, quantum computing, optical displays, and optical modulators necessitate enormous improvements in the existing cycling speed and endurance of PCMs, for high-performance device configuration. Here, optical switching of an ultra-low loss PCM (Sb2Se3) is demonstrated with an unprecedented combination of rapid cycling speed (0.6 x 10(5) cycles s(-1)) and extreme endurance (> 2 x 10(6) cycles) that pave the way for ultrafast, large-scale, programmable, and reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits and devices.

TI Memory burden effect in black holes and solitons: Implications for PBH
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The essence of the memory burden effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as "saturons." The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge. We identify certain new features of potential observational interest, such as the model-independent spread of the stabilized masses of initially degenerate primordial black holes.

Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of series, except 8 and with even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over F (or 7L) and Narain CFTs.

TI Agile, post-quantum secure cryptography in avionics
SO CEAS AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
AB To introduce a post-quantum-secure encryption scheme specifically for use in flight-computers, we used avionics' module-isolation methods to wrap a recent encryption standard (HPKE-Hybrid Public Key Encryption) within a software partition. This solution proposes an upgrade to HPKE, using quantum-resistant ciphers (Kyber/ML-KEM and Dilithium/ML-DSA) redundantly alongside well-established ciphers, to achieve post-quantum security. Because cryptographic technology can suddenly become obsolete as attacks become more sophisticated, "crypto-agility"-the ability to swiftly replace ciphers-represents the key challenge to deployment of software like ours. Partitioning is a crucial method for establishing such agility, as it enables the replacement of compromised software without affecting software on other partitions, greatly simplifying the certification process necessary in an avionics environment. Our performance measurements (Sect. 5) provide initial evidence that both the memory and cpu performance characteristics of this solution are suitable for deployment in flight-computers. Performance measurements show a memory use of 5 MB of RAM and under 200 KB of stack usage for encryption, compared to a baseline implementation without any encryption; decryption is much more lightweight (under 300 KB RAM overhead, under 100 KB of stack requirement overhead). Generally, the post-quantum algorithms benchmarked where faster than their pre-quantum alternatives; due to the use of hybrid security this leads to a performance overhead of just about 90% compared to the pre-quantum only variant. The implementations benchmarked are optimized for CPU-performance and alternative, lower quality implementations showed much more modest memory requirements, leading us to conclude that there is much room for optimization, targeting use-case specific tradeoffs between memory use and performance.

TI Federated learning with tensor networks: a quantum AI framework for
   healthcare
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The healthcare industry frequently handles sensitive and proprietary data, and due to strict privacy regulations, it is often reluctant to share it directly. In today's context, Federated Learning (FL) stands out as a crucial remedy, facilitating the rapid advancement of distributed machine learning while effectively managing critical concerns regarding data privacy and governance. The fusion of federated learning and quantum computing represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary approach with immense potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to finance. In this work, we propose a federated learning framework based on quantum tensor networks (QTNs) that takes advantage of the principles of many-body quantum physics. Currently, there are no known classical tensor networks (TNs) implemented in federated settings. Furthermore, we investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework by conducting a differential privacy analysis to ensure the security of sensitive data across healthcare institutions. Experiments on popular medical image datasets show that the federated quantum tensor network (FedQTNs) model achieved a mean receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve of 91%-98%, outperforming several state-of-the-art federated learning methods. Moreover, QTN models require fewer parameters in FL settings compared to traditional classical models, which often suffer from over-parameterization. This reduction in parameters not only improves the efficiency of the communication process but also significantly decreases data consumption during training. As a result, QTN models facilitate a more effective and resource-efficient approach to training in decentralized environments with limited communication bandwidth. The FedQTN models demonstrate a smaller performance drop even when using strong differential privacy settings, maintaining higher accuracy compared to classical models under similar privacy constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantum federated global model, consisting of highly entangled TN structures, showed better generalization and robustness and achieved higher testing accuracy, surpassing the performance of locally trained clients under unbalanced data distributions among healthcare institutions.

TI Tunable microcavities coupled to rare-earth quantum emitters
SO OPTICA
AB Electro-optical control of on-chip photonic devices is an essential tool for efficient integrated photonics. Lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) is an emerging platform for on-chip photonics due to its large electro-optic coefficient and high nonlinearity. Integrating quantum emitters into LNOI would extend their versatility in classic photonics to quantum computing and communication. Here, we incorporate rare-earth ion (REI) quantum emitters into electro-optical tunable lithium niobite (LN) thin films and demonstrate control of LN microcavities coupled to REIs over a frequency range of 160 GHz with 5 mu switching speed. Dynamic control of the cavities enables modulation of the Purcell enhancement of REIs with short time constants. Using Purcell enhancement, we show evidence of detecting single Yb3+ ions in LN cavities. Coupling quantum emitters in fast tunable photonic devices is an efficient method to shape the waveform of the emitter. It also offers a platform to encode quantum information in the integration of a spectral-temporal-spatial domain to achieve high levels of channel multiplexing, as well as an approach to generate deterministic single-photon sources.

TI Coherent and non-unitary errors in ZZ-generated gates
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational algorithms such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm have attracted attention due to their potential for solving problems using near-term quantum computers. The ZZ interaction typically generates the primitive two-qubit gate in such algorithms applied for a time, typically a variational parameter, gamma. Different compilation techniques exist with respect to the implementation of two-qubit gates. Due to the importance of the ZZ-gate, we present an error analysis comparing the continuous-angle controlled phase gate (CP) against the fixed angle controlled Z-gate (CZ). We analyze both techniques under the influence of coherent over-rotation and depolarizing noise. We show that CP and CZ compilation techniques achieve comparable ZZ-gate fidelities if the incoherent error is below 0.03% and the coherent error is below 0.8%. Thus, we argue that for small coherent and incoherent error a non-parameterized two-qubit gate such as CZ in combination with virtual Z decomposition for single-qubit gates could lead to a significant reduction in the calibration required and, therefore, a less error-prone quantum device. We show that above a coherent error of 0.04 pi (2%), the CZ gate fidelity depends significantly on gamma.

TI Research of radiation characteristics in a parametrically driven cavity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) serves as a fundamental platform for studying light-matter interactions at a single-particle level and has been extensively investigated in fundamental physics and quantum information. Recent development of parametrically squeezed techniques has demonstrated that they have the remarkable ability to exponentially enhance coherent atom-cavity coupling. However, the full extent to which these techniques can manipulate quantum optical phenomena requires further exploration. This work systematically investigates the influence of optical parametric amplification on single-photon excited atom-cavity systems within a parametrically driven cavity. In the proposed model, optical parametric amplification converts the driving photons into a squeezed cavity mode, which enhances the atom-cavity interaction into the strong coupling region. Through analytical derivation of atomic and cavity radiation spectra, we demonstrate that the optical parametric amplification induces splitting of atomic radiation spectra while exerting negligible effects on spectral intensity. Conversely, the cavity transmission spectrum exhibits both pronounced splitting and nonlinear intensity amplification. Notably, as driving field intensity approaches a critical intensity regime, the cavity radiation spectrum intensity is significantly enhanced. The underlying mechanism is parametric driving amplification, which converts the driving light into a squeezed cavity mode. When this squeezed mode is mapped back to the fundamental mode of the cavity through Bogoliubov squeezing transformation, the pump photons within the squeezed cavity mode are converted into the photons that contribute to the radiation spectrum of the cavity, thereby amplifying its intensity. This parametric enhancement method not only deepens the basic understanding of light-matter interactions, but also establishes a practical framework for improving the single-photon detection sensitivity in cavity-based quantum systems. These findings have broad prospects for quantum sensing and information processing applications.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical multi-cut Benders approach with a power system
   application
SO COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Leveraging the current generation of quantum devices to solve optimization problems of practical interest necessitates the development of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) solution approaches. In this paper, a multi -cut Benders decomposition (BD) approach that exploits multiple feasible solutions of the master problem (MP) to generate multiple valid cuts is adapted, so as to be used as an HQC solver for general mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The use of different cut selection criteria and strategies to manage the size of the MP by eliciting a subset of cuts to be added in each iteration of the BD scheme using quantum computing is discussed. The HQC optimization algorithm is applied to the Unit Commitment (UC) problem. UC is a prototypical use case of optimization applied to electrical power systems, a critical sector that may benefit from advances in quantum computing. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer.

TI High-speed train timetable optimization based on space-time network
   model and quantum simulator
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Timetable scheduling is a combinatorial optimization problem that presents formidable challenges for classical computers. This paper introduces a pioneering methodology for addressing the high-speed train timetabling problem through quantum computing. Initially, a comprehensive binary integer programming model, grounded in the space-time network, is proposed (M1). To manage the intricacy of model M1, a knapsack problem reformulation is employed to establish a simplified binary integer programming model (M2). Both M1 and M2 are subsequently converted into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models to harness the potential of quantum computing. Several techniques, including the Gurobi solver, simulated annealing, and the coherent Ising machine (CIM) quantum simulator, are deployed to solve the model across four distinct scenarios of varying complexity. The findings indicate that CIM quantum simulator outperforms the simulated annealing method in terms of solution quality for medium-scale problems.

TI Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum-gate error
   mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require previous characterization of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that our method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values on current quantum hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.

TI A Quantum-Resistant Blockchain System: A Comparative Analysis
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Blockchain transactions are decentralized, secure, and transparent, and they have altered industries. However, the emergence of quantum computing presents a severe security risk to the traditional encryption algorithms used in blockchain. Post-quantum signatures are required to preserve integrity and reliability. Furthermore, combining the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) with blockchain provides a long-term strategy for data storage and sharing. This study investigates the integration of post-quantum signatures with the IPFS in a blockchain system, which can considerably enhance blockchain system efficiency. We increase security and efficiency by recording hash values of signatures and public keys within the blockchain and storing their actual content using the IPFS. The study compares NIST-recommended post-quantum signatures with the ECDSA in a Bitcoin exchange scheme to show how effective the system is in countering quantum threats while maintaining optimal performance. This research makes an important addition to the long-term viability and dependability of blockchain technology in the face of the growing landscape of quantum computing breakthroughs.

TI Defining quantum-ready primitives for hybrid HPC-QC supercomputing: a
   case study in Hamiltonian simulation
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB As computational demands in scientific applications continue to rise, hybrid high-performance computing (HPC) systems integrating classical and quantum computers (HPC-QC) are emerging as a promising approach to tackling complex computational challenges. One critical area of application is Hamiltonian simulation, a fundamental task in quantum physics and other large-scale scientific domains. This paper investigates strategies for quantum-classical integration to enhance Hamiltonian simulation within hybrid supercomputing environments. By analyzing computational primitives in HPC allocations dedicated to these tasks, we identify key components in Hamiltonian simulation workflows that stand to benefit from quantum acceleration. To this end, we systematically break down the Hamiltonian simulation process into discrete computational phases, highlighting specific primitives that could be effectively offloaded to quantum processors for improved efficiency. Our empirical findings provide insights into system integration, potential offloading techniques, and the challenges of achieving seamless quantum-classical interoperability. We assess the feasibility of quantum-ready primitives within HPC workflows and discuss key barriers such as synchronization, data transfer latency, and algorithmic adaptability. These results contribute to the ongoing development of optimized hybrid solutions, advancing the role of quantum-enhanced computing in scientific research.

TI Observation of the quantum Gouy phase
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Controlling the evolution of photonic quantum states is crucial for most quantum information processing and metrology tasks. Due to its importance, many mechanisms of quantum state evolution have been tested in detail and are well understood; however, the fundamental phase anomaly of evolving waves, called the Gouy phase, has had a limited number of studies in the context of elementary quantum states of light, especially in the case of photon number states. Here we outline a simple method for calculating the quantum state evolution upon propagation and demonstrate experimentally how this quantum Gouy phase affects two-photon quantum states. Our results show that the increased phase sensitivity of multi-photon states also extends to this fundamental phase anomaly and has to be taken into account to fully understand the state evolution. We further demonstrate how the Gouy phase can be used as a tool for manipulating quantum states of any bosonic system in future quantum technologies, outline a possible application in quantum-enhanced sensing, and dispel a common misconception attributing the increased phase sensitivity of multi-photon quantum states solely to an effective de Broglie wavelength.

TI Microsphere-assisted generation of localized optical emitters in 2D
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Crystal defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as versatile nanoscale optical probes with a wide application profile, spanning the fields of nanophotonics, biosensing, bioimaging, and quantum information processing. However, generating these crystal defects as reliable optical emitters remains challenging due to the need for deterministic defect placement and precise control of the emission area. Here, we demonstrate an approach that integrates microspheres with hBN crystal lattices to enhance both hBN defect generation and optical signal readout. This technique harnesses microspheres to amplify light-matter interactions at the nanoscale through two mechanisms: focused femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation into a photonic nanojet (PNJ) for highly localized defect generation and enhanced light collection via the whispering gallery mode (WGM) effect. Our microsphere-assisted defect generation method reduces the emission area by a factor of 5 and increases the fluorescence collection efficiency by approximately 10 times compared to microsphere-free samples. These advancements in defect generation precision and signal collection efficiency open new possibilities for optical emitter manipulation in hBN, with potential applications in quantum technologies and nanoscale sensing.

TI Heterogeneous integration of single InAs/InP quantum dots with the SOI
   chip using direct bonding
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum information processing with photons in small -footprint and highly integrated silicon -based photonic chips requires incorporating non -classical light sources. In this respect, self -assembled III -V semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are an attractive solution, however, they must be combined with the silicon platform. Here, by utilizing the large -area direct bonding technique, we demonstrate the hybridization of InP and SOI chips, which allows for coupling single photons to the SOI chip interior, offering cost-effective scalability in setting up a multi -source environment for quantum photonic chips. We fabricate devices consisting of self -assembled InAs QDs embedded in the tapered InP waveguide (WG) positioned over the SOI-defined Si WG. Focusing on devices generating light in the telecom C -band compatible with the low -loss optical fiber networks, we demonstrate the light coupling between InP and SOI platforms by observing photons outcoupled at the InP-made circular Bragg grating outcoupler fabricated at the end of an 80 pm -long Si WG, and at the cleaved edge of the Si WG. Finally, for a device with suppressed multi -photon generation events exhibiting 80 % single photon generation purity, we measure the photon number outcoupled at the cleaved facet of the Si WG. We estimate the directional on -chip photon coupling between the source and the Si WG to 5.1 %.

TI Test and Characterization of Multilayer Ion Traps on Fused Silica
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Ion traps are a promising architecture to host a future quantum computer. Several challenges, such as signal-routing, power dissipation, and fabrication quality, need to be overcome to scale ion trap devices to hundreds of ions. Currently, ion traps are often fabricated on silicon substrates which result in high power dissipation. Substrates that lead to lower power dissipation are preferred. In this work, a multi-metal layer ion trap is presented on a fused silica substrate that is fabricated and tested in an industrial facility. Its design and material-stack are tailored to minimize power dissipation. Furthermore, the integrated temperature sensors are characterized and functionality down to 10 K is verified. Moreover, an automated wafer test is demonstrated to validate each trap chip prior to its integration into experimental setups. Subsequently, electric field noise and electric stray fields are characterized using a single trapped-ion as a probe, showing an improvement in trap performance over similar trap designs realized on silicon substrates.

TI Identifiability and characterization of transmon qutrits through
   Bayesian experimental design
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Robust control of a quantum system is essential to utilize the current noisy quantum hardware to its full potential, such as quantum algorithms. To achieve such a goal, a systematic search for an optimal control for any given experiment is essential. The design of optimal control pulses requires accurate numerical models and, therefore, accurate characterization of the system parameters. We present an online Bayesian approach for quantum characterization of qutrit systems, which automatically and systematically identifies optimal experiments that provide maximum information on the system parameters, thereby greatly reducing the number of experiments that need to be performed on the quantum testbed. Unlike most characterization protocols that provide point-estimates of the parameters, the proposed approach is able to estimate their probability distribution. The applicability of the Bayesian experimental design technique was demonstrated on test problems, where each experiment was defined by a parameterized control pulse. In addition to this, we also present an approach for iterative pulse extension, which is robust under uncertainties in transition frequencies and coherence times, and shot noise, despite being initialized with wide uninformative priors. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical proof of the theoretical identifiability of the model parameters and present conditions on the quantum state under which the parameters are identifiable. The proof and conditions for identifiability are presented for both closed and open quantum systems using the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and the Lindblad master equation, respectively.

TI Modeling Heterogeneous Catalysis Using Quantum Computers: An Academic
   and Industry Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Heterogeneous catalysis plays a critical role in many industrial processes, including the production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, and research to improve current catalytic processes is important to make the chemical industry more sustainable. Despite its importance, the challenge of identifying optimal catalysts with the required activity and selectivity persists, demanding a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants at various length and time scales. Density functional theory (DFT) has been the workhorse in modeling heterogeneous catalysis for more than three decades. While DFT has been instrumental, this review explores the application of quantum computing algorithms in modeling heterogeneous catalysis, which could bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understanding catalytic interfaces. Bridging academic and industrial perspectives by focusing on emerging materials, such as multicomponent alloys, single-atom catalysts, and magnetic catalysts, we delve into the limitations of DFT in capturing strong correlation effects and spin-related phenomena. The review also presents important algorithms and their applications relevant to heterogeneous catalysis modeling to showcase advancements in the field. Additionally, the review explores embedding strategies where quantum computing algorithms handle strongly correlated regions, while traditional quantum chemistry algorithms address the remainder, thereby offering a promising approach for large-scale heterogeneous catalysis modeling. Looking forward, ongoing investments by academia and industry reflect a growing enthusiasm for quantum computing's potential in heterogeneous catalysis research. The review concludes by envisioning a future where quantum computing algorithms seamlessly integrate into research workflows, propelling us into a new era of computational chemistry and thereby reshaping the landscape of modeling heterogeneous catalysis.

TI Enhanced-performance superconducting nanowire avalanche photodetector

SO SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Emerging quantum technologies and weak-light applications demand photon detectors with a simultaneously high counting rate and near-unity efficiency. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors can achieve >90% system detection efficiency, but maintaining this efficiency at high counting rates remains challenging. Although parallel-configured superconducting nanowire avalanche photodetectors (SNAPs) reduce the recovery time, their designs intensify the current crowding effects at bends, leading to persistent challenges in achieving high system detection efficiency. We developed an optimized bend structure for meandered parallel nanowires called staggered bends, which increased the switching current by 11.3% in the 2-SNAPs. At 1064 nm, the optimized 2-SNAP and 3-SNAP with staggered bends achieved system detection efficiencies of 96.6% and 98.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, these devices maintain 90% system detection efficiency while achieving counting rates of 3.1 MHz and 10.3 MHz. This study establishes a practical framework for SNAPs with demonstrated performance metrics that could enable advancements in the frontiers of quantum information.

TI Squeezed light from a nanophotonic molecule
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Delicate engineering of integrated nonlinear structures is required for developing scalable sources of non-classical light to be deployed in quantum information processing systems. In this work, we demonstrate a photonic molecule composed of two coupled microring resonators on an integrated nanophotonic chip, designed to generate strongly squeezed light uncontaminated by noise from unwanted parasitic nonlinear processes. By tuning the photonic molecule to selectively couple and thus hybridize only the modes involved in the unwanted processes, suppression of parasitic parametric fluorescence is accomplished. This strategy enables the use of microring resonators for the efficient generation of degenerate squeezed light: without it, simple single-resonator structures cannot avoid contamination from nonlinear noise without significantly compromising pump power efficiency. We use this device to generate 8(1) dB of broadband degenerate squeezed light on-chip, with 1.65(1) dB directly measured. Integrated sources of nonclassical light are a key component for scalable quantum technologies. Here, the authors work with two coupled microring resonators and show how to detune the resonances involved in unwanted parametric fluorescence, without significantly affecting the pump power efficiency.

TI Bright single-photon skyrmion sources in bullseye cavities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Optical skyrmions, as structured light fields endowed with discrete topological numbers, open new opportunities for high-density encoding, robust information transport, and quantum light-matter interactions. However, most existing skyrmion generators rely on complex or bulky systems, hindering their application in scalable on-chip quantum technologies. Here, we propose a nanophotonic scheme based on semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics, whereby a circularly polarized quantum emitter is coupled to a concentric bullseye resonator. This configuration enables the efficient generation of single-photon Stokes vector skyrmions at subwavelength scales, as well as their high-order extensions. By exciting single-photon sources at different positions, the skyrmion number can be continuously switched between +2 and -2, while higher-order states are accessible by tuning the radius of cavity's center disc. This strategy couples the topological dimension of skyrmions with quantum states, laying the groundwork for quantum skyrmions in on-chip topological keying and quantum readout. Our work provides a practical device architecture for integrated nanophotonic quantum topological state platforms, offering a new paradigm for topologically protected quantum communications and on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Optimization by Neural Networks in the Coherent Ising Machine and its
   Application to Wireless Communication Systems
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, new optimization machines based on non-silicon physical systems, such as quantum annealing machines, have been developed, and their commercialization has been started. These machines solve the problems by searching the state of the Ising spins, which minimizes the Ising Hamiltonian. Such a property of minimization of the Ising Hamiltonian can be applied to various combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the coherent Ising machine (CIM), which can solve the problems in a milli-second order, and has higher performance than the quantum annealing machines especially on the problems with dense mutual connections in the corresponding Ising model. We explain how a target problem can be implemented on the CIM, based on the optimization scheme using the mutually connected neural networks. We apply the CIM to traveling salesman problems as an example benchmark, and show experimental results of the real machine of the CIM. We also apply the CIM to several combinatorial optimization problems in wireless communication systems, such as channel assignment problems. The CIM's ultra-fast optimization may enable a real-time optimization of various communication systems even in a dynamic communication environment.

TI Multiphoton interference in a single-spatial-mode quantum walk
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multiphoton interference is crucial to many photonic quantum technologies. In particular, interference forms the basis of optical quantum information processing platforms and can lead to significant computational advantages. It is therefore interesting to study the interference arising from various states of light in large interferometric networks. Here, we implement a quantum walk in a highly stable, low-loss, multiport interferometer with up to 12 ultrafast time bins. This time-bin interferometer comprises a sequence of birefringent crystals that produce pulses separated by 4.3 ps, all along a single optical axis. Ultrafast Kerr gating in an optical fiber is employed to time-demultiplex the output from the quantum walk. We measure one-, two-, and three-photon output states arising from various input state combinations, including a heralded single-photon state, a thermal state, and an attenuated coherent state at one or more input ports. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast time bins are a promising platform to observe large-scale multiphoton interference.

TI Optomechanical Schrodinger cat states in a cavity Bose-Einstein
   condensate
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Schrodinger cat states, consisting of superpositions of macroscopically distinct states, provide key resources for a large number of emerging quantum technologies in quantum information processing. Here we propose how to generate and manipulate mechanical and optical Schrodinger cat states with distinguishable superposition components by exploiting the unique properties of cavity optomechanical systems based on Bose-Einstein con-densate. Specifically, we show that in comparison with its solid-state counterparts, almost a 3 order of magnitude enhancement in the size of the mechanical Schrodinger cat state could be achieved, characterizing a much smaller overlap between its two superposed coherent-state components. By exploiting this generated cat state, we further show how to engineer the quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode. Besides, we also provide an efficient method to create multicomponent optical Schrodinger cat states in our proposed scheme. Our work opens up a new way to achieve nonclassical states of massive objects, facilitating the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors and sensors.

TI Efficient and continuous microwave photoconversion in hybrid
   cavity-semiconductor nanowire double quantum dot diodes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Efficient conversion of microwave photons into electrical current would enable several applications in quantum technologies, especially if one could step outside of the gated-time regime. Here, the authors demonstrate continuous-time microwave photoconversion in double quantum dots with 6% efficiency.
   Converting incoming photons to electrical current is the key operation principle of optical photodetectors and it enables a host of emerging quantum information technologies. The leading approach for continuous and efficient detection in the optical domain builds on semiconductor photodiodes. However, there is a paucity of efficient and continuous photon detectors in the microwave regime, because photon energies are four to five orders of magnitude lower therein and conventional photodiodes do not have that sensitivity. Here we tackle this gap and demonstrate how microwave photons can be efficiently and continuously converted to electrical current in a high-quality, semiconducting nanowire double quantum dot resonantly coupled to a cavity. In particular, in our photodiode device, an absorbed photon gives rise to a single electron tunneling through the double dot, with a conversion efficiency reaching 6%.

TI Energy-efficient quantum non-demolition measurement with a spin-photon
   interface
SO QUANTUM
AB Spin-photon interfaces (SPIs) are key devices of quantum technologies, aimed at coherently transferring quantum information between spin qubits and propagating pulses of polarized light. We study the potential of a SPI for quantum non demolition (QND) measurements of a spin state. After being initialized and scattered by the SPI, the state of a light pulse depends on the spin state. It thus plays the role of a pointer state, in-formation being encoded in the light's temporal and polarization degrees of freedom. Building on the fully Hamiltonian resolution of the spin-light dynamics, we show that quantum superpositions of zero and single photon states outperform co-herent pulses of light, producing pointer states which are more distinguishable with the same photon budget. The energetic advantage pro-vided by quantum pulses over coherent ones is maintained when information on the spin state is extracted at the classical level by perform-ing projective measurements on the light pulses. The proposed schemes are robust against imper-fections in state of the art semi-conducting de-vices.

TI Enhanced quantum sensitivity and coherence of symmetric magnetic
   clusters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Searching for highly coherent degrees of freedom in noisy solid-state environments is a major challenge in condensed matter. In disordered dipolar systems, such as magnetically doped insulators, compact clusters of two-level systems (TLS) have recently been shown to have significantly longer coherence times than typical single TLS. Coupling weakly to their environment, they sense and probe its many-body dynamics through the induced dephasing. However, it has remained an open question whether further mechanisms exist that protect the coherence of such solid-state qubits. Here, we show that symmetric clusters of a few TLS couple even more weakly to their surroundings, making them highly sensitive quantum sensors of slow many-body dynamics. Furthermore, we explore their use as qubits for quantum information storage, detailing the techniques required for their preparation and manipulation. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry in enhancing quantum coherence in disordered and noisy systems, opening a route toward a sensitive experimental probe of many-body quasilocalization dynamics as well as the development of quantum technologies in solid-state systems.

TI Nonclassical correlation dynamics of Heisenberg XYZ states with (x,
   y)-spin--orbit interaction, x-magnetic field, and intrinsic
   decoherence effects
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB In quantum information, it is important to recognize the effects of additional interactions, such as spin-orbit interactions, on the quantum information resources of two-qubit Heisenberg states. Therefore, we study the nonlocal correlation dynamics affected by the intrinsic decoherence of the spin-spin-Heisenberg-XYZ interaction, which is supported by spin-orbit interactions (Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya) of the x x and y y directions together. The two spins are coupled to an external inhomogeneous magnetic field (EIMF) in the x x -direction. We investigate and compare the nonclassical correlation dynamics of local quantum Fisher information, local quantum uncertainty, and log-negativity. The results show that spin-spin and spin-orbit interactions have a high capability to enhance non-local correlations in the presence of an external magnetic field. The enhanced non-local correlation can be further improved by strengthening the spin-spin and spin-orbit interactions, as well as by increasing the EIMF's inhomogeneity and uniformity, which increases the amplitudes and fluctuations of the generated non-local correlation oscillations. The degradation of non-local correlations due to intrinsic decoherence can be controlled by spin-spin interactions. These degradation correlations can be enhanced by increasing the intensities of spin-orbit interactions, as well as by increasing the EIMF's inhomogeneity and uniformity.

TI Nonadiabatic braiding of Majorana modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes have drawn significant attention for their crucial role in enabling topological quantum computation. Conventional approaches to the braiding of Majorana zero modes rely on adiabatic processes. In this work, using a composite 2-Kitaev-chain system accommodating Majorana zero modes as a working example, we propose a nonadiabatic and non-Abelian geometry phase-based protocol to execute operations on these Majorana zero modes. This is possible by locally coupling the edge sites of both quantum chains with an embedded lattice defect, successfully simulating the braiding operation of two Majorana modes in a highly nonadiabatic fashion. To further enhance the robustness against control imperfections, we apply a multiple-pulse composite strategy to our quantum chain setting for second-order protection of the braiding operations. Our proposal can also support the fast and robust realization of the pi /8 gate, an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. This work hence offers a potential pathway toward the nonadiabatic and fault-tolerant control of Majorana zero modes.

TI Quantum-Resilient Cloud Data Protection: A Novel Framework for Secure
   Encryption and Key Exchange
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Nowadays, securing data in the cloud is a challenging task; hence, many studies are being conducted on the use of cryptographic techniques for authentication-based cloud data security. Apart from traditional cryptographic techniques, data encryption can also utilize certain physical principles of quantum models, known as cryptography. In the existing method, the secure quantum key distribution for cloud data security (SQKD-CDS) model has high computational complexity and low storage efficiency. However, the quantum cryptography-based cloud security (QC-CSM) model uses an optical fiber connection to prevent attackers from altering the secret key shared with the network. This paper presents a novel model called enhanced non-Abelian NTRU (N-th degree truncated polynomial ring encryption) (En-naNTRU) with supersingular isogeny key exchange (SIKE). SIKE's function is to generate a secure key exchange mechanism; thus, it communicates with two parties using a shared session key. This session key acts as a symmetric key for encrypting messages. However, the En-naNTRU uses this session key to encrypt and decrypt the message securely. The En-naNTRU handles both encryption and decryption mechanisms. Thus, the integrated method combines and ensures robust security against both quantum and classical threats. The proposed model evaluates computation time, integrity score, encryption and decryption time, processing time, and memory utilization and compares the performance of integrity-based encryption to attribute-based encryption. Therefore, the proposed model reduces time complexity and effectively outperforms both classical and quantum security.

SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric phenomenon, has attracted significant attention for its potential in energy conversion, thermoelectrics and spintronics. However, achieving high performance and versatility at low temperatures remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a large and electrically tunable Nernst effect by combining the electrical properties of graphene with the semiconducting characteristics of indium selenide in a field-effect geometry. Our results establish a new platform for exploring and manipulating this thermoelectric effect, showcasing the first electrical tunability with an on/off ratio of 103. Moreover, photovoltage measurements reveal a stronger photo-Nernst signal in the graphene/indium selenide heterostructure compared with individual components. Remarkably, we observe a record-high Nernst coefficient of 66.4 mu V K-1 T-1 at ultralow temperatures and low magnetic fields, an important step towards applications in quantum information and low-temperature emergent phenomena.

TI Observation of metastability in open quantum dynamics of a solid-state
   system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Metastability is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nonequilibrium physics and classical stochastic dynamics. It arises when the system dynamics settles in long-lived states before eventually decaying to true equilibria. Remarkably, it has been predicted that quantum metastability can also occur in continuous- and discrete-time open quantum dynamics. However, the direct experimental observation of metastability in open quantum systems has remained elusive. Here, we experimentally observe metastability in the discrete-time evolution of a single nuclear spin in diamond, realized by sequential Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) of a nearby nitrogen-vacancy electron spin. We demonstrate that the metastable polarization of the nuclear spin emerges at a metastable region of measurement times determined by the spectral structure of the quantum channel induced by the RIM. Such metastable polarization enables high-fidelity single-shot readout of the nuclear spin and the observation of an ultralong spin relaxation time of more than 10 s at room temperature. Our results represent a concrete step towards uncovering nonequilibrium physics in open quantum dynamics, which is practically relevant for the utilization of metastable information for various quantum information processing tasks.

TI Group-covariant extreme and quasiextreme channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Constructing all extreme instances of the set of completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, i.e., quantum channels, is a challenging and valuable open problem in quantum information theory. Here we introduce a systematic approach that, despite the lack of knowledge about the full parametrization of the set of CPTP maps on arbitrary Hilbert-spaced dimension, enables us to construct exactly those extreme channels that are covariant with respect to a finite discrete group or a compact connected Lie group. Innovative labeling of quantum channels by group representations enables us to identify the subset of group-covariant channels whose elements are group-covariant generalized-extreme channels. Furthermore, we exploit essentials of group representation theory to introduce equivalence classes for the labels and also partition the set of group-covariant channels. As a result, we show that it is enough to construct one representative of each partition. We construct Kraus operators for group-covariant generalized-extreme channels by solving systems of linear and quadratic equations for all candidates satisfying the necessary condition for being group-covariant generalized-extreme channels. Deciding whether these constructed instances are extreme or quasiextreme is accomplished by solving a system of linear equations. Proper labeling and partitioning the set of group-covariant channels leads to a novel systematic, algorithmic approach for constructing the entire subset of group-covariant extreme channels. We formalize the problem of constructing and classifying group-covariant generalized extreme channels, thereby yielding an algorithmic approach to solving, which we express as pseudocode. To illustrate the application and value of our method, we solve for explicit examples of group-covariant extreme channels. With unbounded computational resources to execute our algorithm, our method always delivers a description of an extreme channel for any finite-dimensional Hilbert space and furthermore guarantees a description of a group-covariant extreme channel for any dimension and for any finite-discrete or compact connected Lie group if such an extreme channel exists.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Chemistry Computations with Variational, Imaginary
   Time Evolution, and Krylov Space Solver Algorithms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum chemistry is a key application area for noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices, and therefore serves as an important benchmark for current and future quantum computer performance. Previous benchmarks in this field have focused on variational methods for computing ground and excited states of various molecules, including a benchmarking suite focused on the performance of computing ground states for alkali-hydrides under an array of error mitigation methods. State-of-the-art methods to reach chemical accuracy in hybrid quantum-classical electronic structure calculations of alkali hydride molecules on NISQ devices from IBM are outlined here. It is demonstrated how to extend the reach of variational eigensolvers with symmetry preserving Ansatze. Next, it is outlined how to use quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos as a complementary method to variational techniques, highlighting the advantages of each approach. Finally, a new error mitigation method is demonstrated which uses systematic error cancellation via hidden inverse gate constructions, improving the performance of typical variational algorithms. These results show that electronic structure calculations have advanced rapidly, to routine chemical accuracy for simple molecules, from their inception on quantum computers a few short years ago, and they point to further rapid progress to larger molecules as the power of NISQ devices grows.

Furthermore, patterns are initially stored in the memory as a quantum superposition in order to take advantage of its properties. Experiments testing the memory's viability and performance were implemented using IBM's Qiskit library.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A kernel-based quantum classifier is the most practical and influential quantum machine learning technique for the hyper-linear classification of complex data. We propose a Variational Quantum Approximate Support Vector Machine (VQASVM) algorithm that demonstrates empirical sub-quadratic run-time complexity with quantum operations feasible even in NISQ computers. We experimented our algorithm with toy example dataset on cloud-based NISQ machines as a proof of concept. We also numerically investigated its performance on the standard Iris flower and MNIST datasets to confirm the practicality and scalability.

TI Robustness of nonlocality in many-body open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocality consists in the existence of nonclassical correlations between local measurements. So far, it has been investigated mostly in isolated quantum systems. Here we show that nonlocal correlations are present, can be detected, and might be robust against noise also in many-body open quantum systems, both in the steady-state and in the transient regime. We further discuss the robustness of nonlocal correlations when the open quantum system undergoes repeated measurements, a relevant scenario for quantum cryptography.

TI Fixing detailed balance in ancilla-based dissipative state engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Dissipative state engineering is a general term for a protocol which prepares the ground state of a complex many-body Hamiltonian using engineered dissipation or engineered environments. Recently, it was shown that a version of this protocol, where the engineered environment consists of one or more dissipative qubit ancillas tuned to be resonant with the low-energy transitions of a many-body system, resulted in the combined system evolving to reasonable approximation to the ground state. This potentially broadens the applicability of the method beyond nonfrustrated systems, to which it was previously restricted. Here we argue that this approach has an intrinsic limitation because the ancillas, seen as an effective bath by the system in the weak-coupling limit, do not give the detailed balance expected for a true zero-temperature environment. Our argument is based on the study of a similar approach employing linear coupling to bosonic ancillas. We explore overcoming this limitation using a recently developed open quantum systems technique called pseudomodes. With a simple example model of a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, we show that detailed balance can be fixed, and a more accurate estimation of the ground state obtained, at the cost of two additional unphysical dissipative modes and the extrapolation error of implementing those modes in physical systems.

TI Asymmetric transport in long-range interacting chiral spin chains
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Harnessing power-law interactions (1/r(alpha)) in a large variety of physical systems are increasing. We study the dynamics of chiral spin chains as a possible multi-directional quantum channel. This arises from the nonlinear character of the dispersion with complex quantum interference effects. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we propose a model to guide quantum states to a desired direction. We illustrate our approach using the long-range XXZ model modulated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. By exploring non-equilibrium dynamics after a local quantum quench, we identify the interplay of interaction range ff and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling giving rise to an appreciable asymmetric spin excitations transport. This could be interesting for quantum information protocols to transfer quantum states, and it may be testable with current trapped-ion experiments. We further explore the growth of block entanglement entropy in these systems, and an order of magnitude reduction is distinguished. (C) Copyright J. Vahedi.

TI Effect of phase-sensitive manipulations on generation of low-frequency
   two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum states are an important quantum resource for quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum precision measurement and sensing. It is essential to obtain stable two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum states in a low frequency range and compact configurations for practical applications, especially in quantum precision measurement and sensing. Two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum states are commonly produced via a subthreshold nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) in a continuous variable system. However, it is a difficult problem that the subthreshold NOPA cavity is phase sensitive manipulated to obtain stable squeezed vacuum states. Previous signal light injecting scheme relies on an injection of a weak light field into the subthreshold NOPA for phase sensitive manipulation. The injected signal light has the same frequency as the generated squeezed vacuum state. Thereby even the weakest injected signal light can introduce large amounts of excessive noise at low frequencies and the squeezing degree of two-mode squeezed vacuum states will be reduced or squeezing cannot be achieved.
   In this paper, a single sideband frequency shifted light injecting scheme is proposed for phase sensitive manipulation of NOPA. The comparison between the single sideband frequency shifted light injecting scheme and the signal light injecting scheme for realization of phase sensitive manipulation of NOPA is conducted. The effects of the two schemes on the generation of the low-frequency two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum state light field are investigated experimentally. The experimental results show that in the signal light injecting scheme for phase sensitive manipulation, the squeezing degree of the two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum state continuously decreases until it disappears as the power of injected signal light increases. In the process of phase sensitive manipulation of NOPA by using the single sideband frequency shifted light injecting scheme, the squeezing degree of the two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum state does not change with the power of the injected frequency shifted light increasing. Stable phase sensitive manipulation is realized by injecting single sideband frequency shifted light into NOPA. The NOPA is operated in a phase sensitive amplification state for 30 min. Stable low-frequency two-mode orthogonal squeezed vacuum states are obtained. The (4.1 +/- 0.1) dB amplitude orthogonal squeezed vacuum states and (4.0 +/- 0.2) dB phase orthogonal squeezed vacuum states at a frequency of 200 kHz are generated stably, in a compact NOPA configuration.

TI Collapse and Revival of an Artificial Atom Coupled to a Structured
   Photonic Reservoir
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum emitters in the presence of an electromagnetic reservoir with varying density of states, or structure, can undergo a rich set of dynamical behavior. In particular, the reservoir can be tailored to have a memory of past interactions with emitters, in contrast to memoryless Markovian dynamics of typical open systems. In this article, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a superconducting waveguide engineered to have both a sharp spectral variation in its transmission properties and a slowing of light by a factor of 650. Tuning the qubit into the spectral vicinity of the passband of this slow-light waveguide reservoir, we observe a 400-fold change in the emission rate of the qubit, along with oscillatory energy relaxation of the qubit resulting from the beating of bound and radiative dressed qubit-photon states. Furthermore, upon addition of a reflective boundary to one end of the waveguide, we observe revivals in the qubit population on a timescale 30 times longer than the inverse of the qubit's emission rate, corresponding to the round-trip travel time of an emitted photon. By in situ tuning of the qubit-waveguide interaction strength, we also probe a crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian qubit emission dynamics in the presence of feedback from waveguide reflections. With this superconducting circuit platform, future studies of multiqubit interactions via highly structured reservoirs and the generation of multiphoton highly entangled states are possible.

TI Searching for Dark Particles with Quantum Optics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a way to use optical tools from quantum imaging and quantum communication to search for physics beyond the standard model. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a commonly used source of entangled photons in which pump photons convert to a signal-idler pair. We propose to search for "dark-SPDC" (dSPDC) events in which a new dark-sector particle replaces the idler. Though it does not interact, the presence of a dark particle can be inferred by the properties of the signal photon. Examples of dark states include axionlike particles and dark photons. We show that the presence of an optical medium opens the phase space of the down-conversion process, or decay, which would be forbidden in a vacuum. Search schemes are proposed that employ optical imaging and/or spectroscopy of the signal photons. The signal rates in our proposal scales with the second power of the small coupling to new physics, as opposed to light-shining-through-wall experiments, the signal of which scales with coupling to the fourth power. We analyze the characteristics of the optical media needed to enhance dSPDC and estimate the rate.

TI Ultrafast opto-magnetic effects induced by nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond crystals
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The current generation of quantum sensing technologies using color centers in diamond crystals is primarily based on the principle that the resonant microwave frequency of the luminescence between quantum levels of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center varies with temperature and electric and magnetic fields. This principle enables us to measure, for instance, magnetic and electric fields, as well as local temperature with nanometer resolution in conjunction with a scanning probe microscope (SPM). However, the time resolution of conventional quantum sensing technologies has been limited to microseconds due to the limited luminescence lifetime. Here, we investigate ultrafast opto-magnetic effects in diamond crystals containing NV centers to improve the time resolution of quantum sensing to sub-picosecond time scales. The spin ensemble from diamond NV centers induces an inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME) in the form of a sub-picosecond optical response in a femtosecond pump-probe measurement. The helicity and quadratic power dependence of the ICME can be interpreted as a second-order opto-magnetic effect in which ensembles of NV electron spins act as a source for the ICME. The results provide fundamental guidelines for enabling high-resolution spatial-time quantum sensing technologies when combined with SPM techniques. (C) 2022 Author(s)

AB The Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) is a complex transportation optimisation problem typically solved using meta-heuristics on classical computers. Quantum computers, despite being a nascent technology, have the potential to significantly speed up computation by exploiting quantum parallelism. A quantum annealer (QA) is a quantum computer tailored to solve combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO). Formulating complex optimisation problems as QUBO is an open challenge. This paper derives a new QUBO formulation for TAP by employing a streamlined methodology of general applicability. It also attempts a direct comparison at solving TAP encompassing a QA (D-WAVE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, and classical methods including Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. This comparison is difficult and seldom done due to the inherent differences between quantum and classic hardware. As expected from the current quantum technology, our results show that a pure QA suffers from significant noise in qubits and requires significant additional computational time, although we show that the time required solely by the QPU does not increase with problem size. We also show that the hybrid QA mitigates these noise issues and is on a par with traditional methods.

TI Strain Effects in a Directly Bonded Diamond-on-Insulator Substrate
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. This study investigates strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of approximate to 0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of approximate to 0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.

TI Coherent manipulation of nuclear spins in the strong driving regime
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spin-based quantum information processing makes extensive use of spin-state manipulation. This ranges from dynamical decoupling of nuclear spins in quantum sensing experiments to applying logical gates on qubits in a quantum processor. Fast manipulation of spin states is highly desirable for accelerating experiments, enhancing sensitivity, and applying elaborate pulse sequences. Strong driving using intense radio-frequency (RF) fields can, therefore, facilitate fast manipulation and enable broadband excitation of spin species. In this work, we present an antenna for strong driving in quantum sensing experiments and theoretically address challenges of the strong driving regime. First, we designed and implemented a micron-scale planar spiral RF antenna capable of delivering intense fields to a sample. The planar antenna is tailored for quantum sensing experiments using the diamond's nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and should be applicable to other solid-state defects. The antenna has a broad bandwidth of 22 MHz, is compatible with scanning probes, and is suitable for cryogenic and ultrahigh vacuum conditions. We measure the magnetic field induced by the antenna and estimate a field-to-current ratio of 113 +/- 16 G/A, representing a six-fold increase in efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, crucial for cryogenic experiments. We demonstrate the antenna by driving Rabi oscillations in 1H spins of an organic sample on the diamond surface and measure 1H Rabi frequencies of over 500 kHz, i.e. pi -pulses shorter than 1 mu s -an order of magnitude faster than previously reported in NV-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Finally, we discuss the implications of driving spins with a field tilted from the transverse plane in a regime where the driving amplitude is comparable to the spin-state splitting, such that the rotating wave approximation does not describe the dynamics well. We present a simple recipe to optimize pulse fidelity in this regime based on a phase and offset-shifted sine drive, which may be optimized in situ without numerical optimization procedures or precise modeling of the experiment. We consider this approach in a range of driving amplitudes and show that it is particularly efficient in the case of a tilted driving field. The results presented here constitute a foundation for implementing fast nuclear spin control in various systems.

TI Monolithic Terahertz Topological Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The pursuit of on-chip electromagnetic wave control for high throughput communication, spectroscopy, and quantum computing underlies the motivation for terahertz photonic integrated circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in topological photonics have enabled the development of chips that harness topologically resilient interface modes to achieve area and performance efficiency. However, the demonstration of a compact, monolithic topological Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), remains a critical gap. In this work, a terahertz topological MZI is presented, exhibiting six interferometric fringes across a 17 GHz bandwidth, with splitter, combiner, and arms integrated on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on-off contrast with extinction ratios over 20 dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface-dependent out-of-plane radiation losses. Active tuning of the MZI response is also demonstrated through photoexcitation of the MZI arms. The presented approach is the first step toward realizing topological photonic modulators that leverage the phase degree of freedom for photonic integrated communication and quantum information processing.

TI Feedback-based quantum strategies for constrained combinatorial
   optimization problems
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Feedback-based quantum algorithms have recently emerged as potential methods for approximating the ground states of Hamiltonians. One such algorithm, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (FALQON), is specifically designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Its extension, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization with constraints (FALQON-C), was introduced to handle constrained optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. In this work, we extend the feedback-based quantum algorithms framework to address a broader class of constraints known as invalid configuration (IC) constraints, which explicitly prohibit specific configurations of decision variables. We first present a transformation technique that converts the constrained optimization problem with invalid configuration constraints into an equivalent unconstrained problem by incorporating a penalizing term into the cost function. Then, leaning upon control theory, we propose an alternative method tailored for feedback-based quantum algorithms that directly tackles IC constraints without requiring slack variables. Our approach introduces a new operator that encodes the optimal feasible solution of the constrained optimization problem as its ground state. Then, a controlled quantum system based on the Lyapunov control technique is designed to ensure convergence to the ground state of this operator. Two approaches are introduced in the design of this operator to address IC constraints: the folded spectrum approach and the deflation approach. These methods eliminate the need for slack variables, significantly reducing the quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits required. We show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.

TI A highly accurate quantum optimization algorithm for CT image
   reconstruction based on sinogram patterns
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Computed tomography (CT) has been developed as a nondestructive technique for observing minute internal images in samples. It has been difficult to obtain photorealistic (clean or clear) CT images due to various unwanted artifacts generated during the CT scanning process, along with the limitations of back-projection algorithms. Recently, an iterative optimization algorithm has been developed that uses an entire sinogram to reduce errors caused by artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm for reconstructing CT images. This algorithm can be used with any type of light source as long as the projection is defined. Assuming an experimental sinogram produced by a Radon transform, to find the CT image of this sinogram, we express the CT image as a combination of qubits. After acquiring the Radon transform of the undetermined CT image, we combine the actual sinogram and the optimized qubits. The global energy optimization value used here can determine the value of qubits through a gate model quantum computer or quantum annealer. In particular, the new algorithm can also be used for cone-beam CT image reconstruction and for medical imaging.

TI Finding the optimal probe state for multiparameter quantum metrology
   using conic programming
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The ultimate precision in quantum sensing could be achieved using optimal quantum probe states. However, current quantum sensing protocols do not use probe states optimally. Indeed, the calculation of optimal probe states remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we present an algorithm that efficiently calculates a probe state for correlated and uncorrelated measurement strategies. The algorithm involves a conic program, which minimizes a linear objective function subject to conic constraints on a operator-valued variable. Our algorithm outputs a probe state that is a simple function of the optimal variable. We prove that our algorithm finds the optimal probe state for channel estimation problems, even in the multiparameter setting. For many noiseless quantum sensing problems, we prove the optimality of maximally entangled probe states. We also analyze the performance of 3D-field sensing using various probe states. Our work opens the door for a plethora of applications in quantum metrology.

TI Authenticable quantum secret sharing based on special entangled state
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, a pair of quantum states are constructed based on an orthogonal array and further generalized to multi-body quantum systems. Subsequently, a novel physical process is designed, which is aimed at effectively masking quantum states within multipartite quantum systems. According to this masker, a new authenticable quantum secret sharing scheme is proposed, which can realize a class of special access structures. In the distribution phase, an unknown quantum state is shared safely among multiple participants, and this secret quantum state is embedded into a multi-particle entangled state using the masking approach. In the reconstruction phase, a series of precisely designed measurements and corresponding unitary operations are performed by the participants in the authorized set to restore the original information quantum state. To ensure the security of the scheme, the security analysis of five major types of quantum attacks is conducted. Finally, when compared with other quantum secret sharing schemes based on entangled states, the proposed scheme is found to be not only more flexible but also easier to implement based on existing quantum computing cloud platforms.

TI Laser writing of preferentially orientated nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond
SO CARBON TRENDS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond have gained widespread attention as quantum systems that can be applied in quantum information devices. The excellent properties of quantum devices can be enhanced using prefer-entially oriented nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However, thus far, orientation control has been achieved only via chemical vapor deposition. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of preferentially oriented NV centers via laser writing. The alignment ratio of ensemble NV centers is biased along the direction parallel to [111], depending on the femtosecond laser polarization, causing an increase of 55 % in contrast to the optically magnetic resonance signal at maximum compared with 25 % in random orientation. Based on time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations and experimental observations, such complex polarization dependence can be attributed to the anisotropy of electron excitation. This technique provides a new optical fabrication method for engineered materials and devices used in quantum technology.

TI Realization of fractional quantum Hall state with interacting photons
SO SCIENCE
AB Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are known for their robust topological order and possess properties that are appealing for applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. An engineered quantum platform would provide opportunities to operate FQH states without an external magnetic field and enhance local and coherent manipulation of these exotic states. We demonstrate a lattice version of photon FQH states using a programmable on-chip platform based on photon blockade and engineering gauge fields on a two-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We observe the effective photon Lorentz force and butterfly spectrum in the artificial gauge field, a prerequisite for FQH states. After adiabatic assembly of Laughlin FQH wave function of 1/2 filling factor from localized photons, we observe strong density correlation and chiral topological flow among the FQH photons. We then verify the unique features of FQH states in response to external fields, including the incompressibility of generating quasiparticles and the smoking-gun signature of fractional quantum Hall conductivity. Our work illustrates a route to the creation and manipulation of novel strongly correlated topological quantum matter composed of photons and opens up possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum information devices.

TI Optimal photon-magnon mode matching in whispering-gallery mode cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optomagnonic structures are widely studied in the field of nanophotonics and quantum information science. They are the key platforms for the realization of magnon-mediated microwave to optical transducers in various applications of quantum computing. In order to enhance the coupling between light (photons) and spin waves (magnons), here in this work, we use the Lagrange multiplication method to find the optimum matching condition between the optical whispering-gallery mode and the magnon with Kittle and higher-order modes in microresonators. It is found that the magnon modes located near the edge of the resonator exhibits stronger coupling strength with the optical modes. Numerically, we find the coupling constant can approach 87.6 x 2 pi Hz in Kittle mode, and 459 x 2 pi Hz in high-order magnon mode for a yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Y3Fe5O12) microdisk cavity with a radius of 300 microns and a thickness of 10 microns. We believe these results may provide an efficient way for enhancing the magneto-optical interaction in the optical devices, which will facilitate the development of magneto-optical control, optical-microwave interaction, and optical nonlinearity.

TI Enabling Power Systems With SQKD in Presence of Remote Nodes
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) can be applied in power systems to share unconditionally secure keys between the power substations and the local controllers. Secret keys can be used for the encryption and decryption of control commands and measurements of power substations. This paper studies the allocation problem of a minimal number of trusted nodes, quantum servers with optimal source rates and fiber links on a pre-existing classical cyber layer of power system under the constraint of a minimal target key generation rate in the presence of an attacker for power systems with remote nodes. The optimization problem is formulated as a binary program that upgrades a pre-existing classical cyber layer of power system to support SQKD. Due to the complexity of the allocation problem, this paper develops algorithms based on Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN), Dijksra's algorithm and genetic algorithms. This research examined the proposed allocation strategy on the cyber layer of the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test systems, since these systems have remote nodes. The work in the literature did not solve the systems with remote nodes, so this study modified two benchmarks to handle the remote nodes in order to compare with them. The results demonstrate that the target key generation rate can be achieved at different attack levels with a number of trusted nodes, quantum servers, source rates and a number of fiber links, that is 62.5% and 50%, respectively, less than a benchmark for the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test systems. The results also demonstrate that the proposed solution requires 62.23% and 54.99% less number of quantum server, source rates and a number of fiber links compared to QKD solutions for the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test systems, respectively.

TI Photon-pair production and frequency translation using backward-wave
   spontaneous parametric downconversion
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Backward-wave three-wave mixing is a difficult chi(2) interaction to observe, because it requires ultrashort poling periods to achieve phasematching. Having realized sub-micrometer periods in periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP), we demonstrate for the first time first-order quasi-phasematched, backward-wave spontaneous parametric downconversion (BW SPDC). We pumped the PPKTP crystal at 800 nm and obtained a forward-wave signal at 1400 nm and a backward-wave idler at 1868 nm. We estimated an internal pair production rate of 4.0 x 104 pairs/s/mW. The backward-wave phasematching constraints lead to the unique tuning property that spectral features of the pump are transferred to the forward-wave signal photons, which makes BW SPDC an attractive source of spectrally shaped, heralded single photons. These spectrally shaped photons are useful for quantum computing and quantum interconnects. For the first time, we experimentally show this effect by observing frequency translation between a spectrally shaped pump beam and the BW SPDC signal photons. Due to their unique properties, BW-SPDC-based devices will be important building blocks for quantum information processing.

TI Analysis of optical quantum state preparation using photon detectors in
   the finite-temporal-resolution regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state preparation is important for quantum information processing. In particular, in optical quantum computing with continuous variables, non-Gaussian states are needed for universal operation and error correction. Optical non-Gaussian states are usually generated by heralding schemes using photon detectors. In previous experiments, the temporal resolution of the photon detectors was sufficiently high relative to the time width of the quantum state, so that the conventional theory of non-Gaussian state preparation treated the detector's temporal resolution as negligible. However, when using various photon detectors, including photon-number-resolving detectors, the temporal resolution is non-negligible. In this paper, we extend the conventional theory of quantum state preparation using photon detectors to the finite-temporal-resolution regime, analyze the cases of single-photon and two-photon preparation as examples, and find that the generated states are characterized by the dimensionless parameter B, defined as the product of the temporal resolution of the detectors Delta t and the bandwidth of the light source Delta f. Based on the results, B similar to 0.1 is required to keep the purity and fidelity of the generated quantum states high.

TI Calculating the hyperfine tensors for group-IV impurity-vacancy centers
   in diamond using hybrid density functional theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The hyperfine interaction is an important probe for understanding the structure and symmetry of defects in a semiconductor. Density functional theory has shown that it can provide useful first-principles predictions for both the hyperfine tensor and the hyperfine constants that arise from it. Recently there has been great interest in using group-IV impurity-vacancy color centers XV- (where X = Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb and V is a carbon vacancy) for important applications in quantum computing and quantum information science. In this paper we have calculated the hyperfine tensors for these XV- color centers using the HSE06 screened Hartree-Fock hybrid exchangecorrelation functional with the inclusion of core electron spin polarization. We have compared our results to calculations which only use the PBE exchange-correlation functional without the inclusion of core electron spin polarization and we have found that our results are in very good agreement with available experimental results. Finally, we have theoretically shown that these XV- color centers exhibit a Jahn-Teller distortion which explains the observed anisotropic distribution of the hyperfine constants among the neighboring C-13 nuclear spins.

TI A squeezed quantum microcomb on a chip
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The optical microresonator-based frequency comb (microcomb) provides a versatile platform for nonlinear physics studies and has wide applications ranging from metrology to spectroscopy. The deterministic quantum regime is an unexplored aspect of microcombs, in which unconditional entanglements among hundreds of equidistant frequency modes can serve as critical ingredients to scalable universal quantum computing and quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a deterministic quantum microcomb in a silica microresonator on a silicon chip. 40 continuous-variable quantum modes, in the form of 20 simultaneously two-mode squeezed comb pairs, are observed within 1 THz optical span at telecommunication wavelengths. A maximum raw squeezing of 1.6 dB is attained. A high-resolution spectroscopy measurement is developed to characterize the frequency equidistance of quantum microcombs. Our demonstration offers the possibility to leverage deterministically generated, frequency multiplexed quantum states and integrated photonics to open up new avenues in fields of spectroscopy, quantum metrology, and scalable, continuous-variable-based quantum information processing. Microcombs operating in the deterministic quantum regime could lead to new applications. Here, the authors demonstrate a quantum microcomb consisting of 20 two-mode squeezed comb pairs, in an optical microresonator on a silicon chip.

TI Enhanced Quantum Emission from a Topological Floquet Resonance
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement is a valuable resource in quantum information technologies. The practical implementation of entangled photon sources faces obstacles from imperfections and defects inherent in physical systems, resulting in a loss or degradation of entanglement. The topological photonic insulators, however, have emerged as promising candidates, demonstrating an exceptional capability to resist defect-induced scattering, thus enabling the development of robust entangled sources. Despite their inherent advantages, building programmable topologically protected entangled sources remains challenging due to complex device designs and weak material nonlinearity. Here, we present a development in entangled photon-pair generation achieved through a nonmagnetic and tunable anomalous Floquet insulator, utilizing an optical spontaneous four-wave-mixing process. We verify the nonclassicality and time-energy entanglement of the photons generated by our topological system. Our experiment demonstrates a substantial enhancement in nonclassical photon-pair generation compared to devices reliant only on topological edge states. Our results could lead to the development of resilient quantum sources with potential applications in quantum technology.

TI Nebula: Network Enhanced Boltzmann Machine With Universal Local Search
   Architecture
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose Nebula, a computational method for combinatorial optimization and stochastic sampling. The proposed method is designed for a generic local search engine utilized for digital annealing in an optimization system for multidimensional binary variables, and it can handle a variety of cost functions of multidimensional binary variables with multi-body interactions in a unified manner. In addition to optimization, the method can be used to perform sampling to reproduce the Boltzmann distribution. To achieve this, we extend the network of conventional Boltzmann machines or Ising machines to include dependent variables mediating various interactions. The extended network enables fast operation by predicting the total energy change due to state transitions in all one-flip neighborhoods. The energy function, which is limited to the quadratic form in conventional Ising machines, is extended here to represent inequality constraints and higher-order products. The ability to handle higher-order spin products enables the implementation of arbitrary energy functions with k -body interactions based on the Walsh transform. We conducted numerical experiments to demonstrate the concept of our proposed method and show that it can solve problems with inequality constraints and higher order terms, which are difficult to solve with conventional Ising machines. The numerical experiments also show that our method can exploit the expansion of the energy landscape by the Walsh function and reproduce the Boltzmann distribution by sampling.

TI Benchmarking quantum versions of the kNN algorithm with a metric based
   on amplitude-encoded features
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This work introduces a quantum subroutine for computing the distance between two patterns and integrates it into two quantum versions of the kNN classifier algorithm: one proposed by Schuld et al. and the other proposed by Quezada et al. Notably, our proposed subroutine is tailored to be memory-efficient, requiring fewer qubits for data encoding, while maintaining the overall complexity for both QkNN versions. This research focuses on comparing the performance of the two quantum kNN algorithms using the original Hamming distance with qubit-encoded features and our proposed subroutine, which computes the distance using amplitude-encoded features. Results obtained from analyzing thirteen different datasets (Iris, Seeds, Raisin, Mine, Cryotherapy, Data Bank Authentication, Caesarian, Wine, Haberman, Transfusion, Immunotherapy, Balance Scale, and Glass) show that both algorithms benefit from the proposed subroutine, achieving at least a 50% reduction in the number of required qubits, while maintaining a similar overall performance. For Shuld's algorithm, the performance improved in Cryotherapy (68.89% accuracy compared to 64.44%) and Balance Scale (85.33% F1 score compared to 78.89%), was worse in Iris (86.0% accuracy compared to 95.33%) and Raisin (77.67% accuracy compared to 81.56%), and remained similar in the remaining nine datasets. While for Quezada's algorithm, the performance improved in Caesarian (68.89% F1 score compared to 58.22%), Haberman (69.94% F1 score compared to 62.31%) and Immunotherapy (76.88% F1 score compared to 69.67%), was worse in Iris (82.67% accuracy compared to 95.33%), Balance Scale (77.97% F1 score compared to 69.21%) and Glass (40.04% F1 score compared to 28.79%), and remained similar in the remaining seven datasets.

TI Do quantum circuit Born machines generalize?
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent proposals of quantum circuit models for generative tasks, the discussion about their performance has been limited to their ability to reproduce a known target distribution. For example, expressive model families such as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) have been almost entirely evaluated on their capability to learn a given target distribution with high accuracy. While this aspect may be ideal for some tasks, it limits the scope of a generative model's assessment to its ability to memorize data rather than generalize. As a result, there has been little understanding of a model's generalization performance and the relation between such capability and the resource requirements, e.g. the circuit depth and the amount of training data. In this work, we leverage upon a recently proposed generalization evaluation framework to begin addressing this knowledge gap. We first investigate the QCBM's learning process of a cardinality-constrained distribution and see an increase in generalization performance while increasing the circuit depth. In the 12-qubit example presented here, we observe that with as few as 30% of the valid data in the training set, the QCBM exhibits the best generalization performance toward generating unseen and valid data. Lastly, we assess the QCBM's ability to generalize not only to valid samples, but to high-quality bitstrings distributed according to an adequately re-weighted distribution. We see that the QCBM is able to effectively learn the reweighted dataset and generate unseen samples with higher quality than those in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature that presents the QCBM's generalization performance as an integral evaluation metric for quantum generative models, and demonstrates the QCBM's ability to generalize to high-quality, desired novel samples.

TI Quadrature entanglement in the microwave domain with a phase locking
   protocol
SO EPL
AB Entanglement has attracted great attention in the past few decades due to its potential applications in the field of quantum information protocols. From now, achieving excellent phase locking in entanglement generation is significant yet a challenging task in cryogenic quantum technology. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a comprehensive paradigm of phase locking protocol for quadrature entanglement at the microwave wavelengths. We carry out a theoretical derivation of the quadrature entangled microwaves generated based on Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs), and the phase locking error signal, which is used to lock the relative phase of zero between the two quadrature squeezed microwaves. Simulating data for the phase locking scheme are shown under different parameter settings for comparison. Finally, we use the proposed phase locking scheme to enable a stable output of quadrature entangled microwave.

TI Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization for environmental control
   system equipment design and assessment
SO ADVANCED MODELING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB This paper explores possible implementations of a quantum annealing-based algorithm, in the Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization method (QUBO) form, to solve the thermo-fluid dynamics problem associated with the design of critical components of aircraft environmental control systems, namely compact heat exchangers and ejectors (also known as jet pumps), used on rotary- or fixed- winged aircrafts environmental control system to mix two fluids and exchange thermal energy. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the implementation of the QUBO model based on compact heat exchangers lumped model and the SAE 1168-6 ejector design procedure, with the formalization of the mathematical problem and the comparison of results obtained with experimental tests, classical resolution approaches and the quantum optimized code, showing how the QUBO approach is an effective and efficient tools for design engineers tasked to design and validate equipment parameters.We start with a simple two-phase flow within a single-pass mini-channel heat exchanger, describing the mathematical formulation of the problem followed by a simplified implementation of the proposed quantum approaches, highlighting the main procedures of the calculation as well as the practical implications, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method, e.g. a limited number of CFD simulations are required to evaluate air side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop for particular designs within the defined design space, and the specific hardware required to implement the quantum process.

TI Wide field imaging of van der Waals ferromagnet
   Fe3GeTe2 by spin defects in hexagonal boron
   nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been used extensively to encapsulate other van der Waals materials, protecting them from environmental degradation, and allowing integration into more complex heterostructures. Here, the authors make use of boron vacancy spin defects in h-BN using them to image the magnetic properties of a Fe3GeTe2 flake.
   Emergent color centers with accessible spins hosted by van der Waals materials have attracted substantial interest in recent years due to their significant potential for implementing transformative quantum sensing technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is naturally relevant in this context due to its remarkable ease of integration into devices consisting of low-dimensional materials. Taking advantage of boron vacancy spin defects in hBN, we report nanoscale quantum imaging of low-dimensional ferromagnetism sustained in Fe3GeTe2/hBN van der Waals heterostructures. Exploiting spin relaxometry methods, we have further observed spatially varying magnetic fluctuations in the exfoliated Fe3GeTe2 flake, whose magnitude reaches a peak value around the Curie temperature. Our results demonstrate the capability of spin defects in hBN of investigating local magnetic properties of layered materials in an accessible and precise way, which can be extended readily to a broad range of miniaturized van der Waals heterostructure systems.

TI Exploration of new chemical materials using black-box optimization with
   the D-wave quantum annealer
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In materials informatics, searching for chemical materials with desired properties is challenging due to the vastness of the chemical space. Moreover, the high cost of evaluating properties necessitates a search with a few clues. In practice, there is also a demand for proposing compositions that are easily synthesizable. In the real world, such as in the exploration of chemical materials, it is common to encounter problems targeting black-box objective functions where formalizing the objective function in explicit form is challenging, and the evaluation cost is high. In recent research, a Bayesian optimization method has been proposed to formulate the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem as a surrogate model for black-box objective functions with discrete variables. Regarding this method, studies have been conducted using the D-Wave quantum annealer to optimize the acquisition function, which is based on the surrogate model and determines the next exploration point for the black-box objective function. In this paper, we address optimizing a black-box objective function containing discrete variables in the context of actual chemical material exploration. In this optimization problem, we demonstrate results obtaining parameters of the acquisition function by sampling from a probability distribution with variance can explore the solution space more extensively than in the case of no variance. As a result, we found combinations of substituents in compositions with the desired properties, which could only be discovered when we set an appropriate variance.

TI Quantifying quantum coherence of optical cat states in a noisy channel
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum coherence is one of the most fundamental features of quantum mechanics that underlines the unique characteristics of quantum technology. Optical cat state is a superposition of two coherent states and has broad applications in quantum information and quantum metrology. In the application of optical cat state, it is essential to investigate the quantum coherence of it when it interacts with the environment. In this manuscript, we present the quantum coherence of an optical cat state in a noisy channel by calculating the relative entropy in Fock basis. We show that the quantum coherence of an optical cat state is robust against loss and noise in a noisy channel. Different from quantum coherence, the negativity of the Wigner function and the fidelity of the cat state are not robust against loss and noise. Our result provides a reference for applying optical cat states in a noisy environment. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Photon-pair generation in a lossy waveguide
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB An on-chip quantum light source based on spontaneous four-wave mixing is an essential element for developing quantum photonic integrated circuit technology, which has the advantage of no connection loss owing to the integration of the source into photonic circuits. The waveguide-based quantum light source inevitably causes propagation loss owing to imperfections in the fabrication process, but the propagation loss effects on photon-pair generation have not been extensively studied. In this study, propagation loss effects were examined using theoretical and experimental methods. In theory, the performance of quantum light sources, such as brightness, heralding efficiency, and coincidence-to-accidental ratio, strongly depend on propagation loss. We fabricate several waveguides with a moderate propagation loss of 2.2 dB/cm to investigate the loss dependence and ascertain that the brightness, heralding efficiency, and coincidence-to-accident ratio strongly correlate with the length of the optical waveguide. The maximum coincidence-count brightness occurred at an optimization length of 1/alpha, where alpha is the absorption coefficient. In contrast, the single-count brightness shows slightly different waveguide length dependence owing to loss-induced one-photon states. We expect that the results obtained in this study will greatly assist in determining the proper waveguide length for photon-pair generation according to the source's application fields. The results will be helpful in the development of a quantum light source suitable for practical and quantum optical integrated circuits and will lead to the development of high-fidelity quantum technologies.

TI Fast Electrically Switchable Large Gap Quantum Spin Hall States in
   MGe2Z4
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Spin-polarized conducting edge currents counterpropagate in quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators and are protected against disorder-driven localizations by the time-reversal symmetry. Using these spin-currents for device applications requires materials with a large bandgap and fast switchable QSH states. By means of in-depth first-principles calculations, this study demonstrates the large bandgap and fast switchable QSH state in a newly introduced 2D material family with 1T '-MGe(2)Z(4) (M = Mo or W and Z = P or As). These Ge-based compounds show superior properties with respect to other members of the same family. For the WGe2As4 monolayer it can stabilize the 1T '-phase, while for the other members of the family, this study needs an appropriate strain. The dynamically stable 1T '-MGe(2)Z(4) monolayers have a large energy gap up to 237 meV for WGe2As4. These materials undergo a phase transition from a QSH insulator to a trivial insulator with a Rashba-like spin splitting under the influence of an out-of-plane electric field, demonstrating a fast tunability of the bandgap and its band topology for the Ge-based compounds. Fast topological phase switching in a large gap 1T '-MGe(2)Z(4) QSH insulators have potential applications in low-power devices, quantum computation, and quantum communication.

TI Telecom-Band Quantum Interference of Frequency-Converted Photons from
   Remote Detuned NV Centers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement distribution over quantum networks has the promise of realizing fundamentally new technologies. Entanglement between separated quantum processing nodes has been achieved on several experimental platforms in the past decade. To move toward metropolitan-scale quantum network test beds, the creation and transmission of indistinguishable single photons over existing telecom infrastructure is key. Here, we report the interference of photons emitted by remote spectrally detuned NV-center-based network nodes, using quantum frequency conversion to the telecom L band. We find a visibility of 0.79 +/- 0.03 and an indistinguishability between converted NV photons around 0.9 over the full range of the emission duration, confirming the removal of the spectral information present. Our approach implements fully separated and independent control over the nodes, time multiplexing of control and quantum signals, and active feedback to stabilize the output frequency. Our results demonstrate a working principle that can be readily employed on other platforms and shows a clear path toward generating metropolitan-scale solid-state entanglement over deployed telecom fibers.

TI A quantum spin liquid candidate isolated in a two-dimensional
   CoIIRhIII bimetallic oxalate network
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an elusive state of matter characterized by the absence of long-range magnetic order, even at zero temperature, and by the presence of exotic quasiparticle excitations. In spite of their relevance for quantum communication, topological quantum computation and the understanding of strongly correlated systems, like high-temperature superconductors, the unequivocal experimental identification of materials behaving as QSLs remains challenging. Here, we present a novel 2D heterometallic oxalate complex formed by high-spin Co(ii) ions alternating with diamagnetic Rh(iii) in a honeycomb lattice. This complex meets the key requirements to become a QSL: a spin 1/2 ground state for Co(ii), determined by spin-orbit coupling and crystal field, a magnetically-frustrated triangular lattice due to the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations, strongly suppressed direct exchange interactions and the presence of equivalent interfering superexchange paths between Co centres. A combination of electronic paramagnetic resonance, specific heat and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements in a wide range of frequencies and temperatures shows the presence of strong antiferromagnetic correlations concomitant with no signs of magnetic ordering down to 15 mK. These results show that bimetallic oxalates are appealing QSL candidates as well as versatile systems to chemically fine tune key aspects of a QSL, like magnetic frustration and superexchange path geometries.

TI Wehrl entropy and entanglement complexity of quantum spin systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the Shannon entropy of its coherent-state distribution function, and remains non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the relationship between this entropy and the many-particle quantum entanglement, for N spin-1/2 particles. Explicitly, we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various N-particle ( 2 <= N <= 20) entangled pure states, with respect to the SU(2) circle times N coherent states. Our results show that for the large-N ( N greater than or similar to 10) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states (e.g. 2-N/2 & sum;s1,s2,& mldr;,sN=up arrow,down arrow |s1,s2,& mldr;,sN > e-i phi s1,s2,& mldr;,sN, with phi s1,s2,& mldr;,sN being random angles) are substantially larger than that of the very regular entangled states (e.g. the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state). Therefore, the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement of many-body pure states, as proposed by Sugita (2003 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36 9081). In particular, the Wehrl entropy per particle (WEPP) can be used as a quantitative description of this entanglement complexity. Unlike other quantities used to evaluate this complexity (e.g. the degree of entanglement between a subsystem and the other particles), the WEPP does not necessitate the division of the total system into two subsystems. We further demonstrate that many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, based on the behavior of the WEPP in the limit N ->infinity: states approaching that of a maximally mixed state, those approaching completely separable pure states, and a third category lying between these two extremes. Each type exhibits fundamentally different entanglement complexity.

TI Selective excitation of a single rare-earth ion in an optical fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A fiber-coupled single-photon source is an essential component for the implementation of optical quantum communication technologies. Using the rare-earth ion doped in an optical fiber as an emitter is a significant method to construct such a photon source at room temperature, as well as achieving high coupling and channeling efficiency. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of single photons at room temperature by selectively exciting a sole rare-earth ion isolated within a tapered silica fiber. The key advantages of our method are the ability to manipulate a purely single ion and the efficient collection of photons from the guided mode of the fiber, owing to the single ion's emission of photons directly within the fiber. These features make our system a promising building block for realizing all-fiber-integrated optical quantum networks. We have also measured the optical lifetime of a single neodymium ion in the tapered fiber, and the result supports that the single-photon correlation time is practically determined by the absorption time of the ion.

TI Design of topological micropillar cavities for Purcell enhanced single
   photon emission from semiconductor quantum dots
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots offer distinct advantages in generating near-optimal single photons, which have important applications in quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation. Semiconductor quantum dot single-photon sources in the telecommunication band are garnering significant attention due to their considerable advantages in low-loss long-distance fiber transmission. In this paper, we propose and design a topological micropillar cavity based on the interface states between two one-dimensional photonic crystals with distinct Zak phases, achieving a high-quality factor exceeding 15,000 and a significant Purcell factor of up to 606 in the 1.31-mu m band. We have computed the emission efficiency by an InAs/GaAs quantum dot coupled to an arbitrarily detuned single-mode topological micropillar cavity, taking into account pure dephasing processes and the ratio of external-to-internal cavity losses. Our results demonstrate that the designed topologically protected micropillar single- photon sources exhibit robust single-photon emission with high efficiency of over 90% even in the highly dephasing and detuning conditions, which is in striking contrast to the conventional micropillar single-photon sources. Our study provides theoretical guidance for the development of a new type of surface-emitting single-photon source with high performance.

TI A Secure Multiparty Quantum Homomorphic Encryption Scheme
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The significant advantage of the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme is to ensure the perfect security of quantum private data. In this paper, a novel secure multiparty quantum homomorphic encryption scheme is proposed, which can complete arbitrary quantum computation on the private data of multiple clients without decryption by an almost dishonest server. Firstly, each client obtains a secure encryption key through the measurement device independent quantum key distribution protocol and encrypts the private data by using the encryption operator and key. Secondly, with the help of the almost dishonest server, the non-maximally entangled states are pre shared between the client and the server to correct errors in the homomorphic evaluation of T gates, so as to realize universal quantum circuit evaluation on encrypted data. Thirdly, from the perspective of the application scenario of secure multi-party computation, this work is based on the probabilistic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, allowing multiple parties to delegate the server to perform the secure homomorphic evaluation. The operation and the permission to access the data performed by the client and the server are clearly pointed out. Finally, a concrete security analysis shows that the proposed multiparty quantum homomorphic encryption scheme can securely resist outside and inside attacks.

TI Security analysis of measurement-device-independent quantum conference
   key agreement with weak randomness
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) allows multiple users to distribute secret conference keys over long distances. Measurement-device-independent QCKA (MDI-QCKA) is an effective QCKA scheme, which closes all detection loopholes and greatly enhances QCKA's security in practical application. However, an eavesdropper (Eve) may compromise the security of practical systems and acquire conference key information by taking advantage of the weak randomness from the imperfect quantum devices. In this article, we analyze the performance of the MDI-QCKA scheme based on the weak randomness model. Our simulation results show that even a small proportion of weak randomness may lead to a noticeable fluctuation in the conference key rate. For the case with finite-key size, we find that the weak randomness damages the performance of MDI-QCKA to different degrees according to the data size of total pulses transmitted. Furthermore, we infer that QCKA based on single-photon interference technology may perform better in resisting weak randomness vulnerabilities. Our work contributes to the practical security analysis of multiparty quantum communication and takes a further step in the development of quantum networks.

TI An Efficient Visually Meaningful Quantum Walks-Based Encryption Scheme
   for Secure Data Transmission on IoT and Smart Applications
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Smart systems and technologies have become integral parts of modern society. Their ubiquity makes it paramount to prioritise securing the privacy of data transferred between smart devices. Visual encryption is a technique employed to obscure images by rendering them meaningless to evade attention during transmission. However, the astounding computing power ascribed to quantum technology implies that even the best visually encrypted systems can be effortlessly violated. Consequently, the physical realisation quantum hardware portends great danger for visually encrypted date on smart systems. To circumvent this, our study proposes the integration of quantum walks (QWs) as a cryptographic mechanism to forestall violation of the integrity of images on smart systems. Specifically, we use QW first to substitute the original image and to subsequently permutate and embed it onto the reference image. Based on this structure, our proposed quantum walks visually meaningful cryptosystem facilities confidential transmission of visual information. Simulation-based experiments validate the performance of the proposed system in terms of visual quality, efficiency, robustness, and key space sensitivity, and by that, its potential to safeguard smart systems now and as we transition to the quantum era.

TI Polarization-dependent photoluminescence of Ce-implanted MgO and

SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Since the qubit's performance of solid-state spin centers depends highly on the host material, spin centers using new host materials may offer new qubit applications. We investigate the optical properties of Ce-implanted MgO and MgAl2O4 as potential materials holding the optically accessible qubit. We find that the photoluminescence of Ce-implanted MgAl2O4 is more than 10 times brighter than that of Ce-implanted MgO and observe polarization-dependent emission of Ce center in MgAl2O4 with 2% at 4 K under 500 mT, suggesting that the properties required for initializing and reading the state of the spin qubit have been achieved.

TI Photonic circuits written by femtosecond laser in glass: improved
   fabrication and recent progress in photonic devices
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics is attracting considerable attention and has found many applications in both classical and quantum optics, fulfilling the requirements for the ever-growing complexity in modern optical experiments and big data communication. Femtosecond (fs) laser direct writing (FLDW) is an acknowledged technique for producing waveguides (WGs) in transparent glass that have been used to construct complex integrated photonic devices. FLDWpossesses unique features, such as three-dimensional fabrication geometry, rapid prototyping, and single step fabrication, which are important for integrated communication devices and quantum photonic and astrophotonic technologies. To fully take advantage of FLDW, considerable efforts have been made to produce WGs over a large depth with low propagation loss, coupling loss, bend loss, and highly symmetrical mode field. We summarize the improved techniques as well as the mechanisms for writing high-performance WGs with controllable morphology of cross-section, highly symmetrical mode field, low loss, and high processing uniformity and efficiency, and discuss the recent progress of WGs in photonic integrated devices for communication, topological physics, quantum information processing, and astrophotonics. Prospective challenges and future research directions in this field are also pointed out.

TI Electrically tunable quantum confinement of neutral excitons
SO NATURE
AB Confining particles to distances below their de Broglie wavelength discretizes their motional state. This fundamental effect is observed in many physical systems, ranging from electrons confined in atoms or quantum dots(1,2) to ultracold atoms trapped in optical tweezers(3,4). In solid-state photonics, a long-standing goal has been to achieve fully tunable quantum confinement of optically active electron-hole pairs, known as excitons. To confine excitons, existing approaches mainly rely on material modulation(5), which suffers from poor control over the energy and position of trapping potentials. This has severely impeded the engineering of large-scale quantum photonic systems. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled quantum confinement of neutral excitons in 2D semiconductors. By combining gate-defined in-plane electric fields with inherent interactions between excitons and free charges in a lateral p-i-n junction, we achieve exciton confinement below 10 nm. Quantization of excitonic motion manifests in the measured optical response as a ladder of discrete voltage-dependent states below the continuum. Furthermore, we observe that our confining potentials lead to a strong modification of the relative wave function of excitons. Our technique provides an experimental route towards creating scalable arrays of identical single-photon sources and has wide-ranging implications for realizing strongly correlated photonic phases(6,7) and on-chip optical quantum information processors(8,9).

TI Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle-Strained
   WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam
   Irradiation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Solid-state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP-strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub-bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti-bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub-bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti-bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well-defined energy range.

AB Optimization problems is one of the most challenging applications of quantum computers, as well as one of the most relevants. As a consequence, it has attracted huge efforts to obtain a speedup over classical algorithms using quantum resources. Up to now, many problems of different nature have been addressed through the perspective of this revolutionary computation paradigm, but there are still many open questions. In this work, a hybrid classical-quantum approach is presented for dealing with the one-dimensional Bin Packing Problem (1dBPP). The algorithm comprises two modules, each one designed for being executed in different computational ecosystems. First, a quantum subroutine seeks a set of feasible bin configurations of the problem at hand. Secondly, a classical computation subroutine builds complete solutions to the problem from the subsets given by the quantum subroutine. Being a hybrid solver, we have called our method H-BPP. To test our algorithm, we have built 18 different 1dBPP instances as a benchmarking set, in which we analyse the fitness, the number of solutions and the performance of the QC subroutine. Based on these figures of merit we verify that H-BPP is a valid technique to address the 1dBPP.

TI Exploring the fundamental limits of integrated beam splitters with
   arbitrary phase via topology optimization
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Optical beam splitters are essential for classical and quantum photonic on -chip systems. In integrated optical technology, a beam splitter can be implemented as a beam coupler with two input and two output ports. The output phases are constrained by the conservation of energy. In lossless beam splitters, the phase shift between the output fields is pi and zero for excitation from the first and second input ports, respectively. Therefore, for excitation from both inputs, the phase between the output fields, defined as beam splitter phase (BSP), is pi. The BSP leads to several phenomena, such as the quantum interference between two photons, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. By introducing losses, BSP values different than pi become theoretically possible, but the design of 2 x 2 beam couplers with an arbitrary phase is elusive in integrated optics. Inspired by the growing interest on fundamental limits in electromagnetics and inverse design, here we explore the theoretical limits of symmetrical integrated beam splitters with an arbitrary BSP via adjoint-based topology optimization. Optimized 2D designs accounting for fabrication constraints are obtained for several combinations of loss and phase within the theoretical design space. Interestingly, the algorithm does not converge for objectives outside of the theoretical limits. Designs of beam splitters with arbitrary phase may find use in integrated optics for quantum information processing.

TI Learning interpretable representations of entanglement in quantum optics
   experiments using deep generative models
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum physics experiments produce interesting phenomena such as interference or entanglement, which are the core properties of numerous future quantum technologies. The complex relationship between the setup structure of a quantum experiment and its entanglement properties is essential to fundamental research in quantum optics but is difficult to intuitively understand. We present a deep generative model of quantum optics experiments where a variational autoencoder is trained on a dataset of quantum optics experiment setups. In a series of computational experiments, we investigate the learned representation of our quantum optics variational autoencoder (QOVAE) and its internal understanding of the quantum optics world. We demonstrate that QOVAE learns an interpretable representation of quantum optics experiments and the relationship between the experiment structure and entanglement. We show QOVAE is able to generate novel experiments for highly entangled quantum states with specific distributions that match its training data. QOVAE can learn to generate specific entangled states and efficiently search the space of experiments that produce highly entangled quantum states. Importantly, we are able to interpret how QOVAE structures its latent space, finding curious patterns that we can explain in terms of quantum physics. The results demonstrate how we can use and understand the internal representations of deep generative models in a complex scientific domain. QOVAE and the insights from our investigations can be immediately applied to other physical systems.
   A variational autoencoder is trained on a dataset of quantum optics experiment configurations and learns an interpretable representation of the relationship between experiment setup and quantum entanglement. The approach can be used to explore new experiment designs with specific, highly entangled states.

AB Well-controlled yet practical systems that give access to interference effects are critical for established and new functionalities in ultrafast signal processing, quantum photonics, optical coherence characterization, etc. Optical fiber systems constitute a central platform for such technologies. However, harnessing optical interference in a versatile and stable manner remains technologically costly and challenging. Here, degrees of freedom native to optical fibers, i.e., polarization and frequency, are used to demonstrate an easily deployable technique for the retrieval and stabilization of the relative phase in fiber interferometric systems. The scheme gives access (without intricate device isolation) to <1.3 x 10(-3) pi rad error signal Allan deviation across 1 ms to 1.2 h integration times for all tested phases, ranging from 0 to 2 pi. More importantly, the phase-independence of this stability is shown across the full 2 pi range, granting access to arbitrary phase settings, central for, e.g., performing quantum projection measurements and coherent pulse recombination. Furthermore, the scheme is characterized with attenuated optical reference signals and single-photon detectors, and extended functionality is demonstrated through the use of pulsed reference signals (allowing time-multiplexing of both main and reference signals). Finally, the scheme is used to demonstrate radiofrequency-controlled interference of high-dimensional time-bin entangled states.

TI Demonstration of reversed non-Hermitian skin effect via quantum walks on
   a ladder
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum walks hold enormous potential applications in various areas such as quantum computing and quantum simulation. Discrete-time quantum walks on a ladder offer greater prospects compared to traditional quantum walks, especially in addressing physical problems in higher-dimension coupled systems. Here we give an experimental proposal of quantum walks on a two-leg ladder using linear optics, and further apply it to non-Hermitian systems by introducing loss-based non-unitary evolutions. Non-Hermitian systems under nonreciprocity-induced evolution present an exotic phenomenon, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In a two-leg non-Hermitian system with the same preferred direction of NHSE, the direction has recently been found to reverse when interchain couplings are introduced. Based on quantum walks on a ladder, we also propose an experimentally feasible scheme to demonstrate the direction reversal of NHSE. Through the simulated results we show that particles on each chain accumulate to the preferred boundary driven by nonreciprocal hopping, while particles are transported in the opposite direction when interchain hopping is allowed, clearly demonstrating the existence of reversed NHSE. Our work further expands the application of the quantum walk platform and opens a door for the experimental investigation of reversed NHSE.

TI Silicon Nitride Integrated Photonics from Visible to Mid-Infrared
   Spectra
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are of great interest due to their extremely low propagation loss and higher integration capabilities. The number of applications based on the silicon nitride integrated photonics platform continues to grow, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), hybrid neuromorphic and quantum computing. It's potential for CMOS compatibility, as well as advances in heterogeneous integration with silicon-on-insulator, indium phosphate, and lithium niobate on insulator platforms, are leading to an advanced hybrid large-scale PICs. Here, they review key trends in Si3N4 photonic integrated circuit technology and fill an information gap in the field of state-of-the-art devices operating from the visible to the mid-infrared spectrum. A comprehensive overview of its microfabrication process details (deposition, lithography, etching, etc.) is introduced. Finally, the limitations and challenges of silicon nitride photonics performance are pointed out in an ultra-wideband, providing routes and prospects for its future scaling and optimization.
   This manuscript reviews recent advances in the fabrication processes and applications of silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits in the broadband spectrum from visible to mid-infrared wavelengths. The details of material deposition, lithography, etching, and fabrication of coupling structures are analyzed. An in-depth analysis of relevant publications by key groups over more than 10 years is presented along with the latest achievements in creating state-of-the-art devices based on Si3N4 integrated photonics. image

AB Commit-and-open Sigma-protocols are a popular class of protocols for constructing non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments and digital-signature schemes via the Fiat-Shamir transformation. Instantiated with hash-based commitments, the resulting non-interactive schemes enjoy tight online-extractability in the random oracle model. Online extractability improves the tightness of security proofs for the resulting digital-signature schemes by avoiding lossy rewinding or forking-lemma based extraction.
   In this work, we prove tight online extractability in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), showing that the construction supports post-quantum security. First, we consider the default case where committing is done by element-wise hashing. In a second part, we extend our result to Merkle-tree based commitments. Our results yield a significant improvement of the provable post-quantum security of the digital-signature scheme Picnic.
   Our analysis makes use of a recent framework by Chung et al. [CFHL21] for analysing quantum algorithms in the QROM using purely classical reasoning. Therefore, our results can to a large extent be understood and verified without prior knowledge of quantum information science.

The adiabatic dynamics is accelerated by introducing high -frequency modulations in the control Hamiltonian, which mimic a timedependent counterdiabatic correction. We present a number of applications for the high-fidelity realization of quantum state transfers and quantum gates based on effective counterdiabatic driving, in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits to Rydberg atoms.

TI Benchmarking the performance of portfolio optimization with QAOA
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We present a detailed study of portfolio optimization using different versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For a given list of assets, the portfolio optimization problem is formulated as quadratic binary optimization constrained on the number of assets contained in the portfolio. QAOA has been suggested as a possible candidate for solving this problem (and similar combinatorial optimization problems) more efficiently than classical computers in the case of a sufficiently large number of assets. However, the practical implementation of this algorithm requires a careful consideration of several technical issues, not all of which are discussed in the present literature. The present article intends to fill this gap and thereby provides the reader with a useful guide for applying QAOA to the portfolio optimization problem (and similar problems). In particular, we will discuss several possible choices of the variational form and of different classical algorithms for finding the corresponding optimized parameters. Viewing at the application of QAOA on error-prone NISQ hardware, we also analyse the influence of statistical sampling errors (due to a finite number of shots) and gate and readout errors (due to imperfect quantum hardware). Finally, we define a criterion for distinguishing between 'easy' and 'hard' instances of the portfolio optimization problem.

TI Unif-NTT: A Unified Hardware Design of Forward and Inverse NTT for PQC
   Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Polynomial multiplications based on the number theoretic transform (NTT) are critical in lattice-based post-quantum cryptography algorithms. Therefore, this paper presents a platform-agnostic unified hardware accelerator design (Unif-NTT) to compute the forward and inverse operations of the NTT for the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm. Moreover, a unified design (Unif-BU) of the Cooley-Tukey and Gentleman-Sande butterflies is presented using two adders, multipliers, subtractors, routing multiplexers and barret-based modular reduction units. Finally, a dedicated controller is implemented for efficient control functionalities. The implementation results are realized on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms. The Unif-NTT requires 1664 and 1792 clock cycles for one forward and inverse NTT computations, respectively. It can operate up to a maximum frequency of $212MHz$ and $2.5GHz$ over Virtex-7 FPGA and 28nm ASIC platforms, respectively. The Unif-NTT is 26% more efficient in Area-Time-Product compared to the most area-optimized NTT accelerator from the state-of-the-art. The Unif-NTT design is suited for applications that demand reasonable hardware resources with processing speed.

TI A Side-Channel-Resistant Implementation of SABER
SO ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB The candidates for the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization have undergone extensive studies on efficiency and theoretical security, but research on their side-channel security is largely lacking. This remains a considerable obstacle for their real-world deployment, where side-channel security can be a critical requirement. This work describes a side-channel-resistant instance of Saber, one of the lattice-based candidates, using masking as a countermeasure. Saber proves to be very efficient to masking due to two specific design choices: power-of-two moduli and limited noise sampling of learning with rounding. A major challenge in masking lattice-based cryptosystems is the integration of bit-wise operations with arithmetic masking, requiring algorithms to securely convert between masked representations. The described design includes a novel primitive for masked logical shifting on arithmetic shares and adapts an existing masked binomial sampler for Saber. An implementation is provided for an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, and its side-channel resistance is experimentally demonstrated. The masked implementation features a 2.5x overhead factor, significantly lower than the 5.7x previously reported for a masked variant of NewHope. Masked key decapsulation requires less than 3,000,000 cycles on the Cortex-M4 and consumes less than 12kB of dynamic memory, making it suitable for deployment in embedded platforms.

TI Digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose digitized-counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO) to achieve polynomial enhancement over adiabatic quantum optimization for the general Ising spin-glass model, which includes the whole class of combinatorial optimization problems. This is accomplished via the digitization of adiabatic quantum algorithms that are catalyzed by the addition of nonstoquastic counterdiabatic terms. The latter is suitably chosen not only for escaping classical simulability, but also for speeding up the performance. Finding the ground state of a general Ising spin-glass Hamiltonian is used to illustrate that the inclusion of k-local nonstoquastic counterdiabatic terms can always outperform the traditional adiabatic quantum optimization with stoquastic Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that a polynomial enhancement in the ground-state success probability can be achieved for a finite-time evolution, even with the simplest two-local counterdiabatic terms. Furthermore, the considered digitization process within the gate-based quantum computing paradigm, provides the flexibility to introduce arbitrary nonstoquastic interactions. As an experimental test, we study the performance of the DCQO algorithm on cloud-based IBM's superconducting and Quantinuum's ion-trap quantum processors with up to 8 qubits. Along these lines, using our proposed paradigm on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, quantum speedup may be reached to find approximate solutions for NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems. We expect DCQO to become a fast-lane paradigm toward quantum advantage in the NISQ era.

TI Verifying BQP Computations on Noisy Devices with Minimal Overhead
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB With the development of delegated quantum computation, clients will want to ensure confidentiality of their data and algorithms and the integrity of their computations. While protocols for blind and verifiable quantum computation exist, they suffer from high overheads and from oversensitivity: when running on noisy devices, imperfections trigger the same detection mechanisms as malicious attacks, resulting in perpetually aborted computations. We introduce the first blind and verifiable protocol for delegating bounded-error quantum polynomial (BQP) computations to a powerful server, with repetition as the only overhead. It is composable and statistically secure with exponentially low bounds and can tolerate a constant amount of global noise.

TI The Optimization and Application of 3-Bit Hermitian Gates and Multiple
   Control Toffoli Gates
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The well-known 3-bit Hermitian gate (a Toffoli gate) has been implemented using Clifford+T circuits. Compared with the Peres gate, its implementation circuit requires more controlled-not (cnot) gates. However, the Peres gate is not Hermitian. This article reports four 3-bit Hermitian gates named LI gates, whose realized circuits have the same T-count, T-depth, and cnot-count as the Peres gate. Furthermore, two decomposition methods of a multiple-control Toffoli (MCT) gate are proposed for different primary optimization goals. Then, we design the equality, less-than, and full comparators with the minimum circuit width using proposed Hermitian gates and optimized MCT gates. A fault-tolerant circuit is required for robust quantum computing. Clifford+T circuits are accepted solutions for fault-tolerant implementation. Considering T-count, T-depth, cnot-count, and circuit width as the primary optimization goals, we design the optimized Clifford+T circuits of three comparators using LI gates and optimized MCT gates. Comparison and analysis show that the proposed comparators have better overall performances for T-count, T-depth, cnot-count, and circuit width than the best-known comparators without quantum measurements.

TI Topologically protected Grover's oracle for the partition problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The number partitioning problem (NPP) is one of the NP-complete (nondeterministic polynomial-time complete) computational problems. Its definite exact solution generally requires a check of all N solution candidates, which is exponentially large. Here we describe a path to the fast solution of this problem in & RADIC;N quasi-adiabatic quantum annealing steps. We argue that the errors due to the finite duration of the quantum annealing can be suppressed if the annealing time scales with N only logarithmically. Moreover, our adiabatic oracle is topologically protected, in the sense that it is robust against small uncertainty and slow time dependence of the physical parameters or the choice of the annealing protocol. We also argue that our approach can solve many other famous NP-complete computational problems in & RADIC;N steps.

TI Digital quantum simulations of the nonresonant open Tavis-Cummings model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The open Tavis-Cummings model consists of N quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As N increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis-Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogeneous, nonresonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as O(N2) and O(N3), while the number of qubits used by these algorithms (space complexity) scales linearly as O(N). One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of Patel and Wilde [Open Syst. Inf. Dyn. 30, 2350014 (2023)]. We benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver in a variety of scenarios and demonstrate that our algorithms accurately reproduce the expected dynamics.

TI Local unitary classification of sets of generalized Bell states in Cd⊗Cd
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Two sets of quantum entangled states that are equivalent under local unitary transformations may exhibit identical effectiveness and versatility in various quantum information processing tasks. Consequently, classification under local unitary transformations has become a fundamental issue in the theory of quantum entanglement. The primary objective of this work is to establish a practical LU-classification for all sets of l(>= 2) generalized Bell states (GBSs), high-dimensional generalizations of Bell states, in a bipartite system Cd circle times Cd with d >= 3. Based on this classification, we determine the minimal cardinality of indistinguishable GBS sets in C6 circle times C6 under one-way local operations and classical communication (one-way LOCC). We first propose two classification methods based on LU-equivalence for all sets of l GBSs (l-GBS sets). We then establish LU-classification for all 2-GBS, 3-GBS, 4-GBS and 5-GBS sets in C6 circle times C6. Since LU-equivalent sets share identical local distinguishability, it suffices to examine representative GBS sets from equivalent classes. Notably, we identify a one-way LOCC indistinguishable 4-GBS set among these representatives, thereby resolving the case of d=6 for the problem of determining the minimum cardinality of one-way LOCC indistinguishable GBS sets in (Yuan et al. in Quantum Inf Process. 18:145, 2019) or (Zhang et al. in Phys Rev A 91:012329, 2015).

TI Toward practical quantum embedding simulation of realistic chemical
   systems on near-term quantum computers
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing has recently exhibited great potential in predicting chemical properties for various applications in drug discovery, material design, and catalyst optimization. Progress has been made in simulating small molecules, such as LiH and hydrogen chains of up to 12 qubits, by using quantum algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Yet, originating from the limitations of the size and the fidelity of near-term quantum hardware, the accurate simulation of large realistic molecules remains a challenge. Here, integrating an adaptive energy sorting strategy and a classical computational method-the density matrix embedding theory, which respectively reduces the circuit depth and the problem size, we present a means to circumvent the limitations and demonstrate the potential of near-term quantum computers toward solving real chemical problems. We numerically test the method for the hydrogenation reaction of C6H8 and the equilibrium geometry of the C-18 molecule, using basis sets up to cc-pVDZ (at most 144 qubits). The simulation results show accuracies comparable to those of advanced quantum chemistry methods such as coupled-cluster or even full configuration interaction, while the number of qubits required is reduced by an order of magnitude (from 144 qubits to 16 qubits for the C-18 molecule) compared to conventional VQE. Our work implies the possibility of solving industrial chemical problems on near-term quantum devices.

TI Two-stage relaxation of operators through domain wall and magnon
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a popular probe for quantum information spreading and thermalization. In systems with local interactions, the OTOC defines a characteristic butterfly light cone that separates a regime unperturbed by chaos from one where time-evolved operators and the OTOC approach equilibrium. This relaxation has been shown to proceed in two stages. The first stage exhibits an extensive timescale and a decay rate known as the "phantom eigenvalue", which is slower than the gap of the transfer matrix. In this paper, we investigate the two-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local quantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent statistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes-a domain wall and a magnon-govern the decay rates. We show that a configuration with coexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first stage, while competition between these two modes determines the second stage. We also examine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes translate into a bound state of clusters, and the domain wall into a random operator, giving consistent rates. Finally, we extend our findings from random-in-time circuits to a broad class of Floquet models.

TI Estimating parameterized entanglement measure
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The parameterized entanglement monotone, the q-concurrence, is also a reasonable parameterized entanglement measure. By exploring the properties of the q-concurrence with respect to the positive partial transposition and realignment of density matrices, we present tight lower bounds of the q-concurrence for arbitrary q >= 2. Detailed examples are given to show that the bounds are better than the previous ones.

TI Eigenstate control of plasmon wavepackets with electron-channel blockade
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coherent manipulation of plasmon wavepackets in solid-state systems is crucial for advancing nanoscale electronic devices, offering a unique platform for quantum information processing based on propagating quantum bits. Controlling the eigenstate of plasmon wavepackets is essential, as it determines their propagation speed and hence the number of quantum operations that can be performed during their flight time through a quantum system. When plasmon wavepackets are generated by short voltage pulses and transmitted through nanoscale devices, they distribute among multiple electron conduction channels via Coulomb interactions, a phenomenon known as charge fractionalisation. This spreading complicates plasmon manipulation in quantum circuits and makes precise control of the eigenstates of plasmon wavepackets challenging. Using a cavity, we demonstrate the ability to isolate and select electron conduction channels contributing to plasmon excitation, thus enabling precise control of plasmon eigenstates. Specifically, we observe an electron-channel blockade effect, where charge fractionalisation into cavity-confined channels is suppressed due to the plasmon's narrow energy distribution, enabling more stable and predictable plasmonic circuits. This technique provides a versatile tool for designing plasmonic circuits, offering the ability to tailor plasmon speed through local parameters, minimise unwanted plasmon excitation in adjacent circuits, and enable the precise selection of electron-channel plasmon eigenstates in quantum interferometers.

TI Quaternary Neural Belief Propagation Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes With
   Overcomplete Check Matrices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are promising candidates for error correction in quantum computers. One of the major challenges in implementing QLDPC codes in quantum computers is the lack of a universal decoder. In this work, we first propose to decode QLDPC codes with a belief propagation (BP) decoder operating on overcomplete check matrices. Then, we extend the neural BP (NBP) decoder, which was originally studied for suboptimal binary BP decoding of QLPDC codes, to quaternary BP decoders. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that both approaches as well as their combination yield a low-latency, high-performance decoder for several short to moderate length QLDPC codes.

AB While the search for quantum advantage typically focuses on speed-ups in execution time, quantum algorithms also offer the potential for advantage in space complexity. Previous work has shown such advantages for data stream problems, in which elements arrive and must be processed sequentially without random access, but these have been restricted to specially-constructed problems [Le Gall, SPAA '06] or polynomial advantage [Kallaugher, FOCS '21]. We show an exponential quantum space advantage for the maximum directed cut problem. This is the first known exponential quantum space advantage for any natural streaming problem. This also constitutes the first unconditional exponential quantum resource advantage for approximating a discrete optimization problem in any setting.
   Our quantum streaming algorithm 0.4844-approximates the value of the largest directed cut in a graph stream with n vertices using polylog(n) space, while previous work by Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [FOCS '20] implies that obtaining an approximation ratio better than 4/9 approximate to 0.4444 requires Omega(root n) space for any classical streaming algorithm. Our result is based on a recent ($) over tilde(root n) space classical streaming approach by Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy [FOCS '23], with an additional improvement in the approximation ratio due to recent work by Singer [APPROX '23].

SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We propose a theoretical scheme for a one-dimensional lattice based on a superconducting quantum circuit system consisting of two types of superconducting microwave cavities, the interaction between nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor unit cells that can be adjusted by the magnetic flux, the system can obtain the collective dynamic evolution and study the topological properties of the system.First, we investigate the energy spectrum and edge states of the odd-even lattice size and find that the odd-even lattice number affects the topological properties of the system. Furthermore, considering the next-nearest interactions, it is found that there are constraints on the next-nearest interactions, which can be tuned to study the topological phase transitions of the system and the transfer of topological quantum states.In addition, considering the influence of defects on topological properties, it is found that the defect potential energy is small, the system energy band is stable, the edge states remain unchanged, and the energy spectrum fluctuation is small and distinguishable. Conversely, the energy band distribution is destroyed, it will become disordered and chaotic. The research results can design some new quantum devices for quantum optics and quantum information processing.

TI Evaluating the evidence for exponential quantum advantage in
   ground-state quantum chemistry
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The extent of problems in quantum chemistry for which quantum algorithms could provide a speedup is still unclear, as well as the kind of speedup one should expect. Here, the authors look at the problem of ground state energy estimation, and gather theoretical and numerical evidence for the fact that an exponential quantum advantage is unlikely for generic problems of interest.
   Due to intense interest in the potential applications of quantum computing, it is critical to understand the basis for potential exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry. Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation, for generic chemical problems where heuristic quantum state preparation might be assumed to be efficient. The availability of exponential quantum advantage then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics, in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.

TI Quantum relaxometry for detecting biomolecular interactions with single
   NV centers
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving similar to 10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we reexamined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification, and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.

TI Application of quantum approximate optimization algorithm to job shop
   scheduling problem
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) has always been considered as one of the most complex and industry essential scheduling problems. Optimizing the makespan of a given schedule generally involves using dedicated algorithms, local search strategies, or metaheuristics. These approaches, however, heavily rely on classical computational power, which is bounded by the physical limits of microcontrollers and power issues. Inspired by the promising results achieved for Quantum Annealing (QA) based approaches to solve JSSP instances, we propose a new approach that uses gate-model quantum architecture as an alternative to QA. We find that we can make use of the time-indexed JSSP instance representation to build a cost Hamiltonian, which can be embedded into Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to find an optimal solution to a basic JSSP instance. We demonstrate the use of QAOA to solve the JSSP, and we evaluate its efficiency and accuracy for this problem from experimental results, as there is an increased urgency to demonstrate the applicability of quantum optimization algorithms. We also find that optimal variational parameters form patterns that can facilitate computation in bigger quantum circuits. Additionally, we compare the obtained noiseless simulation results of gate-model quantum cir-cuits demonstrating the relationship between two evaluation criteria -makespan and energy. Finally, we analyze and present the overall performance of our approach with the increasing deadline and simulated depth of QAOA circuits.(c) 2023 Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center IBCH PAS.

AB It was recently shown that certain subsurface hydrological inverse problems-here framed as determining the composition of an aquifer from pressure readings-can be solved on a quantum annealer. However, the quantum annealer performance suffered when solving problems where the aquifer was composed of materials with vastly different permeability, which is often encountered in practice. In this paper, we study why this regime is difficult and use several pre- and post-processing tools to address these issues. This study has three benefits: it improves quantum annealing performance for real-world problems in hydrology, it studies the scaling behavior for these problems (which were previously studied at a fixed size), and it elucidates a challenging class of problems that are amenable to quantum annealers.

AB While research in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has gained significant momentum, it is only slowly adopted for real-world products. This is largely due to concerns about practicability and maturity. The secure boot process of embedded devices is one scenario where such restraints can result in fundamental security problems. In this work, we present a flexible hardware/software co-design for hash-based signature (HBS) schemes which enables the move to a post-quantum secure boot today. These signature schemes stand out due to their straightforward security proofs and are on the fast track to standardisation. In contrast to previous works, we exploit the performance intensive similarities of the stateful LMS and XMSS schemes as well as the stateless SPHINCS+ scheme. Thus, we enable designers to use a stateful or stateless scheme depending on the constraints of each individual application. To show the feasibility of our approach, we compare our results with hardware accelerated implementations of classical asymmetric algorithms. Further, we lay out the usage of different HBS schemes during the boot process. We compare different schemes, show the importance of parameter choices, and demonstrate the performance gain with different levels of hardware acceleration.

TI Optimal entanglement distribution within a multi-ring topology
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Entanglement distribution networks are essential for enabling secure, reliable, and sustained communication through the future Quantum Internet. Multi-ring network topologies offer improved scalability and redundancy, but also introduce additional routing complexity for the task of efficiently distributing entanglement. This paper solves the problem of optimal entanglement distribution in multi-ring quantum network topologies. Two separate multi-ring network configurations are analyzed, one where requests can only be routed within a single ring layer, and involves a less complex node setup, and one where requests may switch ring layers when passing through the network's nodes, at the cost of additional complexity within the nodes themselves. We propose algorithms that solve the problem of entanglement distribution in terms of optimal time needed to satisfy a set of entanglement resupply requests with given network resources, as well as the problem of optimal resources in order to satisfy a set of entanglement resupply requests within a single entanglement transmission and measurement step. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed algorithms through computer simulations, which indicate that the additional complexity of a network which allows switching between ring layers brings little benefit in terms of time to serve requests, but may reduce the number of resources needed to satisfy the entanglement distribution requests in a non-blocking manner.

TI SQUWALS: A Szegedy QUantum WALks Simulator
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Szegedy's quantum walk is an algorithm for quantizing a general Markov chain. It has plenty of applications, such as many variants of optimizations. In order to check its properties in an error-free environment, it is important to have a classical simulator. However, the current simulation algorithms require a great deal of memory due to the particular formulation of this quantum walk. In this paper, a memory-saving algorithm is proposed that scales as O(N2)$\mathcal {O}(N<^>2)$ with the size N$N$ of the graph. Additional procedures are provided for simulating Szegedy's quantum walk over mixed states and also the Semiclassical Szegedy walk. With these techniques, a classical simulator in Python called SQUWALS (Szegedy QUantum WALks Simulator) has been built. It is shown that the simulator scales as O(N2)$\mathcal {O}(N<^>2)$ in both time and memory resources. This package provides some high-level applications for algorithms based on Szegedy's quantum walk, as for example the quantum PageRank.
   The Szegedy quantum walk represents the most general quantization of a Markov chain having numerous applications in optimization. Its classical simulation is crucial for the development of quantum algorithms. This work proposes a novel classical algorithm that saves both memory and time resources, allowing simulation for large networks. A Python library based on this algorithm, called SQUWALS (Szegedy QUantum WALks Simulator), has been developed. image

TI Compact and Stable Diamond Quantum Sensors for Wide Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This study proposes compact, highly sensitive, and stable diamond quantum sensors for a wide range of applications, including biomedical and energy electronics. For enhanced sensitivity and alignment precision within the objective field, a high-quality, (111)-oriented 12C-enriched chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond, featuring a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) axis in the (111) direction, is employed as the sensor. To increase the fluorescence collection efficiency, the laser beam is irradiated from the side surface of the CVD diamond, and fluorescence is detected using a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens. The floor noise level of the magnetic field signal is 44 pT/Hz0.5. An Allan deviation of 1.2 pT over 1000 s of averaging demonstrates stability. This is attributable to the integration of a balancing circuit to cancel out laser noise, alongside mechanisms to compensate for temperature fluctuations and a copper housing to shield against electromagnetic field noise.
   A portable diamond quantum sensor head, featuring nitrogen vacancies (NV) in a (111)-oriented, 12C-enriched chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond, has attained a magnetic sensitivity in the order of tens of pT Hz-0.5. The sensor's portability allows for straightforward placement on a measurement object, with the NV axis aligned in the (111) direction facilitating the identification of magnetic signals from living bodies. image

TI Interspecies exciton interactions lead to enhanced nonlinearity of
   dipolar excitons and polaritons in MoS2 homobilayers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nonlinear interactions between excitons strongly coupled to light are key for accessing quantum many-body phenomena in polariton systems. Atomically-thin two-dimensional semiconductors provide an attractive platform for strong light-matter coupling owing to many controllable excitonic degrees of freedom. Among these, the recently emerged exciton hybridization opens access to unexplored excitonic species, with a promise of enhanced interactions. Here, we employ hybridized interlayer excitons (hIX) in bilayer MoS2 to achieve highly nonlinear excitonic and polaritonic effects. Such interlayer excitons possess an out-of-plane electric dipole as well as an unusually large oscillator strength allowing observation of dipolar polaritons (dipolaritons) in bilayers in optical microcavities. Compared to excitons and polaritons in MoS2 monolayers, both hIX and dipolaritons exhibit & AP; 8 times higher nonlinearity, which is further strongly enhanced when hIX and intralayer excitons, sharing the same valence band, are excited simultaneously. This provides access to an unusual nonlinear regime which we describe theoretically as a mixed effect of Pauli exclusion and exciton-exciton interactions enabled through charge tunnelling. The presented insight into many-body interactions provides new tools for accessing few-polariton quantum correlations.
   In semiconductors, accessing nonlinear interactions between excitons strongly coupled to light will be key for quantum technologies. Here, in atomic bilayers of MoS2, new types of excitons are discovered showing strong inter-excitonic interactions.

TI Quantum process discrimination with restricted strategies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The discrimination of quantum processes, including quantum states, channels, and superchannels, is a fundamental topic in quantum information theory. It is often of interest to analyze the optimal performance that can be achieved when discrimination strategies are restricted to a given subset of all strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we present a general formulation of the task of finding the maximum success probability for discriminating quantum processes as a convex optimization problem whose Lagrange dual problem exhibits zero duality gap. The proposed formulation can be applied to any restricted strategy. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal restricted strategy to be optimal within the set of all strategies. We provide a simple example in which the dual problem given by our formulation can be much easier to solve than the original problem. We also show that the optimal performance of each restricted process discrimination problem can be written in terms of a certain robustness measure. This finding has the potential to provide a deeper insight into the discrimination performance of various restricted strategies.

AB Hybrid variational quantum algorithms, which combine a classical optimizer with evaluations on a quantum chip, are the most promising candidates to show quantum advantage on current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The classical optimizer is required to perform well in the presence of noise in the objective function evaluations, or else it becomes the weakest link in the algorithm. We introduce the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) as surrogate models to reduce the impact of noise and to provide high quality seeds to escape local minima, whether real or noise-induced. We build this as a framework on top of local optimizations, for which we choose Implicit Filtering (ImFil) in this study. ImFil is a state-of-the-art, gradient-free method, which in comparative studies has been shown to outperform on noisy VQE problems. The result is a new method: "GP+ImFil". We show that when noise is present, the GP+ImFil approach finds results closer to the true global minimum in fewer evaluations than standalone ImFil, and that it works particularly well for larger dimensional problems. Using GP to seed local searches in a multi-modal landscape shows mixed results: although it is capable of improving on ImFil standalone, it does not do so consistently and would only be preferred over other, more exhaustive, multistart methods if resources are constrained.

TI Demonstration of quantum-digital payments
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB There are different quantum algorithms developed for the security of current cryptographic concepts. Here the authors demonstrate a method to perform quantum-secured digital payments using unforgeable quantum cryptograms over an optical fiber link and verify the information-theoretic security.
   Digital payments have replaced physical banknotes in many aspects of our daily lives. Similarly to banknotes, they should be easy to use, unique, tamper-resistant and untraceable, but additionally withstand digital attackers and data breaches. Current technology substitutes customers' sensitive data by randomized tokens, and secures the payment's uniqueness with a cryptographic function, called a cryptogram. However, computationally powerful attacks violate the security of these functions. Quantum technology comes with the potential to protect even against infinite computational power. Here, we show how quantum light can secure daily digital payments by generating inherently unforgeable quantum cryptograms. We implement the scheme over an urban optical fiber link, and show its robustness to noise and loss-dependent attacks. Unlike previously proposed protocols, our solution does not depend on long-term quantum storage or trusted agents and authenticated channels. It is practical with near-term technology and may herald an era of quantum-enabled security.

TI In vitro recording of muscle activity induced by high intensity
   laser optogenetic stimulation using a diamond quantum biosensor
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The detection of physiological activity at the microscopic level is key for understanding the function of biosystems and relating this to their physical structure. Current sensing methods for in vitro study of living tissue often rely on invasive probes to stimulate and detect activity, bearing the risk of inducing damage in the target system. In recent years, a new type of quantum sensor based on color centers in diamond has begun to offer the possibility to instead passively sense and image living biological systems. Here, we use such a sensor to realize the recording of the biomagnetic field generated by tightly focused, high intensity pulsed laser optogenetic neuromuscular stimulation of extensor digitorum longus muscles, dissected from mice and kept alive in carbogenated solution. Recordings captured a compound action potential response and a slow signal component, which we seek to explain using a detailed model of the biological system. We show proof-of-principle experimental recording of localized neuromuscular activity from the laser stimulation site without photovoltaic or fluorescence artifacts associated with alternative techniques. Our work represents a further step toward passive sensing and imaging at the microscopic level with quantum sensing, enabling further research into mapping of neural activity and intracellular processes.

TI Wave packets in AdS/CFT correspondence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we construct a general bulk wave packet in the AdS / CFT correspondence. This wave packet can be described both in bulk and conformal field theory (CFT) descriptions. Then, we compute time evolution of the energy density of this wave -packet state on the vacuum in the CFT picture AdS 3 / CFT 2 . We find that the energy density of the wave packet is localized at two points, which means that the bulk wave packet corresponds to two light -like particle -like objects in the CFT picture. Our result implies that the entanglement wedge reconstruction given by Almheiri et al. [Bulk locality and quantum error correction in AdS / CFT, J. High Energy Phys. 04 (2015) 163] is invalid.

TI The Road to Near-Capacity CV-QKD Reconciliation: An FEC-Agnostic Design
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB New near-capacity continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) reconciliation schemes are proposed, where both the authenticated classical channel (ClC) and the quantum channel (QuC) for QKD are protected by separate forward error correction (FEC) coding schemes. More explicitly, all of the syndrome-based QKD reconciliation schemes found in literature rely on syndrome-based codes, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Hence at the current state-of-the-art the channel codes that cannot use syndrome decoding such as the family of convolutional codes (CCs) and polar codes cannot be directly applied. Moreover, the ClC used for syndrome transmission in these schemes is generally assumed to be idealistically error-free, where the realistic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading of the ClC have not been taken into account. To circumvent this limitation, a new codeword-based - rather than syndrome-based - QKD reconciliation scheme is proposed, where Alice sends an FECprotected codeword to Bob through a ClC, while Bob sends a separate FEC protected codeword to Alice through a QuC. Upon decoding the codeword received from the other side, the final key is obtained by applying a simple modulo-2 operation to the local codeword and the decoded remote codeword. As a result, first of all, the proposed codeword-based QKD reconciliation system ensures protection of both the QuC and of the ClC. Secondly, the proposed system has a similar complexity at both sides, where both Alice and Bob have an FEC encoder and an FEC decoder. Thirdly, the proposed system makes QKD reconciliation compatible with a wide range of FEC schemes, including polar codes, CCs and irregular convolutional codes (IRCCs), where a near-capacity performance can be achieved for both the QuC and for the ClC. Our simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed regime, the performance improvements of the QuC and of the ClC benefit each other, hence leading to an improved secret key rate (SKR) that inches closer to both the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound and to the maximum achievable rate bound.

TI HAETAE on ARMv8
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In this work, we present the highly optimized implementation of the HAETAE algorithm, submitted to the second round of the Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography (KpqC) competition and to the first round of NIST's additional post-quantum standardization for digital signatures on 64-bit ARMv8 embedded processors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimized implementation of the HAETAE algorithm on 64-bit ARMv8 embedded processors. We apply various optimization techniques to enhance the multiplication operations in the HAETAE algorithm. We utilize parallel operation techniques involving vector registers and NEON (Advanced SIMD technology used in ARM processors) instructions of ARMv8 embedded processors. In particular, we achieved the best performance of the HAETAE algorithm on ARMv8 embedded processors by applying all the state-of-the-art NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) implementation techniques. Performance improvements of up to 3.07x, 3.63x, and 9.15x were confirmed for NTT, Inverse-NTT, and pointwise Montgomery operations (Montgomery multiplication used in modular arithmetic), respectively, by applying the state-of-the-art implementation techniques, including the proposed techniques. As a result, we achieved a maximum performance improvement of up to 1.16x for the key generation algorithm, up to 1.14x for the signature algorithm, and up to 1.25x for the verification algorithm.

TI New constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions with an
   ensemble-NV-diamond magnetometer
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Laboratory search of exotic interactions is crucial for exploring physics beyond the standard model. We report new experimental constraints on two exotic spin-dependent interactions at the micrometer scale based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. A thin layer of NV electronic spin ensembles is synthesized as the solid-state spin quantum sensor, and a lead sphere is taken as the interacting nucleon source. Our result establishes new bounds for two types of exotic spin interactions at the micrometer scale. For an exotic parity-odd spin- and velocity-dependent interaction, improved bounds are set within the force range from 5 to 500 mu m. The upper limit of the corresponding coupling constant g(A)(e)g(V)(N) at 330 mu m is more than 1000-fold more stringent than the previous constraint. For the P, T-violating scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron interaction, improved constraints are established within the force range from 6 to 45 mu m. The limit of the corresponding coupling constant g(S)(N)g(P)(e) is improved by more than one order of magnitude at 30 mu m. This work demonstrates that a solid-state NV ensemble can be a powerful platform for probing exotic spin-dependent interactions.

TI Simultaneous Nanorheometry and Nanothermometry Using Intracellular
   Diamond Quantum Sensors
SO ACS NANO
AB The viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm plays a critical role in cell morphology, cell division, and intracellular transport. Viscoelasticity is also interconnected with other biophysical properties, such as temperature, which is known to influence cellular bioenergetics. Probing the connections between intracellular temperature and cytoplasmic viscoelasticity provides an exciting opportunity for the study of biological phenomena, such as metabolism and disease progression. The small length scales and transient nature of changes in these parameters combined with their complex interdependencies pose a challenge for biosensing tools, which are often limited to a single readout modality. Here, we present a dual-mode quantum sensor capable of performing simultaneous nanoscale thermometry and rheometry in dynamic cellular environments. We use nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals as biocompatible sensors for in vitro measurements. We combine subdiffraction resolution single-particle tracking in a fluidic environment with optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to perform simultaneous sensing of viscoelasticity and temperature. We use our sensor to demonstrate probing of the temperature-dependent viscoelasticity in complex media at the nanoscale. We then investigate the interplay between intracellular forces and the cytoplasmic rheology in live cells. Finally, we identify different rheological regimes and reveal evidence of active trafficking and details of the nanoscale viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm.

TI Quantum LDPC Codes Based on Cocyclic Block Matrices
SO ENTROPY
AB Motivated by a family of binary cocyclic block matrices over GF(2), we proposed a construction method to gain the stabilizer of long-length quantum error-correction codes (QECCs). Stabilizer quantum codes (SQCs) can be obtained by the different rows of the yielded circulant permutation matrices; hence, the quantum codes have the virtue of a fast construction algorithm. The recursive relation of a block matrix is employed in the proposed approach, so that the generator matrix of quantum cocyclic codes with long length can be constructed easily. Furthermore, the obtained quantum codes have the low-density advantage of there being no 4-cycles in the Tanner graph.

TI Challenges in integrating QPUs into classical HPC systems
SO MEMORIA INVESTIGACIONES EN INGENIERIA
AB .- High Performance Computing (HPC) applies different techniques to complex or high-volume applications, relying on parallel software and hardware, to reduce the execution time compared to running them on a simple computer. On the other hand, Quantum Computing (QC) emerges as a new paradigm that takes advantage of properties of quantum mechanics in computing. QC has inherently parallel characteristics and is expected to solve some problems faster than classical computing. Several authors agree that QC should be integrated into classical HPC computing. The purpose of this article is to address the challenges of this integration.

TI In-depth Correlation Power Analysis Attacks on a Hardware Implementation
   of CRYSTALS-Dilithium
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB During the standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography, NIST encourages research on side-channel analysis for candidate schemes. As the recommended lattice signature scheme, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, when implemented on hardware, has seen limited research on side-channel analysis, and current attacks are incomplete or requires a substantial quantity of traces. Therefore, we conducted a more complete analysis to investigate the leakage of an FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium using the Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) method, where with a minimum of 70,000 traces partial private key coefficients can be recovered. Furthermore, we optimise the attack by extracting Point-of-Interests using known information due to parallelism (named CPA-PoI) and by iteratively utilising parallel leakages (named CPA-ITR). Our experimental results show that CPA-PoI reduces the number of traces by up to 16.67%, CPA-ITR by up to 25%, and both increase the number of recovered key coefficients by up to 55.17% and 93.10% using the same number of traces. They outperfom the CPA method. As a result, it suggests that the FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium is more vulnerable than thought before to side-channel analysis.

TI Quasi-Degenerate Resonant Eigenstate Doublets of Two Quantum Emitters in
   a Closed Waveguide
SO PHOTONICS
AB The physics of systems of quantum emitters in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is significantly influenced by the relation between their spatial separation and the wavelength of the emitted photons. If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific resonance conditions, the photon amplitudes produced from decay may destructively interfere. In an infinite-waveguide setting, this effect gives rise to bound states in the continuum, where a photon remains confined between the emitters. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with periodic boundary conditions, there exist two such relevant distances for a given arrangement of the quantum emitters, leading to states in which a photon is confined to either the shorter or the longer path that connects the emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number, these two kinds of resonant eigenstates are allowed to co-exist for the same Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide mode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a single excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the doublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum. The identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to manipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in specific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology tasks.

TI Implementing Grover's on AES-based AEAD schemes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Extensive research is currently underway to determine the security of existing ciphers in light of the advancements in quantum computing. Against symmetric key cryptography, Grover's search algorithm is a prominent attack, capable of reducing search costs to the square root. For using Grover's algorithm, it is imperative to embed the target cipher into a quantum circuit. Even so, this area of research is relatively new; it has garnered significant attention from the research community. In this study, we provide the first estimation of the cost of Grover's key search attack against the AES-based AEAD schemes Rocca-S, AEGIS-128, and Tiaoxin-346. Our analysis considers circuit depth restrictions specified in NIST's PQC standardization process. Considering NIST's maximum depth constraints, We present the overall cost of these attacks using gate count and depth-times-width metrics. We observed that for MAXDEPTH=240\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textsf{MAXDEPTH} = 2<^>{40}$$\end{document}, Rocca-S, AEGIS-128, and Tiaoxin-346 can be retrieved using Grover's search algorithm with gate count of 1.09 x 2253, 1.14 x 2124, and 1.22 x 2124 respectively. Concerning the current updated values by NIST, these ciphers are secure in terms of the cost of implementing Grover's attack for key recovery. The quantum circuits of these ciphers are implemented using QISKIT, an open-source software development kit (SDK) designed for working with quantum computers running on the IBM Quantum Experience platform.

TI Localized Quantum Chemistry on Quantum Computers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum chemistry calculations of large, strongly correlated systems are typically limited by the computation cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system. Quantum algorithms, designed specifically for quantum computers, can alleviate this, but the resources required are still too large for today's quantum devices. Here, we present a quantum algorithm that combines a localization of multireference wave functions of chemical systems with quantum phase estimation (QPE) and variational unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) to compute their ground-state energy. Our algorithm, termed "local active space unitary coupled cluster" (LAS-UCC), scales linearly with the system size for certain geometries, providing a polynomial reduction in the total number of gates compared with QPE, while providing accuracy above that of the variational quantum eigensolver using the UCCSD ansatz and also above that of the classical local active space self-consistent field. The accuracy of LAS-UCC is demonstrated by dissociating (H2)2 into two H2 molecules and by breaking the two double bonds in trans-butadiene, and resource estimates are provided for linear chains of up to 20 H2 molecules.

TI Quantum hash function based on controlled alternate lively quantum walks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum hash function is an important area of interest in the field of quantum cryptography. Quantum hash function based on controlled alternate quantum walk is a mainstream branch of quantum hash functions by virtue of high efficiency and flexibility. In recent development of this kind of schemes, evolution operators determined by an input message depend on not only coin operators, but also direction-determine transforms, which usually are hard to extend. Moreover, the existing works ignore the fact that improper choice of initial parameters may cause some periodic quantum walks, and further collisions. In this paper, we propose a new quantum hash function scheme based on controlled alternate lively quantum walks with variable hash size and provide the selection criteria for coin operators. Specifically, each bit of an input message determines the magnitude of an additional long-range hop for the lively quantum walks. Statistical analysis results show excellent performance in the aspect of collision resistance, message sensitivity, diffusion and confusion property, and uniform distribution property. Our study demonstrates that a fixed coin operator, along with different shift operators, can effectively work on the design of a quantum hash function based on controlled alternate quantum walks, and shed new light on this field of quantum cryptography.

TI Covariant quantum kernels for data with group structure
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The use of kernel functions is a common technique to extract important features from datasets. A quantum computer can be used to estimate kernel entries as transition amplitudes of unitary circuits. Quantum kernels exist that, subject to computational hardness assumptions, cannot be computed classically. The learning problems for these cases are constructed artificially and it is an important challenge to find quantum kernels that have the potential to be relevant for real-world data. Here we identify a suitable class of learning problems on data that have a group structure, which are amenable to kernel methods. We introduce a family of quantum kernels that can be applied to such data, generalizing from a kernel that is known to have a quantum-classical separation when solving a particular set of problems. We use 27 qubits of a superconducting processor to demonstrate our method with a learning problem that embodies the structure of many essential learning problems on groups.
   The kernel method in machine learning can be implemented on near-term quantum computers. A 27-qubit device has now been used to solve learning problems using kernels that have the potential to be practically useful.

TI An efficient modeling workflow for high-performance nanowire
   single-photon avalanche detector
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Single-photon detector (SPD), an essential building block of the quantum communication system, plays a fundamental role in developing next-generation quantum technologies. In this work, we propose an efficient modeling workflow of nanowire SPDs utilizing avalanche breakdown at reverse-biased conditions. The proposed workflow is explored to maximize computational efficiency and balance time-consuming drift-diffusion simulation with fast script-based post-processing. Without excessive computational effort, we could predict a suite of key device performance metrics, including breakdown voltage, dark/light avalanche built-up time, photon detection efficiency, dark count rate, and the deterministic part of timing jitter due to device structures. Implementing the proposed workflow onto a single InP nanowire and comparing it to the extensively studied planar devices and superconducting nanowire SPDs, we showed the great potential of nanowire avalanche SPD to outperform their planar counterparts and obtain as superior performance as superconducting nanowires, i.e. achieve a high photon detection efficiency of 70% with a dark count rate less than 20 Hz at non-cryogenic temperature. The proposed workflow is not limited to single-nanowire or nanowire-based device modeling and can be readily extended to more complicated two-/three dimensional structures.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing imaginary-time
   correlation functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantitative descriptions of strongly correlated materials pose a considerable challenge in condensed matter physics and chemistry. A promising approach to address this problem is quantum embedding methods. In particular, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the original system to an effective quantum impurity model comprising correlated orbitals embedded in an electron bath. The biggest bottleneck in DMFT calculations is numerically solving the quantum impurity model, i.e., computing the Green's function. Past studies have proposed theoretical methods to compute the Green's function of a quantum impurity model in polynomial time using a quantum computer. So far, however, efficient methods for computing the imaginary-time Green's functions have not been established despite the advantages of the imaginary-time formulation. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for computing imaginary-time Green's functions on quantum devices with limited hardware resources by applying the variational quantum simulation. Using a quantum circuit simulator, we verified this algorithm by computing Green's functions for a dimer model as well as a four-site impurity model obtained by DMFT calculations of the single-band Hubbard model, although our method can be applied to general imaginary-time correlation functions.

TI How to Fault-Tolerantly Realize Any Quantum Circuit with Local
   Operations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show how to realize a general quantum circuit involving gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits by means of geometrically local quantum operations and efficient classical computation. We prove that circuit-level local stochastic noise modeling an imperfect implementation of our derived schemes is equivalent to local stochastic noise in the original circuit. Our constructions incur a constant-factor increase in the quantum circuit depth and a polynomial overhead in the number of qubits. To execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on n qubits, we give a three-dimensional quantum fault-tolerance architecture involving O(n3/2 log3 n) qubits and a quasi-two-dimensional architecture using O(n2 log3 n) qubits. Applied to recent fault-tolerance constructions, this gives a fault-tolerance-threshold theorem for universal quantum computations with local operations, a polynomial qubit overhead, and a quasipolylogarithmic depth overhead. More generally, our transformation dispenses with the need for considering the locality of operations when designing schemes for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

TI Signature Split Method for a PQC-DSA Compliant with V2V Communication
   Standards
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The development of quantum computing systems poses a great threat to the security of existing public key-based systems. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project in 2015, and currently active research is being conducted to apply PQC to various cryptographic protocols. Unlike elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based schemes, PQC requires a large memory footprint and key/signature size. Therefore, when migrating PQC to a protocol, depending on the PQC and protocol specifications, it can be hard to migrate PQC. In the case of the WAVE protocol, it is difficult to satisfy the accuracy of a specific PQC algorithm because segmentation of the signature occurs during transmission due to the limitation of the maximum packet size. Therefore, in this paper, we present two methodologies that can apply PQC while complying with IEEE 1609.2 standards to the WAVE protocol in the V2V environment. Whereas previous migration studies have focused on designing a hybrid mode of protocols, this paper explores solutions more intuitively at the application layer of protocols. We analyzed two postquantum digital signature algorithms (Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon) and the structure of basic-safety messages (BSMs) of the V2V protocol on the size side. Through this, we propose methods that can perform an independent signature verification process without waiting for all divided signatures in the WAVE protocol. Our methodology overcomes the limitation that schemes with large signature sizes cannot be mounted into the WAVE protocol. We also note that the architecture used as an on-board unit (OBU) in an autonomous driving environment is mainly a microprocessor. We investigated an optimized PQC implementation in the OBU environment and simulated our methodology with the V2Verifier. Finally, we measured the accurate latency through simulation in Jetson Xavier, which is mainly used as an OBU in the V2V communication network.

TI Optimal Overlapping Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Characterizing large-scale quantum systems is central to fundamental physics and essential for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterization requires exponentially increasing resources, focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly simplified analysis. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits of this approach remain elusive. We present protocols for overlapping tomography that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. First, by providing algorithmic approaches based on graph theory we find the minimal number of Pauli settings, relating overlapping tomography to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics. This significantly reduces the number of measurement settings, showing for instance that two-body overlapping tomography of nearest neighbors in qubit systems with planar topologies can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we prove that using general projective measurements, all k-body marginals can be reconstructed with only 3k settings, independently of the system size. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in a six-photon experiment. Our results will find applications in learning noise and interaction patterns in quantum computers as well as characterizing fermionic systems in quantum chemistry.

We show theoretically that by placing another artificial atom in this transmission line to act as a filter, the Purcell decay of the qubit into the transmission line is suppressed. When strong control fields are applied in the transmission line, the filter is saturated and effectively switched off. Such a Purcell filtering capability permits both the control and measurement of the qubit using the single transmission line, while maintaining the long coherence time of the qubit in the absence of the control pulses. We show that high fidelity Pauli sigma x gates on the qubit can be realized using simple pulse shapes. For devices that already use one transmission line both for control and measurement of the qubit, our paper provides a way to completely filter out the qubit frequency without removing the possibility of controlling the system. Further, combining the proposed filter with frequency multiplexing potentially enables both control and measurement of several qubits using a single Purcell-filtered transmission line. This will enhance the scalability of superconducting quantum processors by decreasing the number of the required transmission lines.

TI Laser-Induced Spectral Diffusion and Excited-State Mixing of Silicon T
   Centers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical-resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon color centers have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled individual silicon T centers using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and we show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a factor-of-35 narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical-resource-state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T-center devices for high-performance entanglement generation.

TI Optical Manipulation of Layer-Valley Coherence via Strong Exciton-Photon
   Coupling in Microcavities
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Coherent control and manipulation of quantum degrees of freedom such as spins forms the basis of emerging quantum technologies. In this context, the robust valley degree of freedom and the associated valley pseudospin found in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is a highly attractive platform. Valley polarization and coherent superposition of valley states have been observed in these systems even up to room temperature. Control of valley coherence is an important building block for the implementation of valley qubit. Large magnetic fields or high-power lasers have been used in the past to demonstrate the control (initialization and rotation) of the valley coherent states. Here, the control of layer-valley coherence via strong coupling of valley excitons in bilayer WS2 to microcavity photons is demonstrated by exploiting the pseudomagnetic field arising in optical cavities owing to the transverse electric-transverse magnetic (TE-TM)mode splitting. The use of photonic structures to generate pseudomagnetic fields which can be used to manipulate exciton-polaritons presents an attractive approach to control optical responses without the need for large magnets or high-intensity optical pump powers.

TI Cavity-mediated collective emission from steady-state subradiance
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cooperative effects such as super(or sub)radiance in quantum systems arise from the interplay among quantum emitters. While bright superradiant states have been extensively studied and have yielded important insights into cooperative phenomena, subradiant states remain less explored due to their inherently dark state nature. However, subradiance holds significant potential as a valuable quantum resource exploiting long-lived and large-scale entanglement, which is a key for advancing quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate strong collective emission from a cavity-mediated steady-state subradiant state. In a tailored photonic environment with balanced cavity dissipation, emitter-field coupling strength, and incoherent pumping, two quantum dots coupled to a low-Q cavity exhibit a steady-state population in a subradiant state with a highly negative cooperativity parameter among the emitters. As a key signature of steady-state subradiance, the system shows strong photon bunching (g((2))(0)>8) and suppressed single-photon decay (36 ns). Furthermore, we investigate that such collective interactions can be manipulated by controlling various system parameters, such as detuning and dephasing, supported by numerical simulations. Our approach to inducing cavity-mediated subradiance paves the way for generating and harnessing quantum correlations among quantum emitters via controlled dissipation.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox with position-momentum entangled
   macroscopic twin beams
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Spatial entanglement is at the heart of quantum enhanced imaging applications and high-dimensional quantum information protocols. In particular, for imaging and sensing applications, quantum states with a macroscopic number of photons are needed to provide a real advantage over the classical state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in its original position and momentum form with bright twin beams of light by showing the presence of EPR spatial (position-momentum) entanglement. An electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device camera is used to record images of the bright twin beams in the near and far field regimes to achieve an apparent violation of the uncertainty principle by more than an order of magnitude, which remains statistically significant even in the limit of a small number of images. We further show that the presence of quantum correlations in the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom leads to spatial squeezing of the bright twin beams in both the near and far fields. This provides another verification of the spatial entanglement and points to the presence of hyperentanglement in the bright twin beams.

TI Geometric quantum adiabatic methods for quantum chemistry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum algorithms have been successfully applied in quantum chemistry to obtain the ground-state energy of small molecules. Although accurate near the equilibrium geometry, the results can become unreliable when the chemical bonds are broken at large distances. For any adiabatic approach, this is usually caused by serious issues, such as energy gap closing or level crossing along the adiabatic evolution path. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm based on adiabatic evolution to obtain molecular eigenstates and eigenenergies in quantum chemistry, which exploits a smooth geometric deformation by continuously varying bond lengths and bond angles. We demonstrate its utility in several examples on a noiseless quantum simulator, including H2O, CH2, and a chemical reaction of H-2+D-2 -> 2HD, by uniformly stretching chemical bonds. We find that this new algorithm solves the problems related to energy gap closing and level crossing along the adiabatic evolution path at large atomic distances. The new method performs more stably and achieves better accuracy than our previous adiabatic method [Yu and Wei, Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013104 (2021)]. Furthermore, our fidelity analysis demonstrates that even with finite bond length changes, our algorithm still achieves high fidelity for the ground state.

TI Entanglement entropy as an order parameter for strongly coupled nodal
   line semimetals
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Topological semimetals are a class of many-body systems exhibiting novel macroscopic quantum phenomena at the interplay between high energy and condensed matter physics. They display a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) which evades the standard Landau paradigm. In the case of Weyl semimetals, the anomalous Hall effect is a good non-local order parameter for the TQPT, as it is proportional to the separation between the Weyl nodes in momentum space. On the contrary, for nodal line semimetals (NLSM), the quest for an order parameter is still open. By taking advantage of a recently proposed holographic model for strongly-coupled NLSM, we explicitly show that entanglement entropy (EE) provides an optimal probe for nodal topology. We propose a generalized c-function, constructed from the EE, as an order parameter for the TQPT. Moreover, we find that the derivative of the renormalized EE with respect to the external coupling driving the TQPT diverges at the critical point, signaling the rise of non-local quantum correlations. Finally, we show that these quantum information quantities are able to characterize not only the critical point but also features of the quantum critical region at finite temperature.

TI A Cost-Efficient Approach towards Computational Fluid Dynamics
   Simulations on Quantum Devices
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Numerical simulations of physical systems are found in many industries, as they currently play a crucial role in product development. There are many numerical methods for solving differential equations that describe the underlying physics behind the mathematical models in the simulation, among which, the finite element method (FEM) is one of the most commonly used. Although in many applications the FEM seems to provide an acceptable solution to the problem, there are still many complex real-life processes that can be challenging to simulate numerically due to their complexity and large size. Recently, there has been a shift in research towards efficiently applying quantum algorithms in finite element analysis (FEA), as the potential and speedup that they could offer have been shown, but little to no effort has been made towards the applicability and cost efficiency of these algorithms in real-world quantum devices. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient method for applying quantum algorithms in FEA for industrial problems post-processed by classical algorithms in order to address the limitations of available quantum hardware and their cost when accessing them through different cloud-based services. We carry this out by approximating the solution of the initially large system with a suitable quantum algorithm and using the obtained solutions to generate a set of reduced-order models (ROMs) that are much smaller in complexity and size than the original model. This allows the simulation of the original model with different parameter sets and excitations to be run efficiently on classical computers without having the need to access quantum subroutines again. This way, we have reduced the usage of quantum hardware (and thus the development cost) while still taking advantage of its quantum speedup.

TI Intrinsic decoherence effects on measurement-induced nonlocality
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB By considering an exactly solvable model of a two interacting spin-1/2 qubits described by the Heisenberg anisotropic interaction in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, we study the dynamics of entanglement quantified by the concurrence and measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) based on Hilbert-Schmidt norm and trace distance with different initial conditions. We highlight the relationship between the entanglement and MIN for the pure initial state. For an initial separable state, it is found that the robustness and the generation of the quantum correlations depend on the physical parameters. While considering the entangled state as an initial state, the results show that despite the phase decoherence, all the correlations reach their steady state values after exhibiting some oscillations. We reveal that the enhancement of correlations may occur by adjusting the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the intervention of the magnetic field decrease the quantum correlations. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations captured by MIN in the unentangled state.

TI Quantum homogenization as a quantum steady-state protocol on noisy
   intermediate-scale quantum hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum homogenization is a reservoir-based quantum state approximation protocol, which has been successfully implemented in state transformation on quantum hardware. In this work we move beyond that and propose the homogenization as a novel platform for quantum state stabilization and information protection. Using the Heisenberg exchange interactions formalism, we extend the standard quantum homogenization protocol to the dynamically equivalent (swap)alpha formulation. We then demonstrate its applicability on the available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors by presenting a shallow quantum circuit implementation consisting of a sequence of CNOT and single-qubit gates. In light of this, we employ the Beny-Oreshkov generalization of the Knill-Laflamme (KL) conditions for near-optimal recovery channels to show that our proposed (swap)alpha quantum homogenization protocol yields a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map under which the code subspace is correctable. Therefore, the protocol protects quantum information contained in a subsystem of the reservoir Hilbert space under CPTP dynamics.

TI Quantum characteristics of a nondegenerate three-level laser with NDPA
   pumped by electron bombardment
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB This study investigates the entanglement and squeezing characteristics of light generated by a non-degenerate, three-level laser with a non-degenerate parametric amplifier, which is pumped by electron bombardment to the top level and coupled to a two-mode vacuum reservoir through a single-port mirror. By normal ordering the noise operators, we simplified the calculations and derived the evolution equations for the atomic operators using the master equation. From the steady-state solutions, we determined the average of the photon number, the quadrature variance of radiation, entanglement, the normalized second-order correlation of the cavity radiation, and fluctuations in intensity difference. Our findings indicate that higher spontaneous emission rates significantly decrease the average photon number, while the amplitude of the pumping mode interacting with the parametric amplifier (epsilon) increases it. Enhanced squeezing is observed with increasing (epsilon), reaching a peak at epsilon = 0.02 (78.5%). Moreover, spontaneous emission enhances squeezing for some interval of ra. A direct correlation between quadrature squeezing and entanglement is found, with greater quadrature squeezing associated with increased entanglement. This research offers potential advancements in quantum technologies, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, where controlled squeezing and entanglement are crucial for improving performance.

TI Valley population of donor states in highly strained silicon
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Strain is extensively used to controllably tailor the electronic properties of materials. In the context of indirect band-gap semiconductors such as silicon, strain lifts the valley degeneracy of the six conduction band minima, and by extension the valley states of electrons bound to phosphorus donors. Here, single phosphorus atoms are embedded in an engineered thin layer of silicon strained to 0.8% and their wave function imaged using spatially resolved spectroscopy. A prevalence of the out-of-plane valleys is confirmed from the real-space images, and a combination of theoretical modelling tools is used to assess how this valley repopulation effect can yield isotropic exchange and tunnel interactions in the xy-plane relevant for atomically precise donor qubit devices. Finally, the residual presence of in-plane valleys is evidenced by a Fourier analysis of both experimental and theoretical images, and atomistic calculations highlight the importance of higher orbital excited states to obtain a precise relationship between valley population and strain. Controlling the valley degree of freedom in engineered strained epilayers provides a new competitive asset for the development of donor-based quantum technologies in silicon.

AB In the quest of large-scale quantum computers, multi-core distributed architectures are considered a compelling alternative to be explored. A crucial aspect in such approach is the stringent demand on communication among cores when qubits need to interact, which conditions the scalability potential of these architectures. In this work, we address the question of how the cost of the communication among cores impacts on the viability of the quantum multi-core approach. Methodologically, we consider a design space in which architectural variables (number of cores, number of qubits per core), application variables for several quantum benchmarks (number of qubits, number of gates, percentage of two-qubit gates) and inter-core communication latency are swept along with the definition of a figure of merit. This approach yields both a qualitative understanding of trends in the design space and companion dimensioning guidelines for the architecture, including optimal points, as well as quantitative answers to the question of beyond which communication performance levels the multi-core architecture pays off. Our results allow to determine the thresholds for inter-core communication latency in order for multi-core architectures to outperform single-core quantum processors.

SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial in quantum communication and information processing. In 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), SPEs are realized through inhomogeneous strain, while in combination with 2D magnets, a high spontaneous out-of-plane magnetization can be induced due to proximity effects. Here, an alternative is proposed that consists of suspending a TMD monolayer (WSe2) on a few-layer antiferromagnet (CrSBr) with in-plane magnetic ordering. The resulting heterostructure exhibits localization centers at lower energies than expected. Among them, a bright SPE with a high degree of polarization selection is identified. This suffers a clear energy shift driven by an in-plane magnetic field, and interestingly, this shift is correlated with the metamagnetic transition of CrSBr, suggesting a new kind of proximity-type effect. Unlike regular SPEs in WSe2 (sensitive to out-of-plane magnetic fields), our SPE demonstrates sensitivity to both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. The added tunability at significantly lower fields offers a promising direction for developing magnetically responsive quantum emitters, paving the way for more practical applications in quantum technologies.

TI Quantum surface effects on quantum emitters coupled to surface plasmon
   polariton
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB As an ideal platform for exploring strong quantized light-matter interactions, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has inspired many applications in quantum technologies. Recent experiments discovered that quantum surface effects (QSEs) of the metal, including nonlocal optical response, electron spill-out, and Landau damping, invalidate the classical electromagnetic theory and contribute additional loss sources to the SPP in the nanoscale. This hinders its applications. Going beyond the widely used classical local response approximation, we use the Feibelman d-parameter method to investigate the QSE-modified non-Markovian dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to a SPP in a planar metal-dielectric nanostructure. A mechanism to overcome the dissipation of the QEs caused by the lossy SPP with the QSEs is discovered. We find that, as long as the QE-SPP bound states are formed, a dissipationless entanglement among the far-separated QEs is created. Compared with the local-response approximate results, the QSEs play a constructive role in establishing such a coherent correlation. The result lays foundation for understanding the light-matter interactions in absorptive media and paves the way for the application of SPP in quantum network.

TI What exactly does Bekenstein bound?
SO QUANTUM
AB The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the Unruh channel that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of zero-bits, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.

AB Aquila, an analog quantum simulation platform developed by QuEra Computing, supports control of the position and coherent evolution of up to 256 neutral atoms. This study details novel experimental protocols designed for analog quantum simulators that generate Bell state entanglement far away from the blockade regime, construct a Z(2) state with a defect induced by an ancilla, and optimize the driving fields schedule to prepare excited states with enhanced fidelity. We additionally evaluate the effectiveness of readout error mitigation techniques in improving the fidelity of measurement results. All experiments were executed on Aquila from QuEra and facilitated by the AWS Braket interface. Our experimental results closely align with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The insights gained from this study showcase Aquila's capabilities in handling complex quantum simulations and computations, and also pave the way for new avenues of research in quantum information processing and physics that employ programmable analog hardware platforms.

TI Single-Shot Spin Readout in Graphene Quantum Dots
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Electrostatically defined quantum dots in bilayer graphene offer a promising platform for spin qubits with presumably long coherence times due to low spin-orbit coupling and low nuclear spin density. We demonstrate two different experimental approaches to measure the decay times of excited states. The first is based on direct current measurements through the quantum device. Pulse sequences are applied to control the occupation of ground and excited states. We observe a lower bound for the excited state decay on the order of a hundred microseconds. The second approach employs a capacitively coupled charge sensor to study the time dynamics of the excited state using the Elzerman technique. We perform single-shot readout of our two-level system with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 7 and find relaxation times up to 50 ms for the spin-excited state, with a strong magnetic field dependence, promising even higher values for smaller magnetic fields. This is an important step for developing a quantum-information processor in graphene.

TI Dynamic spin-polarization control of terahertz waves in magnetized
   plasmas
SO MATTER AND RADIATION AT EXTREMES
AB Controlling terahertz (THz) polarization with high stability and tunability is essential for achieving further progress in ultrafast spectroscopy, structured-light manipulation, and quantum information processing. Here, we propose a magnetized plasma platform for dynamic THz polarization control by exploiting the intrinsic birefringence between extraordinary and ordinary modes. We identify a strong-magnetization, zero-group-velocity-mismatch regime where the two modes share matched group velocities while retaining finite phase birefringence, enabling robust, phase-stable spin angular momentum control. By tuning the plasma length and magnetic field, we realize programmable phase retardation and demonstrate universal single-qubit gates through parameterized unitary operations. Full-wave particle-in-cell simulations validate high-fidelity polarization transformations across the Poincar & eacute; sphere and demonstrate the potential for generating structured vector beams under spatially varying magnetic fields. The platform offers ultrafast response, resilience to extreme THz intensities, and in situ tunability, positioning magnetized plasmas as a versatile and damage-resilient medium for next-generation THz polarization control and structured-wave applications.

TI Designs via Free Probability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Unitary designs have become a vital tool for investigating pseudorandomness, since they approximate the statistics of the uniform Haar ensemble. Despite their central role in quantum information, their relations to quantum chaotic evolution and, in particular, to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and k designs through free probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of k-freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful, for instance, for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called k-fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity and, correspondingly, ETH apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos, and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.

TI Heterogeneous multipartite entanglement purification for
   size-constrained quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The entanglement resource required for quantum information processing comes in a variety of forms, from Bell states to multipartite GHZ states or cluster states. Purifying these resources after their imperfect generation is an indispensable step towards using them in quantum architectures. While this challenge, both in the case of Bell pairs and more general multipartite entangled states, is mostly overcome in the presence of perfect local quantum hardware with unconstrained qubit register sizes, devising optimal purification strategies for finite-size realistic noisy hardware has remained elusive. Here we depart from the typical purification paradigm for multipartite states explored in the last 20 years. We present cases where the hardware limitations are taken into account and, surprisingly, find that smaller "sacrificial" states, such as Bell pairs, can be more useful in the purification of multipartite states than additional copies of these same states. This drastically simplifies the requirements and presents a fundamentally different pathway to leverage near-term networked quantum hardware.

TI Experimental realization of classical Z2 spin liquids in a
   programmable quantum device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We build and probe a Z(2) spin liquid in a programmable quantum device, the D-Wave DW-2000Q. Specifically, we observe the classical eight-vertex and six-vertex (spin ice) states and transitions between them. To realize this state of matter, we design a Hamiltonian with combinatorial gauge symmetry using only pairwise-qubit interactions and a transverse field, i.e., interactions which are accessible in this quantum device. The combinatorial gauge symmetry remains exact along the full quantum annealing path, landing the system onto the classical eight-vertex model at the endpoint of the path. The output configurations from the device allow us to directly observe the loop structure of the classical model. Moreover, we deform the Hamiltonian so as to vary the weights of the eight vertices and show that we can selectively attain the classical six-vertex (ice) model, or drive the system into a ferromagnetic state. We present studies of the classical phase diagram of the system as a function of the eight-vertex deformations and effective temperature, which we control by varying the relative strengths of the programmable couplings, and we show that the experimental results are consistent with theoretical analysis. Finally, we identify additional capabilities that, if added to these devices, would allow us to realize Z(2) quantum spin liquids on which to build topological qubits.

TI Accurate holographic light potentials using pixel crosstalk modelling
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Arbitrary light potentials have proven to be a valuable and versatile tool in many quantum information and quantum simulation experiments with ultracold atoms. Using a phase-modulating spatial light modulator (SLM), we generate arbitrary light potentials holographically with measured efficiencies between 15 and 40% and an accuracy of < 2% root-mean-squared error. Key to the high accuracy is the modelling of pixel crosstalk of the SLM on a sub-pixel scale which is relevant especially for large light potentials. We employ conjugate gradient minimisation to calculate the SLM phase pattern for a given target light potential after measuring the intensity and wavefront at the SLM. Further, we use camera feedback to reduce experimental errors, we remove optical vortices and investigate the difference between the angular spectrum method and the Fourier transform to simulate the propagation of light. Using a combination of all these techniques, we achieved more accurate and efficient light potentials compared to previous studies, and generated a series of potentials relevant for cold atom experiments.

TI Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model: universality and ultrastrong
   coupling effects
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Heat transport in a qubit-oscillator junction described by the quantum Rabi model is investigated. Upon variation of temperature, bias on the qubit and the qubit-oscillator coupling strength, a rich variety of effects is identified. For weak coupling to bosonic heat baths, transport is essentially controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling g which defines a Kondo-like temperature TK(g). At temperatures much lower than TK, coherent heat transfer via virtual processes yields a T3 behavior in the linear conductance as a function of T, modulated by a prefactor determined by the junction parameters and unravelling its multilevel nature. In particular, a coherent suppression of the conductance arises in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum. For T greater than or similar to TK, sequential processes dominate heat transfer and a scaling regime is found when quantities are scaled with TK. The conductance as a function of the bias on the qubit undergoes a transition from a resonant behavior at weak qubit-resonator coupling to a broadened, zero-bias peak regime at ultrastrong coupling.

TI The Single-Photon Scattering Properties of Three-Level Giant Atoms under
   the Interaction of Dissipation and Local Coupling
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The coupling of three-level giant atoms with one-dimensional waveguides can show interesting phenomena of transmission and reflection. Since the non-waveguide mode can cause the dissipation of external atoms, we consider the effect of the dissipation rate on the scattering of single photons in the system with giant atom-waveguide coupling. We find that as the dissipation rate of giant atoms increases, the transmission rate of a single photon increases and the reflection rate decreases. In addition, by varying the phase difference and decay rate, the giant atoms are able to achieve perfect transmission and total reflection over the entire frequency range. We also find and show the conditions for the conversion of the optimal frequency. When the cumulative phase of photons reaches a certain value, the system can achieve perfect transmission, which is independent of frequency. This model of coupling giant atoms with waveguides has a promising application in quantum communication and quantum information processing.

AB Two-photon interference is an indispensable resource in quantum photonics, but it is not straightforward to achieve. The cascaded generation of photon pairs contains intrinsic temporal correlations that negatively affect the ability of such sources to perform two-photon interference, thus hindering applications. We report on how such correlation interplays with decoherence and temporal postselection, and under which conditions temporal postselection could improve two-photon interference visibility. Our study identifies crucial parameters and points the way to a source with optimal performance.

TI Quantum advantage in microwave quantum radar
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A central goal of any quantum technology consists in demonstrating an advantage in their performance compared to the best possible classical implementation. A quantum radar improves the detection of a target placed in a noisy environment by exploiting quantum correlations between two modes, probe and idler. The predicted quantum enhancement is not only less sensitive to loss than most quantum metrological applications, but it is also supposed to improve with additional noise. Here we demonstrate a superconducting circuit implementing a microwave quantum radar that can provide more than 20% better performance than any possible classical radar. The scheme involves joint measurement of entangled probe and idler microwave photon states after the probe has been reflected from the target and mixed with thermal noise. By storing the idler state in a resonator, we mitigate the detrimental impact of idler loss on the quantum advantage. Measuring the quantum advantage over a wide range of parameters, we find that the purity of the initial probe-idler entangled state is the main limiting factor and needs to be considered in any practical application.
   Proposals for quantum radars have suggested that in noisy environments there may be a benefit in sensing using quantum microwaves. A superconducting circuit experiment has now confirmed an advantage exists under appropriate conditions.

   Using a novel way of applying recording query methods we show that for many linear algebra problemsincluding matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix multiplication and poweringexisting classical time-space tradeoffs also apply to quantum algorithms with at most a constant factor loss. For example, for almost all fixed matrices A, including the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most T input queries and S qubits of memory require T= Omega(n(2)/S) to compute matrix-vector product Ax for x epsilon {0,1}(n). We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for n x n binary matrices requires T= Omega(n(3) /root S). Because many of our lower bounds are matched by deterministic algorithms with the same time and space complexity, our results show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic advantage for these problems at any space bound.
   We also improve the previous quantum time-space tradeoff lower bounds for nxn Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication from T= Omega(n(2.5)/S-1/2) to T= Omega(n(2.5)/S-1/4) which has optimal exponents for the powerful query algorithms to which it applies. Our method also yields improved lower bounds for classical algorithms.

TI Optimizing a polynomial function on a quantum processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The gradient descent method is central to numerical optimization and is the key ingredient in many machine learning algorithms. It promises to find a local minimum of a function by iteratively moving along the direction of the steepest descent. Since for high-dimensional problems the required computational resources can be prohibitive, it is desirable to investigate quantum versions of the gradient descent, such as the recently proposed (Rebentrost et al.(1)). Here, we develop this protocol and implement it on a quantum processor with limited resources. A prototypical experiment is shown with a four-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor, which demonstrates the iterative optimization process. Experimentally, the final point converged to the local minimum with a fidelity >94%, quantified via full-state tomography. Moreover, our method can be employed to a multidimensional scaling problem, showing the potential to outperform its classical counterparts. Considering the ongoing efforts in quantum information and data science, our work may provide a faster approach to solving high-dimensional optimization problems and a subroutine for future practical quantum computers.

TI Avoiding Leakage and Errors Caused by Unwanted Transitions in Lambda
   Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Three-level A systems appear in various quantum information processing platforms. In several control schemes, the excited level serves as an auxiliary state for implementing gate operations between the lower qubit states. However, extra excited levels give rise to unwanted transitions that cause leakage and other errors, degrading the gate fidelity. We focus on a coherent-population-trapping scheme for gates and design protocols that reduce the effects of the unwanted off-resonant couplings and improve the gate performance up to several orders of magnitude. For a particular setup of unwanted couplings, we find an exact solution, which leads to error-free gate operations via only a static detuning modification. In the general case, we improve gate operations by adding corrective modulations to the pulses, thereby generalizing the derivative removal by adiabatic gates protocol to A systems. Our techniques enable fast and high-fidelity gates and apply to a wide range of optically driven platforms, such as quantum dots, color centers, and trapped ions.

TI Certified randomness using a trapped-ion quantum processor
SO NATURE
AB Although quantum computers can perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the abilities of classical computers1,2, realizing this potential remains a challenge. An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy3. Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations4,5: a client generates quantum 'challenge' circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 x 1018 floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers.

TI Unitarity breaking in self-averaging spectral form factors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The complex Fourier transform of the two-point correlator of the energy spectrum of a quantum system is known as the spectral form factor (SFF). It constitutes an essential diagnostic tool for phases of matter and quantum chaos. In black hole physics, it describes the survival probability (fidelity) of a thermofield double state under unitary time evolution. However, detailed properties of the SFF of isolated quantum systems with generic spectra are smeared out by large temporal fluctuations, whose minimization requires disorder or time averages. This requirement holds for any system size, that is, the SFF is non-self-averaging. Exploiting the fidelity-based interpretation of this quantity, we prove that using filters and disorder and time averages of the SFF involve unitarity breaking, i.e., open quantum dynamics described by a quantum channel that suppresses quantum noise. Specifically, averaging over Hamiltonian ensembles, time averaging, and frequency filters can be described by the class of mixed-unitary quantum channels in which information loss can be recovered. Frequency filters are associated with a time-continuous master equation generalizing energy dephasing. We also discuss the use of eigenvalue filters. They are linked to non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution without quantum jumps, whose long-time behavior is described by a Hamiltonian deformation. We show that frequency and energy filters make the SFF self-averaging at long times

TI Enhanced Extraction Efficiency of Erbium Luminescence in Erbium Oxygen
   Codoped Gallium Arsenide Using One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Quantum communication, memory, and computing show potential as next-generation information technologies. Controllable, stable, and repeatable single-photon emitters for off-chip applications are essential components of quantum information systems. In this study, onedimensional photonic crystals (PhCs), based on Er,O-codoped GaAs (GaAs:Er,O) as the active component, are employed to enhance Er luminescence extraction efficiency, aiming to advance off-chip applications. Numerical simulations of these PhCs demonstrate an enhancement in light extraction efficiency. The two types of PhC cavities, bridge-type and nanobeam PhCs, are fabricated based on the simulation results. For objective lenses with different numerical apertures (NAs), numerical simulations show that both of the bridge-type and nanobeam PhCs enhance the Er luminescence extraction efficiency, which is consistent with the experimental results. Moreover, the bridge-type and nanobeam PhCs exhibited cavity quality factors of approximately 12000 and 7000, respectively, indicating significant potential for enhancing Er luminescence using cavity modes.

TI On optimal cloning and incompatibility
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We investigate the role of symmetric quantum cloning machines (QCMs) in quantifying the mutual incompatibility of quantum observables. Specifically, we identify a cloning-based incompatibility measure whereby the incompatibility of a set of observables maybe quantified in terms of how well a uniform ensemble of their eigenstates can be cloned via a symmetric QCM. We show that this new incompatibility measure Q(c) faithful since it vanishes only for commuting observables. We prove an upper bound for Q(c) for any set of observables in a finite-dimensional system and show that the upper bound is attained if and only if the observables are mutually unbiased. Finally, we use our formalism to obtain the optimal quantum cloner for a pair of qubit observables. Our work marks an important step in formalising the connection between two fundamental concepts in quantum information theory, namely, the no-cloning principle and the existence of incompatible observables in quantum theory.

TI Renormalization and low-energy effective models in cavity and circuit
   quantum electrodynamics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a cornerstone in the study of light-matter interactions within cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). It effectively captures the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode resonator, serving as a foundation for understanding quantum optical phenomena in a great variety of systems. However, this model may produce inaccurate results for large coupling strengths, even in systems with high anharmonicity. Moreover, issues of gauge invariance further undermine its reliability. In this work, we introduce a renormalized QRM that incorporates the effective influence of higher atomic energy levels, providing a significantly more accurate representation of the system while still maintaining a two-level description. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we present two different examples: an atom in a double-well potential and a superconducting artificial atom (fluxonium qubit). This procedure opens new possibilities for precisely engineering and understanding cavity and circuit QED systems, which are highly sought-after, especially for quantum information processing.

TI Magnifying Quantum Phase Fluctuations with Cooper-Pair Pairing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Remarkably, complex assemblies of superconducting wires, electrodes, and Josephson junctions are compactly described by a handful of collective phase degrees of freedom that behave like quantum particles in a potential. Almost all these circuits operate in the regime where quantum phase fluctuations are small- the associated flux is smaller than the superconducting flux quantum-although entering the regime of large fluctuations would have profound implications for metrology and qubit protection. The difficulty arises from the apparent need for circuit impedances vastly exceeding the resistance quantum. Independently, exotic circuit elements that require Cooper pairs to form pairs in order to tunnel have been developed to encode and topologically protect quantum information. In this work, we demonstrate that pairing Cooper pairs magnifies the phase fluctuations of the circuit ground state. We measure a tenfold suppression of flux sensitivity of the first transition energy only, implying a twofold increase in the vacuum phase fluctuations and showing that the ground state is delocalized over several Josephson wells.

TI Agnostic Phase Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotationinducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.

TI Simulating a Chern Insulator with C = ±2 on Synthetic Floquet
   Lattice
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The synthetic Floquet lattice, generated by multiple strong drives with mutually incommensurate frequencies, provides a powerful platform for quantum simulation of topological phenomena. In this study, we propose a 4-band tight-binding model of the Chern insulator with a Chern number C = +/- 2 by coupling two layers of the half Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang lattice and subsequently mapping it onto the Floquet lattice to simulate its topological properties. To determine the Chern number of our Floquet-version model, we extend the energy pumping method proposed by Martin et al. [2017 Phys. Rev. X7 041008] and the topological oscillation method introduced by Boyers et al. [2020 Phys. Rev. Lett.125 160505], followed by numerical simulations for both methodologies. The simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of the Chern number using either of these methods, providing an excellent prediction of the phase diagram that closely aligns with the theoretical one derived from the original bilayer half Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Finally, we briefly discuss a potential experimental implementation for our model. Our work demonstrates significant potential for simulating complex topological matter using quantum computing platforms, thereby paving the way for constructing a more universal simulator for non-interacting topological quantum states and advancing our understanding of these intriguing phenomena.

TI Measurement of Enhanced Spin-Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor-Bound
   Electron Spins in Silicon
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin-orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on-chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin-orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi-donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two-donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all-electrical control of donor-bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).
   A significant enhancement in spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within multi-donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 mu eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all-electrical control of donor-bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing. image

TI High-speed detection of 1550 nm single photons with superconducting
   nanowire detectors
SO OPTICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are a key technology for quantum information and science due to their high efficiency, low timing jitter, and low dark counts. In this work, we present a detector for single 1550 nm photons with up to 78% detection efficiency, timing jitter below 50 ps FWHM, 158 counts/s dark count rate, as well as a maximum count rate of 1.5 giga-counts/s at 3 dB compression. The PEACOQ detector (Performance-Enhanced Array for Counting Optical Quanta) comprises a linear array of 32 straight superconducting niobium nitride nanowires that span the mode of an optical fiber. This design supports high count rates with minimal penalties for detection efficiency and timing jitter. We show how these trade-offs can be mitigated by implementing independent readout for each nanowire and by using a temporal walk correction technique to reduce count-rate dependent timing jitter. These detectors make quantum communication practical on a 10 GHz clock.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB In this article, a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) version of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) public-key encryption and key-establishment standard is constructed. We mainly focused on how the PAKE version of PQC standard Kyber with mobile compatibility can be obtained by using simple structured password components. In the design process, the conventional password-based authenticated key exchange (PAK) approach is updated under the module learning with errors (MLWE) assumptions to add passwordbased authentication. Thanks to the following PAK model, the proposed Kyber.PAKE provides explicit authentication and perfect forward secrecy (PFS). The resistance analysis against the password dictionary attack of Kyber.PAKE is examined by using random oracle model (ROM) assumptions. In the security analysis, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) Zipf (CDF-Zipf) model is also followed to provide realistic security examinations. According to the implementation results, Kyber.PAKE presents better run-time than lattice-based PAKE schemes with similar features, even if it contains complex key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) components. The comparison results show that the proposed PAKE scheme will come to the fore for the future security of mobile environments and other areas.

TI On McEliece-Type Cryptosystems Using Self-Dual Codes With Large Minimum
   Weight
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB One of the Round 3 Finalists in the NIST post-quantum cryptography call is the Classic McEliece cryptosystem. Although it is one of the most secure cryptosystems, the large size of its public key remains a practical limitation. In this work, we propose a McEliece-type cryptosystem using large minimum distance error-correcting codes derived from self-dual codes. To the best of our knowledge, such codes have not been implemented in a code-based cryptosystem until now. Moreover, we modify the decryption step of the system by introducing a decryption algorithm based on two private keys. We determine the parameters of binary codes with large minimum distance, which, if implemented into a McEliece-type cryptosystem, would provide a security level respectively of 80, 128, and 256 bits. For the 80-bit security case, we construct a large minimum distance self-dual code of length 1064, and use it to derive a random punctured code to be used in the corresponding McEliece-type cryptosystem. Compared to the original McEliece cryptosystem, the key size is reduced by about 38.5%, although an optimal decoding set is yet to be constructed to make the new system fully defined and usable.

TI The role of coherence theory in attractor quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate attractor quantum neural networks (aQNNs) within the framework of coherence theory. We show that: i) aQNNs are associated to non-coherence-generating quantum channels; ii) the depth of the network is given by the decohering power of the corresponding quantum map; and iii) the attractor associated to an arbitrary input state is the one minimizing their relative entropy. Further, we examine faulty aQNNs described by noisy quantum channels, derive their physical implementation and analyze under which conditions their performance can be enhanced by using entanglement or coherence as external resources.

TI Encoding Genetic and Structural Information in DNA Using Electric Field
   Gradients and Nuclear Spins
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Nuclear electric resonance (NER) offers a method of controlling nuclear spins using electric field gradients (EFGs), which is a critical concept in quantum computing. In this study, we focus on nitrogen atoms in DNA, which have a nuclear spin of 1 and are influenced by EFGs. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemical computations, and theoretical analyses, we studied the characteristics of EFGs in the context of DNA. Our results show that the orientation patterns of the EFGs at the positions of nitrogen atoms in DNA bases vary with different types of bases and nitrogen atom sites. Consequently, the genetic and structural information of DNA is encoded into the direction of the nitrogen nuclear spins. Furthermore, the interaction and evolution of these nitrogen nuclear spins with surrounding nuclear spins suggest the potential for quantum computing of genetic information. Our findings not only provide new insights into quantum phenomena in biological systems but also lay the groundwork for expanding the theoretical foundations of DNA quantum computing and offer innovative approaches for the design of future biocompatible quantum computers.

TI Improved clinical data imputation via classical and quantum
   determinantal point processes
SO ELIFE
AB Imputing data is a critical issue for machine learning practitioners, including in the life sciences domain, where missing clinical data is a typical situation and the reliability of the imputation is of great importance. Currently, there is no canonical approach for imputation of clinical data and widely used algorithms introduce variance in the downstream classification. Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes (DPP) that enhance popular techniques such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations and MissForest. Their advantages are twofold: improving the quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the downstream classification and providing deterministic and reliable imputations that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations on synthetic and real clinical data. We also perform quantum hardware experiments by applying the quantum circuits for DPP sampling since such quantum algorithms provide a computational advantage with respect to classical ones. We demonstrate competitive results with up to 10 qubits for small-scale imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor. Our classical and quantum methods improve the effectiveness and robustness of clinical data prediction modeling by providing better and more reliable data imputations. These improvements can add significant value in settings demanding high precision, such as in pharmaceutical drug trials where our approach can provide higher confidence in the predictions made.

TI Global restrictions under local state discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate how local distinguishability can restrict global properties of states shared between two parties. We begin exploring how nonlocality becomes limited by local state discrimination and observe a nontrivial tradeoff between Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation and success probability of local discrimination. We extend our findings to bounding the maximally entangled state fidelity and global observables such as the energy. Our results show that local state discrimination can become a powerful tool to limit global behaviors, e.g., from entangled adversaries in quantum cryptography.

TI Purcell Enhancement of a Cavity-Coupled Emitter in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO SMALL
AB Integration of solid-state quantum emitters into nanophotonic circuits is a critical step towards fully on-chip quantum photonic-based technologies. Among potential materials platforms, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a viable candidate over the last years. While the fundamental physical properties have been intensively studied, only a few works have focused on the emitter integration into photonic resonators. Yet, for a potential quantum photonic material platform, the integration with nanophotonic cavities is an important cornerstone, as it enables the deliberate tuning of the spontaneous emission and the improved readout of distinct transitions for a quantum emitter. In this work, the resonant tuning of a monolithic cavity integrated hBN quantum emitter is demonstrated through gas condensation at cryogenic temperature. In resonance, an emission enhancement and lifetime reduction are observed, with an estimate for the Purcell factor of approximate to 15.

TI Experimental realization of strong coupling between a cold atomic
   ensemble and an optical fiber microcavity
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB The cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system is a promising platform for quantum optics and quantum information experiments. Its core is the strong coupling between atoms and optical cavity, which causes difficulty in the overlap between the atoms and the antinode of optical cavity mode. Here, we use a programmable movable optical dipole trap to load a cold atomic ensemble into an optical fiber microcavity and realize the strong coupling between the atoms and the optical cavity in which the coupling strength can be improved by polarization gradient cooling and adiabatic loading. By the measurement of vacuum Rabi splitting, the coupling strength can be as high as gN = 2 pi x 400 MHz, which means the effective atom number is Neff = 16 and the collective cooperativity is CN = 1466. These results show that this experimental system can be used for cold atomic ensemble and cold molecule based cavity QED research.

TI Metasurface holographic optical traps for ultracold atoms
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We propose metasurface holograms as a novel platform to generate optical trap arrays for cold atoms with high quality, efficiency, and thermal stability. We developed design and fabrication methods to create dielectric, phase-only metasurface holograms based on titanium dioxide. We experimentally demonstrated optical trap arrays of various geometries, including periodic and aperiodic configurations with dimensions ranging from 1D to 3D and up to a few hundred trap sites. We characterized the performance of the holographic metasurfaces in terms of the positioning accuracy, size and intensity uniformity of the generated traps, and power handling capability of the dielectric metasurfaces. Our proposed platform has great potential for enabling fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics, and quantum simulation and computation tasks. The compact form factor, passive nature, good power handling capability, and scalability of generating high-quality, large-scale arrays also make the metasurface platform uniquely suitable for realizing field-deployable devices and systems based on cold atoms.

TI Squeezing-induced nonreciprocal photon blockade in an optomechanical
   microresonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to generate nonreciprocal photon blockade in a stationary whispering gallery microresonator system based on two physical mechanisms. One of the two mechanisms is inspired by recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083604 (2022)], where the quantum squeezing caused by parametric interaction not only shifts the optical frequency of propagating mode but also enhances its optomechanical coupling, resulting in a nonreciprocal conventional photon blockade phenomenon. On the other hand, we also give another mechanism to generate stronger nonreciprocity of photon correlation according to the destructive quantum interference. Comparing these two strategies, the required nonlinear strength of parametric interaction in the second one is smaller, and the broadband squeezed vacuum field used to eliminate thermalization noise is no longer needed. All analyses and optimal parameter relations are further verified by numerically simulating the quantum master equation. Our proposed scheme opens a new avenue for achieving the nonreciprocal single photon source without stringent requirements, which may have critical applications in quantum communication, quantum information processing, and topological photonics.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Shaping single photons through multimode optical fibers using mechanical
   perturbations
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Multimode optical fibers support low-loss transmission of multiple spatial modes, allowing for the transport of high-dimensional, spatially encoded information. In particular, encoding quantum information in the transverse shape of photons may boost the capacity of quantum channels while using existing infrastructure. However, when photons propagate through a multimode fiber, their transverse shape gets scrambled because of mode mixing and modal interference. This is usually corrected using free-space spatial light modulators, inhibiting a robust all-fiber operation. In this work, we demonstrate an all-fiber approach for controlling the shape of single photons and the spatial correlations between entangled photon pairs, using carefully controlled mechanical perturbations of the fiber. We optimize these perturbations to localize the spatial distribution of a single photon or the spatial correlations of photon pairs in a single spot, enhancing the signal in the optimized spot by over an order of magnitude. Using the same approach, we show a similar enhancement for coupling light from a multimode fiber into a single-mode fiber. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Quantum Principal Component Analysis Only Achieves an Exponential
   Speedup Because of Its State Preparation Assumptions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A central roadblock to analyzing quantum algorithms on quantum states is the lack of a comparable input model for classical algorithms. Inspired by recent work of the author [E. Tang, STOC 2019.], we introduce such a model, where we assume we can efficiently perform l(2)-norm samples of input data, a natural analog to quantum algorithms that assume efficient state preparation of classical data. Though this model produces less practical algorithms than the (stronger) standard model of classical computation, it captures versions of many of the features and nuances of quantum linear algebra algorithms. With this model, we describe classical analogs to Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost's quantum algorithms for principal component analysis [S. Lloyd, M. Mohseni, and P. Rebentrost, Nat. Phys. 10, 631 (2014).] and nearest-centroid clustering [S. Lloyd, M. Mohseni, and P. Rebentrost, Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning]. Since they are only polynomially slower, these algorithms suggest that the exponential speedups of their quantum counterparts are simply an artifact of state preparation assumptions.

TI Accelerating Parameter Initialization in Quantum Chemical Simulations
   via LSTM-FC-VQE
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading algorithm for quantum chemistry on near-term devices, but its performance is often limited by inefficient parameter initialization, which leads to slow convergence and high computational overhead. While meta-learning approaches such as LSTM-VQE have been proposed to predict optimization trajectories, their applicability remains restricted by rigid ansatz structures and molecule-specific parameter dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose LSTM-FC-VQE, an enhanced meta-learning framework that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a fully connected projection layer. This design enables the model to standardize variable-length parameter inputs, allowing it to handle molecular systems with heterogeneous qubit counts and ansatz architectures more effectively. We validate our approach on benchmark molecules, including H4 and H2O, and demonstrate that LSTM-FC-VQE significantly reduces the number of VQE iterations required for convergence while achieving energy accuracies comparable to full configuration interaction (FCI) results. Beyond accelerating convergence, our method generalizes to unseen molecular configurations with minimal training data, offering a scalable and data-efficient strategy for quantum chemical simulations in the NISQ era.

TI Bose-Einstein condensation of non-ground-state caesium atoms
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms serve as low-entropy sources for a multitude of quantum-science applications, ranging from quantum simulation and quantum many-body physics to proof-of-principle experiments in quantum metrology and quantum computing. For stability reasons, in the majority of cases the energetically lowest-lying atomic spin state is used. Here, we report the Bose-Einstein condensation of caesium atoms in the Zeeman-excited m f = 2 state, realizing a non-ground-state Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable interactions and tunable loss. We identify two regions of magnetic field in which the two-body relaxation rate is low enough that condensation is possible. We characterize the phase transition and quantify the loss processes, finding unusually high three-body losses in one of the two regions. Our results open up new possibilities for the mixing of quantum-degenerate gases, for polaron and impurity physics, and in particular for the study of impurity transport in strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum wires.

TI Avoiding decoherence with giant atoms in a two-dimensional structured
   environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Giant atoms are quantum emitters that can couple to light at multiple discrete points. Such atoms have been shown to interact without decohering via a one-dimensional waveguide. Here, we study how giant atoms behave when coupled to a two-dimensional square lattice of coupled cavities, an environment characterized by a finiteenergy band and band gaps. In particular, we describe the role that bound states in the continuum (BICs) play in how giant atoms avoid decoherence. By developing numerical methods, we are able to investigate the dynamics of the system and show the appearance of interfering BICs within a single giant atom, as well as oscillating BICs between many giant atoms. In this way, we find the geometric arrangements of atomic coupling points that yield protection from decoherence in the two-dimensional lattice. These results on engineering the interaction between light and matter may find applications in quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

AB We model backreaction in AdS 2 JT gravity via a proposed boundary dual Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dot coupled to Dirac fermion matter and study it from the perspective of quantum entanglement and chaos. The boundary effective action accounts for the backreaction through a linear coupling of the Dirac fermions to the Gaussianrandom two-body Majorana interaction term in the low-energy limit. We calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy between graviton and Dirac fermion fields for a separable initial state and find that it initially increases and then saturates to a finite value. Moreover, in the limit of a large number of fermions, we find a maximally entangled state between the Majorana and Dirac fields in the saturation region, implying a transition of the von Neumann algebra of observables from type I to type II. This transition in turn indicates a loss of information in the holographically dual emergent spacetime. We corroborate these observations with a detailed numerical computation of the averaged nearest-neighbor gap ratio of the boundary spectrum and provide a useful complement to quantum entanglement studies of holography.

TI Engineering a U(1) lattice gauge theory in classical electric circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Lattice gauge theories are fundamental to such distinct fields as particle physics, condensed matter, and quantum information science. Their local symmetries enforce the charge conservation observed in the laws of physics. Impressive experimental progress has demonstrated that they can be engineered in table-top experiments using synthetic quantum systems. However, the challenges posed by the scalability of such lattice gauge simulators are pressing, thereby making the exploration of different experimental setups desirable. Here, we realize a U(1) lattice gauge theory with five matter sites and four gauge links in classical electric circuits employing nonlinear elements connecting LC oscillators. This allows for probing previously inaccessible spectral and transport properties in a multisite system. We directly observe Gauss???s law, known from electrodynamics, and the emergence of long-range interactions between massive particles in full agreement with theoretical predictions. Our paper paves the way for investigations of increasingly complex gauge theories on table-top classical setups, and demonstrates the precise control of nonlinear effects within metamaterial devices.

TI Tamper Localisation Using Quantum Fourier Transform Signatures for
   Medical Image Authentication
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Medical image integrity is critical as telemedicine, cloud PACS and AI-assisted diagnostics become routine. We present a tamper localisation framework that embeds authentication signatures in the phase domain of blockwise quantum Fourier transform (QFT) coefficients. The watermark is phase-only, energy preserving and keyed through sparse midband supports with paired phase differences; a light cross-block coupling imposes spatial consistency so that localised edits produce coherent high-contrast residuals confined to manipulated regions after inverse QFT. Because magnitudes remain unaltered, benign photometric variations are naturally attenuated, improving specificity under common acquisition and storage pipelines. The verifier computes circular phase residuals and applies an adaptive threshold to generate blockwise tamper maps, which are refined to pixel resolution. Across standard distortions (JPEG recompression, Gaussian noise and blur) and localised forgeries (copy-move, inpainting and contrast edits), the scheme maintains diagnostic fidelity (typical PSNR 40 dB, SSIM 0.98) while delivering precise spatially resolved detection. The design is deterministic and reproducible via seeded keys, integrates with DICOM workflows and is amenable to future quantum hardware realisation. This work contributes a quantum-ready, imperceptible and localisation-oriented approach to medical image authentication suitable for deployment in modern healthcare systems. The proposed QFT phase-only watermark achieves imperceptibility (global PSNR dB; SSIM ) and detects localised tampering (ROC AUC under class imbalance).

TI Asymmetric Spin Transport in Colloidal Quantum Dot Junctions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The study of charge and spin transport through semiconductor quantum dots is experiencing a renaissance due to recent advances in nanofabrication and the realization of quantum dots as candidates for quantum computing. In this work, we combine atomistic electronic structure calculations with quantum master equation methods to study the transport of electrons and holes through strongly confined quantum dots coupled to two leads with a voltage bias. We find that a competition between the energy spacing between the two lowest quasi-particle energy levels and the strength of the exchange interaction determines the spin states of the lowest two quasi-particle energy levels. Specifically, the low density of electron states results in a spin singlet being the lowest-energy two-electron state, whereas, in contrast, the high density of states and significant exchange interaction result in a spin triplet being the lowest-energy two-hole state. The exchange interaction is also responsible for spin blockades in transport properties, which could persist up to temperatures as high as 77 K for strongly confined colloidal quantum dots from our calculations. Finally, we relate these findings to the preparation and manipulation of singlet and triplet spin qubit states in quantum dots using voltage biases.

TI Compact linear optical scheme for Bell state generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The capability of linear optics to generate entangled states is exploited in photonic quantum information processing, however, it is challenging to obtain entangled logical qubit states. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact scheme producing the dual-rail-encoded Bell states out of four single photons. Our scheme requires a five-mode interferometer and a single photon detector, while the previously known schemes use six-mode interferometers and two photon detectors. Using computer optimization, we have found a decomposition of the five-mode interferometer with a minimum number of beam splitters and phase-shift elements. Besides compactness, our scheme also offers a success probability of 1/9, which is higher than 2/27 provided by the six-mode counterparts. The analysis suggests that the elevated success probability is connected to a higher order of photon interference realized by our scheme, in particular, four-photon interference is implemented in our scheme, while three-photon interference was implemented in previous counterparts.

TI Self-testing of multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of
   arbitrary local dimension with arbitrary number of measurements per
   party
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Device-independent certification schemes have gained a lot of interest lately, not only for their applications in quantum information tasks, but also their implications towards foundations of quantum theory. The strongest form of device-independent certification, known as self-testing, often requires for a Bell inequality to be maximally violated by specific quantum states and measurements. In this work, using the techniques developed recently [S. Sarkar et al., npj Quantum Inf. 7, 151 (2021)], we provide a self-testing scheme for the multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of arbitrary local dimension that does not rely on self-testing results for qubit states and that exploits the minimal number of two measurements per party. This makes our results interesting as far as practical implementation of device-independent certification methods is concerned. Our self-testing statement relies on maximal violation of a Bell inequality proposed recently [R. Augusiak et al., New J. Phys. 21, 113001 (2019)].

TI SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM MATRICES FROM MUTUALLY UNBIASED BASES

AB We consider the random matrix obtained by picking vectors randomly from a large collection of mutually unbiased bases of C-n, and prove that the spectral distribution converges to the Marchenko-Pastur law. This shows that vectors in mutually unbiased bases behave like random vectors. This phenomenon is similar to that of binary linear codes of dual distance at least 5 ([33]), which was studied in previous work.

TI Transmission spectra of the driven, dissipative Rabi model in the
   ultrastrong-coupling regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present theoretical transmission spectra of a strongly driven, damped flux qubit coupled to a dissipative resonator in the ultrastrong-coupling regime. Such a qubit-oscillator system, described within a dissipative Rabi model, constitutes the building block of superconducting circuit QED platforms. The addition of a strong drive allows one to characterize the system properties and study novel phenomena, leading to a better understanding and control of the qubit-oscillator system. In this work, the calculated transmission of a weak probe field quantifies the response of the qubit, in frequency domain, under the influence of the quantized resonator and of the strong microwave drive. We find distinctive features of the entangled driven qubit-resonator spectrum, namely resonant features and avoided crossings, modified by the presence of the dissipative environment. The magnitude, positions, and broadening of these features are determined by the interplay among qubit-oscillator detuning, the strength of their coupling, the driving amplitude, and the interaction with the heat bath. This work establishes the theoretical basis for future experiments in the driven ultrastrong-coupling regime.

TI Significant loophole-free test of Kochen-Specker contextuality using two
   species of atomic ions
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum measurements cannot be thought of as revealing preexisting results, even when they do not disturb any other measurement in the same trial. This feature is called contextuality and is crucial for the quantum advantage in computing. Here, we report the observation of quantum contextuality simultaneously free of the detection, sharpness, and compatibility loopholes. The detection and sharpness loopholes are closed by adopting a hybrid two-ion system and highly efficient fluorescence measurements offering a detection efficiency of 100% and a measurement repeatability of >98%. The compatibility loophole is closed by targeting correlations between observables for two different ions in a Paul trap, a Yb-171(+) ion and a Ba-138(+) ion, chosen so measurements on each ion use different operation laser wavelengths, fluorescence wavelengths, and detectors. The experimental results show a violation of the bound for the most adversarial noncontextual models and open a way to certify quantum systems.

TI Advances in synthesis strategies and multifunctional applications of
   silicon carbide materials
SO AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Silicon carbide (SiC), a leading third-generation wide-bandgap semiconductor, exhibits exceptional electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, including a high breakdown field, superior thermal conductivity, and remarkable environmental stability, making it indispensable for high-power electronics, high-temperature applications, and advanced composites. This review systematically outlines recent advances in SiC materials, with an emphasis on crystal structure characteristics, innovative synthesis routes, and cross-disciplinary applications. The polytypism of SiC and structure-property correlations governing its band structure and carrier mobility-are elucidated. A comparative analysis is then provided on controllable preparation strategies for micro/nano SiC powders, highlighting emerging eco-friendly and low-temperature synthesis pathways. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying SiC's performance in structural ceramics, catalytic supports, microwave absorption, and supercapacitors are comprehensively discussed, with particular attention paid to its wide-temperature stability and interface enhancement effects. Finally, prevailing challenges in scalable synthesis and defect control are addressed, along with several promising research directions: (1) defect-engineered quantum sensing platforms; (2) low-carbon manufacturing using biomass-derived carbon sources; and (3) deep integration of SiC power devices with smart grid architectures. This review aims to provide theoretical insights and technical guidance for the multi-scale design and application of SiC materials in the fields of new energy and quantum technologies.

TI Multiqubit entanglement and quantum phase gates with epsilon-near-zero
   plasmonic waveguides
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Multiqubit entanglement is extremely important to perform truly secure quantum optical communication and computing operations. However, the efficient generation of long-range entanglement over extended time periods between multiple qubits randomly distributed in a photonic system remains an outstanding challenge. This constraint is mainly due to the detrimental effects of decoherence and dephasing. To alleviate this issue, we present engineered epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) nanostructures that can maximize the coherence of light-matter interactions at room temperature. We investigate a practical ENZ plasmonic waveguide system, which simultaneously achieves multiqubit entanglement in elongated distances, extended time periods, and, even more importantly, independent of the emitters' positions. More specifically, we present efficient transient entanglement between three and four optical qubits mediated by ENZ with results that can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of emitters. The entanglement between multiple qubits is characterized by computing the negativity metric applied to the proposed nanophotonic ENZ configuration. The ENZ response is found to be substantially advantageous to boost the coherence between multiple emitters compared to alternative plasmonic waveguide schemes. Finally, the super-radiance collective emission response at the ENZ resonance is utilized to design a high fidelity two-qubit quantum phase gate that can be used in various emerging quantum computing applications.

TI Gaussian Decomposition vs. Semiclassical Quantum Simulation: Obtaining
   the High-Order Derivatives of a Spectrum in the Case of Photosynthetic
   Pigment Optical Properties Studying
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, a procedure for obtaining undistorted high derivatives (up to the eighth order) of the optical absorption spectra of biomolecule pigments has been developed. To assess the effectiveness of the procedure, the theoretical spectra of bacteriochlorophyll a, chlorophyll a, spheroidene, and spheroidenone were simulated by fitting the experimental spectra using the differential evolution algorithm. The experimental spectra were also approximated using sets of Gaussians to calculate the model absorption spectra. Theoretical and model spectra can be differentiated without smoothing (high-frequency noise filtering) to obtain high derivatives. Superimposition of the noise track on the model spectra allows us to obtain test spectra similar to the experimental ones. Comparison of the high derivatives of the model spectra with those of the test spectra allows us to find the optimal parameters of the filter, the application of which leads to minimal differences between the high derivatives of the model and test spectra. For all four studied pigments, it was shown that smoothing the experimental spectra with optimal filters makes it possible to obtain the eighth derivatives of the experimental spectra, which were close to the eighth derivatives of their theoretical spectra.

TI Quantum-Inspired Real-Time Optimization for 6G Networks: Opportunities,
   Challenges, and the Road Ahead
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB It is envisioned that 6G, unlike its predecessor 5G, will depart from connected machines and connected people to connected intelligence. The main goal of 6G networks is to support massive connectivity for time-sensitive and computation-sensitive services in mission-critical applications. The creation of real-time optimization (RTO) enabled by the fast growing data analytic and machine learning will seize the opportunities for 6G wireless networks to support such immersive services such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and tactile Internet. Recently, with the rapid development of quantum computers, quantum-inspired optimization and machine learning algorithms have been exploited as efficient solutions for future wireless networks. In this article, we provide a comprehensive view on the new concept of quantum-inspired RTO and its application to the optimal resource allocation for 6G wireless networks. Our main contributions are to introduce some of the initial research results and introduce the potentiality of quantum-inspired RTO on some 6G emerging technologies. Not only do we review the fundamental principles; we also explore the challenges and opportunities of this exciting research direction.

TI Heralded initialization of charge state and optical-transition frequency
   of diamond tin-vacancy centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Diamond tin-vacancy centers have emerged as a promising platform for quantum information science and technology. A key challenge for their use in more-complex quantum experiments and scalable applications is the ability to prepare the center in the desired charge state with the optical transition at a predefined frequency. Here we report on heralding such successful preparation using a combination of laser excitation, photon detection, and real-time logic. We first show that fluorescence photon counts collected during an optimized resonant probe pulse strongly correlate with the subsequent charge state and opticaltransition frequency, enabling real-time heralding of the desired state through threshold photon counting. We then implement and apply this heralding technique to photoluminescence-excitation measurements, coherent optical driving, and an optical Ramsey experiment, finding strongly increased optical coherence with increasing threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the prepared optical frequency follows the probe laser across the inhomogeneous linewidth, enabling tuning of the transition frequency over multiple homogeneous linewidths.

AB The quantum walk (QW) has proven to be a valuable testbed for fundamental inquiries in quantum technology applications such as quantum simulation and quantum search algorithms. Many benefits have been found by exploring implementations of QWs in various physical systems, including photonic platforms. Here, we propose a platform to perform quantum walks based on ultrafast time-bin encoding (UTBE) and all-optical Kerr gating. This platform supports the scalability of quantum walks to a large number of steps and walkers while retaining a significant degree of programmability. More importantly, ultrafast time bins are encoded at the picosecond time scale, far away from mechanical fluctuations. This enables the scalability of our platform to many modes while preserving excellent interferometric phase stability over extremely long periods of time without requiring active phase stabilization. Our 18-step QW is shown to preserve interferometric phase stability over a period of 50 h, with an overall walk fidelity maintained above 95%.

TI Learning from Physics Experiments with Quantum Computers: Applications
   in Muon Spectroscopy
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Computational physics is an important tool for analyzing, verifying, and at times-replacing physical experiments. Nevertheless, simulating quantum systems and analyzing quantum data has so far resisted an efficient classical treatment in full generality. While programmable quantum systems have been developed to address this challenge, the resources required for classically intractable problems still lie beyond our reach. In this work, we consider a new target for quantum-simulation algorithms; analyzing the data arising from physics experiments specifically, muon-spectroscopy experiments. These experiments can be used to probe the quantum interactions present in condensed-matter systems. However, fully analyzing their results can require classical computational resources scaling exponentially with the simulated system size, which can limit our understanding of the studied system. We show that this task may be a natural fit for the coming generations of quantum computers. We use classical emulations of our quantum algorithm on systems of up to 29 qubits to analyze real experimental data, and to estimate both the near-term and error-corrected resources required for our proposal. We find that our algorithm exhibits good noise resilience, stemming from our desire to extract global parameters from a fitted curve, rather than targeting any individual data point. In some respects, our fault tolerant resource estimates go further than some prior work in quantum simulation, by estimating the resources required to solve a complete task, rather than just to run a given circuit. Taking the overhead of observable measurement and calculating multiple datapoints into account, we find that significant challenges still remain if our algorithm is to become practical for analyzing muon-spectroscopy data.

TI Building the Standard Model particles and fields within a sphere fiber
   bundle framework
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB In this paper a sphere fiber bundle structure underlying the Standard Model of Particle Physics is developed. The developed bundle framework is shown to contain mathematical structures naturally suited for modeling the Standard Model's elementary particles and fields. This modeling yields numerous results across the spectrum of physics, including: a resolution to the family problem, explanation of the 6-6 lepton-quark split in nature, a spacetime structural explanation of dark matter and energy, prediction of repulsive gravitational effects occurring in localized regions of space maintained at energies ������(1015K), a modeling of the SM elementary particles as vibrating closed loops in spacetime, elimination of the fermionic QFT VEV catastrophe, the unveiling of a grand unification model at odds with standard GUT models, prediction of Dirac-style magnetic monopoles and of a quark-gluon and quasi-quark -gluon plasma near inception of the universe, a topological explanation for quark confinement, resolution to the cosmological constant problem, and a presentation of the model's topology of quantum entanglement which reconciles relativistic locality with quantum non-locality.

TI Re-examining the M-center in silicon
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Silicon is a key material in quantum technologies, forming the foundation for both integrated photonic platforms and spin qubit systems. In this study, we systematically investigate the formation, structure, and stability of carbon-related defect clusters in silicon, focusing on the CsCi, CsCiHi, and CsCiCsHi defects using density functional theory. The CsCi defect exhibits a high formation energy and weak binding energy, indicating a less stable and energetically costly defect. The incorporation of hydrogen to form the CsCiHi cluster significantly lowers the formation energy, demonstrating that hydrogen facilitates defect formation and reduces the binding energy due to structural relaxation and charge redistribution. The more complex CsCiCsHi cluster, which includes an additional substitutional carbon atom, shows the lowest formation energy, suggesting that it forms easily; whereas its negative binding energy reveals that it is more stable than its isolated components. We show that increasing defect complexity does not increase the zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy, but the electronic coupling and symmetry of the defect can play a more decisive role. The ZPL values for both configurations are well outside the telecom O-band reducing their immediate applicability in quantum communications.

TI Design and synthesis of heterocyclic azole based bioactive compounds:

   through docking as multi-target inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 and
   cytotoxicity
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB Two heterocyclic azole compounds, 3-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4H-chromen-4-one (SVS1) and 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)-4-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (SVS2) were obtained unexpectedly from 2-aminothiophenol and 4-oxo-4H-chromene-3-carbaldehyde (for SVS1), and (E)-2-((1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-N-methylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide in the presence of anhydrous FeCl3 (for SVS2), respectively. The compounds were well characterized by analytical and spectroscopic tools. The molecular structures of both the compounds were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the molecular geometry and electron distribution of the compounds, which were correlated well with the three-dimensional structures obtained from the single crystal XRD. DMol(3) was used to calculate quantum chemical parameters [chemical potential (mu), global hardness (eta), global softness (sigma), absolute electronegativity (chi) and electrophilicity index (omega)] of SVS1 and SVS2. Molecular docking study was performed to elucidate the binding ability of SVS1 and SVS2 with SARS-CoV-2 main protease and human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) molecular targets. Interestingly, the binding efficiency of the compounds with the molecular targets was comparable with that of remdesivir (SARS-CoV-2), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. SVS1 showed better docking energy than SVS2. The molecular docking study was complemented by molecular dynamics simulation study of SARS-CoV-2 main protease-SVS1 complex, which further exemplified the binding ability of SVS1 with the target. In addition, SVS1, SVS2 and cisplatin were assessed for their cytotoxicity against a panel of three human cancer cells such as HepG-2 (hepatic carcinoma), T24 (bladder) and EA.hy926 (endothelial), as well as Vero (kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey) normal cells using MTT assay. The results showed that SVS2 has significant cytotoxicity against HepG-2 and EA.hy926 cells with the IC50 values of 33.8 mu M (IC50 = 49.9 mu M-cisplatin and 8.6 mu M-doxorubicin) and 29.2 (IC50 = 26.6 mu M-cisplatin and 3.8 mu M-doxorubicin), respectively.

TI Optimization of the resonator-induced PHASE gate for superconducting
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The resonator-induced PHASE gate is a two-qubit operation in which driving a bus resonator induces a state dependent phase shift on the qubits equivalent to an effective ZZ interaction. In principle, the dispersive nature of the gate offers flexibility for qubit parameters. However, the drive can cause resonator and qubit leakage, the physics of which cannot be fully captured using either the existing Jaynes-Cummings or Kerr models. In this paper, we adopt an ab initio model based on Josephson nonlinearity for transmon qubits. The ab initio analysis agrees well with the Kerr model in terms of capturing the effective ZZ interaction in the weak-drive dispersive regime. In addition, however, it reveals numerous leakage transitions involving high-excitation qubit states. We analyze the physics behind such novel leakage channels, demonstrate the connection with specific qubit-resonator frequency collisions, and lay out a plan toward device parameter optimization. We show that this type of leakage can be substantially suppressed using very weakly anharmonic transmons. In particular, weaker qubit anharmonicity mitigates both collision density and leakage amplitude, while larger qubit frequency moves the collisions to occur only at large anharmonicity not relevant to experiment. Our work is broadly applicable to the physics of weakly anharmonic transmon qubits coupled to linear resonators. In particular, our analysis confirms and generalizes the measurement-induced state transitions noted in Sank et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 190503 (2016)] and lays the groundwork for both strong-drive resonator-induced PHASE gate implementation and strong-drive dispersive qubit measurement.

TI Classically Replaceable Operations
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum information science provides powerful technologies beyond the scope of classical physics. In practice, accurate control of quantum operations is a challenging task with current quantum devices. The implementation of high fidelity and multiqubit quantum operations consumes massive resources and requires complicated hardware design to fight against noise. An approach to alleviating this problem is to replace quantum operations with classical processing. Despite the common practice of this approach, rigorous criteria to determine whether a given quantum operation is replaceable classically are still missing. In this work, we define the classically replaceable operations in four general scenarios. In each scenario, we provide their necessary and sufficient criteria and point out the corresponding classical processing. For a practically favorable case of unitary classically replaceable operations, we show that the replaced classical processing is deterministic. Beyond that, we regard the irreplaceability of quantum operations by classical processing as a quantum resource and relate it to the performance of a channel in a non-local game, as manifested in a robustness measure.

TI Competition of decoherence and quantum speed limits for quantum-gate
   fidelity in the Jaynes-Cummings model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers are operated by external driving fields, such as lasers, microwaves, or transmission lines, that execute logical operations on multiqubit registers, leaving the system in a pure state. However, the drive and the logical system might become correlated in such a way that, after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the driving field, the output state will not be pure. Previous works have pointed out that the resulting error scales inversely with the energy of the drive, thus imposing a limit on the energy efficiency of quantum computing. In this study, focusing on the Jaynes-Cummings model, we show how the same scaling can be seen as a consequence of two competing phenomena: the entanglement-induced error, which grows with time, and a minimal time for computation imposed by quantum speed limits. This evidence is made possible by quantifying, at any time, the computation error via the spectral radius associated with the density operator of the logical qubit. Moreover, we also prove that, in order to attain a given target state at a chosen fidelity, it is energetically more efficient to perform a single driven evolution of the logical qubits rather than to split the computation in subroutines, each operated by a dedicated pulse.

AB Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of 18.5% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of a moderate number of layers.

TI Discreteness effects on the fluxon interaction with the dipole impurity
   in the Josephson transmission line
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The influence of discreteness on the fluxon scattering on the dipole-like impurity is studied. This kind of impurity is used to model the qubit inductively coupled to the Josephson transmission line (JTL). The previously proposed fluxon assisted readout process of the qubit state is based on measuring the passage time through the dipole impurity. The aim of this work is to clarify the role of the discreteness in this qubit readout process. It is demonstrated that the fluxon delay time on the qubit impurity increases significantly if the discreteness of the JTL increases. Also it is shown that the difference between the fluxon threshold currents for the positive and negative impurities decreases with the increase of discreteness.

TI Entangled rendezvous: a possible application of Bell non-locality for
   mobile agents on networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Rendezvous is an old problem of assuring that two or more parties, initially separated, not knowing the position of each other, and not allowed to communicate, are striving to meet without pre-agreement on the meeting point. This problem has been extensively studied in classical computer science and has vivid importance to modern and future applications. Quantum non-locality, like Bell inequality violation, has shown that in many cases quantum entanglement allows for improved coordination of two, or more, separated parties compared to classical sources. The non-signaling correlations in many cases even strengthened such phenomena. In this work, we analyze, how Bell non-locality can be used by asymmetric location-aware agents trying to rendezvous on a finite network with a limited number of steps. We provide the optimal solution to this problem for both agents using quantum resources, and agents with only 'classical' computing power. Our results show that for cubic graphs and cycles it is possible to gain an advantage by allowing the agents to use the assistance of entangled quantum states.

TI Pipeline quantum processor architecture for silicon spin qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a quantum processor architecture, the qubit 'pipeline', in which run-time scales additively as functions of circuit depth and run repetitions. Run-time control is applied globally, reducing the complexity of control and interconnect resources. This simplification is achieved by shuttling N-qubit states through a large layered physical array of structures which realise quantum logic gates in stages. Thus, the circuit depth corresponds to the number of layers of structures. Subsequent N-qubit states are 'pipelined' densely through the structures to efficiently wield the physical resources for repeated runs. Pipelining thus lends itself to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications, such as variational quantum eigensolvers, which require numerous repetitions of the same or similar calculations. We illustrate the architecture by describing a realisation in the naturally high-density and scalable silicon spin qubit platform, which includes a universal gate set of sufficient fidelity under realistic assumptions of qubit variability.

AB One of the essential requirements for atom-based technology is controlling the position and characterizing interactions between atoms and their environment. Optical tweezers are crucial for positioning atoms precisely. Typically, quantum technology research utilizes two-dimensional optical tweezers planar arrays, which are limited in manipulating atoms at different depths of field. To address this issue, three-dimensional optical tweezers can be simulated using a modulated phase mask of a Gaussian laser beam. The phase mask is computed using the direct phase addition (DPA) method with a weight factor, and the angular spectrum method (ASM) is employed to propagate a 2D intensity pattern transversely through the beam, layer by layer. Our results showed that the position of each trap can be adjusted to desire positions in 3D with a global weight factor. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that increasing resolution improves measurement precision. Utilizing 3D atom arrays enhances quantum simulation capabilities, providing better insights into complex phenomena. The results of this investigation will be applied to a spatial light modulator in a real setup for an ultra-cold atom trapping experiment.

TI Quantum Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in the fingerprint
   region
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Infrared quantum absorption spectroscopy is one of the quantum sensing techniques, by which the infrared optical properties of a sample can be estimated through visible or near infrared photon detection without need for infrared optical source or detector, which has been an obstacle for higher sensitivity and spectrometer miniaturization. However, experimental demonstrations have been limited to wavelengths shorter than 5 mu m or in the terahertz region, and have not been realized in the so-called fingerprint region of 1500-500 cm(-1) (6.6 to 20 mu m), which is commonly used to identify chemical compounds or molecules. Here we report the experimental demonstration of quantum Fourier-transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy in the fingerprint region, by which both absorption and phase spectra (complex spectra) can be obtained from Fourier transformed quantum interferograms obtained with a single pixel visible-light detector. As demonstrations, we obtained the transmittance spectrum of a silicon wafer at around 10 mu m (1000 cm(-1)) and complex transmittance spectrum of a synthetic fluoropolymer sheet, polytetrafluoroethylene, in the wavelength range of 8 to 10.5 mu m (1250 to 950 cm(-1)), where absorption due to stretching modes of C-F bonds is clearly observed. These results open the way for new forms of spectroscopic devices based on quantum technologies. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Quantum physics is changing the paradigms for understanding reality and is fostering scientific innovation. Nevertheless, the core concepts of the second quantum revolution are not included in the Italian physics curriculum. Our research project aims to generate the conditions for the development of the scientific competences related to the understanding of the fundamental concepts of contemporary physics at secondary school level. In the framework of Educational Reconstruction for Teacher Education (ERTE), we have developed a continuous professional development program for teachers to enable in-service physics teachers in secondary schools to introduce the superposition principle, quantum entanglement, and their technological applications into regular classroom activities. To achieve this goal, several types of activities have been planned to strengthen collaboration between high school teachers and physics researchers. The intended outcome is to create resources and materials that can help teachers and researchers create innovative physics curricula that can be used in normal secondary school teaching activities. In this paper we present the results of the first edition of a continuous professional development program for in-service teachers on introducing the superposition principle and quantum entanglement into online classroom activities during the schools Covid19 lockdown.

TI Solvable Model of Quantum-Darwinism-Encoding Transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a solvable model of quantum Darwinism to encoding transitions-abrupt changes in how quantum information spreads in a many -body system under unitary dynamics. We consider a random Clifford circuit on an expanding tree, whose input qubit is entangled with a reference. The model has a quantum Darwinism phase, where one classical bit of information about the reference can be retrieved from an arbitrarily small fraction of the output qubits, and an encoding phase where such retrieval is impossible. The two phases are separated by a mixed phase and two continuous transitions. We compare the exact result to a two -replica calculation. The latter yields a similar "annealed" phase diagram, which applies also to a model with Haar random unitaries. We relate our approach to measurement -induced phase transitions (MIPTs), by solving a modified model where an environment eavesdrops on an encoding system. It has a sharp MIPT only with full access to the environment.

TI A diagrammatic approach to variational quantum ansatz construction
SO QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are a promising class of quantum algorithms for preparing approximate ground states in near-term quantum devices. Minimizing the error in such an approximation requires designing ansatzes using physical considerations that target the studied system. Coupledcluster ansatzes family are one family of such ansatzes, that are based on the perturbative principle of size-extensivity. Informally this principle means that the ground state quantum correlations are to be compactly represented in the ansatz. Unfortunately the sizeextensive ansatzes usually require expansion via Trotter-Suzuki methods to be used on digital quantum computers. These introduce additional costs and errors to the variational approximation. In this work, we present a diagrammatic scheme for digital VQE ansatzes, which is size-extensive but does not require Trotterization. We start by designing a family of digital ansatzes that explore the entire Hilbert space with the minimum number of free parameters. We then demonstrate how one may compress an arbitrary digital ansatz, by enforcing symmetry constraints of the target system, or by using them as parent ansatzes for a hierarchy of increasingly long but increasingly accurate sub-ansatzes. We apply a perturbative analysis and develop a diagrammatic formalism that ensures the sizeextensivity of generated hierarchies. We test our methods on a short spin chain, finding good convergence to the ground state in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising model.

TI Traversable wormholes via a double trace deformation involving U(1)
   conserved current operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study the effects of conservation laws on wormholes that are made traversable by a double trace deformation. After coupling the two asymptotic boundaries of a maximally extended (d + 1)-dimensional black brane geometry with U(1) conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic limit violates the averaged null energy condition, rendering the wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation protocols involving conserved current operators.

TI Hybridized Defects in Solid-State Materials as Artificial Molecules
SO ACS NANO
AB Two-dimensional materials can be crafted with structural precision approaching the atomic scale, enabling quantum defects-by-design. These defects are frequently described as "artificial atoms" and are emerging optically addressable spin qubits. However, interactions and coupling of such artificial atoms with each other, in the presence of the lattice, warrants further investigation. Here we present the formation of "artificial molecules" in solids, introducing a chemical degree of freedom in control of quantum optoelectronic materials. Specifically, in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride as our model system, we observe configuration- and distance-dependent dissociation curves and hybridization of defect orbitals within the bandgap into bonding and antibonding orbitals, with splitting energies ranging from similar to 10 meV to nearly 1 eV. We calculate the energetics of cis and trans out-of-plane defect pairs CHB-CHB against an in-plane defect pair C-B-C-B and find that in-plane defect pair interacts more strongly than out-of-plane pairs. We demonstrate an application of this chemical degree of freedom by varying the distance between C-B and V-N of CBVN and observe changes in the predicted peak absorption wavelength from the visible to the near-infrared spectral band. We envision leveraging this chemical degree of freedom of defect complexes to precisely control and tune defect properties toward engineering robust quantum memories and quantum emitters for quantum information science.

TI Weak Exchange Interactions in Multispin Systems: EPR Studies of
   Metalloporphyrins Decorated with {Cr7Ni} Rings
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Both metalloporphyrins and heterometallic {Cr7Ni} rings are of significant research interest due to their proposed roles in quantum information processing devices. In this study, we present a series of complexes in which [Cr7NiF3(Etglu)((O2CBu)-Bu-t)(15)] (N-EtgluH(5) = N-ethyl-d-glucamine) heterometallic rings are coordinated to metalloporphyrin linkers: the symmetric [M(TPyP)] for M = Cu2+, VO2+, and H2TPyP = 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin; and the asymmetric [{VO}(TrPPyP)] for H-2(TrPPyP) = 5,10,15-(triphenyl)-20-(4-pyridyl)porphyrin. The magnetic interactions present in these complexes are unraveled using the continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. The nature of the coupling between the {Cr7Ni} rings and the central metalloporphyrin is assessed by numerical simulations of CW EPR spectra and determined to be on the order of 0.01 cm(-1), larger than the dipolar ones and suitable for individual spin addressability in multiqubit architectures.

TI Controllable tunability of a Chern number within the electronic-nuclear
   spin system in diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Chern numbers characterize topological phases in a wide array of physical systems. However, the resilience of system topology to external perturbations makes it challenging experimentally to investigate transitions between different phases. In this study, we demonstrate the transitions of a Chern number from 0 to 3, synthesized in an electronic-nuclear spin system associated with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. The Chern number is characterized by the number of degeneracies enclosed in a control Hamiltonian parameter sphere. Topological transitions between different phases are realized by varying the radius and offset of the sphere such that the Chern number changes. We show that the measured topological phase diagram is consistent with numerical calculations and can also be mapped onto an interacting three-qubit system. The NV system may also allow access to even higher Chern numbers, which could be applied to exploring exotic topology or topological quantum information.

TI Transverse Mode-Encoded Quantum Gate on a Silicon Photonic Chip
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As an important degree of freedom (d.o.f.) in photonic integrated circuits, the orthogonal transverse mode provides a promising and flexible way to increase communication capability, for both classical and quantum information processing. To construct large-scale on-chip multimode multi-d.o.f.s quantum systems, a transverse mode-encoded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is necessary. Here, with the help of our new transverse mode-dependent directional coupler and attenuator, we demonstrate the first multimode implementation of a 2-qubit quantum gate. The ability of the gate is demonstrated by entangling two separated transverse mode qubits with an average fidelity of 0.89 +/- 0.02 and the achievement of 10 standard deviations of violations in the quantum nonlocality verification. In addition, a fidelity of 0.82 +/- 0.01 is obtained from quantum process tomography used to completely characterize the CNOT gate. Our work paves the way for universal transverse mode-encoded quantum operations and large-scale multimode multi-d.o.f.s quantum systems.

TI The quantum marginal problem for symmetric states: applications to
   variational optimization, nonlocality and self-testing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we present a method to solve the quantum marginal problem for symmetric d-level systems. The method is built upon an efficient semi-definite program that uses the compatibility conditions of an m-body reduced density with a global n-body density matrix supported on the symmetric space. We illustrate the applicability of the method in central quantum information problems with several exemplary case studies. Namely, (i) a fast variational ansatz to optimize local Hamiltonians over symmetric states, (ii) a method to optimize symmetric, few-body Bell operators over symmetric states and (iii) a set of sufficient conditions to determine which symmetric states cannot be self-tested from few-body observables. As a by-product of our findings, we also provide a generic, analytical correspondence between arbitrary superpositions of n-qubit Dicke states and translationally-invariant diagonal matrix product states of bond dimension n.

TI Measurement-induced phase transition in teleportation and wormholes
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate that some quantum teleportation protocols exhibit measurement induced phase transitions in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Namely, Kitaev-Yoshida and Gao- Jafferis-Wall protocols have a phase transition if we apply them at a large projection rate or at a large coupling rate respectively. It is well-known that at small rates they allow teleportation to happen only within a small time-window. We show that at large rates, the system goes into a new steady state, where the teleportation can be performed at any moment. In dual Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity these phase transitions correspond to the formation of an eternal traversable wormhole. In the Kitaev-Yoshida case this novel type of wormhole is supported by continuous projections.

TI Assessment of image generation by quantum annealer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealing was originally proposed as an approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum effects. D-Wave Systems has released a production model of quantum annealing hardware. However, the inherent noise and various environmental factors in the hardware hamper the determination of optimal solutions. In addition, the freezing effect in regions with weak quantum fluctuations generates outputs approximately following a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at an extremely low temperature. Thus, a quantum annealer may also serve as a fast sampler for the Ising spin-glass problem, and several studies have investigated Boltzmann machine learning using a quantum annealer. Previous developments have focused on comparing the performance in the standard distance of the resulting distributions between conventional methods in classical computers and sampling by a quantum annealer. In this study, we focused on the performance of a quantum annealer as a generative model from a different aspect. To evaluate its performance, we prepared a discriminator given by a neural network trained on an a priori dataset. The evaluation results show a higher performance of quantum annealer compared with the classical approach for Boltzmann machine learning in training of the generative model. However the generation of the data suffers from the remanent quantum fluctuation in the quantum annealer. The quality of the generated images from the quantum annealer gets worse than the ideal case of the quantum annealing and the classical Monte-Carlo sampling.

TI Asymptotically Good CSS-T Codes and a New Construction of Triorthogonal
   Codes
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB We propose a new systematic construction of CSS-T codes from any given CSS code using a map Phi . When Phi is the identity map I, we retrieve the construction of Hu et al. (2021) and use it to prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature, and of asymptotically good quantum LDPC CSS-T codes. We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction (Phi = I) , concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in Jain and Albert (2024). Our approach permits using self-orthogonal codes, instead of only doubly-even codes, as building blocks for triorthogonal codes. This broadens the range of codes available for magic state distillation.

TI Information scrambling and chaos in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been extensively used over the past few years to study information scrambling and quantum chaos in many-body systems. In this paper, we extend the formalism of the averaged bipartite OTOC of Styliaris et al. [Phys. Rev. Leu. 126. 030601 (2021)] to the case of open quantum systems. The dynamics is no longer unitary but it is described by more general quantum channels (trace preserving, completely positive maps). This "open bipartite OTOC" can be treated in an exact analytical fashion and is shown to amount to a distance between two quantum channels. Moreover, our analytical form unveils competing entropic contributions from information scrambling and environmental decoherence such that the latter can obfuscate the former. To elucidate this subtle interplay, we analytically study special classes of quantum channels, namely, dephasing channels, entanglement-breaking channels, and others. Finally, as a physical application we numerically study dissipative many-body spin chains and show how the competing entropic effects can be used to differentiate between integrable and chaotic regimes.

TI On construction of finite averaging sets for SL(2, C) via its
   Cartan decomposition
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Averaging physical quantities over Lie groups appears in many contexts across the rapidly developing branches of physics like quantum information science or quantum optics. Such an averaging process can be always represented as averaging with respect to a finite number of elements of the group, called a finite averaging set. In the previous research such sets, known as t-designs, were constructed only for the case of averaging over unitary groups (hence the name unitary t-designs). In thisworkwe investigate the problem of constructing finite averaging sets for averaging over general non-compact matrix Lie groups, which is much more subtle task due to the fact that the the uniform invariant measure on the group manifold (the Haar measure) is infinite. We provide a general construction of such sets based on the Cartan decomposition of the group, which splits the group into its compact and non-compact components. The averaging over the compact part can be done in a uniform way, whereas the averaging over the non-compact one has to be endowed with a suppressing weight function, and can be approached using generalized Gauss quadratures. This leads us to the general form of finite averaging sets for semisimple matrix Lie groups in the product form of finite averaging sets with respect to the compact and non-compact parts. We provide an explicit calculation of such sets for the group SL(2, C), although our construction can be applied to other cases. Possible applications of our results cover finding finite ensembles of random operations in quantum information science and quantum optics, which can be used in constructions of randomised quantum algorithms, including optical interferometric implementations.

TI Coherent Driving of a Single Nitrogen Vacancy Center by a Resonant
   Magnetic Tunnel Junction
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, atomic spin defects in diamond, represent an active contender for advancing transformative quantum information science (QIS) and innovations. One of the major challenges for designing NV-based hybrid systems for QIS applications results from the difficulty of realizing local control of individual NV spin qubits in a scalable and energy-efficient way. To address this bottleneck, we introduce magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices to establish coherent driving of an NV center by a resonant MTJ with voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy. We show that the oscillating magnetic stray field produced by a resonant micromagnet can be utilized to effectively modify and drive NV spin rotations when the NV frequency matches the corresponding resonance conditions of the MTJ. Our results present a new pathway to achieve all-electric control of an NV spin qubit with reduced power consumption and improved solid-state scalability for implementing cutting-edge QIS technological applications.

TI Quantum Control of Optically Active Artificial Atoms With Surface
   Acoustic Waves
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are a versatile tool for realizing coherent quantum interfaces between various solid-state qubits spanning microwave to optical frequencies. Through strain, electric, or magnetic fields associated with acoustic waves, qubit states can be controlled and measured with exquisite precision for applications in quantum information processing, memory, transduction, and sensing. In this review, we discuss progress toward quantum control using surface acoustic waves coupled to optically active artificial atoms, including semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), optically addressable solid-state spins, and quantum emitters in van derWaals materials. We outline the device, material, and theoretical considerations for realizing interactions with surface acoustic waves in the quantum regime, summarize the state of the art in coupling surface acoustic waves to artificial atoms, and provide insight into the current trends and trajectory of the field.

TI Impact of Surface Roughness on Consistent Resonator Performance
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Superconducting circuit-based quantum processors are leading platforms for quantum computing. In these circuits, microwave photons are stored as qubits in ultra-low-loss planar resonators and non-linear inductors formed by Josephson junctions. Resonators are typically made from high-energy-gap superconductors like Nb or Ta, while the junctions are made of Al. Resonators occupy much of the circuit, making defect-free fabrication and understanding microwave energy dissipation crucial. Losses arise from noise, two-level systems (TLS), quasi-particles, and impurities. TLS losses dominate at operating temperatures below the critical temperature of the metal, whereas photon loss due to quasi-particles, often stemming from grain boundaries and pinholes in the metal film, becomes more pronounced at higher photon numbers or temperatures approaching the metal's critical temperature. To mitigate these, substrate cleaning, surface control, and non-superconducting film capping prevent oxide formation and reduce impurities. High-frequency drives and impurities at the grain boundaries lead to nonuniform quality factors among resonators. By controlling oxygen plasma exposure to minimize surface roughness and pinhole depth, an area-dependent quality factor is observed, which are attributed to changes in surface resistivity. This approach minimized variations in quality factors across resonators, improving uniformity in Nb-based devices and more consistent qubit readout performance.

TI Quantum-Driven Multihead Inland Waterbody Detection With
   Transformer-Encoded CYGNSS Delay-Doppler Map Data
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB Inland waterbody detection (IWD), which aims at identifying and mapping waterbodies, such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, is critical for water resources management and agricultural planning. However, the development of high-fidelity IWD mapping technology remains unresolved. We aim to propose a practical solution using only the easily accessible delay-Doppler map (DDM) data provided by NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), which facilitates effective estimation of physical parameters on the Earth's surface with high temporal resolution and wide spatial coverage. Specifically, as the quantum deep network (QUEEN) has revealed its strong proficiency in addressing classification-like tasks, we encode DDM using a customized transformer, followed by feeding the transformer-encoded DDM (tDDM) into a highly entangled QUEEN to distinguish whether the tDDM corresponds to a hydrological region. In recent literature, QUEEN has achieved outstanding performances in numerous challenging remote sensing tasks (e.g., hyperspectral restoration, change detection, and mixed noise removal), and its high effectiveness stems from the fundamentally different ways it adopts to extract features (the so-called quantum unitary-computing features). The meticulously designed IWD-QUEEN retrieves high-precision river textures, such as those in the Amazon River Basin in South America, demonstrating its superiority over traditional classification methods and existing global hydrography maps. IWD-QUEEN, together with its parallel quantum multihead scheme, works in a near-real-time manner (i.e., millisecond-level computing per DDM data). To broaden accessibility for users of traditional computers, we also provide the nonquantum counterpart of our method, called IWD-Transformer, thereby increasing the impact of this work. In terms of quantitative evaluation, IWD-QUEEN leads the IWD-Transformer by approximately 7% and 8% in $F1$ -score and Cohen's kappa, respectively, alluding the promising role of QUEEN in achieving high-performance detection.

TI Quantum game perspective on green product optimal pricing under emission
   reduction cooperation of dual-channel supply chain
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
AB PurposeFrom the quantum game perspective, this paper aims to study a green product optimal pricing problem of the dual-channel supply chain under the cooperation of the retailer and manufacturer to reduce carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approachThe decentralized and centralized decision-making optimal prices and profits are obtained by establishing the classical and quantum game models. Then the classical game and quantum game are compared. FindingsWhen the quantum entanglement is greater than 0, the selling prices of the quantum model are higher than the classical model. Through theoretical research and numerical analysis results, centralized decision-making is more economical and efficient than decentralized decision-making. Publicity and education on carbon emission reduction for consumers will help consumers accept carbon emission reduction products with slightly higher prices. When the emission reduction increases too fast, the cost of emission reduction will form a significant burden and affect the profits of manufacturers and supply chain systems. Originality/valueFrom the perspective of the quantum game, the author explores the optimal prices of green product and compares them with the classical game.

TI A lightweight three-user secure quantum summation protocol without a
   third party based on single-particle states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, a lightweight three-user secure quantum summation protocol is put forward by using single-particle states, which can accomplish the goal that three users cooperate together to calculate the modulo 2 addition of their private messages without the help of a third party. This protocol only requires single-particle states rather than quantum entangled states as the initial quantum resource and only needs single-particle measurements and Bell basis measurements. This protocol needs none of quantum entanglement swapping, the Pauli operations, the controlled-not (CNOT) operation, the Hadamard gate or a pre-shared private key sequence. Security analysis proves that this protocol is secure against both the outside attacks and the participant attacks. Compared with the existing two-dimensional three-user quantum summation protocols, this protocol more or less takes advantage over them on the aspects of the initial quantum resource, users' quantum measurement, the usage of quantum entanglement swapping, the usage of Pauli operations, the usage of CNOT operation or the usage of Hadamard gate.

TI Geometry of entanglement and separability in Hilbert subspaces of
   dimension up to three
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a complete classification of the geometry of the mutually complementary sets of entangled and separable states in three-dimensional Hilbert subspaces of bipartite and multipartite quantum systems. Our analysis begins by finding the geometric structure of the pure product states in a given three-dimensional Hilbert subspace, which determines all the possible separable and entangled mixed states over the same subspace. In bipartite systems, we characterise the 14 possible qualitatively different geometric shapes for the set of separable states in any three-dimensional Hilbert subspace (5 classes which also appear in two-dimensional subspaces and were found and analysed by Boyer et al. (Phys Rev A 95:032308, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.032308), and 9 novel classes which appear only in three-dimensional subspaces), describe their geometries, and provide figures illustrating them. We also generalise these results to characterise the sets of fully separable states (and hence the complementary sets of somewhat entangled states) in three-dimensional subspaces of multipartite systems. Our results show which geometrical forms quantum entanglement can and cannot take in low-dimensional subspaces.

TI Experimental Analysis of Quantum Annealers and Hybrid Solvers Using
   Benchmark Optimization Problems
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper studies the Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on D-Wave quantum systems. Motivated by the fact that most libraries present their benchmark instances in terms of adjacency matrices, we develop a novel matrix formulation for the HCP and TSP Hamiltonians, which enables the seamless and automatic integration of benchmark instances in quantum platforms. We also present a thorough mathematical analysis of the precise number of constraints required to express the HCP and TSP Hamiltonians. This analysis explains quantitatively why, almost always, running incomplete graph instances requires more qubits than complete instances. It turns out that QUBO models for incomplete graphs require more quadratic constraints than complete graphs, a fact that has been corroborated by a series of experiments. Moreover, we introduce a technique for the min-max normalization for the coefficients of the TSP Hamiltonian to address the problem of invalid solutions produced by the quantum annealer, a trend often observed. Our extensive experimental tests have demonstrated that the D-Wave Advantage_system4.1 is more efficient than the Advantage_system1.1, both in terms of qubit utilization and the quality of solutions. Finally, we experimentally establish that the D-Wave hybrid solvers always provide valid solutions, without violating the given constraints, even for arbitrarily big problems up to 120 nodes.

TI Impact of Surface Functionalization on NV Quantum Properties:
   Implications for Biosensing with Fluorescent Nanodiamonds
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds are rapidly redefining the frontiers of quantum sensing in biological systems, offering exceptional photostability, biocompatibility, and sensitivity through their nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However, unlocking their full potential as quantum sensors in living systems demands precise and robust covalent functionalization to ensure stable, targeted interaction with biomolecular structures without compromising NV performance. This work presents a systematic investigation of advanced surface modification strategies that can be utilized for quantum sensing in biological systems. Two bioorthogonal approaches are investigated: biotinylation, harnessing the ultra-high affinity of the biotin-streptavidin system, and maleimide conjugation, which enables site-specific binding to cysteine-tagged proteins. The influence of covalent surface modifications on the spin and optical properties of NV centers, specifically charge state stability and spin relaxation time, is examined to establish correlations between nanoscale chemical modification and quantum sensing performance. Photoluminescence spectroscopy, T 1 relaxometry, and advanced single-particle measurements of fluorescence lifetimes using a confocal Anti-Brownian Electrokinetic trap are employed to systematically investigate these properties in both individual nanodiamonds and particle ensembles. This work provides crucial insights into how the molecular architecture of the surface governs the charge stability and spin dynamics of NV centers, establishing a foundation for the rational engineering of diamond-based quantum sensors.

TI Coherent control and shift of exceptional points in micro-ring
   resonators via resonant frequency through four-level N-type atomic
   medium
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Coherent control of exceptional points (EPs) through resonant frequency manipulation is a pressing question in the field of non-Hermitian physics. EPs, distinguished by the coalescence of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, possess unusual properties that can be a basis for various applications, including sensitivity enhancement, energy harvesting, and signal processing. The current article explores coherent control, with a focus on the resonant frequency as a key parameter. Resonant frequency plays a significant role in the behavior of EPs. It is possible to control their properties and coherent behavior by adjusting the system's physical parameters, such as the index of refraction, size of the micro-ring resonators, and material properties, to match the desired resonant frequency. Through this control mechanism, it is possible to tailor the transmission and reflection properties of waves, enhancing or suppressing certain modes, and to modify the sensitivity of the system to external perturbations. The present work may enable us to design novel devices for optical communication, sensing, and signal processing, and it may open possibilities for controlling entanglement and coherence in quantum information processing.

TI Dynamic decoupling for multi-level systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Dynamical decoupling refers to a family of techniques that are widely used to suppress decoherence in various quantum systems, caused by quasi-static environmental noise. They have broad applications in the field of quantum information processing. Conventional dynamical decoupling targets at noise in two-level system such as qubits and often consists of specifically engineered sequences of & pi; pulses that swap between two different states. On the other hand, researchers do not limit their study within simple two-levels systems any more, but go and seek for even more efficient quantum hardware. A variety of quantum algorithms and schemes of quantum control using multi-level systems, such as qutrits and qudits, for quantum information processing have been proposed and implemented successfully. However, decoherence in such a multi-level system is inherently more sophisticated than that in two-level systems. So far there has been little systematic research on how to tackle decoherence problems in such systems.In this work, we propose several sequences of dynamical decoupling for multi-level systems that only rely on & pi; pulses linking neighboring levels, which is easy to implement experimentally. Our results show that these sequences can efficiently suppress quasi-static noise presented in multi-level systems. In addition, by calculating the corresponding filter functions of these sequences, we are able to further analyze their effect on generic Gaussian noise that may not be quasi-static. We also give a physical explanation of the noise filtering mechanism of these sequences by considering their control functions. Other topics discussed in our work include power spectral density and correlation of noise in multi-level systems. Our work may be regarded as a first step towards a more systematic investigation of dynamical decoupling techniques applicable to multi-level systems.

TI Spin defects in hBN as promising temperature, pressure and magnetic
   field quantum sensors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in two-dimensional materials potentially offer unique advantages for quantum sensing in terms of sensitivity and functionality. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride as sensors of magnetic field, temperature and pressure, and show that their performance is comparable or exceeds that of existing platforms.
   Spin defects in solid-state materials are strong candidate systems for quantum information technology and sensing applications. Here we explore in details the recently discovered negatively charged boron vacancies (V-B(-)) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and demonstrate their use as atomic scale sensors for temperature, magnetic fields and externally applied pressure. These applications are possible due to the high-spin triplet ground state and bright spin-dependent photoluminescence of the V-B(-). Specifically, we find that the frequency shift in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements is not only sensitive to static magnetic fields, but also to temperature and pressure changes which we relate to crystal lattice parameters. We show that spin-rich hBN films are potentially applicable as intrinsic sensors in heterostructures made of functionalized 2D materials.

TI Levitons in correlated nano-scale systems
SO CHAOS
AB In this short review (written to celebrate David Campbell's 80th birthday), we provide a theoretical description of quantum transport in nanoscale systems in the presence of single-electron excitations generated by Lorentzian voltage drives, termed Levitons. These excitations allow us to realize the analog of quantum optics experiments using electrons instead of photons. Importantly, electrons in condensed matter systems are strongly affected by the presence of different types of non-trivial correlations, with no counterpart in the domain of photonic quantum optics. After providing a short introduction about Levitons in non-interacting systems, we focus on how they operate in the presence of two types of strong electronic correlations in nanoscale systems, such as those arising in the fractional quantum Hall effect or in superconducting systems. Specifically, we consider Levitons in a quantum Hall bar of the fractional quantum Hall effect, pinched by a quantum point contact, where anyons with fractional charge and statistics tunnel between opposite edges. In this case, a Leviton-Leviton interaction can be induced by the strongly correlated background. Concerning the effect of superconducting correlations on Levitons, we show that, in a normal metal system coupled to BCS superconductors, half-integer Levitons minimize the excess noise in the Andreev regime. Interestingly, energy-entangled electron states can be realized on-demand in this type of hybrid setup by exploiting crossed Andreev reflection. The results exposed in this review have potential applications in the context of quantum information and computation with single-electron flying qubits.

TI NV microscopy of thermally controlled stresses caused by thin Cr2O3
   films
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Many modern applications, including quantum computing and quantum sensing, use substrate-film interfaces. Particularly, thin films of chromium or titanium and their oxides are commonly used to bind various structures, such as resonators, masks, or microwave antennas, to a diamond surface. Due to different thermal expansions of involved materials, such films and structures could produce significant stresses, which need to be measured or predicted. In this paper, we demonstrate imaging of stresses in the top layer of diamond with deposited structures of Cr2O3 at temperatures 19 & DEG;C and 37 & DEG;C by using stress-sensitive optically detected magnetic resonances (ODMR) in NV centers. We also calculated stresses in the diamond-film interface by using finite-element analysis and correlated them to measured ODMR frequency shifts. As predicted by the simulation, the measured high-contrast frequency-shift patterns are only due to thermal stresses, whose spin-stress coupling constant along the NV axis is 21 & PLUSMN;1 MHz/GPa, that is in agreement with constants previously obtained from single NV centers in diamond cantilever. We demonstrate that NV microscopy is a convenient platform for optically detecting and quantifying spatial distributions of stresses in diamond-based photonic devices with micrometer precision and propose thin films as a means for local application of temperature-controlled stresses. Our results also show that thin-film structures produce significant stresses in diamond substrates, which should be accounted for in NV-based applications.

TI Ultra-secure quantum protection for e-healthcare images: Hybrid chaotic
   one-time pad with cipher chaining encryption framework
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum computing introduces major threats to conventional image encryption methods, especially in medical contexts. This paper addresses these threats by developing a quantum-resistant encryption scheme for medical images. We present a novel framework combining: (1) a novel Mixed Logistic-Ikeda-Henon (MLIH) chaotic map for pseudorandom key generation, (2) quantum image representation using the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) model, and (3) a two-stage encryption process employing Controlled-Not (CNOT) gate chaining for diffusion and One-Time Pad (OTP) with MLIH-generated keys for confusion. The RGB channels are processed separately through quantum state conversion, CNOT-based diffusion, and keyed confusion before final recombination. To validate practical feasibility, the proposed encryption scheme was implemented on IBM's 127-qubit ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, demonstrating real-world feasibility. Experimental validation shows near-ideal entropy (7.9977), superior NPCR (99.97%) and UACI (33.89%) values, and an expansive key space (21952). The novel MLIH demonstrates a 12.7% improvement in logic gate efficiency compared to conventional chaotic and the image encryption has quantum advantage through parallel CNOT operations. The hardware execution yielded a throughput of 4,500 Circuit Layer Operations Per Second (CLOPS), indicating efficient real-time performance on NISQ devices, Moreover, the echoed cross-resonance (ECR) gate error remained within a median of 1.1 x 10(-)2, supporting reliable circuit execution. The proposed scheme outperforms contemporary quantum and classical encryption approaches in terms of entropy, NPCR, UACI, and key sensitivity, all while maintaining a computational complexity of O(n), ensuring scalability. This study effectively bridges the gap between theoretical quantum security models and real-world implementation on existing NISQ devices, demonstrating resilience against classical statistical and differential attacks, as well as quantum-specific threats such as Grover's brute-force search and quantum chosen-plaintext attacks. The successful deployment of IBM quantum hardware positions this scheme as a viable solution for secure medical image transmission in quantum-era healthcare systems.

TI Edge states in plasmonic meta-arrays
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Photonic edge states provide a novel platform to control and enhance light-matter interactions. Recently, it becomes increasing popular to generate such localized states using the bulk-edge correspondence of topological photonic crystals. While the topological approach is elegant, the design and fabrication of these complex photonic topological crystals is tedious. Here, we report a simple and effective strategy to construct and steer photonic edge state in a plasmonic meta-array, which just requires a small number of plasmonic nanoparticles to form a simple lattice. To demonstrate the idea, different lattice configurations, including square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices of meta-arrays, are fabricated and measured by using an ultrahigh spatial resolution photoemission electron microscopy. The properties of edge states depend on the geometric details such as the row and column number of the lattice, as well as the gap distance between the particles. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the excited edge states can be used for the generation of the quantum entanglement. This work not only provides a new platform for the study of nanoscale photonic devices, but also open a new way for the fundamental study of nanophotonics based on edge states.

TI Quantum-Resilient Blockchain for Secure Digital Identity Verification in
   DeFi
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The rapid evolution of quantum computing poses significant threats to traditional cryptographic schemes, particularly in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems that rely on legacy mechanisms like RSA and ECDSA for digital identity verification. This paper proposes a quantum-resilient, blockchain-based identity verification framework designed to address critical challenges in privacy preservation, scalability, and post-quantum security. The proposed model integrates Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC), specifically lattice-based cryptographic primitives, with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Zero-knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure verifiability, anonymity, and resistance to quantum attacks. A dual-layer architecture is introduced, comprising an identity layer for credential generation and validation, and an application layer for DeFi protocol integration. To evaluate its performance, the framework is tested on multiple real-world DeFi platforms using metrics such as verification latency, throughput, attack resistance, energy efficiency, and quantum attack simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 90% latency reduction and over 35% throughput improvement compared to traditional blockchain identity solutions. It also exhibits a high quantum resistance score (95/100), with successful secure verification under simulated quantum adversaries. The revocation mechanism-implemented using Merkle-tree-based proofs-achieves average response times under 40 ms, and the system maintains secure operations with energy consumption below 9 J per authentication cycle. Additionally, the paper presents a security and cost tradeoff analysis using ZKP schemes such as Bulletproofs and STARKs, revealing superior bits-per-byte efficiency and reduced proof sizes. Real-world adoption scenarios, including integration with six major DeFi protocols, indicate a 25% increase in verified users and a 15% improvement in Total Value Locked (TVL). The proposed solution is projected to remain secure until 2041 (basic version) and 2043 (advanced version), ensuring long-term sustainability and future-proofing against evolving quantum threats. This work establishes a scalable, privacy-preserving identity model that aligns with emerging post-quantum security standards for decentralized ecosystems.

TI Programmable frequency-bin quantum states in a nano-engineered silicon
   device
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Frequency-bin qubits get the best of time-bin and dual-rail encodings, but require external modulators and pulse shapers to build arbitrary states. Here, instead, the authors work directly on-chip by controlling the interference of biphoton amplitudes generated in multiple, coherently-pumped ring resonators.
   Photonic qubits should be controllable on-chip and noise-tolerant when transmitted over optical networks for practical applications. Furthermore, qubit sources should be programmable and have high brightness to be useful for quantum algorithms and grant resilience to losses. However, widespread encoding schemes only combine at most two of these properties. Here, we overcome this hurdle by demonstrating a programmable silicon nano-photonic chip generating frequency-bin entangled photons, an encoding scheme compatible with long-range transmission over optical links. The emitted quantum states can be manipulated using existing telecommunication components, including active devices that can be integrated in silicon photonics. As a demonstration, we show our chip can be programmed to generate the four computational basis states, and the four maximally-entangled Bell states, of a two-qubits system. Our device combines all the key properties of on-chip state reconfigurability and dense integration, while ensuring high brightness, fidelity, and purity.

TI Enabling photonic integrated 3D magneto-optical traps for quantum
   sciences and applications
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Cold atoms play an important role in fundamental physics, precision timekeeping, quantum and gravitational sensing, precision metrology, and quantum computing. The three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D-MOT) is a fundamental tool used to create large populations of cold atoms and serves as an integral component for a wide range of quantum and atomic experiments. The 3D-MOT employs laboratory-scale laser systems to trap, cool, manipulate, and interrogate atoms and quantum states. Photonic integration has reached a point where it is possible to generate, control, and deliver light to atomic transitions and provides a path to integrated 3D-MOTs. We review progress and discuss potential paths toward integration of 3D-MOT lasers and optics with focus on the ultra-low loss silicon nitride photonic integration platform. We review 3D-MOT technology, building blocks and components, and discuss characteristics of the lasers, optics, and atomic physics package. We discuss how the silicon nitride platform can be used to perform MOT functions including cooling, trapping, and spectroscopy. An illustrative example of a rubidium photonic integrated MOT (PICMOT) is used to describe possible paths forward to integration. We also discuss how photonic integration can support lower temperatures and atom trapping and manipulation in integrated cold-atom platforms for quantum sensing and computing.

TI Effect of dilute impurities on short graphene Josephson junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB A supercurrent can flow across the junction between two superconductors without any applied voltage. Here, the authors show how non-magnetic impurities in these so-called Josephson junctions made from graphene reduce the critical current, the maximum possible supercurrent, and skews the relationship between current and phase.
   Despite the structural simplicity of graphene, its mechanical and electronic remarkable properties make this material a credible starting point for new technologies across a wide range of fields. The recent realizations of graphene-based hybrid systems, such as Josephson junctions, make graphene a promising a platform for new generations of devices for topological quantum computing and quantum sensing. To this aim, accurate control of the electronic properties of graphene Josephson junctions in the presence of disorder is essential. Here, we study the effect of a dilute homogeneous spatial distribution of non-magnetic impurities on the equilibrium supercurrent sustained by a ballistic graphene Josephson junction in the short junction limit. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach and modeling impurities by the Anderson model we derive the supercurrent and its equilibrium power spectrum. We find a modification of the current-phase relation with a reduction of the skewness induced by disorder, and a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the critical current. The potentialities of the supercurrent power spectrum for accurate spectroscopy of the hybridized Andreev bound states-impurities spectrum are highlighted. In the low temperature limit, the supercurrent zero frequency thermal noise directly probes the spectral function at the Fermi energy.

TI Phase sensitivity for an SU(1,1) interferometer via multiphoton
   subtraction at the output port
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the field of quantum precision measurement, enhancing phase sensitivity is crucial for various applications, including quantum metrology and quantum sensing technologies. We theoretically investigate the improvement in phase sensitivity and quantum Fisher information achieved through multiphoton subtraction operations at the output port of an SU(1,1) interferometer under conditions of photon loss. We use vacuum and coherent states as the inputs and detect the outputs by intensity detection. The results indicate that internal photon losses within the SU(1,1) interferometer have a more significant impact on the phase sensitivity compared to external photon losses. Moreover, increasing the number of photon subtractions m effectively enhances both the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information. Notably, even under conditions of severe photon loss, the multiphoton subtraction operations can enable the phase sensitivity to surpass the standard quantum limit, approaching both the Heisenberg limit and the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. This study provides a new theoretical basis for enhancing the phase sensitivity in the SU(1,1) interferometer.

TI Analysis of Atom against quantum attacks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB A significant amount of study is being done to review the security promises made for the various ciphers now in use as a result of the development of quantum computing technology. A general attack against symmetric key cryptography primitives that can reduce search costs to the square root is Grover's search algorithm. To implement Grover's algorithm, it is necessary that the target cipher be implemented as a quantum circuit. Despite being relatively new, this area of study has received significant attention from the research community. The authors have estimated the cost of Grover's key search attack against the stream cipher Atom, for the first time, under circuit depth restrictions defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardisation process. The authors implement the quantum circuit of Atom in QISKIT, (open-source software development kit for working with quantum computers running on IBM Quantum Experience). The results are also compared with other existing literature on LFSR-based stream ciphers, such as Grain-v1, Grain-128-AEAD, and Lizard. The authors also find that, to the best of their knowledge, in the existing literature on estimating the cost of Grover's attack on symmetric ciphers, Atom is the only 128-bit key cipher that meets the threshold of approximate to 2170 set by NIST for quantum security of 128-bit key ciphers. The authors also analyse the security of Atom against quantum TMDTO attacks.

   Infeasible Solutions Feasible: A Proof of Concept with the Maximum
   Independent Set Problem and 3-SAT
SO JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS
AB Over the past decade, the usefulness of quantum annealing hardware for combinatorial optimization has been the subject of active debate. Although current analog quantum machines do not guarantee optimality, operating instead as heuristic solvers, the technology is evolving rapidly. Beyond performance alone, this emerging technologies offers fundamentally new approaches to problem-solving that are not readily accessible to classical exact methods particularly in dynamic environments or online optimization settings. This paper focuses on one such approaches: Reverse Quantum Annealing (RQA). Unlike classical exact methods, RQA allows the optimization process to begin from an initial infeasible solution by embedding it directly into the qubits' initial state. We leverage this capability by formulating problem constraints as penalty terms within Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models, thereby preserving infeasible solutions within the quantum search space. We propose iterative strategies that apply RQA in three distinct modes to rapidly repair infeasible solutions. These methods are evaluated on two well-known NP-hard problems: the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and the 3-SAT problem. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RQA in steering infeasible configurations toward feasibility, offering promising potential for real-time applications where problem data may change suddenly and solutions must be repaired swiftly.

TI Spectrally stable nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond formed by carbon
   implantation into thin microstructures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) in diamond, with its exceptional spin coherence and convenience in optical spin initialization and readout, is increasingly used both as a quantum sensor and as a building block for quantum networks. Employing photonic structures for maximizing the photon collection efficiency in these applications typically leads to broadened optical linewidths for the emitters, which are commonly created via nitrogen ion implantation. With studies showing that only native nitrogen atoms contribute to optically coherent NVs, a natural conclusion is to either avoid implantation completely or substitute nitrogen implantation by an alternative approach to vacancy creation. Here, we demonstrate that implantation of carbon ions yields a comparable density of NVs as implantation of nitrogen ions and that it results in NV populations with narrow optical linewidths and low charge-noise levels even in thin diamond microstructures. We measure a median NV linewidth of 150 MHz for structures thinner than 5 mu m, with no trend of increasing linewidths down to the thinnest measured structure of 1.9 mu m. We propose a modified NV creation procedure in which the implantation is carried out after instead of before the diamond fabrication processes and confirm our results in multiple samples implanted with different ion energies and fluences.

TI HeriLedger-A New Generation of Blockchains for Cultural Heritage
   Preservation
SO SENSORS
AB The immense success of Bitcoin has also highlighted the hidden potential of blockchains and distributed ledgers in general. However, most blockchains are based on the so-called Proof-of-Work principle, which requires significant resources, making them unsuitable for the growing number of Internet of Things devices, not to mention other problems such as ensuring privacy and resistance to quantum computing. This paper, therefore, analyses current approaches in the field of ledgers with applications for the Internet of Things. Based on this, it presents a new ledger architecture for cultural heritage preservation that is energy sustainable and tailored to smartphones while pushing the deployment boundaries closer to the rest of the Internet of Things world. It is also resistant to quantum computing and provides privacy with accountability. Moreover, the developed solution considers not only the core technological structure but also its broader social (business) context, i.e., links to the tourism sector. This is performed by incorporating the relevant business model, as business models are important for the successful adoption of new technologies.

TI Simulation of a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization for a
   realistic neutral-atom system with an optimized small-angle
   controlled-phase gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In contrast to the classical optimization process required by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, FALQON, a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization [A. B. Magann et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 250502 (2022)], enables one to obtain approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems without any classical optimization effort. In this study, we leverage the specifications of a recent experimental platform for the neutral-atom system [Z. Fu et al., Phys. Rev. A 105, 042430 (2022)] and present a scheme to implement an optimally tuned small-angle controlled-phase gate. By examining the two- to four-qubit FALQON algorithms in the MaxCut problem and considering the spontaneous emission of the neutral atomic system, we observe that the performance of FALQON implemented with small-angle controlled-phase gates exceeds that of FALQON utilizing controlled-Z gates. This approach has the potential to significantly simplify the logic circuit required to simulate FALQON and effectively address the MaxCut problem, which may pave the way for the experimental implementation of near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms with neutral-atom systems.

TI An efficient adaptive variational quantum solver of the Schrodinger
   equation based on reduced density matrices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Recently, adaptive variational quantum algorithms, e.g., Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter-Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) and Iterative Qubit-Excitation Based-Variational Quantum Eigensolver (IQEB-VQE), have been proposed to optimize the circuit depth, while a huge number of additional measurements make these algorithms highly inefficient. In this work, we reformulate the ADAPT-VQE with reduced density matrices (RDMs) to avoid additional measurement overhead. With Valdemoro's reconstruction of the three-electron RDM, we present a revised ADAPT-VQE algorithm, termed ADAPT-V, without any additional measurements but at the cost of increasing variational parameters compared to the ADAPT-VQE. Furthermore, we present an ADAPT-Vx algorithm by prescreening the anti-Hermitian operator pool with this RDM-based scheme. ADAPT-Vx requires almost the same variational parameters as ADAPT-VQE but a significantly reduced number of gradient evaluations. Numerical benchmark calculations for small molecules demonstrate that ADAPT-V and ADAPT-Vx provide an accurate description of the ground- and excited-state potential energy curves. In addition, to minimize the quantum resource demand, we generalize this RDM-based scheme to circuit-efficient IQEB-VQE algorithm and achieve significant measurement reduction.

AB Although quantum computing has been attracting increasing attention, hardware restrictions are tight in current implementations. Intensive design exploration is therefore essential to match requirements, such as the problem scale and acceptable error rate, with potential designs to combine quantum computing and classical computing. The design decision made in this way is often fragile as it is sensitive to the problem scale as well as still evolving quantum services. We need continuous design decision, or adaptation and evolution, given changes in requirements or environments. In this paper, we present a framework for model-based engineering to support the continuous adaptation and evolution of quantum-classical hybrid systems. Modeling in our framework involves not only potential designs, but also rationale or evidence of design decision, which often requires simulation and experiments. This focus allows for tracing and analyzing whether the past decision is still valid or not, or whether there is uncertainty and we need further simulation and experiments. The usage of the framework is demonstrated with an example problem from steel manufacturing.

TI Trapped Atoms and Superradiance on an Integrated Nanophotonic Microring
   Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Interfacing cold atoms with integrated nanophotonic devices could offer new paradigms for engineering atom-light interactions and provide a potentially scalable route for quantum sensing, metrology, and quantum information processing. However, it remains a challenging task to efficiently trap a large ensemble of cold atoms on an integrated nanophotonic circuit. Here, we demonstrate direct loading of an ensemble of up to 70 atoms into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit. Efficient trap loading is achieved by employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling in the microtrap, where a built-in spin-motion coupling arises directly from the vector light shift of the evanescent-field potential on a microring. Atoms are cooled into the trap via optical pumping with a single free space beam. We have achieved a trap lifetime approaching 700 ms under continuous cooling. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.

TI On the effects of biased quantum random numbers on the initialization of
   artificial neural networks
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB Recent advances in practical quantum computing have led to a variety of cloud-based quantum computing platforms that allow researchers to evaluate their algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A common property of quantum computers is that they can exhibit instances of true randomness as opposed to pseudo-randomness obtained from classical systems. Investigating the effects of such true quantum randomness in the context of machine learning is appealing, and recent results vaguely suggest that benefits can indeed be achieved from the use of quantum random numbers. To shed some more light on this topic, we empirically study the effects of hardware-biased quantum random numbers on the initialization of artificial neural network weights in numerical experiments. We find no statistically significant difference in comparison with unbiased quantum random numbers as well as biased and unbiased random numbers from a classical pseudo-random number generator. The quantum random numbers for our experiments are obtained from real quantum hardware.

AB The quantum computing (QC) field is rapidly moving beyond the realm of pure science to become a commercially viable technology that may be able to overcome the drawbacks of traditional computing. Major technology tycoons have spent in building coding frameworks and hardware to create applications specifically designed for quantum computing over the last few years. The development of QC hardware is accelerating, however, the requirement for software-intensive methodology, approaches, procedures, instruments, roles and responsibilities for creating industrial-focused quantum software applications arises from operationalizing the QC. This paper outlines the concept of quantum software engineering (QSE) life cycle, which entails the engineering of quantum requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintenance of quantum software. This paper notably advocates for collaborative efforts between the industrial community and software engineering research to propose practical solutions to support the complete activities for the development of quantum software. The proposed vision makes it easier for researchers and practitioners to suggest new procedures, reference designs, cutting-edge equipment, and methods for utilizing quantum computers and creating the newest and most advanced quantum software.

TI Hardware-tailored diagonalization circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A central building block of many quantum algorithms is the diagonalization of Pauli operators. Although it is always possible to construct a quantum circuit that simultaneously diagonalizes a given set of commuting Pauli operators, only resource-efficient circuits can be executed reliably on near-term quantum computers. Generic diagonalization circuits, in contrast, often lead to an unaffordable SWAP gate overhead on quantum devices with limited hardware connectivity. A common alternative is to exclude two-qubit gates altogether. However, this comes at the severe cost of restricting the class of diagonalizable sets of Pauli operators to tensor product bases (TPBs). In this article, we introduce a theoretical framework for constructing hardware-tailored (HT) diagonalization circuits. Our framework establishes a systematic and highly flexible procedure for tailoring diagonalization circuits with ultra-low gate counts. We highlight promising use cases of our framework and - as a proof-of-principle application - we devise an efficient algorithm for grouping the Pauli operators of a given Hamiltonian into jointly-HT-diagonalizable sets. For several classes of Hamiltonians, we observe that our approach requires fewer measurements than conventional TPB approaches. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that HT circuits can improve the efficiency of estimating expectation values with cloud-based quantum computers.

TI Hybrid Quantum Image Classification and Federated Learning for Hepatic
   Steatosis Diagnosis
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB In the realm of liver transplantation, accurately determining hepatic steatosis levels is crucial. Recognizing the essential need for improved diagnostic precision, particularly for optimizing diagnosis time by swiftly handling easy-to-solve cases and allowing the expert time to focus on more complex cases, this study aims to develop cutting-edge algorithms that enhance the classification of liver biopsy images. Additionally, the challenge of maintaining data privacy arises when creating automated algorithmic solutions, as sharing patient data between hospitals is restricted, further complicating the development and validation process. This research tackles diagnostic accuracy by leveraging novel techniques from the rapidly evolving field of quantum machine learning, known for their superior generalization abilities. Concurrently, it addresses privacy concerns through the implementation of privacy-conscious collaborative machine learning with federated learning. We introduce a hybrid quantum neural network model that leverages real-world clinical data to assess non-alcoholic liver steatosis accurately. This model achieves an image classification accuracy of 97%, surpassing traditional methods by 1.8%. Moreover, by employing a federated learning approach that allows data from different clients to be shared while ensuring privacy, we maintain an accuracy rate exceeding 90%. This initiative marks a significant step towards a scalable, collaborative, efficient, and dependable computational framework that aids clinical pathologists in their daily diagnostic tasks.

TI Measurement-free preparation of grid states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing potentially offers exponential speed-ups over classical computing for certain tasks. A central, outstanding challenge to making quantum computing practical is to achieve fault tolerance, meaning that computations of any length or size can be realized in the presence of noise. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code is a promising approach toward fault-tolerant quantum computing, encoding logical qubits into grid states of harmonic oscillators. However, for the code to be fault tolerant, the quality of the grid states has to be extremely high. Approximate grid states have recently been realized experimentally, but their quality is still insufficient for fault tolerance. Current implementable protocols for generating grid states rely on measurements of ancillary qubits combined with either postselection or feed forward. Implementing such measurements take up significant time during which the states decohere, thus limiting their quality. Here, we propose a measurement-free preparation protocol, which deterministically prepares arbitrary logical grid states with a rectangular or hexagonal lattice. The protocol can be readily implemented in trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit platforms to generate high-quality grid states using only a few interactions, even with the noise levels found in current systems.

TI Nearly tight Trotterization of interacting electrons
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider simulating quantum systems on digital quantum computers. We show that the performance of quantum simulation can be improved by simultaneously exploiting commutativity of the target Hamiltonian, sparsity of interactions, and prior knowledge of the initial state. We achieve this using Trotterization for a class of interacting electrons that encompasses various physical systems, including the plane-wave-basis electronic structure and the Fermi-Hubbard model. We estimate the simulation error by taking the transition amplitude of nested commutators of the Hamiltonian terms within the eta-electron manifold. We develop multiple techniques for bounding the transition amplitude and expectation of general fermionic operators, which may be of independent interest. We show that it suffices to use (n(5/3/)eta(2/3/)eta(2/3)) n(o)(1) gates to simulate electronic structure in the plane-wave basis with n spin orbitals and eta electrons, improving the best previous result in second quantization up to a negligible factor while outperforming the first-quantized simulation when n = eta(2)-o(1). We also obtain an improvement for simulating the FermiHubbard model. We construct concrete examples for which our bounds are almost saturated, giving a nearly tight Trotterization of interacting electrons.

TI Contraction Heuristics for Tensor Decision Diagrams
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we study the equivalence problem for quantum circuits: Given two quantum circuits, are they equivalent? We reduce this problem to the contraction problem of a tensor network. The order in which the contraction operations between tensors are applied has a crucial impact on efficiency, which is why many heuristics have been proposed. In this work, we use an efficient representation of tensors as a tensor decision diagram. Since existing contraction heuristics do not perform well in combination with these diagrams, we propose two new contraction heuristics. We demonstrate experimentally that our heuristics outperform other state-of-the-art heuristics. We also demonstrate that our framework yields state-of-the-art performance for equivalence checking.

TI Robust violation of a multipartite Bell inequality from the perspective
   of a single-system game
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Recently, Fan et al. [Mod. Phys. Lett. A 36, 2150223 (2021)] presented a generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, to identify N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. They showed an interesting phenomenon that the maximal violation of the generalized CHSH inequality is robust under some specific noises. In this work, we map the inequality to the CHSH game, and consequently to the CHSH* game in a single-qubit system. This mapping provides an explanation for the robust violations in N-qubit systems. Namely, the robust violations, resulting from the degeneracy of the generalized CHSH operators correspond to the symmetry of the maximally entangled two-qubit states and the identity transformation in the single-qubit game. This explanation enables us to exactly demonstrate that the degeneracy is 2(N-2).

TI Quantum Advantage from Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Random
   Shallow Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study random constant-depth quantum circuits in a two-dimensional (2D) architecture. While these circuits only produce entanglement between nearby qubits on the lattice, long-range entanglement can be generated by measuring a subset of the qubits of the output state. It is conjectured that this long-range measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) proliferates when the circuit depth is at least a constant critical value d*. For circuits composed of Haar-random two-qubit gates, it is also believed that this coincides with a quantum advantage phase transition in the classical hardness of sampling from the output distribution. Here, we provide evidence for a quantum advantage phase transition in the setting of random Clifford circuits. Our work extends the scope of recent separations between the computational power of constantdepth quantum and classical circuits, demonstrating that this kind of advantage is present in canonical random circuit sampling tasks. In particular, we show that in any architecture of random shallow Clifford circuits, the presence of long-range MIE gives rise to an unconditional quantum advantage. In contrast, any depth-d 2D quantum circuit that satisfies a short-range MIE property can be classically simulated efficiently and with depth O(d). Finally, we introduce a 2D depth-2 "coarse-grained" circuit architecture, composed of random Clifford gates acting on O(log(n)) qubits, for which we prove the existence of longrange MIE and establish an unconditional quantum advantage.

TI Improving resilience of quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses
   to decoherence using three superpositions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently, a protocol called quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) that aims to test the quantum nature of gravity using the entanglement of two qubits was proposed. The entanglement can arise only if the force between the two spatially superposed masses is occurring via the exchange of a mediating virtual graviton. In this paper we examine a possible improvement of the QGEM setup by introducing a third mass with an embedded qubit so that there are now three qubits to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. We compare the entanglement generation for different experimental setups with two and three qubits and find that a three-qubit setup where the superpositions are parallel to each other leads to the highest rate of entanglement generation within tau = 5 s. We show that the three-qubit setup is more resilient to the higher rate of decoherence. The entanglement can be detected experimentally for the two-qubit setup if the decoherence rate gamma is gamma < 0.11 Hz compared to gamma < 0.16 Hz for the three-qubit setup. However, the introduction of an extra qubit means that more measurements are required to characterize entanglement in an experiment. We conduct experimental simulations and estimate that the three-qubit setup would allow detecting the entanglement in the QGEM protocol at a 99.9% certainty with O(10(4))-O(10(5)) measurements when gamma is an element of [0.1, 0.15] Hz. Furthermore, we find that the number of needed measurements can be reduced to O(10(3))-O(10(5)) if the measurement schedule is optimized using joint Pauli basis measurements. For gamma > 0.06 Hz the three-qubit setup is favorable compared to the two-qubit setup in terms of the minimum number of measurements needed to characterize the entanglement. Thus, the proposed setup here provides a promising avenue for implementing the QGEM experiment.

TI Hybrid Dynamic Galois Field with Quantum Resilience for Secure IoT Data
   Management and Transmission in Smart Cities Using Reed-Solomon (RS) Code
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The Internet of Things (IoT), which is characteristic of the current industrial revolutions, is the connection of physical devices through different protocols and sensors to share information. Even though the IoT provides revolutionary opportunities, its connection to the current Internet for smart cities brings new opportunities for security threats, especially with the appearance of new threats like quantum computing. Current approaches to protect IoT data are not immune to quantum attacks and are not designed to offer the best data management for smart city applications. Thus, post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is still in its research stage, aims to solve these problems. To this end, this research introduces the Dynamic Galois Reed-Solomon with Quantum Resilience (DGRS-QR) system to improve the secure management and communication of data in IoT smart cities. The data preprocessing includes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and min-max normalization and then applying the Galois Field Adaptive Expansion (GFAE). Optimization of the quantum-resistant keys is accomplished by applying Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithms. Also, role-based access control provides strong cloud data security, and quantum resistance is maintained by refreshing keys every five minutes of the active session. For error correction, Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are used which provide data reliability. Data management is performed using an attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Att-Bi-LSTM) model with skip connections to provide optimized city management. The proposed approach was evaluated using key performance metrics: a key generation time of 2.34 s, encryption time of 4.56 s, decryption time of 3.56 s, PSNR of 33 dB, and SSIM of 0.99. The results show that the proposed system is capable of protecting IoT data from quantum threats while also ensuring optimal data management and processing.

TI Leveraging Small-Scale Quantum Computers with Unitarily Downfolded
   Hamiltonians
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, we propose a quantum unitary downfolding formalism based on the driven similarity renormalization group (QDSRG) that may be combined with quantum algorithms for both noisy and fault-tolerant hardware. The QDSRG is a classical polynomial-scaling downfolding method that avoids the evaluation of costly three-and higher-body reduced density matrices while retaining the accuracy of classical multireference many-body theories. We calibrate and test the QDSRG on several challenging chemical problems and propose a strategy for reducing the measurement cost. We report QDSRG compu-tations of two chemical systems using the variational quantum eigensolver on IBM quantum devices: (i) the dissociation curve of H2 using a quintuple-zeta basis and (ii) the bicyclobutane isomerization reaction to trans-butadiene, demonstrating the reduction of problems that require several hundred qubits to a single qubit. Our work shows that the QDSRG is a viable approach to leverage near-term quantum devices for estimating molecular properties with chemical accuracy, using only up to the diagonal elements of the two-body reduced density matrix of the reference state.

TI Hybrid quantum neural networks for efficient protein-ligand binding
   affinity prediction
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.

TI Quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) vs. classical LSTM in time series
   forecasting: a comparative study in solar power forecasting
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Accurate solar power forecasting is pivotal for the global transition towards sustainable energy systems. This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.

TI Low-overhead defect-adaptive surface code with bandage-like
   super-stabilizers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB To make practical quantum algorithms work, large-scale quantum processors protected by error-correcting codes are required to resist noise and ensure reliable computational outcomes. However, a major challenge arises from defects in processor fabrication, as well as occasional losses or cosmic rays during the computing process, all of which can lead to qubit malfunctions and disrupt error-correcting codes' normal operations. In this context, we introduce an automatic adapter to implement the surface code on defective lattices. Unlike previous approaches, this adapter leverages newly proposed bandage-like super-stabilizers to save more qubits when defects are clustered, thus enhancing the code distance and reducing super-stabilizer weight. For instance, in comparison with earlier methods, with a code size of 27 and a random defect rate of 2%, the disabled qubits decrease by 1/3, and the average preserved code distance increases by 63%. This demonstrates a significant reduction in overhead when handling defects using our approach, and this advantage amplifies with increasing processor size and defect rates. Our work presents a low-overhead, automated solution to the challenge of adapting the surface code to defects, an essential step towards scaling up the construction of large-scale quantum computers for practical applications.

TI Mitigation of frequency collisions in superconducting quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The reproducibility of qubit parameters is a challenge for scaling up superconducting quantum processors. Signal cross talk imposes constraints on the frequency separation between neighboring qubits. The frequency uncertainty of transmon qubits arising from the fabrication process is attributed to deviations in the Josephson junction area, tunnel barrier thickness, and the qubit shunt capacitor. We decrease the sensitivity to these variations by fabricating larger Josephson junctions and reduce the wafer-level standard deviation in resistance down to 2%. We characterize 32 identical transmon qubits and demonstrate the reproducibility of the qubit frequencies with a 40 MHz standard deviation (i.e., 1%) with qubit quality factors exceeding 2 million. We perform two-level-system (TLS) spectroscopy and observe no significant increase in the number of TLSs causing qubit relaxation. We further show by simulation that for our parametric-gate architecture, and accounting only for errors caused by the uncertainty of the qubit frequency, we can scale up to 100 qubits with an average of only three collisions between quantum-gate transition frequencies, assuming 2% cross talk and 99.9% target gate fidelity.

TI Hybrid Classical-Quantum Kernel Learning for Scalable and Secure Link
   State Prediction in Software-Defined Networks
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) with their centralized control system and enhancedprogrammability requires a sophisticated approach to predict link states in complex network topologies.While predictive performance of traditional machine learning (ML) models remains high on static data,they struggle under dynamic and imbalanced network behavior. Although Quantum Machine Learning(QML) offers a promising solution by leveraging quantum-enhanced kernels to discover non-linearpatterns, current quantum hardware constraints limit its standalone applicability. This paper presents anextended hybrid classical-quantum learning framework for SDN link state prediction under both benign(stable) and attack (compromised) conditions, integrating classical preprocessing with quantum kernelembedding via the ZZFeatureMap. A tunable parameter alpha is an element of [0,1]enables dynamic interpolation betweenclassical Radial Basis Function (RBF) and quantum kernels. On a stratified 5,000-sample subset ofthe InSDN dataset, which contains both normal and attack traffic flows, the hybrid Quantum SupportVector Machine (QSVM) achieves 85% accuracy, 0.92 ROC-AUC, and 0.73 Average Precision (AP).Scalability experiments on 20,000 samples confirm stable performance using Nystr & ouml;m-approximatedkernels. Comparative evaluations with existing core classical, gradient boosting, and deep learningapproaches highlight hybrid QSVM's tunable expressivity, controlled computational scaling, and robustnessto data distribution shifts, demonstrating its potential for future quantum-enabled SDN analytics.

TI Improving Bitcoin's Post-Quantum Transaction Efficiency With a Novel
   Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme Based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and
   a STARK Protocol
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper proposes a novel lattice-based aggregate signature (LAS) scheme that brings post-quantum security to the Bitcoin system without sacrificing its transaction efficiency. Bitcoin currently employs Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is insecure against the emerging quantum technology, so post-quantum signature schemes like the proposed LAS will become necessary in the near future. However, most of the post-quantum signatures schemes have large signature sizes which decrease Bitcoin's efficiency. Even CRYSTALS-Dilithium, the most prominent post-quantum signature scheme chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has this adverse limitation: it would cause Bitcoin's transaction efficiency to fall by 17 times from 2759.36622 transactions per block (tpb) to 159.48374 tpb. The existing signature schemes are unable to resolve this efficiency problem for Bitcoin. We crafted a novel LAS scheme based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (STARK) protocol to tackle this problem. The proposed LAS scheme takes full advantage of signature aggregation using the STARK protocol and Dilithium's easy and fast implementation, thus generating signatures with post-quantum security and small signature sizes which are critical to transaction efficiency. Our proofs convey the correctness, compactness, and post-quantum security of our scheme in the quantum random oracle model, and our implementation in Python conveyed that the proposed scheme would only decrease Bitcoin's transaction efficiency by 3 times, a significant improvement from using Dilithium and other lattice-based aggregate signature schemes. Our proposed scheme has many advantages over the existing schemes and will become very valuable to Bitcoin.

TI Hybrid quantum neural networks with variational quantum regressor for
   enhancing QSPR modeling of CO2-capturing amine
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Accurate amine property prediction is essential for optimizing CO2 capture efficiency in post-combustion processes. Quantum machine learning (QML) can enhance predictive modeling by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and interference to capture complex correlations. In this study, we developed hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNN) to improve quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling for CO2-capturing amines. By integrating variational quantum regressors with classical multi-layer perceptrons and graph neural networks, quantum-enhanced performance was explored in physicochemical property prediction under noiseless conditions and robustness was evaluated against quantum hardware noise using IBM quantum systems. Our results showed that HQNNs improve predictive accuracy for key solvent properties, including basicity, viscosity, boiling point, melting point, and vapor pressure. The fine-tuned and frozen pre-trained HQNN models with 9 qubits consistently achieved the highest rankings, highlighting the benefits of integrating quantum layers with pre-trained classical models. Furthermore, simulations under hardware noise confirmed the robustness of HQNNs, maintaining predictive performance. Overall, these findings emphasize the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in molecular modeling. As quantum hardware and QML algorithms continue to advance, practical quantum benefits in QSPR modeling and materials discovery are expected to become increasingly attainable, driven by improvements in quantum circuit design, noise mitigation, and scalable architectures.

TI Quantum Attacks on Type-1 Generalized Feistel Schemes
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Generalized Feistel schemes (GFSs) are extremely important and extensively researched cryptographic schemes. In this paper, the security of Type-1 GFS in quantum circumstances is investigated. On the one hand, in the qCCA setting, a new quantum polynomial-time distinguisher on (d2-1)$(d<^>2-1)$-round Type-1 GFS with branches d & GE;3$d\ge 3$ is given, which extends the previous results by (d-2)$(d-2)$ rounds. This leads to a more efficient analysis of type-1 GFS, that is, the complexity of some previous key-recovery attacks is reduced by a factor of 2(d-2)k2$2<^>{\frac{(d-2)k}{2}}$, where k is the key length of the internal round function. On the other hand, for CAST-256, which is a certain block cipher based on Type-1 GFS, a 17-round quantum distinguisher in the qCPA setting is given. Based on this, an r(r>17)$r (r>17)$-round quantum key-recovery attack with complexity O(237(r-17)2)$O(2<^>{\frac{37(r-17)}{2}})$ is constructed.

TI Ultrastrong Capacitive Coupling of Flux Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A flux qubit can interact strongly when it is capacitively coupled to other circuit elements. This interaction can be separated into two parts, one acting on the qubit subspaces and one in which excited states mediate the interaction. The first term dominates the interaction between the flux qubit and an LC resonator, leading to ultrastrong couplings of the form sigma(y)(a + a dagger), which complement the inductive sigma(x)i(a dagger - a) coupling. However, when coupling two flux qubits capacitively, all terms need to be taken into account, leading to complex nonstoquastic ultrastrong interaction of types sigma(y)(1)sigma(y)(2), sigma(z)(1)sigma(z)(2), and sigma(x)(1)sigma(x)(2). Our theory explains all these interactions, describing them in terms of general circuit properties-coupling capacitances, qubit gaps, inductive, Josephson and capacitive energies-that apply to a wide variety of circuits and flux qubit designs.

TI Nonlocal advantages of quantum imaginarity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum imaginarity and quantum nonlocality capture the essence of quantumness of a physical system from different aspects. We establish a connection between the imaginarity and quantum nonlocality in any two-qubit states. Based on the imaginarity l 1-norm and relative entropy, we derive complementary relations among the quantum imaginarities with respect to any set of mutually unbiased bases for arbitrary qubit states. Based on these complementary relations, we introduce the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI). We show that any two-qubit state with NAQI is quantum steerable, but not vice versa. In addition, we investigate the exclusion property of NAQI in three-qubit pure states.

TI Quantum Single-Photon Control, Storage, and Entanglement Generation with
   Planar Atomic Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB While artificially fabricated patterned metasurfaces are providing paradigm-shifting optical components for classical light manipulation, strongly interacting, controllable, and deterministic quantum interfaces between light and matter in free space remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we theoretically demonstrate how to achieve quantum control of both the electric and magnetic components of an incident single-photon pulse by engineering the collective response of a two-dimensional atomic array. High-fidelity absorption and storage in a long-lived subradiant state, and its subsequent retrieval, are achieved by controlling classically or quantum-mechanically the ac Stark shifts of the atomic levels and suppressing the scattering during the absorption. Quantum wave-front control of the transmitted photon with nearly zero reflection is prepared by coupling the collective state of the array to another photon in a cavity and by engineering a Huygens' surface of atoms using only a single coherent standing wave. The proposed schemes allow for the generation of entanglement between the cavity, the lattice, and hence the state of the stored, reflected, or transmitted light, and for quantum-state transfer between the cavity and propagating photons. Bipartite entanglement generation is explicitly calculated between a stored single-photon excitation of the array and the cavity photon. We illustrate the control by manipulating the phase, phase superposition, polarization, and direction of a transmitted or reflected photon, providing quantum-optical switches and functional quantum interfaces between light and atoms that could form links in a larger quantum information platform.

TI Efficient generation of multiqubit entanglement states using rapid
   adiabatic passage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose the implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) scheme to generate entanglement in Rydberg atom-array systems. This method transforms a product state in a multiqubit system into an entangled state with high fidelity and robustness. By employing global and continuous driving laser fields, we demonstrate the generation of a two-qubit Bell state and a three-qubit W state, via sequential RAP pulses within the Rydberg blockade regime. As an illustrative example, applying this technique to alkali-metal atoms, we predict fidelities exceeding 0.9995 for the two-qubit Bell and three-qubit W state, along with excellent robustness. Furthermore, our scheme can be extended to generate entanglement between weakly coupled atoms and to create four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through spatial correlations. Our approach holds the potential for extension to larger atomic arrays, offering a straightforward and efficient method to generate high-fidelity entangled states in neutral atom systems.

TI Ancilla-free continuous-variable SWAP test
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a continuous-variable (CV) SWAP test that requires no ancilla register, thereby generalizing the ancilla-free SWAP test for qubits. In this ancilla-free CV SWAP test, the computational basis measurement is replaced by photon number-resolving measurement, and we calculate an upper bound on the error of the overlap estimate obtained from a finite Fock cutoff in the detector. As an example, we show that estimation of the overlap of pure, centered, single-mode Gaussian states of energy E and squeezed in opposite quadratures can be obtained to error epsilon using photon statistics below a Fock basis cutoff O(E ln epsilon(-1)). This cutoff is greatly reduced to E + O(root E ln epsilon(-1)) when the states have rapidly decaying Fock tails, such as coherent states. We show how the ancilla-free CV SWAP test can be extended to many modes and applied to quantum algorithms such as variational compiling and entanglement spectroscopy in the CV setting. For the latter we also provide a new algorithm which does not have an analog in qubit systems. The ancilla-free CV SWAP test is implemented on Xanadu's 8-mode photonic processor in order to estimate the vacuum probability of a two-mode squeezed state.

TI Guaranteed efficient energy estimation of quantum many-body Hamiltonians
   using ShadowGrouping
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Estimation of the energy of quantum many-body systems is a paradigmatic task in various research fields. In particular, efficient energy estimation may be crucial in achieving a quantum advantage for a practically relevant problem. For instance, the measurement effort poses a critical bottleneck for variational quantum algorithms. We aim to find the optimal strategy with single-qubit measurements that yields the highest provable accuracy given a total measurement budget. As a central tool, we establish tail bounds for empirical estimators of the energy. They are helpful for identifying measurement settings that improve the energy estimate the most. This task constitutes an NP-hard problem. However, we are able to circumvent this bottleneck and use the tail bounds to develop a practical, efficient estimation strategy, which we call ShadowGrouping. As the name indicates, it combines shadow estimation methods with grouping strategies for Pauli strings. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that ShadowGrouping improves upon state-of-the-art methods in estimating the electronic ground-state energies of various small molecules, both in provable and practical accuracy benchmarks. Hence, this work provides a promising way, e.g., to tackle the measurement bottleneck associated with quantum many-body Hamiltonians.

TI Graph states of atomic ensembles engineered by photon-mediated
   entanglement
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Graph states are a broad family of entangled quantum states, each defined by a graph composed of edges representing the correlations between subsystems. Such states constitute versatile resources for quantum computation and quantum-enhanced measurement. Their generation and engineering require a high level of control over entanglement. Here we report on the generation of continuous-variable graph states of atomic spin ensembles, which form the nodes of the graph. We program the entanglement structure encoded in the graph edges by combining global photon-mediated interactions in an optical cavity with local spin rotations. By tuning the entanglement between two subsystems, we either localize correlations within each subsystem or enable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering-a strong form of entanglement that enables the extraction of precise information from one subsystem through measurements on the other. We further engineer a four-mode square graph state, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. Our method is scalable to larger and more complex graphs, laying groundwork for measurement-based quantum computation and advanced protocols in quantum metrology.
   Photon-mediated entanglement in atomic ensembles coupled to cavities enables the engineering of quantum states with a graph-like entanglement structure. This offers potential advantages in quantum computation and metrology.

TI Quantum violation of LGI under an energy constraint for different
   scenarios systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we consider a qubit in four scenarios: with drive, without drive, and in the presence of dissipation and dephasing, to investigate the quantum violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) in an energy constraint. In the case of the energy constraint, we find that under the coarsening measurement in reference and final resolution, the quantum violation of the LGI for the pure qubit is the most robust; on the other hand, the quantum violation of the LGI for the dephasing qubit is the most vulnerable, and the quantum violation of the LGI for driven qubit lies between that of pure qubit and dissipation qubit. Under the coarsening of measurement temporal reference, the quantum violation of the LGI for the pure qubit is more robust than that of the qubit with driven. Moreover, in the case of a qubit that is subjected to driving and is in the presence of dissipation and dephasing, the robustness of quantum violations of the LGI for these scenario systems will become vulnerable, with the driven intensity and the rate of spontaneous emission increasing, respectively, for coarsening measurement both in reference and in final resolution. In addition, in the energy constraint and the projective measurement, the LGI can attain its maximum violation value, 1.5, for the coherent dynamics; while for drive, dissipative and dephasing qubits, the LGI cannot attain the value of 1.5. For systems in the presence of dissipation and dephasing, we find that in the energy constraint, the robustness of the coarsening measurement in final resolution exhibits more vulnerable than that of the coarsening measurement in reference. And for systems with drive and without drive, the robustness of the coarsening measurement in temporal reference is the most robust, and the robustness of the coarsening of measurement final measurement resolution is the most vulnerable.

TI QPUF: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions for Security-by-Design of
   Industrial Internet-of-Things
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB This research investigates the integration of quantum hardware-assisted security into critical applications, including the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), Smart Grid, and Smart Transportation. The Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUF) architecture has emerged as a robust security paradigm, harnessing the inherent randomness of quantum hardware to generate unique and tamper-resistant cryptographic fingerprints. This work explores the potential of Quantum Computing for Security-by-Design (SbD) in the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), aiming to establish security as a fundamental and inherent feature. SbD in Quantum Computing focuses on ensuring the security and privacy of Quantum computing applications by leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, which underpin the quantum computing infrastructure. This research presents a scalable and sustainable security framework for the trusted attestation of smart industrial entities in Quantum Industrial Internet-of-Things (QIoT) applications within Industry 4.0. Central to this approach is the QPUF, which leverages quantum mechanical principles to generate unique, tamper-resistant fingerprints. The proposed QPUF circuit logic has been deployed on IBM quantum systems and simulators for validation. The experimental results demonstrate the enhanced randomness and an intra-hamming distance of approximately 50% on the IBM quantum hardware, along with improved reliability despite varying error rates, coherence, and decoherence times. Furthermore, the circuit achieved 100% reliability on Google's Cirq simulator and 95% reliability on IBM's quantum simulator, highlighting the QPUF's potential in advancing quantum-centric security solutions.

TI Coherence dynamics induced by attenuation and amplification Gaussian
   channels
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Quantum Gaussian channels play a key role in quantum information theory. In particular, the attenuation and amplification channels are useful to describe noise and decoherence effects on continuous variables systems. They are directly associated with the beam splitter and two-mode squeezing operations, which have operational relevance in quantum protocols with bosonic models. An important property of these channels is that they are Gaussian completely positive maps, and the action on a general input state depends on the parameters characterizing the channels. In this work, we study the coherence dynamics introduced by these channels on input Gaussian states. We derive explicit expressions for the coherence depending on the parameters describing the channels. By assuming a displaced thermal state with initial coherence as input state, for the attenuation case it is observed a revival of the coherence as a function of the transmissivity coefficient, whereas for the amplification channel the coherence reaches asymptotic values depending on the gain coefficient. Further, we obtain the entropy production for these classes of operations, showing that it can be reduced by controlling the parameters involved. We write a simple expression for computing the entropy production due to the coherence for both channels. This can be useful to simulate many processes in quantum thermodynamics, as finite-time driving on bosonic modes.

TI Spin-State-Selective Excitation in Spin Defects of Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional platform for quantum sensing due to its optically addressable spin defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB -). Spectral overlap of spin transitions due to large hyperfine interactions has limited its magnetic sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate spin-selective excitation of VB - spin defects in hBN driven by a circularly polarized microwave. Using a cross-shaped microwave resonance waveguide, we superimpose two orthogonally linearly polarized microwaves shifted in phase from an FPGA to generate circularly polarized microwaves. This enables selective spin |0 > -> |-1 > or |0 > -> |1 > excitation of VB - defects, as confirmed by optically detected magnetic resonance experimentally and supported computationally. We also investigate the influence of the magnetic field on spin-state selectivity. Our technique enhances the hBN platform for quantum sensing through better spin state control and magnetic sensitivity at low and zero fields.

TI Quantum Toffoli gate in hybrid optomechanical system
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB An quantum Toffoli gate based on optomechanical system is proposed. By exploring the hybrid optomechanical system, we show that there are equivalence third order Kerr nonlinear effects between optical and mechanical modes. Through parameter analysis, we find that the nonlinear coefficient can be much stronger than the one under natural conditions. By taking advantage of this nonlinear effect, we can achieve high fidelity photon-phonon Toffoli gate. In the presence of dissipation and noise, we calculate the implementation time and fidelity of Toffoli gate. In addition, the application of this protocol in universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is also analyzed. Our study provides an effective platform for hybrid quantum computation.

TI Proposal for transduction between microwave and optical photons using
   167Er-doped yttrium orthosilicate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Efficient transduction devices that reversibly convert optical and microwave quantum signals into each other are essential for integrating different technologies. Rare-earth ions in solids, and in particular erbium ions, with both optical and microwave addressable transitions are promising candidates for designing transducers. We propose a microwave-to-optical quantum transducer scheme based on the dark state protocol in 167Er doped into yttrium orthosilicate (YSO) at zero external magnetic fields. Zero-field operation is beneficial for superconducting resonators that can incur extra losses in magnetic fields. By calculating the fidelity and efficiency of the transducer, considering the most important imperfections, we show that an efficient conversion is possible with a high fidelity. We also investigate the microwave transitions of 167Er:YSO that can be used for the transducer protocol.

TI Spectral Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference between Independently Generated
   Single Photons for Scalable Frequency-Domain Quantum Processing
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The photon's frequency degree of freedom, being compatible with mature telecom infrastructure, offers large potential for the stable and controllable realization of photonic quantum processing applications such as the quantum internet. The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, as a two-photon interference phenomenon, serves as a central building block for such frameworks. A key element yet missing to enable meaningful frequency-based implementations as well as scalability in the number of processed photons, is the demonstration of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect between independently created photons of different frequencies. The experimental implementation of bosonic and fermionic frequency domain Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independently generated single photons is reported here, with measured visibilities of 74.31% +/- 3.56% and 86.44% +/- 8.27%, respectively. This is achieved through a scalable photonic frequency circuit that creates two post-selected pure single photons, which undergo frequency mixing at an electro-optic phase modulator. The system is on-the-fly reconfigurable allowing to probe bosonic and fermionic Hong-Ou-Mandel interference in the same experimental setup. The work demonstrates the versatility of frequency domain processing and its scalability toward higher photon numbers, which enables new quantum gate concepts as well as the establishment of frequency-based large-scale quantum networks.

TI Quantum-Inspired Equilibrium Optimizer for Linear Antenna Array
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB With the rapid development of communication technology, the problem of antenna array optimization plays a crucial role. Among many types of antennas, line antenna arrays (LAA) are the most commonly applied, but the side lobe level (SLL) reduction is still a challenging problem. In the radiation process of the linear antenna array, the high side lobe level will interfere with the intensity of the antenna target radiation direction. Many conventional methods are ineffective in obtaining the maximum side lobe level in synthesis, and this paper proposed a quantum equilibrium optimizer (QEO) algorithm for line antenna arrays. Firstly, the linear antenna array model consists of an array element arrangement. Array factor (AF) can be expressed as the combination of array excitation amplitude and position in array space. Then, inspired by the powerful computing power of quantum computing, an improved quantum equilibrium optimizer combining quantum coding and quantum rotation gate strategy is proposed. Finally, the proposed quantum equilibrium optimizer is used to optimize the excitation amplitude of the array elements in the linear antenna array model by numerical simulation to minimize the interference of the side lobe level to the main lobe radiation. Six different metaheuristic algorithms are used to optimize the excitation amplitude in three different arrays of line antenna arrays, the experimental results indicated that the quantum equilibrium optimizer is more advantageous in obtaining the maximum side lobe level reduction. Compared with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, the quantum equilibrium optimizer has advantages in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.

TI Diagnosing first- and second-order phase transitions with probes of
   quantum chaos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We explore quantum phase transitions using two probes of quantum chaos: out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and the r-parameter obtained from the level spacing statistics. In particular, we address p-spin models associated with quantum annealing or reverse annealing. Quantum annealing triggers first-order or second-order phase transitions, which is crucial for the performance of quantum devices. We find that the time-averaging OTOCs for the ground state and the average r-parameter change behavior around the corresponding transition points, diagnosing the phase transition. Furthermore, they can identify the order (first or second) of the phase transition by their behavior at the quantum transition point, which changes abruptly (smoothly) in the case of first-order (second-order) phase transitions.

TI Optimization of Composite Pulses Based on Shortcuts to Adiabaticity
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective The rapid development of quantum technologies, particularly quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, has placed unprecedented demands on the precision and robustness of quantum control techniques. In real-world quantum systems, control fields are inevitably subject to imperfections, such as pulse length deviations, detuning errors, and environmental noise, which can significantly degrade the fidelity and reliability of quantum operations. To address these challenges, robust control strategies are essential for maintaining coherence and achieving high-fidelity quantum state manipulation under imperfect conditions. Composite pulse sequences (CPs) have emerged as widely used techniques for mitigating systematic errors by designing sequences of pulses with specific relative phases and amplitudes. However, traditional composite pulse schemes often require long durations or rely on heuristic design principles, limiting their applicability in fast and large-scale quantum operations. In this paper, we aim to address these limitations by integrating the concept of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) into the design of composite pulses, achieving both fast and robust quantum control. STA methods provide a powerful framework for accelerating adiabatic quantum evolution without requiring long operation times, making them highly suitable for high-speed quantum information processing. By systematically optimizing composite pulse sequences within the STA framework, the goal is to enhance the resilience of quantum control protocols to typical experimental imperfections while maintaining or even improving their operational efficiency. The proposed approach not only contributes to the development of noise-resistant quantum gates and control techniques but also provides new theoretical insights into the intersection of dynamical control and geometric robustness, which has broad implications for the scalability of next-generation quantum technologies. Methods In this paper, we focus on the design and optimization of CPs for robust quantum control in a two-level quantum system. The central methodology involves integrating the STA framework, specifically inverse engineering techniques, into the construction of CPs. These STA-based techniques are used to tailor the system's dynamics, enabling rapid population transfer between quantum states while minimizing non-adiabatic transitions. We begin by establishing a two-level quantum system driven by time-dependent external control fields, explicitly incorporating typical experimental imperfections such as detuning fluctuations and pulse duration errors. The initial focus is on optimizing single-pulse operations, particularly the 7r-pulse for population inversion and the 7r/2-pulse for beam-splitting. These fundamental pulses are optimized using the STA framework, wherein the actual dynamical phase accumulated during evolution is carefully engineered to follow the adiabatic trajectory within a finite time. To extend this approach to composite control schemes, we apply an optimized STA single-pulse protocol to construct 7r-CPs. This involves deriving unitary propagator expressions for both the conventional resonant 7r-pulse and the STA-optimized 7r-pulse. Based on these propagators, we formulate the overall evolution operator for the CPs. By analyzing the total propagator under pulse length and detuning errors, we derive the error cancellation conditions for both the traditional and STA-enhanced sequences.
   These analytical conditions are then used to solve for the optimal phase distribution across the components of the CPs. Results and Discussions In the STA optimization of single pulses, we obtain the optimal parameters for both 7r-pulses [Fig. 1(a)] and 7r/2-pulses [Fig. 1(b)] by designing the actual dynamical phase to follow a prescribed adiabatic path, under the presence of detuning and pulse length errors. Numerical simulations are performed to compute the fidelity of these pulses across a range of error magnitudes. The results consistently show that STA-optimized pulses exhibit significantly enhanced robustness compared to conventional resonant pulses, with notably higher fidelity retention under both types of errors [Fig. 1(c)-(d)]. Building upon this foundation, we apply the STA design scheme to known rectangular 7r-CPs (Tables 1-2), which are classically used to suppress either pulse length or detuning errors. Following the method outlined in the previous section, we replace the standard 7r-pulses in the sequence with STA-optimized 7r-pulses and recalculate the overall propagator and resulting fidelity. Simulation results reveal that the STA-optimized CPs outperform their rectangular counterparts, showing improved tolerance to both pulse length and detuning imperfections (Fig. 3). This confirms that the STA optimization method is effective in enhancing the robustness of 7r-CPs. However, when the same optimization framework is extended to non-7r-CPs (Fig. 4), the method fails to produce improved performance (Fig. 5). Further theoretical analysis shows that for sequences such as (7r/2)phi 1, 7r phi 2, ..., 7r phi N-1, (7r/2)phi N, the STA protocol does not effectively allow reverse engineering of the control field, thus failing to establish the necessary conditions for robustness enhancement. We provide a formal proof (Appendix) demonstrating the intrinsic limitations of STA optimization in non-7r-CPs, highlighting the need for alternative approaches in such cases. Conclusions In this paper, we develop a novel optimization strategy for CPs by integrating the inverse engineering framework, based on quantum invariants. By carefully designing the system's evolution parameters, we ensure that the STA-driven dynamics remain fully consistent with those of traditional resonant control, thus enabling STA optimization of CPs. The results demonstrate that the optimized sequences exhibit significantly improved robustness against pulse length and detuning errors compared to conventional CPs composed of resonant pulses. The effectiveness of this approach lies in its ability to accelerate quantum state evolution via STA while preserving the intrinsic phase interference properties of CPs, which are essential for error cancellation. This synergy between STA and CPs design leads to higher fidelity operations under realistic noise conditions. However, our findings also indicate that this optimization strategy is primarily effective for 7r-CPs. When applied to more general non-7r-CPs like (7r/2)phi 1, 7r phi 2, ..., 7r phi N-1, (7r/2)phi N, the method does not yield performance improvements, due to inherent constraints in implementing effective reverse control under such configurations. Theoretical analysis confirms the potential of STA-based techniques to advance quantum control, particularly in enhancing the performance of error-robust pulse sequences.
   Future work may explore the extension of this method to more generalized CPs, including those with nontrivial phase structures or non-7r rotation angles, further expanding the applicability of STA in robust quantum system manipulation.

TI Adjustable-depth quantum circuit for position-dependent coin operators
   of discrete-time quantum walks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Discrete-time quantum walks with position-dependent coin operators have numerous applications. For a position dependence that is sufficiently smooth, it has been provided in Nzongani et al. (Quantum circuits for discrete-time quantum walks with position-dependent coin operator, arXiv:2211.05271, 2022) an approximate quantum-circuit implementation of the coin operator that is efficient. If we want the quantum-circuit implementation to be exact (e.g., either, in the case of a smooth position dependence, to have a perfect precision, or in order to treat a non-smooth position dependence), but the depth of the circuit not to scale exponentially, then we can use the linear-depth circuit of the previous reference, which achieves a depth that is linear at the cost of introducing an exponential number of ancillas. In this paper, we provide an adjustable-depth quantum circuit for the exact implementation of the position-dependent coin operator. The lower the depth of the circuit is, the more we have to add ancillary qubits, so this adjustable-depth circuit we propose is the right tool for a good adaptation to the experimental platform: one will typically reduce the depth as much as the experimental platform can handle the added ancillary qubits that go with the reduction of the depth. This adjustable-depth circuit consists in (i) applying in parallel, with a linear-depth circuit, only certain operator-packs of coin operators (rather than all of them as in the original linear-depth circuit), each pack contributing linearly to the depth, and in (ii) applying sequentially these packs, which contributes exponentially to the depth. Hence, given an input position state, one has to wait the right operator-pack to apply the coin operator to the coin state of this position. The key technical point of this work, which is the main technical novelty with respect to the previous reference, is that the one-hot encoding of the ancillary positions at the beginning of each operator-pack is selective, that is, we perform this encoding only for certain positions (those whose internal state we want to apply the coin operator to).

Our adaptation improves upon the original NPA hierarchy by using smaller certificates and fewer constraints, although it can only be applied to certify synchronous correlations.

For applications, we show that the existence of symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases can be verified or invalidated with only two certificates of our adapted NPA hierarchy.

TI Synthetic Z2 gauge theories based on parametric excitations
   of trapped ions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Resource efficient fi cient schemes for the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories can benefit fi t from hybrid encodings of gauge and matter fi elds that use the native degrees of freedom, such as internal qubits and motional phonons in trapped-ion devices. We propose to use a parametric scheme to induce a tunneling of the phonons conditioned to the internal qubit state which, when implemented with a single trapped ion, corresponds to a minimal Z 2 gauge theory. To evaluate the feasibility of this scheme, we perform numerical simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to generalize this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number of ions, moving from a single link to a Z 2 plaquette, and to an entire Z 2 chain. We present analytical expressions for the gaugeinvariant dynamics and the corresponding confinement, fi nement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state simulations.

TI Multiparticle quantum walk-based error correction algorithm with
   two-lattice Bose-Hubbard model
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB When the evolution of discrete time quantum walk is carried out for particles, the ramble state is prone to error due to the influence of system noise. A multiparticle quantum walk error correction algorithm based on the two-lattice Bose-Hubbard model is proposed in this study. First, two point Bose-Hubbard models are constructed according to the local Euclidean generator, and it is proved that the two elements in the model can be replaced arbitrarily. Second, the relationship between the transition intensity and entanglement degree of the particles in the model is obtained by using the Bethe hypothesis method. Third, the position of the quantum lattice is coded and the quantum state exchange gate is constructed. Finally, the state replacement of quantum walk on the lattice point is carried out by switching the walker to the lattice point of quantum error correction code, and the replacement is carried out again. The entanglement of quantum particles in the double-lattice Bose-Hubbard model is simulated numerically. When the ratio of the interaction between particles and the transition intensity of particles is close to 0, the entanglement operation of quantum particles in the model can be realized by using this algorithm. According to the properties of the Bose-Hubbard model, quantum walking error correction can be realized after particle entanglement. This study introduces the popular restnet network as a training model, which increases the decoding speed of the error correction circuit by about 33%. More importantly, the lower threshold limit of the convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder is increased from 0.0058 under the traditional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) to 0.0085, which realizes the stable progress of quantum walk with high fault tolerance rate.

TI Single-copy activation of Bell nonlocality via broadcasting of quantum
   states
SO QUANTUM
AB Activation of Bell nonlocality refers to the phenomenon that some entangled mixed states that admit a local hidden variable model in the standard Bell scenario nevertheless reveal their nonlocal nature in more exotic measurement scenarios. We present such a scenario that involves broadcasting the local subsystems of a single-copy of a bipartite quantum state to multiple parties, and use the scenario to study the nonlocal properties of the two-qubit isotropic state:
   rho alpha = alpha vertical bar Phi(+)><Phi(+)| + (1 - alpha) 1/4
   We present two main results, considering that Nature allows for (i) the most general no-signalling correlations, and (ii) the most general quantum correlations at the level of any hidden variable theory. We show that the state does not admit a local hidden variable description for alpha > 0.559 and alpha > 1/2, in cases (i) and (ii) respectively, which in both cases provides a device-independent certification of the entanglement of the state. These bounds are significantly lower than the previously best-known bound of 0.697 for both Bell nonlocality and device-independent entanglement certification using a single copy of the state. Our results show that strong examples of non-classicality are possible with a small number of resources.

TI State-Insensitive Trapping of Alkaline-Earth Atoms in a Nanofiber-Based
   Optical Dipole Trap
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Neutral atoms that are optically trapped using the evanescent fields surrounding optical nanofibers are a promising platform for developing quantum technologies and exploring fundamental science, such as quantum networks and many-body physics of interacting photons. Building on the successful advancements with trapped alkali atoms, here we trap strontium-88 atoms, an alkaline-earth element, in a state-insensitive, nanofiber-based optical dipole trap using the evanescent fields of an optical nanofiber. Employing a two-color, double magic-wavelength trapping scheme, we realize state-insensitive trapping of the atoms for the kilohertz-wide 5s2 1S0 - 5s5p 3P1,|m|=1 intercombination transition, which we verify by performing high-resolution spectroscopy for an atom-surface distance of about 300 nm. This allows us to experimentally find and verify the state insensitivity of the trap nearby a theoretically predicted magic wavelength of 435.827(25) nm, a necessary step to confirm precision atomic physics calculations. Alkaline-earth atoms also exhibit nonmagnetic ground states and ultranarrow linewidth transitions making them ideal candidates for atomic clocks and precision metrology applications, especially with state-insensitive traps. Additionally, given the low collisional scattering length specific to strontium-88, this work also lays the foundation for developing versatile and robust matter-wave atomtronic circuits over nanophotonic waveguides.

TI Decoherence mitigation by real-time noise acquisition
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We present a scheme to neutralize the dephasing effect induced by classical noise on a qubit. The scheme builds upon the key idea that this kind of noise can be recorded by a classical device during the qubit evolution, and that its effect can be undone by a suitable control sequence that is conditioned on the measurement result. We specifically demonstrate this scheme on a nitrogen-vacancy center that strongly couples to current noise in a nearby conductor. By conditioning the readout observable on a measurement of the current, we recover the full qubit coherence and the qubit's intrinsic coherence time T-2. We demonstrate that this scheme provides a simple way to implement single-qubit gates with an infidelity of 10(-2) even if they are driven by noisy sources, and we estimate that an infidelity of 10(-5) could be reached with additional improvements. We anticipate this method to find widespread adoption in experiments using fast control pulses driven from strong currents, in particular, in nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging, where control of peak currents of 100 mA with a bandwidth of 100 MHz is required.

TI Jarzynski-like equality of nonequilibrium information production based
   on quantum cross-entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The two-time measurement scheme is well studied in the context of quantum fluctuation theorem. However, it becomes infeasible when the random variable determined by a single measurement trajectory is associated with the von Neumann entropy of the quantum states. We employ the one-time measurement scheme to derive a Jarzynski-like equality of nonequilibrium information production by proposing an information production distribution based on the quantum cross-entropy. The derived equality further enables one to explore the roles of the quantum cross-entropy in quantum communications, quantum machine learning, and quantum thermodynamics.

TI Kinetic inductance coupling for circuit QED with spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB While transverse coupling (ox) is commonly used in qubit-resonator systems, longitudinal coupling via oz presents a tantalizing alternative: it does not hybridize the modes, eliminating Purcell decay, and it enables quantum-nondemolition qubit readout independent of the qubit-resonator frequency detuning. Here, we demonstrate longitudinal coupling between a {Cr7Ni} molecular spin qubit ensemble and the kinetic inductance of a granular aluminum superconducting microwave resonator. The inherent frequency independence of this coupling allows for the utilization of a 7.8-GHz readout resonator to measure the full {Cr7Ni} magnetization curve spanning 0-600 mT, corresponding to a spin frequency range of fspin = 0-15 GHz. For 2-GHz detuning from the readout resonator, we measure a 1/e spin relaxation time oft = 0.38 s, limited by phonon decay to the substrate. Based on these results, we propose a path towards longitudinal coupling of single spins to a superconducting fluxonium qubit.

TI A decoherence explanation of the gallium neutrino anomaly
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Gallium radioactive source experiments have reported a neutrino-induced event rate about 20% lower than expected with a high statistical significance. We present an explanation of this observation assuming quantum decoherence of the neutrinos in the gallium detectors at a scale of 2 m. This explanation is consistent with global data on neutrino oscillations, including solar neutrinos, if decoherence effects decrease quickly with energy, for instance with a power law E-r nu with r similar or equal to 12. Our proposal does not require the presence of sterile neutrinos but implies a modification of the standard quantum mechanical evolution equations for active neutrinos.

TI Quantum anomaly detection for collider physics
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We explore the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for anomaly detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In particular, we explore a semi-supervised approach in the four-lepton final state where simulations are reliable enough for a direct background prediction. This is a representative task where classification needs to be performed using small training datasets - a regime that has been suggested for a quantum advantage. We find that Classical Machine Learning (CML) benchmarks outperform standard QML algorithms and are able to automatically identify the presence of anomalous events injected into otherwise background-only datasets.

TI Variational-quantum-eigensolver-inspired optimization for spin-chain
   work extraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The energy extraction from quantum sources is a key task to develop new quantum devices such as quantum batteries (QB). In this context, one of the main figures of merit is the ergotropy, which measures the maximal amount of energy (as work) that can be extracted from the quantum source by means of unitary operations. One of the main issues to fully extract energy from the quantum source is the assumption that any unitary operation can be done on the system. This assumption, in general, fails in practice since the operations that can be done are limited and depend on the quantum hardware (experimental platform) one has available. In this work, we propose an approach to optimize the extractable energy inspired by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In this approach, we explicitly take into account a limited set of unitaries by using the hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) class of parameterized quantum circuits. As a QB we use an one-dimensional spin chain described by a family of paradigmatic first neighbor hamiltonians such as the XXX, XXZ, XY Z, XX, XY, and transverse Ising models. By building our parameterized quantum circuits assuming that different types of connectivity may be available depending on the quantum hardware, we numerically compare the efficiency of work extraction for each model. Our results show that the best efficiency is generally obtained with quantum circuits that have connectivity between first neighbor spins.

This ansatz is widely used in quantum machine learning for learning weakly entangled state approximations. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that in many cases, the objective function is an inner product of almost sparse operators, highlighting the potential for classically simulating such a learning problem with few quantum resources. All our results are experimentally validated across various scenarios.

TI Quantum bath suppression in a superconducting circuit by immersion
   cooling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum circuits interact with the environment via several temperature-dependent degrees of freedom. Multiple experiments to-date have shown that most properties of superconducting devices appear to plateau out at T approximate to 50 mK - far above the refrigerator base temperature. This is for example reflected in the thermal state population of qubits, in excess numbers of quasiparticles, and polarisation of surface spins - factors contributing to reduced coherence. We demonstrate how to remove this thermal constraint by operating a circuit immersed in liquid He-3. This allows to efficiently cool the decohering environment of a superconducting resonator, and we see a continuous change in measured physical quantities down to previously unexplored sub-mK temperatures. The He-3 acts as a heat sink which increases the energy relaxation rate of the quantum bath coupled to the circuit a thousand times, yet the suppressed bath does not introduce additional circuit losses or noise. Such quantum bath suppression can reduce decoherence in quantum circuits and opens a route for both thermal and coherence management in quantum processors.
   Removing excess energy (cooling) and reducing noise in superconducting quantum circuits is central to improved coherence. Lucas et al. demonstrate cooling of a superconducting resonator and its noisy environment to sub-mK temperatures by immersion in liquid He-3.

TI Observation of critical phase transition in a generalized
   Aubry-Andre-Harper model with superconducting circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulation enables study of many-body systems in non-equilibrium by mapping to a controllable quantum system, providing a powerful tool for computational intractable problems. Here, using a programmable quantum processor with a chain of 10 superconducting qubits interacted through tunable couplers, we simulate the one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper model for three different phases, i.e., extended, localized and critical phases. The properties of phase transitions and many-body dynamics are studied in the presence of quasi-periodic modulations for both off-diagonal hopping coefficients and on-site potentials of the model controlled respectively by adjusting strength of couplings and qubit frequencies. We observe the spin transport for initial single- and multi-excitation states in different phases, and characterize phase transitions by experimentally measuring dynamics of participation entropies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recently developed tunable coupling architecture of superconducting processor extends greatly the simulation realms for a wide variety of Hamiltonians, and can be used to study various quantum and topological phenomena.

TI Schur-Weyl Duality for the Clifford Group with Applications: Property
   Testing, a Robust Hudson Theorem, and de Finetti Representations
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Schur-Weyl duality is a ubiquitous tool in quantum information. At its heart is the statement that the space of operators that commute with the t-fold tensor powers U-circle times t of all unitaries U is an element of U(d) is spanned by the permutations of the t tensor factors. In this work, we describe a similar duality theory for tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of quantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The duality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite geometries. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications:
   We resolve an open problem in quantum property testing by showing that "stabilizerness" is efficiently testable: There is a protocol that, given access to six copies of an unknown state, can determine whether it is a stabilizer state, or whether it is far away from the set of stabilizer states. We give a related membership test for the Clifford group.
   We find that tensor powers of stabilizer states have an increased symmetry group. Conversely, we provide corresponding de Finetti theorems, showing that the reductions of arbitrary states with this symmetry are well-approximated by mixtures of stabilizer tensor powers (in some cases, exponentially well).
   We showthat the distance of a pure state to the set of stabilizers can be lower-bounded in terms of the sum-negativity of its Wigner function. This gives a new quantitative meaning to the sum-negativity (and the related mana) - a measure relevant to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The result constitutes a robust generalization of the discrete Hudson theorem.
   We show that complex projective designs of arbitrary order can be obtained from a finite number (independent of the number of qudits) of Clifford orbits. To prove this result, we give explicit formulas for arbitrary moments of random stabilizer states.

TI Does provable absence of barren plateaus imply classical simulability?
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We collect evidence-on a case-by-case basis-that many commonly used models whose loss landscapes avoid barren plateaus can also admit classical simulation, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus, while stressing that quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our analysis sheds doubt on the information processing capabilities of many parametrized quantum circuits with provably barren plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing the (many) caveats in our arguments including the limitations of average case arguments, the role of smart initializations, models that fall outside our assumptions, the potential for provably superpolynomial advantages and the possibility that, once larger devices become available, parametrized quantum circuits could heuristically outperform our analytic expectations.

TI 1D Majorana Goldstinos and partial supersymmetry breaking in quantum
   wires
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Majorana modes realised in topological superconductors are expected to be an important feature for quantum information processing applications. Here, the authors propose an experimental approach to achieve N = 4 supersymmetry in a proximitised semiconducting nanowire and, by spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry, realise 1D helical Majorana modes as Goldstinos.
   Realizing Majorana modes in topological superconductors, i.e., the condensed-matter counterpart of Majorana fermions in particle physics, may lead to a major advance in the field of topologically-protected quantum computation. Here, we introduce one-dimensional, counterpropagating, and dispersive Majorana modes as bulk excitations of a periodic chain of partially-overlapping, zero-dimensional Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires via periodically-modulated fields. This system realizes centrally-extended quantum-mechanical supersymmetry with spontaneous partial supersymmetry breaking. The massless Majorana modes are the Nambu-Goldstone fermions (Goldstinos) associated with the spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Their experimental fingerprint is a dip-to-peak transition in the zero-bias conductance, which is generally not expected for Majorana modes overlapping at a finite distance. Moreover, the Majorana modes can slide along the wire by applying a rotating magnetic field, realizing a "Majorana pump". This may suggest new braiding protocols and implementations of topological qubits.

TI Spectral properties of transverse Laguerre-Gauss modes in parametric
   down-conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The first color photos of the parametric down-conversion (PDC) emission cone illustrate the correlation of longitudinal and transverse momentum in the process, i.e., wavelength-dependent emission angles of PDC photons. However, current experiments and applications are more conveniently described in terms of discrete mode sets, with the most suitable choice depending on the propagation symmetries of the experimental setting. Remarkably, despite the fact that experiments with PDC sources are becoming ever more demanding, e.g., in terms of brightness or state fidelity, a description of spectral-spatial coupling in parametric down-conversion for the case of discrete modal decompositions remains elusive. We present a comprehensive study, in theory and experiment, of the spectral dependence of the transverse Laguerre-Gauss modes in parametric down-conversion. Moreover, we show how the spectral and spatial coupling can be harnessed to tune the purity of the well-known orbital angular momentum entanglement. This paper has implications for efficient collection of entangled photons in a transverse single mode, quantum imaging, and engineering pure states for high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Unitarity of Decoherence Implies Possibility of Decoherence-like
   Dynamics towards Macroscopic Superpositions
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum decoherence is crucial to understanding the emergence of the classical world from the underlying quantum reality. Decoherence dynamics are unitary, although they superselect a preferred eigenbasis. Decoherence dynamics result in stable macroscopic, localized, classical-like states. We show that the above-mentioned facts imply the possibility of the existence of decoherence-like dynamics that result in stable macroscopic non-localized non-classical-like states. Being rooted in the fabric of the decoherence theory itself, this property implies environments that steer the decoherence towards, for example, spatial superpositions of macroscopic objects. To demonstrate this, we provide thought-experimental, mathematical and philosophical arguments.

TI Quantum Bisimilarity via Barbs and Contexts: Curbing the Power of
   Non-deterministic Observers
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Past years have seen the development of a few proposals for quantum extensions of process calculi. The rationale is clear: with the development of quantum communication protocols, there is a need to abstract and focus on the basic features of quantum concurrent systems, like CCS and CSP have done for their classical counterparts. So far, though, no accepted standard has emerged, neither for the syntax nor for the behavioural semantics. Indeed, the various proposals do not agree on what should be the observational properties of quantum values, and as a matter of fact, the soundness of such properties has never been validated against the prescriptions of quantum theory.
   To this aim, we introduce a new calculus, Linear Quantum CCS (lqCCS), and investigate the features of behavioural equivalences based on barbs and contexts. Our calculus can be thought of as an asynchronous, linear version of qCCS, which is in turn based on value-passing CCS. The combination of linearity and asynchronous communication fits well with the properties of quantum systems (e.g. the no-cloning theorem), since it ensures that each qubit is sent exactly once, precisely specifying which qubits of a process interact with the context.
   We exploit contexts to examine how bisimilarities relate to quantum theory. We show that the observational power of general contexts is incompatible with quantum theory: roughly, they can perform non-deterministic moves depending on quantum values without measuring (hence perturbing) them.
   Therefore, we refine the operational semantics in order to prevent contexts from performing unfeasible non-deterministic choices. This induces a coarser bisimilarity that better fits the quantum setting: (i) it lifts the indistinguishability of quantum states to the distributions of processes and, despite the additional constraints, (ii) it preserves the expressiveness of non-deterministic choices based on classical information. To the best of our knowledge, our semantics is the first one that satisfies the two properties above.

AB Programming for today's quantum computers is making significant strides toward modern workflows compatible with high performance computing (HPC), but fundamental challenges still remain in the integration of these vastly different technologies. Quantum computing (QC) programming languages share some common ground, as well as their emerging runtimes and algorithmic modalities. In this short paper, we explore avenues of refinement for the quantum processing unit (QPU) in the context of many-tasks management, asynchronous or otherwise, in order to understand the value it can play in linking QC with HPC. Through examples, we illustrate how its potential for scientific discovery might be realized.

TI Collective excitation of spatio-spectrally distinct quantum dots enabled
   by chirped pulses
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Nanoscale bright sources that produce high-purity single photons and high-fidelity entangled photon pairs are the building blocks to realize high security quantum communication devices. To achieve high communication rates, it is desirable to have an ensemble of quantum emitters that can be collectively excited, despite their spectral variability. In case of semiconductor quantum dots, Rabi rotations are the most popular method for resonant excitation. However, these cannot assure a universal, highly efficient excited state preparation, due to the sensitivity to excitation parameters. In contrast, adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), relying on chirped optical pulses, is immune to quantum dot spectral inhomogeneity. Here, we show that the robustness of ARP holds true for the simultaneous excitation of the biexciton states in multiple, spatially separated and spectrally different quantum dots. For positive chirps, we also find a regime where the influence of phonons relax the sensitivity to spectral detunings and lower the needed excitation power. Being able to generate high-purity photons from spatially multiplexed quantum dot sources using the biexciton to ground state cascade is a big step towards the implementation of high photon rate, entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols.

TI Gate-Controlled Quantum Dots Based on 2D Materials
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB 2D materials are a family of layered materials exhibiting rich exotic phenomena, such as valley-contrasting physics. Down to single-particle level, unraveling fundamental physics and potential applications including quantum information processing in these materials attracts significant research interests. To unlock these great potentials, gate-controlled quantum dot architectures have been applied in 2D materials and their heterostructures. Such systems provide the possibility of electrical confinement, control, and manipulation of single carriers in these materials. In this review, efforts in gate-controlled quantum dots in 2D materials are presented. Following basic introductions to valley degree of freedom and gate-controlled quantum dot systems, the up-to-date progress in etched and gate-defined quantum dots in 2D materials, especially in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, is provided. The challenges and opportunities for future developments in this field, from views of device design, fabrication scheme, and control technology, are discussed. The rapid progress in this field not only sheds light on the understanding of spin-valley physics but also provides an ideal platform for investigating diverse condensed matter physics phenomena and realizing quantum computation in the 2D limit.

TI Reducing the impact of adaptive optics lag on optical and quantum
   communications rates from rapidly moving sources
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Wavefront of light passing through the turbulent atmosphere gets distorted. This causes signal loss in free-space optical communication as the light beam spreads and wanders at the receiving end. Frequency and/or time division multiplexing adaptive optics (AO) techniques have been used to conjugate this kind of wavefront distortion. However, if the signal beam moves relative to the atmosphere, the AO system performance degrades due to high temporal anisoplanatism. Here, we solve this problem by adding a pioneering beacon that is spatially separated from the signal beam with time delay between spatially separated pulses. More importantly, our protocol works irrespective of the signal beam intensity and, hence, is also applicable to secret quantum communication. In particular, using semi-empirical atmospheric turbulence calculation, we show that for low earth orbit satellite-to-ground decoy state quantum key distribution with the satellite at zenith angle <30 degrees, our method increases the key rate by at least 215% and 40% for satellite altitudes of 400 and 800 km, respectively. Finally, we propose a modification of the existing wavelength division multiplexing systems as an effective alternative solution to this problem.

AB In this paper, using the linear entropy criterion to quantify the degree of entanglement, we demonstrate that the addition of photons can enhance the entanglement degree of the photon-added two-mode squeezed vacuum states (PATMSVSs). Besides, the entanglement degree can approach ideal in case of squeezing parameter or number of added photons is high. When using PATMSVSs as entanglement resources to teleport a coherent state via a canonical protocol, the results show that the average fidelity of the quantum teleportation process is enhanced by the photon addition operation. The average fidelity increases as the number of photons added to the two-mode increases. In addition, we show that an enhancement in average fidelity can also be achieved by increasing the squeezing parameter of the TMSVS.

AB Imaging and microscopy are some of the most important tools in modern life science for getting new insights into metabolisms or unravelling bio-chemical processes. However, in particular low-light observations outside the visible spectrum are still challenging and a limiting factor. A rugged, label-free quantum imaging system is presented capable of recording at video rate in the visible regime, while illuminating the sample with undetected light of different wavelength. The results pave the way for a field deployable quantum imaging device allowing live-cell imaging in extreme spectral ranges with a minimal photo dose.

TI Lamb Shift and the Vacuum Rabi Splitting in a Strongly Dissipative
   Environment
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We study the vacuum Rabi splitting of a qubit ultrastrongly coupled to a high-Q cavity mode and a radiation reservoir. Three methods are employed: a numerically exact variational approach with a multiple Davydov ansatz, the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), and the transformed RWA. Agreement between the variational results and the transformed RWA results is found in the regime of validity of the latter, where the RWA breaks down completely. We illustrate that the Lamb shift plays an essential role in modifying the vacuum Rabi splitting in the ultrastrong coupling regime, leading to off-resonant qubit-cavity coupling even though the cavity frequency equals the bare transition frequency of the qubit. Specifically, the emission spectrum exhibits one broad low-frequency peak and one narrow high-frequency peak in the presence of relatively weak cavity-qubit coupling. As the cavity-qubit coupling increases, the low-frequency peak narrows while the high-frequency peak broadens until they have similar widths.

TI Oblivious communication game, self-testing of projective and
   nonprojective measurements, and certification of randomness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We provide an interesting two-party parity-oblivious communication game whose success probability is solely determined by the Bell expression. The parity-oblivious condition in an operational quantum theory implies the preparation noncontextuality in an ontological model of it. We find that the aforementioned Bell expression has two upper bounds in an ontological model: the usual local bound and a nontrivial preparation noncontextual bound arising from the nontrivial parity-oblivious condition, which is smaller that the local bound. We first demonstrate the communication game when both Alice and Bob perform three measurements of dichotomic observables in their respective sites. The optimal quantum value of the Bell expression in this scenario enables us to device-independently self-test the maximally entangled state and trine set of observables, three-outcome qubit positive-operator-valued measures and 1.58 bits of local randomness. Further, we generalize the above communication game in that both Alice and Bob perform the same but arbitrary (odd) number (n > 3) of measurements. Based on the optimal quantum value of the relevant Bell expression for any arbitrary n, we also demonstrate device-independent self-testing of the state and measurements.

TI Low-loss erbium-incorporated rare-earth oxide waveguides on Si with
   bound states in the continuum and the large optical signal enhancement
   in them
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated optical amplifiers are essential building blocks for emerging applications of large-scale and complex silicon photonic integrated circuits. Single-crystal erbium-incorporated rare-earth oxide thin films epitaxially grown on silicon substrate could be a promising material candidate. Based on the mechanism of bound states in the continuum, we have developed a low-loss waveguide platform for such materials. The waveguides are formed by patterning a silicon nitride cap layer grown on a rare-earth oxide thin film on silicon-on-insulator substrate. Low propagation loss of 4.70 dB/cm has been obtained in waveguides with silicon nitride/rare-earth oxide/silicon layer stack thickness of 72 nm/90 nm/300 nm, width of 1.08 mu m, at a wavelength of 1445.8 nm. Optical signal enhancement in these waveguides upon optical pumping has been observed in a wide wavelength range of 1510 to 1560 nm, with a large peak enhancement of similar to 16 dB/cm around 1536 nm. Our results represent an important step towards the realization of high-performance monolithic-integrated optical amplifiers on Si.

TI Overcoming entropic limitations on asymptotic state transformations
   through probabilistic protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum relative entropy is known to play a key role in determining the asymptotic convertibility of quantum states in general resource-theoretic settings, often constituting the unique monotone that is relevant in the asymptotic regime. We show that this is no longer the case when one allows stochastic protocols that may only succeed with some probability, in which case the quantum relative entropy is insufficient to characterize the rates of asymptotic state transformations, and a new entropic quantity based on a regularization of the Hilbert projective metric comes into play. Such a scenario is motivated by a setting where the cost associated with transformations of quantum states, typically taken to be the number of copies of a given state, is instead identified with the size of the quantum memory needed to realize the protocol. Our approach allows for constructing transformation protocols that achieve strictly higher rates than those imposed by the relative entropy. Focusing on the task of resource distillation, we give broadly applicable strong converse bounds on the asymptotic rates of probabilistic distillation protocols, and show them to be tight in relevant settings such as entanglement distillation with nonentangling operations. This generalizes and extends previously known limitations that are only applicable to deterministic protocols. Our methods are based on recent results for probabilistic one-shot transformations as well as a new asymptotic equipartition property for the projective relative entropy.

TI Minimal quantum walk simulation of Dirac fermions in curved space-times
SO QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS
AB The problem of simulating through quantum walks the curved space-time propagation of Dirac fermions is revisited, taking the (1 + 1)D case as an example. New quantum walks are introduced which encode the spacetime geometry, not in the mixing operators, but in new unitary shift operators which carry out a position-dependent translation of the wave function components. These walks simulate Dirac fermions in arbitrary curved space-times and coordinates. Contrary to previously proposed general alternatives, the wave functions of the new walks have as many components as usual Dirac spinors, and not twice that number. In particular, in (1 + 1)D space-times, only one qubit is needed at each lattice point, which makes it easier to perform quantum simulations of the Dirac dynamics on current NISQs quantum devices. Numerical simulations of the Dirac dynamics in the post Newtonian, so-called Gravitoelectromagnetism regime are presented as an illustration. The possible usefulness of the new shift operators and quantum walks in other more general contexts is also discussed.

TI Implementation of a 3 x 3 directionally-unbiased linear optical
   multiport
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Linear optical multiports are widely used in photonic quantum information processing. Naturally, these devices are directionally-biased since photons always propagate from the input ports toward the output ports. Recently, the concept of directionally-unbiased linear optical multiports was proposed. These directionally-unbiased multiports allow photons to propagate along a reverse direction, which can greatly reduce the number of required linear optical elements for complicated linear optical quantum networks. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a 3 x 3 directionally-unbiased linear optical fiber multiport using an optical tritter and mirrors. Compared to the previous demonstration using bulk optical elements which works only with light sources with a long coherence length, our experimental directionally-unbiased 3 x 3 optical multiport does not require a long coherence length since it provides negligible optical path length differences among all possible optical trajectories. It can be a useful building block for implementing large-scale quantum walks on complex graph networks. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Broad Range Tuning of InAs Quantum Dot Emission for Nanophotonic Devices
   in the Telecommunication Bands
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB InAs semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the near-infrared are promising platforms for on-demand single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces. However, the realization of quantum-photonic nanodevices emitting in the telecom windows with similar performance remains an open challenge. In particular, nanophotonic devices incorporating quantum light emitting diodes in the telecom C-band based on GaAs substrates are still lacking due to the relaxation of the lattice constant along the InGaAs graded layer which makes the implementation of electrically contacted devices challenging. Here, we report an optimized heterostructure design for QDs emitting in the telecom O- and C-bands grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy. The InAs QDs are embedded in mostly relaxed InGaAs matrices with fixed indium content grown on top of compositionally graded InGaAs buffers. Reciprocal space maps of the indium profiles and optical absorption spectra are used to optimize In0.22Ga0.78As and In0.30Ga0.70As matrices, accounting for the chosen indium grading profile. This approach results in a tunable QD photoluminescence (PL) emission from 1200 up to 1600 nm. Power and polarization dependent micro-PL measurements performed at 4 K reveal exciton-biexciton complexes from quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C-bands. The presented study establishes a flexible platform that can be an essential component for advanced photonic devices based on InAs/GaAs that serve as building blocks for future quantum networks.

TI Recycling nonlocality in quantum star networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The nonlocality of an entangled qubit pair can be recycled for several Bell experiments. Here, we go beyond standard Bell scenarios and investigate the recycling of nonlocal resources in a quantum network. First, we show that the ability to recycle nonlocality can be independent of the size of the network. Then, we realize a photonic quantum three-branch star network in which three sources of entangled pairs independently connect three outer parties with a central node. After measuring, each outer party respectively relays their system to an independent secondary measuring party. We experimentally demonstrate that the outer parties can perform unsharp measurements that are strong enough to violate a network Bell inequality with the central party, but weak enough to maintain sufficient entanglement in the network to allow the three secondary parties to do the same. Moreover, the violations are strong enough to exclude any model based on standard projective measurements on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs emitted in the network. Our experiment brings together the research program of recycling quantum resources with that of Bell nonlocality in networks.

TI Extracting Correlations in Arbitrary Diagonal Quantum States via Weak
   Couplings and Auxiliary Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this work, we introduce a novel method to extract correlations in diagonal quantum states in multi-particle quantum systems, addressing a significant limitation of traditional approaches that require prior knowledge of the density matrices of quantum states. Instead of relying on classical information processing, our method is based on weak couplings and ancillary systems, eliminating the need for classical communication, optimization, and complex calculations. The concept of mutually unbiased bases is intrinsically linked to symmetry, as it entails the uniform distribution of quantum states across distinct bases. Within the framework of our theoretical model, mutually unbiased bases are employed to facilitate weak measurements and to function as the post-selected states. To quantify the correlations in the initial state, we employ the trace distance between the initial state and the product of its marginal states, and illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We generalize the approach to accommodate high-dimensional multi-particle systems for potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum networks.

TI Secure IoT in the Era of Quantum Computers-Where Are the Bottlenecks?
SO SENSORS
AB Recent progress in quantum computers severely endangers the security of widely used public-key cryptosystems and of all communication that relies on it. Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices-even with pre-quantum public-key cryptography-since IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency- and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NIST's goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes. This is contrary to much research that claims dedicated hardware accelerators are mandatory.

TI Optimization of Nuclear Polarization in an Alkali-Noble Gas
   Comagnetometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Self-compensated comagnetometers, employing overlapping samples of spin-polarized alkali and noble gases (for example K-3He) are promising sensors for exotic beyond-the-standard-model fields and highprecision metrology such as rotation sensing. When the comagnetometer operates in the so-called self-compensated regime, the effective field, originating from contact interactions between the alkali valence electrons and the noble-gas nuclei, is compensated with an applied magnetic field. When the comagnetometer begins operation in a given magnetic field, spin-exchange optical pumping establishes an equilibrium between the alkali electron-spin polarization and the nuclear-spin polarization. Subsequently, when the magnetic field is tuned to the compensation point, the spin polarization is brought out of the equilibrium conditions. This causes a practical issue for long measurement times. We report on a method for closed-loop control of the compensation field. This method allows optimization of the operating parameters, especially magnetic field gradients, in spite of the inherently slow (hours to days) dynamics of the system. With the optimization, higher stable nuclear polarization, longer relaxation times, and stronger electron-nuclear coupling are achieved which is useful for nuclear-spin-based quantum memory, spin amplifiers, and gyroscopes. The optimized sensor demonstrates a sensitivity comparable to the best previous comagnetometer but with four times lower noble-gas density. This paves the way for applications in both fundamental and applied science.

TI A metasurface-based diamond frequency converter using plasmonic nanogap
   resonators
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Diamond has attracted great interest as an appealing material for various applications ranging from classical to quantum optics. To date, Raman lasers, single photon sources, quantum sensing and quantum communication have been demonstrated with integrated diamond devices. However, studies of the nonlinear optical properties of diamond have been limited, especially at the nanoscale. Here, a metasurface consisting of plasmonic nanogap cavities is used to enhance both chi((2)) and chi((3)) nonlinear optical processes in a wedge-shaped diamond slab with a thickness down to 12 nm. Multiple nonlinear processes were enhanced simultaneously due to the relaxation of phase-matching conditions in subwavelength plasmonic structures by matching two excitation wavelengths with the fundamental and second-order modes of the nanogap cavities. Specifically, third-harmonic generation (THG) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are both enhanced 1.6 x 10(7)-fold, while four-wave mixing is enhanced 3.0 x 10(5) -fold compared to diamond without the metasurface. Even though diamond lacks a bulk chi((2)) due to centrosymmetry, the observed SHG arises from the surface AP of the diamond slab and is enhanced by the metasurface elements. The efficient, deeply subwavelength diamond frequency converter demonstrated in this work suggests an approach for conversion of color center emission to telecom wavelengths directly in diamond.

Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors5, 6, 7-8 have focused primarily on the surface code9, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The colour code10 enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of colour codes11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18-19 have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here we present a comprehensive demonstration of the colour code on a superconducting processor8. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Lambda 3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the colour code, and the colour code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking20 and inject magic states21, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between colour codes using lattice surgery22. This work establishes the colour code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.

TI Threshold-independent method for single-shot readout of spin qubits in
   semiconductor quantum dots
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The single-shot readout data process is essential for the realization of high-fidelity qubits and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms in semiconductor quantum dots. However, the fidelity and visibility of the readout process are sensitive to the choice of the thresholds and limited by the experimental hardware. By demonstrating the linear dependence between the measured spin state probabilities and readout visibilities along with dark counts, we describe an alternative threshold-independent method for the single-shot readout of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots. We can obtain the extrapolated spin state probabilities of the prepared probabilities of the excited spin state through the threshold-independent method. We then analyze the corresponding errors of the method, finding that errors of the extrapolated probabilities cannot be neglected with no constraints on the readout time and threshold voltage. Therefore, by limiting the readout time and threshold voltage, we ensure the accuracy of the extrapolated probability. We then prove that the efficiency and robustness of this method are 60 times larger than those of the most commonly used method. Moreover, we discuss the influence of the electron temperature on the effective area with a fixed external magnetic field and provide a preliminary demonstration for a single-shot readout of up to 0.7 K/1.5 T in the future.

AB Recent developments have shown the existence of quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes with constant rate and linear distance. A natural question concerns the efficient decodability of these codes. In this paper, we present a linear time decoder for the recent quantum Tanner codes construction of asymptotically good qLDPC codes, which can correct all errors of weight up to a constant fraction of the blocklength. Our decoder is an iterative algorithm which searches for corrections within constant-sized regions. At each step, the corrections are found by reducing a locally defined and efficiently computable cost function which serves as a proxy for the weight of the remaining error.

TI Quantum error precompensation for quantum noisy channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Most previous efforts on quantum error correction focused on either extending classical error-correction schemes to the quantum regime by performing a perfect correction on a subset of errors or seeking a recovery operation to maximize the fidelity between an input state and its corresponding output state of a noisy channel. There are few results concerning quantum error precompensation. Here we design an error-precompensated input state for an arbitrary quantum noisy channel and a given target output state. By following a procedure, the required input state, if it exists, can be analytically obtained in single-partite systems. Furthermore, we also present semidefinite programs to numerically obtain the error-precompensated input states with maximal fidelities between the target state and the output state. The numerical results coincide with the analytical results.

TI Localization and Mitigation of Loss in Niobium Superconducting Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Materials imperfections in planar superconducting quantum circuits-in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects-contribute significantly to decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. The identification of specific parasitic layers and their associated loss contributions has, however, proven elusive. Using a combination of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we determine the thickness, chemical composition, and location of the oxides present in niobium-on-silicon coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators and quantify their respective contributions to the measured single-photon quality factor (Q). Using selective chemical etching, we reduce first the substrate-air oxide then the metal-air oxide thickness, dramatically reducing both TLS (delta(TLS)) and non-TLS (delta(hi)) losses, resulting in a median Q value over 5 x 10(6), with individual devices approaching 6 x 10(6). We find that silicon surface oxides host 70% of TLS losses, with a delta(TLS) : delta(hi) loss-density ratio near 11:1. In contrast, niobium surface oxides host 77% of non-TLS losses, uniformly distributed within the oxide layer, with a delta(TLS) : delta(hi) loss-density ratio of 3:4 for the superconducting circuits investigated in this work. Only 7% of losses come from other sources, including the niobium-silicon interface, which is sufficiently clean in our devices to allow epitaxial Nb nucleation on Si. As we mitigate surface losses through selective modification of the interface dielectrics, we arrive in a regime where TLS losses are no longer dominant, which will allow other types of losses in superconducting circuits to be investigated in more detail, including nonequilibrium quasiparticles.

TI Deep UV to NIR frequency combs via cascaded harmonic generation in a
   silica nanowire using nanojoule pulse energies
SO OPTICA
AB Compact, turnkey frequency combs in the deep ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region are important for applications ranging from ultralow power spectroscopy and quantum memory to light-atom interactions. Translation of an IR (1550 nm) comb from a compact mode-locked laser (MLL) to visible wavelength region, using cascading of optical nonlinearities, provides the simplest way to realize an on-demand deep UV to NIR comb. However, the translation of an IR comb to the visible region extending from deep UV to NIR has been difficult to achieve in a single device. We exploit chirped pulsed compression and dispersion engineering to report the simultaneous generation of second- (780 nm), third- (520 nm) and sixth-order (260 nm) harmonics of a 1560 nm MLL in a 10 mm long silica nanowire using nanojoule pulse energies. RF spectrum measurements of the 520 nm signal show that the 82 MHz frequency comb at 1560 nm is translated to visible. The use of a single-mode fiber nanotaper and turnkey mode-locked IR laser creates a hybrid platformthat provides deep UV to NIR comb and enables applications in quantum optics through trapping and probing of atoms using the evanescent field of nanotaper.

AB Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) have become a key building block in many security products as they provide interesting efficiency/security trade-offs. Indeed, a PAKE allows to dispense with the heavy public key infrastructures and its efficiency and portability make it well suited for applications such as Internet of Things or e-passports. With the emerging quantum threat and the effervescent development of post-quantum public key algorithms in the last five years, one would wonder how to modify existing password authenticated key exchange protocols that currently rely on Diffie-Hellman problems in order to include newly introduced and soon-to-be-standardized post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM). A generic solution is desirable for maintaining modularity and adaptability with the many post-quantum KEM that have been introduced.
   In this paper, we propose two new generic and natural constructions proven in the Universal Composability (UC) model to transform, in a black-box manner, a KEM into a PAKE with very limited performance overhead: one or two extra symmetric encryptions. Behind the simplicity of the designs, establishing security proofs in the UC model is actually non-trivial and requires some additional properties on the underlying KEM like fuzziness and anonymity. Luckily, post-quantum KEM protocols often enjoy these two extra properties. As a demonstration, we prove that it is possible to apply our transformations to Crystals-Kyber, a lattice-based post-quantum KEM that will soon be standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
   In a nutshell, this work opens up the possibility to securely include post-quantum cryptography in PAKE-based real-world protocols.

TI Cross-layering consideration for network and quantum resources-aware
   quantum-secured networking
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Quantum-secured networking constitutes a layering architecture comprising a user network and a quantum key distribution network (QKDN). In the wavelength division multiplexing-based quantum-secured optical networking, wavelength and quantum key are scarce resources in the user network and QKDN, respectively; hence, an effective resource dimensioning algorithm is required for practical quantum-secured services. Therefore, we investigated a resource dimensioning problem for the standardization-compatible quantum-secured networking model, where a data routing path in the user network and a quantum key relay path in the QKDN are interdependent. As benchmarking solutions, we first developed integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for wavelength resource and quantum key resource optimal quantum-secured networking. To obtain the tractable solution, an iterative heuristic algorithm was proposed, in which a path of a quantum-secured service was calculated by considering the statuses of both wavelength and quantum key resources. Simulation study on practical backbone topologies revealed that the proposed heuristic algorithm reduced manifold order-of-magnitude in the algorithm computation time at the costs of acceptable overheads in the wavelength and quantum key resources, from those of the ILP optimizations.

TI Laser-written reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit directly
   coupled to a single-photon avalanche diode array
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.

TI An expressive ansatz for low-depth quantum approximate optimisation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used to approximately solve combinatorial optimisation problems. It involves multiple iterations of a parameterised ansatz that consists of a problem and mixer Hamiltonian, with the parameters being classically optimised. While QAOA can be implemented on near-term quantum hardware, physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors can limit circuit depth and decrease performance. To address these limitations, this work introduces the eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA), an overparameterised variant of QAOA that assigns more classical parameters to the ansatz to improve its performance at low depths. XQAOA also introduces an additional Pauli-Y component in the mixer Hamiltonian, allowing the mixer to implement arbitrary unitary transformations on each qubit. To benchmark the performance of XQAOA at unit depth, we derive its closed-form expression for the MaxCut problem and compare it to QAOA, Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA) (Herrman et al 2022 Sci. Rep. 12 6781), a classical-relaxed algorithm, and the state-of-the-art Goemans-Williamson algorithm on a set of unweighted regular graphs with 128 and 256 nodes for degrees ranging from 3 to 10. Our results indicate that at unit depth, XQAOA has benign loss landscapes with local minima concentrated near the global optimum, allowing it to consistently outperform QAOA, MA-QAOA, and the classical-relaxed algorithm on all graph instances and the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on graph instances with degrees greater than 4. Small-scale simulations also reveal that unit-depth XQAOA invariably surpasses both QAOA and MA-QAOA on all tested depths up to five. Additionally, we find an infinite family of graphs for which XQAOA solves MaxCut exactly and analytically show that for some graphs in this family, special cases of XQAOA are capable of achieving a much larger approximation ratio than QAOA. Overall, XQAOA is a more viable choice for variational quantum optimisation on near-term quantum devices, offering competitive performance at low depths.

TI On the quantum performance evaluation of two distributed quantum
   architectures
SO PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
AB Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as continuous-time Markov chains and compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for network-heavy ones. We validate our analysis with the quantum network simulator NetSquid. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies. This provides a valuable new tool for performance evaluation experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures studied in this work. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Rapid charging of a two-qubit quantum battery by transverse field
   amplitude and phase control
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider a quantum battery (QB) composed of a pair of qubits coupled with an Ising interaction in the usual NMR framework, where the longitudinal applied field is constant and the time-dependent variables controlling the system are the amplitude and phase of the transverse field, and use optimal control to derive fast charging protocols. We study both the cases where the Ising coupling is weaker and stronger than the longitudinal field. In the first case, where the lowest-energy state of the system is the spin-down state, the optimal charging protocol stipulates the transverse field amplitude to be constant and equal to its maximum allowed value, while the minimum time for full charging of the battery tends to zero as this maximum bound increases. In the second case, where the lowest-energy state is a maximally entangled Bell state, the optimal charging protocol includes a time interval where the transverse field amplitude is zero and its phase is immaterial, corresponding to singular control. In this case, the QB can be charged with higher levels of stored energy, while the minimum time for full charging tends to a nonzero limit proportional to the inverse Ising interaction, as the maximum bound of the control amplitude increases. We analyze intuitively and quantitatively the distinct behavior of the two cases and additionally use the dynamical Lie algebra of the system to elucidate the presence of a singular arc in the optimal pulse-sequence in the second case. The discovered interplay between the QB parameters, the stored energy and the minimum time for full charging, provides great flexibility for optimizing the performance of the device according to the operating constraints. The valuable insights gained regarding the design of QBs is expected to find immediate applications in modern quantum science and technology, while we aim to extend the proposed methods to larger spin chains.

TI Interpretable Quantum Advantage in Neural Sequence Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum neural networks have been widely studied in recent years, given their potential practical utility and recent results regarding their ability to efficiently express certain classical data. However, analytic results to date rely on assumptions and arguments from complexity theory. Because of this, there is little intuition as to the source of the expressive power of quantum neural networks or for which classes of classical data any advantage can be reasonably expected to hold. Here, we study the relative expressive power between a broad class of neural network sequence models and a class of recurrent models based on Gaussian operations with non-Gaussian measurements. We explicitly show that quantum contextuality is the source of an unconditional memory separation in the expressivity of the two model classes. We use this intuition to study the relative performance of our introduced model on a standard translation data set exhibiting linguistic contextuality. In doing so, we demonstrate that our introduced quantum models are able to outperform state-of-the-art classical models even in practice.

TI Sub-Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields
   in Strain-Engineered WSe2 Monolayers
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Strain-engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single-photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow-linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle-strained WSe2 monolayers with sub-diffraction-limit resolution (approximate to 30 nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240 nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain-engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next-generation quantum optical architectures.

TI JARVIS-Leaderboard: a large scale benchmark of materials design methods
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Lack of rigorous reproducibility and validation are significant hurdles for scientific development across many fields. Materials science, in particular, encompasses a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches that require careful benchmarking. Leaderboard efforts have been developed previously to mitigate these issues. However, a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking on an integrated platform with multiple data modalities with perfect and defect materials data is still lacking. This work introduces JARVIS-Leaderboard, an open-source and community-driven platform that facilitates benchmarking and enhances reproducibility. The platform allows users to set up benchmarks with custom tasks and enables contributions in the form of dataset, code, and meta-data submissions. We cover the following materials design categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electronic Structure (ES), Force-fields (FF), Quantum Computation (QC), and Experiments (EXP). For AI, we cover several types of input data, including atomic structures, atomistic images, spectra, and text. For ES, we consider multiple ES approaches, software packages, pseudopotentials, materials, and properties, comparing results to experiment. For FF, we compare multiple approaches for material property predictions. For QC, we benchmark Hamiltonian simulations using various quantum algorithms and circuits. Finally, for experiments, we use the inter-laboratory approach to establish benchmarks. There are 1281 contributions to 274 benchmarks using 152 methods with more than 8 million data points, and the leaderboard is continuously expanding. The JARVIS-Leaderboard is available at the website: https://pages.nist.gov/jarvis_leaderboard/

AB Quantum error correction is necessary to protect logical quantum states and operations. However, no meaningful data protection can be made when the syndrome extraction is erroneous due to faulty measurement gates. Quantum data-syndrome (DS) codes are designed to protect the data qubits and syndrome bits concurrently. In this paper, we propose an efficient decoding algorithm for quantum DS codes with sparse check matrices. Based on a refined belief propagation (BP) decoding for stabilizer codes, we propose a DS-BP algorithm to handle the quaternary quantum data errors and binary syndrome bit errors. Moreover, a sparse quantum code may inherently be able to handle minor syndrome errors so that fewer redundant syndrome measurements are necessary. We demonstrate this with simulations on a quantum hypergraph-product code.

TI Hyperinvariant multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz: with
   power-law correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We consider a class of holographic tensor networks that are efficiently contractible variational ansatz, manifestly (approximate) quantum error correction codes, and can support power-law correlation functions. In the case when the network consists of a single type of tensor that also acts as an erasure correction code, we show that it cannot be both locally contractible and sustain power-law correlation functions. Motivated by this no-go theorem, and the desirability of local contractibility for an efficient variational ansatz, we provide guidelines for constructing networks consisting of multiple types of tensors that can support power-law correlation. We also provide an explicit construction of one such network, which approximates the holographic HaPPY pentagon code in the limit where variational parameters are taken to be small.

TI Simulating the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the
   quantum counting algorithm with limited entanglement using tensor
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum algorithms reformulate computational problems as quantum evolutions in a large Hilbert space. Most quantum algorithms assume that the time evolution is perfectly unitary and that the full Hilbert space is available. However, in practice, the available entanglement may be limited, leading to a reduced fidelity of the quantum algorithms. To simulate the execution of quantum algorithms with limited entanglement, tensor-network methods provide a useful framework, since they allow us to restrict the entanglement in a quantum circuit. Thus, we here use tensor networks to analyze the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm as the entanglement is reduced, and we map out the entanglement that is generated during the execution of each algorithm. In all three cases, we find that the algorithms can be executed with high fidelity even if the entanglement is somewhat reduced. For example, the quantum counting algorithm can be executed with a high fidelity beyond a certain threshold level of entanglement. Our results provide an understanding of the entanglement that is required to execute the three algorithms, and our simulations based on tensor networks can easily be applied to other algorithms.

TI Multiple single-photon generations in three-level atoms coupled to a
   cavity with non-Markovian effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper we show how to generate multiple single-photon wave packets of arbitrary temporal shape from an optical cavity coupled with N three-level atoms driven by a driving field in the non-Markovian regime. We derive an exact analytical expression of the optimal driving field to generate such wave packets, which depends on two detunings of the cavity and driving field with respect to the three-level atoms. The cavity we use consists of two mirrors facing each other, where one is perfect and the other includes dissipation (a one-sided cavity), which couples with the corresponding non-Markovian input-output fields. If the first single-photon wave packet generated by the Markovian system is the same as the non-Markovian case, the Markovian system cannot generate the same multiple single-photon wave packets as the non-Markovian system when the spectral widths of the other environments take values different from the spectral width of the first environment, while setting the equal spectral widths for the different environments can generate this. The generated multiple different single-photon wave packets are not independent of each other, which satisfies certain relations with non-Markovian spectral parameters. We analyze the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian regimes and compare the differences between them, where the cavity interacts simultaneously with the multiple non-Markovian environments. Finally, we extend the above results to a general non-Markovian quantum network involving many cavities coupled with driven three-level atoms.

TI A Quantum-Based Microwave Attenuation Standard: Direct Comparison
   Between Rabi Attenuation and the National Standard
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Microwave (MW) quantum sensors have attracted attention due to their promising applications in precision measurements and standards. Recently, we demonstrated the measurement of Rabi attenuation-a quantum-based MW attenuation-using cesium atomic vapor. Rabi attenuation offers several potential advantages over conventional standards; however, the previous study encountered issues with nonlinearity. In this study, we improved the linearity of Rabi attenuation by reducing detuning as one of the nonlinearity factors. We combined the precise determination of resonant frequency using the first-order term of Rabi resonance with the accurate measurement of the MW field using the second-order term. Furthermore, we conducted a direct comparison of Rabi attenuation with the national standard in the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) for the first time, allowing for a quantitative evaluation of Rabi attenuation's linearity. The Rabi attenuation was consistent with the national standard within a range of 33 dB, accounting for the uncertainty due to MW field nonuniformity. Further optimization of Rabi attenuation measurements paves the way for the next-generation quantum-based MW attenuation standards based on qubit Rabi frequency measurements.

TI Temperature-dependent coherence properties of NV ensemble in diamond up
   to 600 K
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an ideal candidate for quantum sensing because of its excellent spin coherence property as well as the possibility for optical initialization and readout. Previous studies, on the other hand, have typically been conducted at low or room temperature. The inability to fully understand the coherence properties of the NV center at high temperatures limits NV's further applications. We systematically investigate the coherence properties of NV center ensemble at temperatures ranging from 300 K to 600 K in this paper. Coherence time T-2 decreases rapidly from 184 mu s at 300 K to 30 mu s at 600 K due to the interaction with paramagnetic impurities. At all experiment temperatures, both single-quantum and double-quantum transitions exhibit a T-5 relaxation rate, which is attributed to the two-phonon Raman process. Nonetheless, the inhomogeneous dephasing time T-2* and thermal-echo decoherence time T-TE remain almost unchanged at temperature up to 600 K. A thermal-echo-based thermometer is demonstrated to have a sensitivity of 41 mK/ root Hz at 450 K. These findings will pave the way for NV-based high-temperature sensing and provide a more comprehensive understanding of solid-state qubit decoherence.

TI Say NO to Optimization: A Nonorthogonal Quantum Eigensolver
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A balanced description of both static and dynamic correlations in electronic systems with nearly degenerate low-lying states presents a challenge for multiconfigurational methods on classical computers. We present here a quantum algorithm utilizing the action of correlating cluster operators to provide highquality wave-function ansatze employing a nonorthogonal multireference basis that captures a significant portion of the exact wave function in a highly compact manner and that allows computation of the resulting energies and wave functions at polynomial cost with a quantum computer. This enables a significant improvement over the corresponding classical nonorthogonal solver, which incurs an exponential cost when evaluating off-diagonal matrix elements between the ansatz states and is therefore intractable. We implement the nonorthogonal quantum eigensolver (NOQE) here with an efficient ansatz parametrization inspired by classical quantum chemistry methods that succeed in capturing significant amounts of electronic correlation accurately. Crucially, we avoid the need to perform any optimization of the ansatz on the quantum device. By taking advantage of such classical approaches, NOQE provides a flexible, compact, and rigorous description of both static and dynamic electronic correlation, making it an attractive method for the calculation of electronic states of a wide range of molecular systems.

TI Bell-state tomography in a silicon many-electron artificial molecule
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB An error-corrected quantum processor will require millions of qubits, accentuating the advantage of nanoscale devices with small footprints, such as silicon quantum dots. However, as for every device with nanoscale dimensions, disorder at the atomic level is detrimental to quantum dot uniformity. Here we investigate two spin qubits confined in a silicon double quantum dot artificial molecule. Each quantum dot has a robust shell structure and, when operated at an occupancy of 5 or 13 electrons, has single spin-<mml:mfrac>12</mml:mfrac> valence electron in its p- or d-orbital, respectively. These higher electron occupancies screen static electric fields arising from atomic-level disorder. The larger multielectron wavefunctions also enable significant overlap between neighbouring qubit electrons, while making space for an interstitial exchange-gate electrode. We implement a universal gate set using the magnetic field gradient of a micromagnet for electrically driven single qubit gates, and a gate-voltage-controlled inter-dot barrier to perform two-qubit gates by pulsed exchange coupling. We use this gate set to demonstrate a Bell state preparation between multielectron qubits with fidelity 90.3%, confirmed by two-qubit state tomography using spin parity measurements. Multielectron quantum dots offer a promising platform for high-performance spin qubits; however, previous demonstrations have been limited to single-qubit operation. Here, the authors report a universal gate set and two-qubit Bell state tomography in a high-occupancy double quantum dot in silicon.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature scheme that is resistant to attacks by quantum computers and has been selected to be standardized in the NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process. However, the speed performance and design flexibility of the Dilithium still need to be evaluated. This article presents a high-performance software/hardware co-design of CRYSTALS-Dilithium based on the NIST PQC round-3 parameters. High-speed pipelined hardware modules for NTT/INTT, pointwise multiplication/addition, and for SHAKE are included in the design to accelerate the time-consuming operations in Dilithium. All hardware modules are parameterized, thus allowing full support of runtime configuration to increase versatility. Moreover, the proposed software/hardware architecture and tight operating workflows reduce the data transmission overhead between the processor and other hardware modules. The hardware accelerator is implemented with a reconfigurable logic on FPGA and is integrated with the high-performance ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the Xilinx Zynq Architecture. We measure the performance of the software/hardware system for Dilithium in NIST security levels 2, 3, and 5. Compared to pure software implementations, we achieve 8.7-12.5 times speedup in Key generation, 6.3-7.3 times speedup in Sign, and 9.1-12.2 times speedup in Verify operations.

TI No-go theorem for device-independent security in relativistic causal
   theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A fundamental question in device-independent quantum cryptography is to determine the minimal physical principle upon which the security of such a cryptographic protocol (such as for key distribution or for randomness generation) may be based. Since the seminal work on device-independent quantum key distribution by J. Barrett, L. Hardy, and A. Kent [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 010503 (2005)], a conjectured candidate for certification of deviceindependent security has been the principle of relativistic causality, namely the disallowance of causal loops. While this principle has thus far been equated with the no-signaling constraints, it has been shown recently that in multiparty Bell scenarios, the no-signaling constraints are sufficient but not necessary for relativistic causality, and a refined set of constraints has been proposed that more precisely capture the notion of relativistic causality. In this paper, we build upon this finding to show that, in contrast to the no-signaling constraints, the constraints of relativistic causality are not sufficient for certification of device-independent security. More specifically, we show that there exist correlations allowed by the causality principle that allow an adversary to gain complete information about the measurement outcomes of honest parties in any device-independent cryptographic protocol, thereby rendering the protocol completely insecure. As a tool to develop this adversarial attack strategy, we fully characterize the set of correlations allowed by relativistic causality in the tripartite Bell scenario of three parties, each performing two binary measurements, that may be of independent interest. We also demonstrate the difference between the relativistic causal correlations and those allowed by the usual nosignaling constraints by presenting explicit communication tasks wherein the two sets exhibit striking difference in their respective winning probabilities.

TI Foundations of additive codes over finite fields
SO FINITE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
AB Additive codes were initially introduced by Delsarte in 1973 within the context of association schemes and recently they have become of interest due to their application in constructing quantum error-correcting codes. We give foundational results for additive codes where the elements are from a finite field, and define the orthogonality relation using group characters. We introduce a type for these additive codes and explore the notion of independence for a generating set. Additionally, we provide a definition for a generator matrix of an additive code based on its type. We also relate the type of an additive code to the type of its orthogonal. We study a family of kernels and ranks associated with these additive codes. We relate the equivalence of additive codes to their type, the family of kernels and ranks, and duality. We see how these relations contribute in the classification of additive codes. Finally, we provide a general encoding and decoding method for these codes. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

TI Parity Deformed Tavis-Cummings Model: Entanglement, Parameter Estimation
   and Statistical Properties
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we introduce the parity extension of the harmonic oscillator systems to develop the generalized Tavis-Cummings model (T-CM) based on a specific deformation of the Heisenberg algebra. We present a quantum scheme of a two-qubit system (TQS) interacting with a quantized field that is initially prepared in parity deformed coherent states (PDCSs). The dynamical features of the considered system are explored in the presence of parity deformed parameter (PDP) and time-dependent coupling (t-dc). In particular, we examine the amount of the entanglement formed in the qubit-field and qubit-qubit states. We find that the maximal amount of the entanglement may be occurred periodically during the time evolution. Finally, we investigate the influence of PDP on the Fisher information and the photon statistics of the deformed field with respect to the main parameters of the system.

AB Algebraic methods for the design of series of maximum distance separable (MDS) linear block and convolutional codes to required specifications and types are presented. Algorithms are given to design codes to required rate and required error-correcting capability and required types. Infinite series of block codes with rate approaching a given rational R with 0 < R < 1 and relative distance over length approaching (1 - R) are designed. These can be designed over fields of given characteristic p or over fields of prime order and can be specified to be of a particular type such as (i) dual-containing under Euclidean inner product, (ii) dual-containing under Hermitian inner product, (iii) quantum error-correcting, (iv) linear complementary dual (LCD). Convolutional codes to required rate and distance and infinite series of convolutional codes with rate approaching a given rational R and distance over length approaching 2(1 - R) are designed. The designs are algebraic and properties, including distances, are shown algebraically. Algebraic explicit efficient decoding methods are referenced.

TI Error estimation in current noisy quantum computers
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB One of the main important features of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the correct evaluation and consideration of errors. In this paper, we analyse the main sources of errors in current (IBM) quantum computers and we present a useful tool (TED-qc) designed to facilitate the total error probability expected for any quantum circuit. We propose this total error probability as the best way to estimate a lower bound for the fidelity in the NISQ era, avoiding the necessity of comparing the quantum calculations with any classical one. In order to contrast the robustness of our tool we compute the total error probability that may occur in three different quantum models: 1) the Ising model, 2) the Quantum-Phase Estimation (QPE), and 3) the Grover's algorithm. For each model, the main quantities of interest are computed and benchmarked against the reference simulator's results as a function of the error probability for a representative and statistically significant sample size. The analysis is satisfactory in more than the 99 % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$99\%$$\end{document} of the cases. In addition, we study how error mitigation techniques are able to eliminate the noise induced during the measurement. These results have been calculated for the IBM quantum computers, but both the tool and the analysis can be easily extended to any other quantum computer.

TI A Scalable Quantum Gate-Based Implementation for Causal Hypothesis
   Testing
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this work, a scalable quantum gate-based algorithm for accelerating causal inference is introduced. Specifically, the formalism of causal hypothesis testing presented in [Nat Commun 10, 1472 (2019)] is considered. Through the algorithm, the existing definition of error probability is generalized, which is a metric to distinguish between two competing causal hypotheses, to a practical scenario. The results on the Qiskit validate the predicted speedup and show that in the realistic scenario, the error probability depends on the distance between the competing hypotheses. To achieve this, the causal hypotheses are embedded as a circuit construction of the oracle. Furthermore, by assessing the complexity involved in implementing the algorithm's subcomponents, a numerical estimation of the resources required for the algorithm is offered. Finally, applications of this framework for causal inference use cases in bioinformatics and artificial general intelligence are discussed.
   It expands the current framework by adjusting error probability based on process distance between the causal hypotheses. This implementation facilitates gate complexity estimation for the quantum algorithm. Stressing the significance of causal inference in machine learning and quantum networks, it anticipates applications in grasping general intelligence limits and bioinformatics. image

TI Exploiting Symmetry Reduces the Cost of Training QAOA
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A promising approach to the practical application of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is finding QAOA parameters classically in simulation and sampling the solutions from QAOA with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Doing so requires repeated evaluations of QAOA energy in simulation. In this article, we propose a novel approach for accelerating the evaluation of QAOA energy by leveraging the symmetry of the problem. We show a connection between classical symmetries of the objective function and the symmetries of the terms of the cost Hamiltonian with respect to the QAOA energy. We show how by considering only the terms that are not connected by symmetry, we can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating the QAOA energy. Our approach is general and applies to any known subgroup of symmetries and is not limited to graph problems. Our results are directly applicable to nonlocal QAOA generalization recursive QAOA. We outline how available fast graph automorphism solvers can be leveraged for computing the symmetries of the problem in practice. We implement the proposed approach on the MaxCut problem using a state-of-the-art tensor network simulator and a graph automorphism solver on a benchmark of 48 graphs with up to 10 000 nodes. Our approach provides an improvement for p = 1 on 71.7% of the graphs considered, with a median speedup of 4.06, on a benchmark, where 62.5% of the graphs are known to be hard for automorphism solvers.

TI Exploring and Controlling Chemistry Using Quantum Logic
SO CHIMIA
AB Over the past years, the development of experimental techniques for the coherent manipulation and control of isolated quantum systems has made impressive progress. Such 'quantum-logic' methods are also highly attractive in a chemical context in view of unravelling and controlling the quantum dynamics of molecular collisions and chemical reactions. Quantum technologies have the potential to transform the way chemical dynamics are investigated - by providing highly sensitive methods for state readout and spectroscopy, by opening up new pathways for the quantum-state preparation of molecules and by enabling an improved control of their microscopic behavior on the single-particle level. However, for complex quantum systems like molecules, these techniques are still in their infancy and their considerable potential remains to be unlocked. The aim of the present research program supported by an Advanced Grant of the Swiss National Science Foundation is to merge the fields of quantum science and chemical dynamics by advancing quantum technologies to polyatomic molecular ions and by applying them to the study of ion-molecule collisions and chemical reactions. In this article, we review the salient experimental methods as well as prospects and challenges in the development of molecular quantum technologies and their applications to chemistry.

TI Derivation of the robustness from the concurrence
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Adding the maximally mixed state with some weight to the entanglement system leads to disentanglement of the latter. For each predefined entangled state there exists a minimal value of this weight for which the system loses its entanglement properties. These values were proposed to be used as a quantitative measure of entanglement called robustness [G. Vidal and R. Tarrach, Phys. Rev. A 59, 141 (1999)]. Using the concurrence, we propose the derivation of this measure for the system of two-qubit. Namely, for a two-qubit pure state, an exact expression of robustness is obtained. Finally, in the same way, the robustness of special cases of mixed two-qubit states is calculated.

TI Biological efficiency in processing information in green plants
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB The detection and processing of environmental information is a fundamental attribute of all living systems. This article approaches the question of how efficiently plants process that information, considering it likely that differential efficiency among different species may help explain differential survival. The primary routes of information transfer, that is, signal transduction, are relatively well understood. It is pointed out, based on current understanding, that erasure of such information may be of equal importance to its acquisition. This in turn could provide a simple means of quantifying the acquisition of information by a plant and the efficiency in doing so. However, wild plants live in an environment that is noisy. A useful analogy to deal with such situations can be found in quantum theory of open systems, wherein processes are both well-characterized and well understood, unlike those in plants. This paper develops this theme from quantum information processing and provides a mean of transferring such quantum characterization to biological dynamical situations. The article concludes with discussion on communication theory, indicating that there is a dearth of experimental results that can currently be used to investigate information processing but suggesting how progress can be made in this important programme.

TI Conditionally Rigorous Mitigation of Multiqubit Measurement Errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Several techniques have been recently introduced to mitigate errors in near-term quantum computers without the overhead required by quantum error correcting codes. While most of the focus has been on gate errors, measurement errors are significantly larger than gate errors on some platforms. A widely used transition matrix error mitigation (TMEM) technique uses measured transition probabilities between initial and final classical states to correct subsequently measured data. However from a rigorous perspective, the noisy measurement should be calibrated with perfectly prepared initial states, and the presence of any state-preparation error corrupts the resulting mitigation. Here we develop a measurement error mitigation technique, a conditionally rigorous TMEM, that is not sensitive to state-preparation errors and thus avoids this limitation. We demonstrate the importance of the technique for high-precision measurement and for quantum foundations experiments by measuring Mermin polynomials on IBM Q superconducting qubits. An extension of the technique allows one to correct for both state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors in expectation values as well; we illustrate this by giving a protocol for fully SPAM-corrected quantum process tomography.

TI SPHINCSLET: An Area-Efficient Accelerator for the Full SPHINCS plus
   Digital Signature Algorithm
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB This work presents SPHINCSLET, the first fully standard-compliant and area-efficient hardware implementation of the SLH-DSA algorithm, formerly known as SPHINCS+, a post-quantum digital signature scheme. SPHINCSLET is designed to be parameterizable across different security levels and hash functions, offering a balanced tradeoff between area efficiency and performance. Existing hardware implementations either feature a large area footprint to achieve fast signing and verification or adopt a coprocessor-based approach that significantly slows down these operations. SPHINCSLET addresses this gap by delivering a 4.7x reduction in area compared to high-speed designs while achieving a 2.5x to 5x improvement in signing time over the most efficient coprocessor-based designs for a SHAKE256-based SPHINCS+ implementation. The SHAKE256based SPHINCS+ FPGA implementation targeting the AMD Artix-7 requires fewer than 10.8K LUTs for any security level of SLH-DSA. Furthermore, the SHA-2-based SPHINCS+ implementation achieves a 2x to 4x speedup in signature generation across various security levels compared to existing SLH-DSA hardware, all while maintaining a compact area footprint of 6K to 15K LUTs. This makes it the fastest SHA-2-based SLH-DSA implementation to date. With an optimized balance of area and performance, SPHINCSLET can assist resource-constrained devices in transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.

TI Privacy-Preserving Techniques in Generative AI and Large Language
   Models: A Narrative Review
SO INFORMATION
AB Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), has transformed the paradigm of data generation and creative content, but this progress raises critical privacy concerns, especially when models are trained on sensitive data. This review provides a comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving techniques aimed at safeguarding data privacy in generative AI, such as differential privacy (DP), federated learning (FL), homomorphic encryption (HE), and secure multi-party computation (SMPC). These techniques mitigate risks like model inversion, data leakage, and membership inference attacks, which are particularly relevant to LLMs. Additionally, the review explores emerging solutions, including privacy-enhancing technologies and post-quantum cryptography, as future directions for enhancing privacy in generative AI systems. Recognizing that achieving absolute privacy is mathematically impossible, the review emphasizes the necessity of aligning technical safeguards with legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance with data protection laws. By discussing the ethical and legal implications of privacy risks in generative AI, the review underscores the need for a balanced approach that considers performance, scalability, and privacy preservation. The findings highlight the need for ongoing research and innovation to develop privacy-preserving techniques that keep pace with the scaling of generative AI, especially in large language models, while adhering to regulatory and ethical standards.

   converting from hybrid solver to pure quantum processing unit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Traffic congestion continues to pose a significant challenge in urban environments, necessitating innovative approaches to traffic management. This paper explores the application of Quantum Annealing (QA) for real-world traffic optimization, expanding on the pioneering work of Volkswagen and D-Wave. In 2017, a collaborative team demonstrated the potential of QA to optimize traffic flow by solving a complex Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem involving 418 cars, which required 1,254 qubits. Later, this research culminated in a pilot project at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, one of Europe's largest technology events, showcasing quantum computing-based traffic optimization. Since the QPU alone could not directly handle the full problem size, the team employed a hybrid classical-quantum approach, leading to significant improvements in traffic distribution. This paper builds on that foundation by investigating potential speedups using a purely quantum approach, particularly by utilizing the QPU for smaller QUBO problems. The proposed method (MTF) enhances traffic management by decomposing the overall optimization problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This decomposition enables us to harness the advantages of the QPU while tackling more complex traffic scenarios that previous approaches struggled to manage. By breaking the problem into smaller parts, we mitigate the challenges associated with embedding large-scale problems into the QPU, which often presents computational difficulties. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments involving 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 cars on a complex traffic map featuring multiple start and end points. We successfully embedded the problem into the D-Wave Advantage Quantum Processing Unit, utilizing the "Pegasus" topology, which resulted in a significant acceleration of the solution process. The experiment results show improved speed and effectiveness in real-world scenarios by leveraging the QPU for better traffic optimization.

TI Rigorous noise reduction with quantum autoencoders
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Reducing noise in quantum systems is a significant challenge in advancing quantum technologies. We propose and demonstrate a noise reduction scheme utilizing a quantum autoencoder, which offers rigorous performance guarantees. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress noisy quantum states into a latent subspace and eliminate noise through projective measurements. We identify various noise models in which the noiseless state can be perfectly reconstructed, even at high noise levels. We apply the autoencoder to cool thermal states to the ground state and reduce the cost of magic state distillation by several orders of magnitude. Our autoencoder can be implemented using only unitary transformations without the need for ancillas, making it immediately compatible with state-of-the-art quantum technologies. We experimentally validate our noise reduction methods in a photonic integrated circuit. Our results have direct applications in enhancing the robustness of quantum technologies against noise.

TI Skew Constacyclic Codes over a Non-Chain Ring
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we investigate the algebraic structure of the non-local ring R-q = F-q[v]/(v(2) + 1) and identify the automorphisms of this ring to study the algebraic structure of the skew constacyclic codes and their duals over this ring. Furthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the skew constacyclic codes over R-q to be linear complementary dual (LCD). We present some examples of Euclidean LCD codes over R-q and tabulate the parameters of Euclidean LCD codes over finite fields as the F-images of these codes over R-q, which are almost maximum distance separable (MDS) and near MDS. Eventually, by making use of Hermitian linear complementary duals of skew constacyclic codes over R-q and the map F, we give a class of entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) with maximal entanglement and tabulate parameters of some EAQECCs with maximal entanglement over finite fields.

TI Miniaturizing Transmon Qubits Using van der Waals Materials
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum computers can potentially achieve an exponential speedup versus classical computers on certain computational tasks, recently demonstrated in superconducting qubit processors. However, the capacitor electrodes that comprise these qubits must be large in order to avoid lossy dielectrics. This tactic hinders scaling by increasing parasitic coupling among circuit components, degrading individual qubit addressability, and limiting the spatial density of qubits. Here, we take advantage of the unique properties of van der Waals (vdW) materials to reduce the qubit area by >1000 times while preserving the capacitance while maintaining quantum coherence. Our qubits combine conventional aluminum-based Josephson junctions with parallel-plate capacitors composed of crystalline layers of superconducting niobium diselenide and insulating hexagonal boron nitride. We measure a vdW transmon T-1 relaxation time of 1.06 mu s, demonstrating a path to achieve high-qubit-density quantum processors with long coherence times, and the broad utility of layered heterostructures in low-loss, high-coherence quantum devices.

TI Gate-controlled supercurrent in ballistic InSb nanoflag Josephson
   junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High-quality III-V narrow bandgap semiconductor materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and large Lande g-factor provide a promising platform for next-generation applications in the field of high-speed electronics, spintronics, and quantum computing. Indium antimonide (InSb) offers a narrow bandgap, high carrier mobility, and small effective mass and, thus, is very appealing in this context. In fact, this material has attracted tremendous attention in recent years for the implementation of topological superconducting states supporting Majorana zero modes. However, high-quality heteroepitaxial two-dimensional (2D) InSb layers are very difficult to realize owing to the large lattice mismatch with all commonly available semiconductor substrates. An alternative pathway is the growth of free-standing single-crystalline 2D InSb nanostructures, the so-called nanoflags. Here, we demonstrate fabrication of ballistic Josephson-junction devices based on InSb nanoflags with Ti/Nb contacts that show a gate-tunable proximity-induced supercurrent up to 50 nA at 250 mK and a sizable excess current. The devices show clear signatures of subharmonic gap structures, indicating phase-coherent transport in the junction and a high transparency of the interfaces. This places InSb nanoflags in the spotlight as a versatile and convenient 2D platform for advanced quantum technologies.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Quantum nanodiamonds for sensing of biological quantities: Angle,
   temperature, and thermal conductivity
SO BIOPHYSICS AND PHYSICOBIOLOGY
AB Measuring physical quantities in the nanometric region inside single cells is of great importance for understanding cellular activity. Thus, the development of biocompatible, sensitive, and reliable nanobiosensors is essential for progress in biological research. Diamond nanoparticles containing nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVCs), referred to as fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), have recently emerged as the sensors that show great promise for ultrasensitive nanosensing of physical quantities. FNDs emit stable fluorescence without photobleaching. Additionally, their distinctive magneto-optical properties enable an optical readout of the quantum states of the electron spin in NVC under ambient conditions. These properties enable the quantitative sensing of physical parameters (temperature, magnetic field, electric field, pH, etc.) in the vicinity of an FND; hence, FNDs are often described as "quantum sensors". In this review, recent advancements in biosensing applications of FNDs are summarized. First, the principles of orientation and temperature sensing using FND quantum sensors are explained. Next, we introduce surface coating techniques indispensable for controlling the physicochemical properties of FNDs. The achievements of practical biological sensing using surface-coated FNDs, including orientation, temperature, and thermal conductivity, are then highlighted. Finally, the advantages, challenges, and perspectives of the quantum sensing of FND are discussed. This review article is an extended version of the Japanese article, In Situ Measurement of Intracellular Thermal Conductivity Using Diamond Nanoparticle, published in SEIBUTSU BUTSURI Vol. 62, p.122-124 (2022).

TI Spectral collapse in multiqubit two-photon Rabi model
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We have shown that the smallest possible singel-qubit critical coupling strength of the N-qubit two-photon Rabi model is only 1/N times that of the two-photon Rabi model. The spectral collapse can thus occur at a more attainable value of the critical coupling. For both of the two-qubit and three-qubit cases, we have also rigorously demonstrated that at the critical coupling the system not only has a set of discrete eigenenergies but also a continuous energy spectrum. The discrete eigenenergy spectrum can be derived via a simple one-to-one mapping to the bound state problem of a particle of variable effective mass in the presence of a finite potential well and a nonlocal potential. The energy difference of each qubit, which specifies both the depth of the finite potential well and the strength of the nonlocal potential, determines the number of bound states available, implying that the extent of the incomplete spectral collapse can be monitored in a straightforward manner.

TI Fabrication of airbridges with gradient exposure
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In superconducting quantum circuits, airbridges are critical for eliminating parasitic slotline modes of coplanar waveguide circuits and reducing crosstalks between direct current magnetic flux biases. Here, we present a technique for fabricating superconducting airbridges. With this technique, a single layer of photoresist is employed, and the gradient exposure process is used to define the profile of airbridges. In order to properly obtain the bridge profile, we design exposure dosage based on residual photoresist thickness and laser power calibrations. Compared with other airbridge fabrication techniques, the gradient exposure fabrication technique provides the ability to produce lossless superconducting airbridges with flexible size and, thus, is more suitable for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. Furthermore, this method reduces the complexity of the fabrication process and provides a high fabrication yield. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing

TI Program generation meets program verification: A case study on
   number-theoretic transform
SO SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
AB Program generation allows us to produce high-performance code specialized to each application domain. Although it has had great success in various domains, it remains to be seen whether it is effective for cryptography, where the correctness of programs is indispensable.This work presents a unified approach to program generation, analysis, and verification. Our target is Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key building block of several candidates in Post Quantum Cryptography. We developed a program-generation framework based on the typed tagless-final style, and obtained highly efficient implementations with vector instructions such as AVX2 and AVX-512. The framework allows us to implement a program analyzer for integer overflow analysis. By combining a brute-force analysis with the standard static interval analysis, we have obtained more precise results than the state-of-the-art static analyzer, which let us find a new optimization.We have verified the generated program using the framework. While verifying the generated program all at once is intractable, we can separately verify the low-level components and the high-level algorithm, thanks to the compositional nature of our program generator. We have used an SMT solver for the former and a custom symbolic interpreter for the latter to prove the functional correctness of the generated program successfully.

TI Selection Strategy of F4-Style Algorithm to Solve MQ Problems Related to
   MPKC
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Multivariate public-key cryptosystems are potential candidates for post-quantum cryptography. The security of multivariate public-key cryptosystems relies on the hardness of solving a system of multivariate quadratic polynomial equations. Faugere's F4 algorithm is one of the solution techniques based on the theory of Grobner bases and selects critical pairs to compose the Macaulay matrix. Reducing the matrix size is essential. Previous research has not fully examined how many critical pairs it takes to reduce to zero when echelonizing the Macaulay matrix in rows. Ito et al. (2021) proposed a new critical-pair selection strategy for solving multivariate quadratic problems associated with encryption schemes. Instead, this paper extends their selection strategy for solving the problems associated with digital signature schemes. Using the OpenF4 library, we compare the software performance between the integrated F4-style algorithm of the proposed methods and the original F4-style algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can reduce the processing time of the F4-style algorithm by up to a factor of about seven under certain specific parameters. Moreover, we compute the minimum number of critical pairs to reduce to zero and propose their extrapolation outside our experimental scope for further research.

TI Micromotion minimization using Ramsey interferometry
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We minimize the stray electric field in a linear Paul trap quickly and accurately, by applying interferometry pulse sequences to a trapped ion optical qubit. The interferometry sequences are sensitive to the change of ion equilibrium position when the trap stiffness is changed, and we use this to determine the stray electric field. The simplest pulse sequence is a two-pulse Ramsey sequence, and longer sequences with multiple pulses offer a higher precision. The methods allow the stray field strength to be minimized beyond state-of-the-art levels. Using a sequence of nine pulses we reduce the 2D stray field strength to (10.5 +/- 0.8) mV m(-1) in 11 s measurement time. The pulse sequences are easy to implement and automate, and they are robust against laser detuning and pulse area errors. We use interferometry sequences with different lengths and precisions to measure the stray field with an uncertainty below the standard quantum limit. This marks a real-world case in which quantum metrology offers a significant enhancement. Also, we minimize micromotion in 2D using a single probe laser, by using an interferometry method together with the resolved sideband method; this is useful for experiments with restricted optical access. Furthermore, a technique presented in this work is related to quantum protocols for synchronizing clocks; we demonstrate these protocols here.

TI Evolution of two-dimensional van der Waals materials and their
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB This review examines rec advancements in 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, exploring their growth, behaviors, and applications across fields, includes electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum technologies. These materials have attracted significant interest owing to their exceptional properties, which arise from their atomic-scale thickness and layered structure bound together by relatively weak vdW forces. Such materials have been found to exhibit exceptional properties, featuring adjustable bandgaps, exceptional carrier mobility, and enhanced light-matter interactions, and quantum confinement effects, making them integral to advancing quantum computing. High quality of these materials can be produced through various synthesis techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metal-organic CVD,(MOCVD) molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and exfoliation, etc. These methods have great advantages as they allow for precise control over thickness, composition, and heterostructure assembly. Emerging directions in heterostructure design, twisted bilayers, and novel characterization techniques are also discussed, highlighting their transformative potential in next-generation technologies. Despite remarkable progress, challenges remain in attaining large-scale synthesis, ensuring material stability, and integrating these materials into practical devices. Emerging directions, including the exploration of novel 2D materials and advancements in heterostructure engineering, hold the potential to address these issues. As 2D vdW materials continue to evolve, this review helps to reshape fields ranging from fundamental science to industrial applications, heralding a new era of innovation and discovery.

TI Color Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an essential material for the encapsulation layer in van der Waals heterostructures and efficient deep ultraviolet optoelectronics. This is primarily due to its remarkable physical properties and ultrawide bandgap (close to 6 eV, and even larger in some cases) properties. Color centers in hBN refer to intrinsic vacancies and extrinsic impurities within the 2D crystal lattice, which result in distinct optical properties in the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) range. Furthermore, each color center in hBN exhibits a unique emission spectrum and possesses various spin properties. These characteristics open up possibilities for the development of next-generation optoelectronics and quantum information applications, including room-temperature single-photon sources and quantum sensors. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the atomic configuration, optical and quantum properties, and different techniques employed for the formation of color centers in hBN. A deep understanding of color centers in hBN allows for advances in the development of next-generation UV optoelectronic applications, solid-state quantum technologies, and nanophotonics by harnessing the exceptional capabilities offered by hBN color centers.

TI Molecular Design for Optically Induced Magnetization: Targeting Excited
   State Orbital Degeneracy in Tungsten(V) Complexes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The rise of quantum information science has spurred chemists to prepare new molecules that serve as useful building blocks in quantum technologies of the future. Implementation of molecular spin-based qubits requires new methods to induce high spin polarization of samples. Herein, we report design criteria to develop axially symmetric spin-1/2 molecules amenable to optically induced magnetization (OIM), a technique using circularly polarized (CP) excitation to deliver spin polarization. We apply these criteria to develop a series of tungsten(V) chalcogenide complexes that are demonstrated to have large spin-sensitive responses to CP light using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) that could allow up to similar to 20% spin polarization through OIM. Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal these systems have improved relaxation times over molecules like K2IrCl6, a species recently investigated by OIM, and field-swept electron spin-echo (FS-ESE) experiments show they have a remarkable lack of anisotropy in their phase-memory T m times. The design criteria are general and point toward future ways to improve OIM-initializable qubits.

TI Maximal steered coherence in accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum coherence, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, plays a crucial role in various quantum information tasks. However, preserving coherence under extreme conditions, such as relativistic acceleration, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate the influence of Unruh temperature and energy levels on the evolution of maximal steered coherence (MSC) for different initial states. Our results reveal that MSC is strongly dependent on Unruh temperature, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic decline to non-monotonic recovery, depending on the initial state parameter Delta 0\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Delta _0$$\end{document}.

Additionally, we observe that higher energy levels help preserve or enhance MSC in the presence of Unruh effects. These findings offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between relativistic effects and quantum coherence, with potential applications in developing robust quantum technologies for non-inertial environments.

TI Spectroscopic Signatures of Phonon Character in Molecular Electron Spin
   Relaxation
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Spin-lattice relaxation constitutes a key challenge for the development of quantum technologies, as it destroys superpositions in molecular quantum bits (qubits) and magnetic memory in single molecule magnets (SMMs). Gaining mechanistic insight into the spin relaxation process has proven challenging owing to a lack of spectroscopic observables and contradictions among theoretical models. Here, we use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to profile changes in spin relaxation rates (T 1) as a function of both temperature and magnetic field orientation, forming a two-dimensional data matrix. For randomly oriented powder samples, spin relaxation anisotropy changes dramatically with temperature, delineating multiple regimes of relaxation processes for each Cu(II) molecule studied. We show that traditional T 1 fitting approaches cannot reliably extract this information. Single-crystal T 1 anisotropy experiments reveal a surprising change in spin relaxation symmetry between these two regimes. We interpret this switch through the concept of a spin relaxation tensor, enabling discrimination between delocalized lattice phonons and localized molecular vibrations in the two relaxation regimes. Variable-temperature T 1 anisotropy thus provides a unique spectroscopic method to interrogate the character of nuclear motions causing spin relaxation and the loss of quantum information.

TI Extreme depolarization for any spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The opportunity to build quantum technologies operating with elementary quantum systems with more than two levels is now increasingly being examined, not least because of the availability of such systems in the laboratory. It is therefore essential to understand how these single systems initially in highly nonclassical states decohere on different timescales due to their coupling with the environment. In this work, we consider the depolarization, both isotropic and anisotropic, of a quantum spin of arbitrary spin quantum number j and focus on the study of the most superdecoherent states. We approach this problem from the perspective of the collective dynamics of a system of N = 2j constituent spin 1/2, initially in a symmetric state, undergoing collective depolarization. This allows us to use the powerful language of quantum information theory to analyze the fading of quantum properties of spin states caused by depolarization. In this framework, we establish a precise link between superdecoherence and entanglement. We present extensive numerical results on the scaling of the entanglement survival time with the Hilbert space dimension for collective depolarization. We also highlight the specific role played by anticoherent spin states and show how their Markovian isotropic depolarization alone can lead to the generation of bound entangled states.

TI A High-Throughput, BRAM-Efficient NTT/INTT Accelerator for ML-KEM
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The Number-Theoretic Transform is the primary performance bottleneck in hardware accelerators for post-quantum cryptography schemes like the Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism. A key design challenge is the trade-off between the massive parallelism required for low-latency computation and the prohibitive on-chip Block RAM consumption this typically entails. This paper introduces an NTT/INTT accelerator architecture that resolves this conflict, achieving a state-of-the-art latency of 40 clock cycles for a 256-point transform while utilizing only 5 BRAM blocks. Our architecture achieves this by pairing a 32-way parallel streaming datapath with a hybrid memory subsystem that strategically allocates on-chip storage resources. The core innovation is the use of distributed RAM instead of BRAM for high-bandwidth buffering of intermediate data between pipeline stages. This reserves the scarce BRAM resources for storing static twiddle factors and for system-level FIFO interfaces. By deliberately trading abundant logic fabric and dedicated DSP slices for BRAM efficiency, our work demonstrates a design point optimized for high-speed, BRAM-constrained System-on-Chip environments, proving that a focus on memory hierarchy is critical to developing PQC solutions that are both fast and practical for real-world integration.

AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a framework for implementing certain polynomial functions via quantum circuits. To construct a QSP circuit, one needs (i) a target polynomial P(z), which must satisfy vertical bar P(z)vertical bar <= 1 on the complex unit circle T and (ii) a complementary polynomial Q(z), which satisfies vertical bar P(z)vertical bar(2) + vertical bar Q(z)vertical bar(2) = 1 on T. We present two exact mathematical results within this context. First, we obtain an exact expression for a certain uniform polynomial approximant of 1/x, which is used to perform matrix inversion via quantum circuits. Second, given a generic target polynomial P(z), we construct the complementary polynomial Q(z) exactly via integral representations, valid throughout the entire complex plane.

TI Fixed Depth Hamiltonian Simulation via Cartan Decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulating quantum dynamics on classical computers is challenging for large systems due to the significant memory requirements. Simulation on quantum computers is a promising alternative, but fully optimizing quantum circuits to minimize limited quantum resources remains an open problem. We tackle this problem by presenting a constructive algorithm, based on Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonian, which generates quantum circuits with time-independent depth. We highlight our algorithm for special classes of models, including Anderson localization in one-dimensional transverse field XY model, where O(n2)-gate circuits naturally emerge. Compared to product formulas with significantly larger gate counts, our algorithm drastically improves simulation precision. In addition to providing exact circuits for a broad set of spin and fermionic models, our algorithm provides broad analytic and numerical insight into optimal Hamiltonian simulations.

AB One-way functions are central to classical cryptography. They are necessary for the existence of non-trivial classical cryptosystems, and also sufficient to realize meaningful primitives including commitments, pseudorandom generators and digital signatures. At the same time, a mounting body of evidence suggests that assumptions even weaker than one-way functions may suffice for many cryptographic tasks of interest in a quantum world, including bit commitments and secure multi-party computation.
   This work studies one-way state generators [Morimae-Yamakawa, CRYPTO 2022], a natural quantum relaxation of one-way functions. Given a secret key, a one-way state generator outputs a hard to invert quantum state. A fundamental question is whether this type of quantum one-wayness suffices to realize quantum cryptography. We obtain an affirmative answer to this question, by proving that one-way state generators with pure state outputs imply quantum bit commitments and secure multiparty computation.
   Along the way, we use efficient shadow tomography [Huang et. al., Nature Physics 2020] to build an intermediate primitive with classical outputs, which we call a (quantum) one-way puzzle. Our main technical contribution is a proof that one-way puzzles imply quantum bit commitments. This proof develops new techniques for pseudoentropy generation [Hastad et. al., SICOMP 1999] from arbitrary distributions, which may be of independent interest.

TI Intra-cavity frequency-doubled VECSEL system for narrow linewidth
   Rydberg EIT spectroscopy
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High-power, narrow-linewidth light sources in the visible and UV spectra are in growing demand, particularly as quantum information and sensing research proliferates. Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSELs) with intra-cavity frequency conversion are emerging as an attractive platform to fill these needs. Using such a device, we demonstrate 3.5MHz full-width half-maximum Rydberg-state spectroscopy via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The laser's 690mW of output power at a wavelength of 475 nm enables large Rabi frequencies and strong signal-to-noise ratio in shorter measurement times. In addition, we characterize the frequency stability of the VECSEL using the delayed self-heterodyne technique and direct comparison with a commercial external-cavity diode laser (ECDL). We measure the pre-doubled light's Lorentzian linewidth to be 2(pi) x 5.3(2) kHz, and the total linewidth to be 2(pi) x 23(2) kHz. These measurements provide evidence that intra-cavity frequency-doubled VECSELs can perform precision spectroscopy at and below the MHz level, and are a promising tool for contemporary, and future, quantum technologies.

   materials scandium based-material using Ab initio
   calculations
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Two-dimensional monolayers such as scandium oxyhalides are future compounds for prospective optoelectronics, quantum information, and quantum technologies. These two-dimensional materials have attracted much attention for fundamental and applied research due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties. In this framework, we investigate the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional ScOX (F, Cl, Br) compounds scandium-based materials employing density functional theory calculations. Our two-dimensional single -layer structures are dynamically stable, as evidenced by the phonon dispersion curves, which showed no unstable phonon modes. The TDOSs and BS calculations show that these 2D sheets are wide-band-gap semiconductors. Our spin -up and spin-down computations demonstrate that our monolayers are non-magnetic compounds. The imaginary part of the dielectric function of these two-dimensional materials disappears at around 30.00 eV, which is the energy dissipation function. Our compounds appear transparent once the incident light's frequency surpasses the plasma frequency (30.00 eV). The importance of absorption coefficient and gap energy suggests that these materials will be an effective compounds for optoelectronic applications.

TI Robust all-optical single-shot readout of nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-fidelity projective readout of a qubit's state in a single experimental repetition is a prerequisite for various quantum protocols of sensing and computing. Achieving single-shot readout is challenging for solid-state qubits. For Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, it has been realized using nuclear memories or resonant excitation at cryogenic temperature. All of these existing approaches have stringent experimental demands. In particular, they require a high efficiency of photon collection, such as immersion optics or all-diamond micro-optics. For some of the most relevant applications, such as shallow implanted NV centers in a cryogenic environment, these tools are unavailable. Here we demonstrate an all-optical spin readout scheme that achieves single-shot fidelity even if photon collection is poor (delivering less than 10(3) clicks/second). The scheme is based on spin-dependent resonant excitation at cryogenic temperature combined with spin-to-charge conversion, mapping the fragile electron spin states to the stable charge states. We prove this technique to work on shallow implanted NV centers, as they are required for sensing and scalable NV-based quantum registers. The NV center in diamond has been used extensively in sensing; however single shot readout of its spin remains challenging, requiring complex optical setups. Here, Irber et al. demonstrate a more robust scheme that achieves single-shot readout even when using inefficient detection optics.

TI Quantum advantage with membosonsampling
SO CHIP
AB Quantum computer, harnessing quantum superposition to boost a parallel computational power, promises to outperform its classical counterparts and offer an exponentially increased scaling. The term "quantum advantage" was proposed to mark the key point when people can solve a classically intractable problem by artificially controlling a quantum system in an unprecedented scale, even without error correction or known practical applications. Boson sampling, a problem about quantum evolutions of multi-photons on multimode photonic networks, as well as its variants, has been considered as a promising candidate to reach this milestone. However, the current photonic platforms suffer from the scaling problems, both in photon numbers and circuit modes. Here, we propose a new variant of the problem, membosonsampling, exploiting the scaling of the problem can be in principle extended to a large scale. We experimentally verify the scheme on a self-looped photonic chip inspired by memristor, and obtain multi-photon registrations up to 56-fold in 750,000 modes with a Hilbert space up to 10 254 . The results exhibit an integrated and cost-efficient shortcut stepping into the "quantum advantage" regime in a photonic system far beyond previous scenarios, and provide a scalable and controllable platform for quantum information processing.

TI Machine and quantum learning for diamond-based quantum applications
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, machine and quantum learning have gained considerable momentum sustained by growth in computational power and data availability and have shown exceptional aptness for solving recognition- and classification-type problems, as well as problems that require complex, strategic planning. In this work, we discuss and analyze the role machine and quantum learning are playing in the development of diamond-based quantum technologies. This matters as diamond and its optically addressable spin defects are becoming prime hardware candidates for solid state-based applications in quantum information, computing and metrology. Through a selected number of demonstrations, we show that machine and quantum learning are leading to both practical and fundamental improvements in measurement speed and accuracy. This is crucial for quantum applications, especially for those where coherence time and signal-to-noise ratio are scarce resources. We summarize some of the most prominent machine and quantum learning approaches that have been conducive to the presented advances and discuss their potential, as well as their limits, for proposed and future quantum applications.

TI Efficient characterizations of multiphoton states with an ultra-thin
   optical device
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Metasurface enables the generation and manipulation of multiphoton entanglement with flat optics, providing a more efficient platform for large-scale photonic quantum information processing. Here, we show that a single metasurface optical device would allow more efficient characterizations of multiphoton entangled states, such as shadow tomography, which generally requires fast and complicated control of optical setups to perform information-complete measurements, a demanding task using conventional optics. The compact and stable device here allows implementations of general positive operator valued measures with a reduced sample complexity and significantly alleviates the experimental complexity to implement shadow tomography. Integrating self-learning and calibration algorithms, we observe notable advantages in the reconstruction of multiphoton entanglement, including using fewer measurements, having higher accuracy, and being robust against experimental imperfections. Our work unveils the feasibility of metasurface as a favorable integrated optical device for efficient characterization of multiphoton entanglement, and sheds light on scalable photonic quantum technologies with ultra-thin optical devices.
   Shadow tomography is efficient for quantum state characterization. Here, the authors implement shadow tomography on photonic states with a single metasurface, which alleviates the complexity in measurement

TI Entanglement Quantification in Atomic Ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement measures quantify nonclassical correlations present in a quantum system, but can be extremely difficult to calculate, even more so, when information on its state is limited. Here, we consider broad families of entanglement criteria that are based on variances of arbitrary operators and analytically derive the lower bounds these criteria provide for two relevant entanglement measures: the best separable approximation and the generalized robustness. This yields a practical method for quantifying entanglement in realistic experimental situations, in particular, when only few measurements of simple observables are available. As a concrete application of this method, we quantify bipartite and multipartite entanglement in spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensates of similar to 500 atoms, by lower bounding the best separable approximation and the generalized robustness only from measurements of first and second moments of the collective spin operator.

TI Quantum Resonator as a Directional Quantum Emitter
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Single-photon sources are essential for testing fundamental physics and for the development of quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source is investigated, based on a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings system, where the resonator works as the quantum emitter rather than the two-level system. This role reversal provides certain advantages, such as robustness against losses from the two-level system (e.g., dephasing), as it remains in its ground state throughout the entire dynamics. This provides higher efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability compared to sources based on the usual Jaynes-Cummings model under the same parameter conditions in both models. Another advantage of this system is the possibility of direct conversion of a coherent excitation pulse with one photon on average to a single-photon pulse with efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability above . Since the entire excitation pulse is consumed in the generation of a single photon, the system also minimizes energy waste. The potential for implementing the two-photon JC model across different platforms expands the possibilities for controlled single-photon generation in applications in quantum information processing and computation.

TI Manipulation of single stored-photon with microwave field based on
   Rydberg polariton
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a coherent microwave manipulation of a single optical photon based on a single Rydberg excitation in an atomic ensemble. Due to the strong nonlinearities in a Rydberg blockade region, a single photon can be stored in the formation of Rydberg polariton using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The manipulation of the stored single photon is performed by applying a microwave field that resonantly couples the nS1/2 and nP3/2, while the coherent readout is performed by mapping the excitation into a single photon. We achieve a single photon source with g(2)(0) = 0.29 & PLUSMN; 0.08 at 80S1/2 without applying microwave fields. By implementing the microwave field during the storage time and retrieval process, we show the Rabi oscillation and modulation of stored photons that can be controlled to retrieve early or late. Rapid modulation frequencies up to 50 MHz can be obtained. Our experimental observations can be well explained via numerical simulations based on an improved superatom model accounting for the dipole-dipole interactions in a Rydberg EIT medium. Our work provides a way to manipulate the stored photons by employing the microwave field, which is significant for developing quantum technologies.

TI Method to deterministically generate large-amplitude optical cat states
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Cat states, as an important resource in the study of macroscopic quantum superposition and quantum information applications, have garnered widespread attention. To date, preparing large-sized optical cat states has remained challenging. We demonstrate that, by utilizing interaction-free measurement and the quantum Zeno effect, even a fragile quantum microscopic system can deterministically control and become entangled with strong light fields, thereby generating large-amplitude optical cat states. During the entire preparation process, our method ensures that the microscopic system functions within a weak field environment, so that its quantum property can be protected. Furthermore, we show that the preparation of cat states is possible even when the quantum microsystem suffers from significant photon loss, provided that optical losses from classical devices are kept low, which implies that the fidelity of the cat state can be enhanced by improvements to and the perfection of the classical optical system.
   In quantum physics, superposition-illustrated by Schr & ouml;dinger's cat being both dead and alive-inspires 'cat states', utilized in quantum technologies. The authors propose a theory where the optical state, through multiple indirect atom interactions in an interferometric setup, can generate large-amplitude optical cat states, advancing quantum applications.

TI Spin-dependent vibronic response of a carbon radical ion in
   two-dimensional WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-polarized defects in 2D materials are attracting attention for future quantum technology applications, but their controlled fabrication is still challenging. Here, the authors report the creation and characterization of effective spin 1/2 defects via the atomically-precise generation of magnetic carbon radical ions in 2D WS2.
   Atomic spin centers in 2D materials are a highly anticipated building block for quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an effective spin-1/2 system via the atomically controlled generation of magnetic carbon radical ions (CRIs) in synthetic two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Hydrogenated carbon impurities located at chalcogen sites introduced by chemical doping are activated with atomic precision by hydrogen depassivation using a scanning probe tip. In its anionic state, the carbon impurity is computed to have a magnetic moment of 1 mu(B) resulting from an unpaired electron populating a spin-polarized in-gap orbital. We show that the CRI defect states couple to a small number of local vibrational modes. The vibronic coupling strength critically depends on the spin state and differs for monolayer and bilayer WS2. The carbon radical ion is a surface-bound atomic defect that can be selectively introduced, features a well-understood vibronic spectrum, and is charge state controlled.

TI Flow-preserving ZX-calculus Rewrite Rules for Optimisation and
   Obfuscation
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 17-21, 2023
CL Paris, FRANCE
AB In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), computation proceeds via measurements on a resource state. So-called flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, with Pauli flow being the most general of these. Computations, represented as measurement patterns, may be rewritten to optimise resource use and for other purposes. Such rewrites need to preserve the existence of flow to ensure the new pattern can still be implemented deterministically. The majority of existing work in this area has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits, yet it can be beneficial to increase the number of qubits for certain kinds of optimisation, as well as for obfuscation. In this work, we introduce several ZX-calculus rewrite rules that increase the number of qubits and preserve the existence of Pauli flow. These rules can be used to transform any measurement pattern into a pattern containing only (general or Pauli) measurements within the XY-plane. We also give the first flow-preserving rewrite rule that allows measurement angles to be changed arbitrarily, and use this to prove that the 'neighbour unfusion' rule of Staudacher et al. preserves the existence of Pauli flow. This implies it may be possible to reduce the runtime of their two-qubit-gate optimisation procedure by removing the need to regularly run the costly gflow-finding algorithm.

TI Comparing the quantum witness, the entropic Leggett-Garg inequality and
   the NCGD
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we investigate the violation of the quantum witness, the entropic Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) and the no-coherence-generating-and-detecting (NCGD) dynamics, under projective and coarsening measurements. We consider a qubit in the three scenarios: coherent dynamics, in the presence of dissipation, and in the presence of dephasing. For the pure qubit, we find that in the case of the projective measurement, the non-violation conditions of the quantum witness and the NCGD are the same; while the non-violation conditions of the entropic LGI and the quantum witness do not contain each other, i.e., a suitable conjunction of the quantum witness and the entropic LGI may be better for testing macrorealism. Also, for the pure qubit with coarsening measurement similar results can be obtained. For the dissipative qubit with projective measurement, the quantum witness and the NCGD can be both violated for a wider parameter regime than the entropic LGI. For the dissipative qubit with coarsening measurement, the violation of the NCGD is the most robust compared to the quantum witness and the entropic LGI. For the dephasing qubit with projective and coarsening measurements, the relationship among the quantum witness, the entropic LGI and the NCGD is similar to that of the pure qubit. In addition, we find that for pure, dissipative and dephasing qubits, the robustness of the coarsening measurement in final resolution is more vulnerable than that of the coarsening measurement in reference for the entropic LGI.

TI Macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization: insights from the
   2025 Nobel Prize in Physics
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke (University of California, Berkeley, USA), Michel H. Devoret (Yale University, USA), and John M. Martinis (University of California, Santa Barbara, USA) for their pioneering experimental confirmation of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and macroscopic energy quantization in superconducting circuits. Since the foundation of quantum mechanics, one of the central questions has been the nature of the boundary between the microscopic quantum world and our classical macroscopic reality. The work of Clarke, Devoret, and Martinis is a definitive triumph in this decades-long pursuit. By demonstrating that quantum laws, previously confined to single particles, govern the collective dynamics of billions of electrons, their achievement fundamentally bridged the quantum-classical divide and ushered in a new era of physics where the direct engineering and control of macroscopic quantum systems became possible. This paper introduces and explains this monumental achievement. We begin by establishing the theoretical concepts of quantum tunneling and energy quantization in microscopic models. We then introduce the macroscopic quantum state, demonstrating how collective particle behavior allows these fundamental quantum phenomena to be introduced into a macroscopic system, using the Josephson phase as the key single quantum variable. Following the Nobel laureate in Physics, Anthony Leggett's theoretical idea on the problem, we discussed his experimental proposal on realizing macroscopic quantum superposition in superconducting circuits. We reviewed the Nobel Prize-winning experiments utilizing the biased Josephson junction, which conclusively validated MQT and energy quantization at the circuit level. The experiments were performed on a centimeter-square superconducting circuit. Finally, the paper reviews the explosive technological legacy of this research. The macroscopic quantum effects in superconducting circuits lead to the most sensitive magnetic field sensor, the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which achieves this sensitivity 10( - 15 )T/ Hz . The established quantum control directly fueled the development of the qubit. We track the subsequent, rapid acceleration in quantum computing. The coherence time of the superconducting qubits has been increased to ms from 10 ns, over the past 20 years. The first quantum supremacy experiment was performed with the superconducting quantum computer in 2019. We highlight the recent key global hardware advancements, e.g. the Google's Willow Chip and China's Zuchongzhi No. 3 with 104 qubits. Then, we conclude by discussing the enduring impact of the macroscopic quantum paradigm on realizing exotic quantum states, such as Schr & ouml;dinger's Cat and other theoretical "Schr & ouml;dinger's Bacteria" models, which were also based on superconducting circuits.

TI Operational applications of the diamond norm and related measures in
   quantifying the non-physicality of quantum maps
SO QUANTUM
AB Although quantum channels underlie the dynamics of quantum states, maps which are not physical channels- that is, not completely positive- can often be encountered in settings such as entanglement detection, non-Markovian quantum dynamics, or error mitigation. We introduce an operational approach to the quantitative study of the non-physicality of linear maps based on different ways to approximate a given linear map with quantum channels. Our first measure directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum channels, shifting the difficulty in simulating unphysical dynamics onto the task of simulating linear combinations of quantum states. Our second measure benchmarks the quantitative advantages that a non-completely-positive map can provide in discrimination-based quantum games. Notably, we show that for any trace-preserving map, the quantities both reduce to a fundamental distance measure: the diamond norm, thus endowing this norm with new operational meanings in the characterisation of linear maps. We discuss applications of our results to structural physical approximations of positive maps, quantification of non-Markovianity, and bounding the cost of error mitigation.

TI Strong signature of electron-vibration coupling in molecules on Ag(111)
   triggered by tip-gated discharging
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electron-vibration coupling is of critical importance for the development of molecular electronics, spintronics, and quantum technologies, as it affects transport properties and spin dynamics. The control over charge-state transitions and subsequent molecular vibrations using scanning tunneling microscopy typically requires the use of a decoupling layer. Here we show the vibronic excitations of tetrabromotetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules directly adsorbed on Ag(111) into an orientational glassy phase. The electron-deficient TBTAP is singly-occupied by an electron donated from the substrate, resulting in a spin 1/2 state, which is confirmed by a Kondo resonance. The TBTAP center dot- discharge is controlled by tip-gating and leads to a series of peaks in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These occurrences are explained by combining a double-barrier tunneling junction with a Franck-Condon model including molecular vibrational modes. This work demonstrates that suitable precursor design enables gate-dependent vibrational excitations of molecules on a metal, thereby providing a method to investigate electron-vibration coupling in molecular assemblies without a decoupling layer.
   Electron-vibration coupling is driving advances in molecular electronics, spintronics, and quantum technology. Here, the authors succeeded in directly controlling vibronic excitations in tetrabromotetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules on the surface of Ag(111).

TI 2D Material-Micro/Nano-Photonic Cavity Coupling Quantum Systems and
   Their Control in Multiple Degrees of Freedom (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit novel physical properties such as large exciton binding energy and the ability to be assembled as heterostructures. With the continuous development of 2D materials, their devices have shown significant potential in fileds such as optoelectronics, quantum information, and nanotechnology. Micro/nano-photonic cavities enable control of light-matter interactions at micro/nano-scale dimensions, offering an ideal platform for studying the exciton-photon coupling in the quantum regime. Consequently, the integration of 2D materials with micro/nano-photonic cavities has garnered considerable interest. This review summarizes representative devices that facilitate coupling between 2D materials and micro/nano-photonic cavities, with a focus on quasiparticle interactions and control in multiple degrees of freedom. By designing and manipulating these coupled systems, researchers can explore novel quantum phenomena such as exciton-photon polaritons and exciton-nanocavity coupling in the phononic degrees of freedom. The rich quantum effects observed in such systems demonstrate their notable potential for applications in quantum sources, nonlinear optics, and topological photonics. Despite challenges related to preparation and integration processes, and theoretical complexities involving strong correlations and many-body effects, the rapid progress in 2D material-micro/nano-photonic cavity coupling systems is opening new avenues for advancing quantum photonic technologies.

TI Recursive greedy initialization of the quantum approximate optimization
   algorithm with guaranteed improvement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm, where a quantum computer implements a variational ansatz consisting of p layers of alternating unitary operators and a classical computer is used to optimize the variational parameters. For a random initialization, the optimization typically leads to local minima with poor performance, motivating the search for initialization strategies of QAOA variational parameters. Although numerous heuristic initializations exist, an analytical understanding and performance guarantees for large p remain evasive. We introduce a greedy initialization of QAOA which guarantees improving performance with an increasing number of layers. Our main result is an analytic construction of 2p + 1 transition states-saddle points with a unique negative curvature direction-for QAOA with p + 1 layers that use the local minimum of QAOA with p layers. Transition states connect to new local minima, which are guaranteed to lower the energy compared to the minimum found for p layers. We use the GREEDY procedure to navigate the exponentially increasing with p number of local minima resulting from the recursive application of our analytic construction. The performance of the GREEDY procedure matches available initialization strategies while providing a guarantee for the minimal energy to decrease with an increasing number of layers p.

TI Calculating response functions of coupled oscillators using quantum
   phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the problem of estimating frequency response functions of systems of coupled, classical harmonic oscillators using a quantum computer. The functional form of these response functions can be mapped to a corresponding eigenproblem of a Hermitian matrix H, thus suggesting the use of quantum phase estimation. Our proposed quantum algorithm operates in the standard s-sparse, oracle-based query access model. For a network of N oscillators with maximum norm HHHmax, and when the eigenvalue tolerance epsilon is much smaller than the minimum eigenvalue gap, we use O(log(NsHHHmax/epsilon) algorithmic qubits and obtain a rigorous worst-case query complexity upper bound O(sHHHmax/(delta 2 epsilon)) up to logarithmic factors, where delta denotes the desired precision on the coefficients appearing in the response functions. Crucially, our proposal does not suffer from the infamous state preparation bottleneck and can as such potentially achieve large quantum speedups compared to relevant classical methods. As a proof-of-principle of exponential quantum speedup, we show that a simple adaptation of our algorithm solves the random glued-trees problem in polynomial time. We discuss practical limitations as well as potential improvements for quantifying finite-size, end-to-end complexities for application to relevant instances.

TI Si/SiGe QuBus for single electron information-processing devices with

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The connectivity within single carrier information-processing devices requires transport and storage of single charge quanta. Single electrons have been adiabatically transported while confined to a moving quantum dot in short, all-electrical Si/SiGe shuttle device, called quantum bus (QuBus). Here we show a QuBus spanning a length of 10 mu m and operated by only six simply-tunable voltage pulses. We introduce a characterization method, called shuttle-tomography, to benchmark the potential imperfections and local shuttle-fidelity of the QuBus. The fidelity of the single-electron shuttle across the full device and back (a total distance of 19 mu m) is (99.7 +/- 0.3) %. Using the QuBus, we position and detect up to 34 electrons and initialize a register of 34 quantum dots with arbitrarily chosen patterns of zero and single-electrons. The simple operation signals, compatibility with industry fabrication and low spin-environment-interaction in 28Si/SiGe, promises long-range spin-conserving transport of spin qubits for quantum connectivity in quantum computing architectures.
   Electron spin qubits in SiGe dots have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information processing. Here the authors demonstrate conveyor-mode single electron shuttling in a Si/SiGe quantum dot device spanning the length of 10 micrometres and operated with a small number of controls

TI Quantum Circuit Design of Toom 3-Way Multiplication
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In classical computation, Toom-Cook is one of the multiplication methods for large numbers which offers faster execution time compared to other algorithms such as schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication. For the use in quantum computation, prior work considered the Toom-2.5 variant rather than the classically faster and more prominent Toom-3, primarily to avoid the nontrivial division operations inherent in the latter circuit. In this paper, we investigate the quantum circuit for Toom-3 multiplication, which is expected to give an asymptotically lower depth than the Toom-2.5 circuit. In particular, we designed the corresponding quantum circuit and adopted the sequence proposed by Bodrato to yield a lower number of operations, especially in terms of nontrivial division, which is reduced to only one exact division by 3 circuit per iteration. Moreover, to further minimize the cost of the remaining division, we utilize the unique property of the particular division circuit, replacing it with a constant multiplication by reciprocal circuit and the corresponding swap operations. Our numerical analysis shows that the resulting circuit indeed gives a lower asymptotic complexity in terms of Toffoli depth and qubit count compared to Toom-2.5 but with a large number of Toffoli gates that mainly come from realizing the division operation.

TI Entanglement dynamics between Ising spins and a central ancilla
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate competing entanglement dynamics in an Ising spin chain coupled to an external central ancilla qudit. In studying the real-time behavior following a quench from an unentangled spin-ancilla state, we find that the ancilla entanglement entropy S-vN;A tracks the dynamical phase transition in the underlying spin system. In this composite setting, purely spin-spin entanglement metrics such as mutual information and quantum Fisher information (QFI) decay as the ancilla entanglement entropy grows. We define multipartite entanglement loss (MEL) as the difference between collective magnetic fluctuations and QFI, which is zero in the pure spin chain limit. MEL directly quantifies the ancilla's effect on the development of spin-spin entanglement. One of our central results is that we find M-el (t) proportional to e(SvN;A(t)). Our results provide a platform for exploring composite system entanglement dynamics and suggest that MEL serves as a quantitative estimate of information entropy shared between collective spins and the ancilla qudit. Our results present a framework that connects physical spin fluctuations, QFI, and bipartite entanglement entropy between collective quantum systems.

TI 12.6 dB squeezed light at 1550 nm from a bow-tie cavity for long-term
   high duty cycle operation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Squeezed states are an interesting class of quantum states that have numerous applications. This work presents the design, characterization, and operation of a bow-tie optical parametric amplifier (OPA) for squeezed vacuum generation. We report the high duty cycle operation and long-term stability of the system that makes it suitable for post-selection based continuous-variable quantum information protocols, cluster-state quantum computing, quantum metrology, and potentially gravitational wave detectors. Over a 50 hour continuous operation, the measured squeezing levels were greater than 10 dB with a duty cycle of 96.6%. Alternatively, in a different mode of operation, the squeezer can also operate 10 dB below the quantum noise limit over a 12 hour period with no relocks, with an average squeezing of 11.9 dB. We also measured a maximum squeezing level of 12.6 dB at 1550 nm. This represents one of the best reported squeezing results at 1550 nm to date for a bow-tie cavity. We discuss the design aspects of the experiment that contribute to the overall stability, reliability, and longevity of the OPA, along with the automated locking schemes and different modes of operation.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Let?s do it right the first time: Survey on security concerns in the way
   to quantum software engineering
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Quantum computing is no longer a promise of the future but a rapidly evolving reality. Advances in quan-tum hardware are making it possible to make tangible a computational reality that until now was only theoretical. The proof of this is that development languages and platforms are appearing that bring phys-ical principles closer to developers, making it feasible to begin to propose, in different areas of society, solutions to problems that until now were unsolvable. However, security vulnerabilities are also emerg-ing that could hinder the progress of quantum computing, as well as its transition and development in industry. For this reason, this article proposes a review of some of the first artefacts that are emerging in the field of quantum computing. From this analysis, we begin to identify possible security issues that could become potential vulnerabilities in the quantum software of tomorrow. Likewise, and following the experience in classical software development, the testing technique is analysed as a possible candidate for improving security in quantum software development. Following the principles of Quantum Software Engineering, we are aware of the lack of tools, techniques and knowledge necessary to guaran-tee the development of quantum software in the immediate future. Therefore, this article aims to offer some first clues on what would be a roadmap to guarantee secure quantum software development. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Application of machine learning to experimental design in quantum
   mechanics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The recent advances in Machine Learning hold great promises for the field of quantum sensing and metrology. With the help of reinforcement learning, we can tame the complexity of quantum systems and solve the problem of optimal experimental design. Reinforcement learning is a powerful model-free technique that allows an agent, which is typically a neural network, to learn the best strategy to reach a certain goal in a completely a priori unknown environment. However, in general, we know something about the quantum system the agent is interacting with, at least that it follows the rules of quantum mechanics. In quantum metrology, we typically have a model for the system and only some parameters of the evolution or of the initial state are unknown. We present here a general Machine Learning technique that can optimize the precision of quantum sensors, and in doing so it exploits the knowledge we have on the system. We have developed a Python package to automate a broad class of optimizations that can be found in the tasks of quantum parameter estimation, quantum metrology and quantum hypothesis testing. What the agent is learning here is an optimal adaptive strategy, that, on the basis of the previous outcomes, decides the next measurements to perform. It works both for Bayesian estimation and for frequentist estimation. The user is required to implement the physics of the system to be studied and state which parameters in the experiment are controllable and which are unknowns. The functions of the library allow then to easily train a neural network agent for optimizing the precision of the sensor, by simulating the experiment. We have explored some applications of this technique to magnetometry on NV centers (both DC and AC), to state discrimination in quantum optics and to phase estimation. So far, we were able to certify better results than the current state-of-the-art controls for many examples. The Machine Learning technique developed here can be applied in all those scenarios where the quantum system is well characterized and relatively simple and small. In these cases, we can squeeze every last bit of information from a quantum sensor by controlling it with a neural network appropriately trained.

TI Determining the Ensemble N-Representability of Reduced Density
   Matrices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The N-representability problem for reduced density matrices remains a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. Following our previous work that employs a unitary-evolution algorithm based on an adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to probe pure-state N-representability of reduced density matrices [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy that embeds an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness.

TI Open dynamics of entanglement in mesoscopic bosonic systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A key issue in quantum information is finding an adequate description of mesoscopic systems that is simpler than full quantum formalism yet retains crucial information about non-classical phenomena like entanglement. In particular, the study of fully bosonic systems undergoing open evolution is of great importance for the advancement of photonic quantum computing and communication. In this paper, we propose a mesoscopic description of such systems based on boson number correlations. This description allows for tracking Markovian open evolution of entanglement of both non-Gaussian and Gaussian states and their sub-Poissonian statistics. It can be viewed as a generalization of the reduced state of the field formalism (Alicki 2019 Entropy 21 705), which by itself does not contain information about entanglement. As our approach adopts the structure of the description of two particles in terms of first quantization, it allows for broad intuitive usage of known tools. Using the proposed formalism, we show the robustness of entanglement against low-temperature damping for four-mode bright squeezed vacuum state and beam-splitted single photon. We also present a generalization of the Mandel Q parameter. Building upon this, we show that the entanglement of the state obtained by beam splitting of a single occupied mode is inherited from sub-Poissonian statistics of the input state.

   in the Quantification of DNA and RNA Extracted from Frozen and FFPE
   Tissues from Lung Cancer Patients: A Real-World Use of Genomic Tests
SO MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB Background and Objectives: Panel-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been carried out in daily clinical settings for the diagnosis and treatment guidance of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The success of genomic tests including NGS depends in large part on preparing better-quality DNA or RNA; however, there are no established operating methods for preparing genomic DNA and RNA samples. Materials and Methods: We compared the following two quantitative methods, the QubitTM and NanoDropTM, using 585 surgical specimens, 278 biopsy specimens, and 82 cell block specimens of lung cancer that were used for genetic tests, including NGS. We analyzed the success rate of the genomic tests, including NGS, which were performed with DNA and RNA with concentrations that were outliers for the Qubit Fluorometer. Results: The absolute value for DNA concentrations had a tendency to be higher when measured with NanoDropTM regardless of the type of specimen; however, this was not the case for RNA. The success rate of DNA-based genomic tests using specimens with a concentration below the lower limit of QubitTM detection was as high as approximately 96%. At less than 60%, the success rate of RNA-based genomic tests, including RT-PCR, was not as satisfactory. The success rates of the AmpliSeqTM DNA panel sequencing and RNA panel sequencing were 77.8% and 91.5%, respectively. If at least one PCR amplification product could be obtained, then all RNA-based sequencing was performed successfully. Conclusions: The concentration measurements with NanoDropTM are reliable. The success rate of NGS with samples at concentrations below the limit of detection of QubitTM was relatively higher than expected, and it is worth performing PCR-based panel sequencing, especially in cases where re-biopsy cannot be performed.

TI Low-loss high-impedance circuit for quantum transduction between optical
   and microwave photons
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum transducers between microwave and optical photons are essential for long-distance quantum networks based on superconducting qubits. An optically active self-assembled quantum dot molecule (QDM) is an attractive platform for the implementation of a quantum transducer because an exciton in a QDM can be efficiently coupled to both optical and microwave fields at the single-photon level. Recently, the transduction between microwave and optical photons has been demonstrated with a QDM integrated with a superconducting resonator. In this paper, we present a design of a QD-high impedance resonator device with a low microwave loss and an expected large single-microwave photon coupling strength of 100s of MHz. We integrate self-assembled QDs onto a high-impedance superconducting resonator using a transfer printing technique and demonstrate a low-microwave loss rate of 1.8 MHz and gate tunability of the QDs. The corresponding microwave photon decay time of 88 ns is longer than the time necessary for the optical-microwave transduction process as well as the transmon-resonator swap operation time. This feature will facilitate efficient quantum transduction between an optical and microwave qubit.

TI A Review of Post-Quantum Privacy Preservation for IoMT Using Blockchain
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has significantly enhanced the healthcare system by enabling advanced patient monitoring, data analytics, and remote interactions. Given that IoMT devices generate vast amounts of sensitive data, robust privacy mechanisms are essential. This privacy requirement is critical for IoMT as, generally, these devices are very resource-constrained with limited storage, computation, and communication capabilities. Blockchain technology, with its decentralisation, transparency, and immutability, offers a promising solution for improving IoMT data security and privacy. However, the recent emergence of quantum computing necessitates developing measures to maintain the security and integrity of these data against emerging quantum threats. This work addresses the current gap of a comprehensive review and analysis of the research efforts to secure IoMT data using blockchain in the quantum era. We discuss the importance of blockchain for IoMT privacy and analyse the impact of quantum computing on blockchain to justify the need for these works. We also provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on quantum-resistant techniques for effective blockchain solutions in IoMT applications. From our detailed review, we present challenges and future opportunities for blockchain technology in this domain.

TI Optimal depth and a novel approach to variational unitary quantum
   process tomography
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this work, we present two new methods for variational quantum circuit (VQC) process tomography (PT) onto n qubits systems: unitary PT based on VQCs (PT_VQC) and unitary evolution-based variational quantum singular value decomposition (U-VQSVD). Compared to the state of the art, PT_VQC halves in each run the required amount of qubits for unitary PT and decreases the required state initializations from 4 n to just 2 n , all while ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction of the targeted unitary channel U. It is worth noting that, for a fixed reconstruction accuracy, PT_VQC achieves faster convergence per iteration step compared to quantum deep neural network and tensor network schemes. The novel U-VQSVD algorithm utilizes variational singular value decomposition to extract eigenvectors (up to a global phase) and their associated eigenvalues from an unknown unitary representing a universal channel. We assess the performance of U-VQSVD by executing an attack on a non-unitary channel quantum physical unclonable function. By using U-VQSVD we outperform an uninformed impersonation attack (using randomly generated input states) by a factor of 2 to 5, depending on the qubit dimension. For the two presented methods, we propose a new approach to calculate the complexity of the displayed VQC, based on what we denote as optimal depth.

TI Certification of Gaussian Boson Sampling via graphs feature vectors and
   kernels
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a non-universal model for quantum computing inspired by the original formulation of the Boson Sampling (BS) problem. Nowadays, it represents a paradigmatic quantum platform to reach the quantum advantage regime in a specific computational model. Indeed, thanks to the implementation in photonics-based processors, the latest GBS experiments have reached a level of complexity where the quantum apparatus has solved the task faster than currently up-to-date classical strategies. In addition, recent studies have identified possible applications beyond the inherent sampling task. In particular, a direct connection between photon counting of a genuine GBS device and the number of perfect matchings in a graph has been established. In this work, we propose to exploit such a connection to benchmark GBS experiments. We interpret the properties of the feature vectors of the graph encoded in the device as a signature of correct sampling from the true input state. Within this framework, two approaches are presented. The first method exploits the distributions of graph feature vectors and classification via neural networks. The second approach investigates the distributions of graph kernels. Our results provide a novel approach to the actual need for tailored algorithms to benchmark large-scale Gaussian Boson Samplers.

TI A Quantum-Like Model for Predicting Human Decisions in the Entangled
   Social Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB Human-centered systems of systems, such as social networks, the Internet of Things, or healthcare systems are growingly becoming significant facets of modern life. Realistic models of human behavior in such systems play an essential role in their accurate modeling and prediction. Nevertheless, human behavior under uncertainty often violates the predictions by the conventional probabilistic models. Recently, quantum-like decision theories have shown a considerable potential to explain the contradictions in human behavior by applying quantum probabilities. But providing a quantum-like decision theory that could predict rather than describe the current state of human behavior is still one of the unsolved challenges. The fundamental contribution of this work is introducing the concept of entanglement from quantum information theory to Bayesian networks (BNs). This concept leads to an entangled quantum-like BN (QBN), in which each human is a part of the entire society. Accordingly, society's effect on the dynamic evolution of the decision-making process, which is less often considered in decision theories, is modeled by entanglement measures. To reach this aim, we introduce a quantum-like witness and find the relationship between this witness and the famous concurrence entanglement measure. The proposed predictive entangled QBN (PEQBN) is evaluated on 22 experimental tasks. Results confirm that PEQBN provides more realistic predictions of human decisions under uncertainty when compared with classical BNs and three recent quantum-like approaches.

TI Temperature-Dependent Spectral Properties of Hexagonal Boron Nitride
   Color Centers
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as a mature platform for single-photon sources in quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigate the temperature-dependent spectral properties of a single defect in hBN to understand the dominant dephasing mechanisms due to phonons. We observe a sharp zero-phonon line (ZPL) emission accompanied by Stokes and anti-Stokes optical phonon sidebands assisted by the Raman-active low-energy (approximate to 6.5 meV) interlayer shear mode of hBN. The shape of the spectral lines around the ZPL is measured down to 78 K, at which the line width of the ZPL is measured as 211 mu eV. Using a quadratic electron-phonon interaction, the temperature-dependent broadening and the lineshift of the ZPL are found to follow a temperature dependence of T + T 5 and T + T 3, respectively. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent line shape around the ZPL at low-temperature conditions is modeled with a linear electron-phonon coupling theory, which results in a 0 K Debye-Waller factor of the ZPL emission as 0.59. Our results provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling in hBN, which is critical to enhance their potential for applications in quantum technologies.

TI Observation of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules
SO NATURE
AB Ensembles of particles governed by quantum mechanical laws exhibit intriguing emergent behaviour. Atomic quantum gases(1,2), liquid helium(3,4) and electrons in quantum materials(5-7) all exhibit distinct properties because of their composition and interactions. Quantum degenerate samples of ultracold dipolar molecules promise the realization of new phases of matter and new avenues for quantum simulation(8) and quantum computation(9). However, rapid losses(10), even when reduced through collisional shielding techniques(11-13), have so far prevented evaporative cooling to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we report on the realization of a BEC of dipolar molecules. By strongly suppressing two- and three-body losses via enhanced collisional shielding, we evaporatively cool sodium-caesium molecules to quantum degeneracy and cross the phase transition to a BEC. The BEC reveals itself by a bimodal distribution when the phase-space density exceeds 1. BECs with a condensate fraction of 60(10)% and a temperature of 6(2)nK are created and found to be stable with a lifetime close to 2s. This work opens the door to the exploration of dipolar quantum matter in regimes that have been inaccessible so far, promising the creation of exotic dipolar droplets(14), self-organized crystal phases(15) and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices(16).

TI Non-perturbative many-body treatment of molecular magnets
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Molecular magnets have received significant attention because of their potential applications in quantum information and quantum computing. A delicate balance of electron correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), ligand field splitting, and other effects produces a persistent magnetic moment within each molecular magnet unit. The discovery and design of molecular magnets with improved functionalities would be greatly aided by accurate computations. However, the competition among the different effects poses a challenge for theoretical treatments. Electron correlation plays a central role since d- or f-element ions, which provide the magnetic states in molecular magnets, often require explicit many-body treatments. SOC, which expands the dimensionality of the Hilbert space, can also lead to non-perturbative effects in the presence of strong interaction. Furthermore, molecular magnets are large, with tens of atoms in even the smallest systems. We show how an ab initio treatment of molecular magnets can be achieved with auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, in which electron correlation, SOC, and material specificity are included accurately and on an equal footing. The approach is demonstrated by an application to compute the zero-field splitting of a locally linear Co2+ complex.

TI Function smoothing regularization for precision factorization machine
   annealing in continuous variable optimization problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Solving continuous variable optimization problems by factorization machine quantum annealing (FMQA) demonstrates the potential of Ising machines to be extended as a solver for integer and real optimization problems. However, the details of the Hamiltonian function surface obtained by the factorization machine (FM) have been overlooked. This study shows that in the widely used case where real numbers are represented by a combination of binary variables, the function surface of the Hamiltonian obtained by FM can be very noisy. This noise interferes with the inherent capabilities of quantum annealing and is likely to be a substantial cause of problems previously considered unsolvable because of the limitations of FMQA performance. The origin of the noise is identified and a simple, general method is proposed to prevent its occurrence. The generalization performance of the proposed method and its ability to solve practical problems is demonstrated.

TI Nanoparticle self-assemblies with modern complexity
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Thanks to decades of tireless efforts, nanoparticle assemblies have reached an extremely high level of controllability, sophistication, and complexity, with new insights provided by integration with graph theory, cutting-edge characterization, and machine learning (ML)-based computation and modeling, as well as with ever-diversifying applications in energy, catalysis, biomedicine, optics, electronics, magnetics, organic biosynthesis, and quantum technology. Nanoparticle assemblies can be crystalline, known as superlattices or supracrystals. Their assembly entails a transition from disorder-dispersed nanoparticles-to order, which can be achieved through classical nucleation pathways or nonclassical pathways via prenucleation precursors or particle aggregation. The periodic lattices allow facile manipulations of electrons, phonons, photons, and even spins, leading to advanced device components and metamaterials. Meanwhile, aperiodic assemblies out of nanoparticles, such as gels, networks, and amorphous solids, also start to attract attention. Despite the loss of periodicity, symmetry-lowering or symmetry-breaking three-dimensional (3D) structures emerge with unique properties, such as chiroptical activity, topological mechanical strength, and quantum entanglement. Real-space imaging such as electron microscopy and x-ray-based tomography methods are utilized to characterize these complex structures, whereas mathematical tools such as graph theories are in need to describe such complex structures. This issue aims to provide a timely review of the efforts in this greatly broadened materials design space, including experiment, simulation, theory, and applications. Nine top experts (and their teams) from four countries deliver six articles summarizing fundamental mechanistic understandings of nanoparticle assemblies, highlighted with the developments of state-of-the-art in situ characterization tools and ML-assisted reverse engineering, and newly emergent applications of nanoarchitectures.

TI Optimal Scaling Quantum Linear-Systems Solver via Discrete Adiabatic
   Theorem
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recently, several approaches to solving linear systems on a quantum computer have been formulated in terms of the quantum adiabatic theorem for a continuously varying Hamiltonian. Such approaches have enabled near-linear scaling in the condition number K of the linear system, without requiring a complicated variable-time amplitude amplification procedure. However, the most efficient of those procedures is still asymptotically suboptimal by a factor of log(K). Here, we prove a rigorous form of the adiabatic theorem that bounds the error in terms of the spectral gap for intrinsically discrete-time evolutions. In combination with the qubitized quantum walk, our discrete adiabatic theorem gives a speed-up for all adiabatic algorithms. Here, we use this combination to develop a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems that is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that the complexity is strictly linear in K, matching a known lower bound on the complexity. Our O[K log(1/E)] complexity is also optimal in terms of the combined scaling in K and the precision E. Compared to existing suboptimal methods, our algorithm is simpler and easier to implement. Moreover, we determine the constant factors in the algorithm, which would be suitable for determining the complexity in terms of gate counts for specific applications.

TI Entanglement-Assisted Communication Surpassing the Ultimate Classical
   Capacity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement underpins a variety of quantum-enhanced communication, sensing, and computing capabilities. Entanglement-assisted communication (EACOMM) leverages entanglement preshared by communicating parties to boost the rate of classical information transmission. Pioneering theory works showed that EACOMM can enable a communication rate well beyond the ultimate classical capacity of optical communications, but an experimental demonstration of any EACOMM advantage remains elusive. In this Letter we report the implementation of EACOMM surpassing the classical capacity over lossy and noisy bosonic channels. We construct a high-efficiency entanglement source and a phase-conjugate quantum receiver to reap the benefit of preshared entanglement, despite entanglement being broken by channel loss and noise. We show that EACOMM beats the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland capacity of classical communication by up to 16.3%, when both protocols are subject to the same power constraint at the transmitter. As a practical performance benchmark, we implement a classical communication protocol with the identical characteristics for the encoded signal, showing that EACOMM can reduce the bit-error rate by up to 69% over the same bosonic channel. Our work opens a route to provable quantum advantages in a wide range of quantum information processing tasks.

TI Quantum State Tomography in Nonequilibrium Environments
SO PHOTONICS
AB We generalize an approach to studying the quantum state tomography (QST) of open systems in terms of the dynamical map in Kraus representation within the framework of dynamic generation of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures. As applications, we use the generalized approach to theoretically study the QST of qubit systems in the presence of nonequilibrium environments which exhibit nonstationary and non-Markovian random telegraph noise statistical properties. We derive the time-dependent measurement operators for the quantum state reconstruction of the single qubit and two-qubit systems in terms of the polarization operator basis. It is shown that the behavior of the time-dependent measurement operators is closely associated with the dynamical map of the qubit systems.

TI Light-emitting devices based on atomically thin MoSe2
SO JOURNAL OF SEMICONDUCTORS
AB Atomically thin MoSe2 layers, as a core member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family, benefit from their appealing properties, including tunable band gaps, high exciton binding energies, and giant oscillator strengths, thus providing an intriguing platform for optoelectronic applications of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), single-photon emitters (SPEs), and coherent light sources (CLSs). Moreover, these MoSe2 layers can realize strong excitonic emission in the near-infrared wavelengths, which can be combined with the silicon-based integration technologies and further encourage the development of the new generation technologies of on-chip optical interconnection, quantum computing, and quantum information processing. Herein, we overview the state-of-the-art applications of light-emitting devices based on two-dimensional MoSe2 layers. Firstly, we introduce recent developments in excitonic emission features from atomically thin MoSe2 and their dependences on typical physical fields. Next, we focus on the exciton-polaritons and plasmon-exciton polaritons in MoSe2 coupled to the diverse forms of optical microcavities. Then, we highlight the promising applications of LEDs, SPEs, and CLSs based on MoSe2 and their heterostructures. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities for high-quality emission of MoSe2 and high-performance light-emitting devices.

TI Dynamic phases induced by two-level system defects on driven qubits
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Recent experimental evidences point to two-level defects, located in the oxides and on the interfaces of the Josephson junctions, as the major constituents of decoherence in superconducting qubits. How these defects affect the qubit evolution with the presence of external driving is less well understood since the semiclassical qubit-field coupling renders the Jaynes-Cummings model for qubit-defect coupling undiagonalizable. We analyze the decoherence dynamics in the continuous coherent state space induced by the driving and solve the master equation endowed with an extra decay-cladded driving term via a Fokker-Planck equation. The solutions for diffusion propagators as Gaussian distributions show four distinct dynamic phases: four types of convergence paths to limit cycles of varying radius by the distribution mean, which are determined by the competing external driving and the defect decays. The qubit trajectory resulted from these solutions is a super-Poissonian over displaced Fock states, which reduces to a Gibbs state of effective temperature decided by the defect at zero driving limit. Furthermore, the Poincare map shows the dependence of the rate of convergence on the initial state. In other words, the qubit evolution can serve as an indicator of the defect coupling strength through the variation of the driving strength as a parameter.

TI Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Transmission in
   NOMA-Based Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-QDRL) framework to optimize uplink access in Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (IRSA-NOMA) systems under practical constraints such as finite frame lengths and fading channels. IRSA enhances reliability by allowing devices to transmit multiple packet replicas across random time slots, while NOMA increases spectral efficiency through power-domain multiplexing with successive interference cancellation (SIC). As a benchmark, Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) improves traditional ALOHA through packet repetition and interference cancellation, maintaining solid performance under moderate network loads; however, its efficiency gradually declines under heavier traffic due to increased collisions and limited adaptability. Conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-CDRL) approaches have been explored to address coordination challenges in such environments. Nevertheless, these models often experience scalability limitations and unstable convergence as the number of agents increases. To overcome these challenges, MA-QDRL integrates variational quantum circuits into agents' policy networks to improve learning efficiency and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-QDRL reduces packet loss rate by 63.2% compared to classical DRL and by 39.2% compared to CRDSA-NOMA under high network load conditions (G = 1.0), confirming its effectiveness in highly congested IoT environments. In addition, it reduces overall computational cost compared to MA-CDRL. These results highlight the potential of MA-QDRL as a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic multi-agent wireless access in next-generation IoT networks.

TI Entanglement entropy and flow in two-dimensional QCD: Parton and string
   duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We discuss quantum entanglement between fast and slow degrees of freedom, in a two-dimensional (2D) large Nc gauge theory with Dirac quarks, quantized on the light front. Using the 't Hooft wave functions, we construct the reduced density matrix for an interval in the momentum fraction x space, and calculate its von Neumann entropy in terms of structure functions, that are measured by deep inelastic scattering on mesons (hadrons in general). We found that the entropy is bounded by an area law with logarithmic divergences, proportional to the rapidity of the meson. The evolution of the entanglement entropy with rapidity is fixed by the cumulative singlet parton distribution function (PDF), and bounded from above by a Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of 1. At low x, the entanglement exhibits an asymptotic expansion, similar to the forward meson-meson scattering amplitude in the Regge limit. The evolution of the entanglement entropy in parton x per unit rapidity measures the meson singlet PDF. The resummed entanglement entropy along the single meson Regge trajectory is stringlike. We suggest that its extension to multimeson states models deep inelastic scattering on a large 2D"nucleus." The result is a large rate of change of the entanglement entropy with rapidity, that matches the current Bekenstein-Bremermann bound for maximum quantum information flow. This mechanism may be at the origin of the large entropy deposition and rapid thermalization, reported in current heavy ion colliders, and may extend to future electron-ion colliders.

TI Grover-QAOA for 3-SAT: quadratic speedup, fair-sampling, and parameter
   clustering
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The SAT problem is a prototypical NP-complete problem of fundamental importance in computational complexity theory with many applications in science and engineering; as such, it has long served as an essential benchmark for classical and quantum algorithms. This study shows numerical evidence for a quadratic speedup of the Grover Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (G-QAOA) over random sampling for finding all solutions to 3-SAT (All-SAT) and Max-SAT problems. G-QAOA is less resource-intensive and more adaptable for these problems than Grover's algorithm, and it surpasses conventional QAOA in its ability to sample all solutions. We show these benefits by classical simulations of many-round G-QAOA on thousands of random 3-SAT instances. We also observe G-QAOA advantages on the IonQ Aria quantum computer for small instances, finding that current hardware suffices to determine and sample all solutions. Interestingly, a single-angle-pair constraint that uses the same pair of angles at each G-QAOA round greatly reduces the classical computational overhead of optimizing the G-QAOA angles while preserving its quadratic speedup. We also find parameter clustering of the angles. The single-angle-pair protocol and parameter clustering significantly reduce obstacles to classical optimization of the G-QAOA angles.

TI Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity in Composite Materials: A Device
   Perspective
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Magnetism is an area of immense fundamental and technological importance. At the atomic level, magnetism originates from electron "spin". The field of nanospintronics (or nanoscale spin-based electronics) aims to control spins in nanoscale systems, which has resulted in astronomical improvement in data storage and magnetic field sensing technologies over the past few decades, recognized by the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics. Spins in nanoscale solid-state devices can also act as quantum bits or qubits for emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum sensing. Due to the fundamental connection between magnetism and spins, ferromagnets play a key role in many solid-state spintronic devices. This is because at the Fermi level, electron density of states is spin-polarized, which permits ferromagnets to act as electrical injectors and detectors of spins. Ferromagnets, however, have limitations in terms of low spin polarization at the Fermi level, stray magnetic fields, crosstalk, and thermal instability at the nanoscale. Therefore, new physics and new materials are needed to propel spintronic and quantum device technologies to the true atomic limit. Emerging new phenomena such as chirality induced spin selectivity or CISS, in which an intriguing correlation between carrier spin and medium chirality is observed, could therefore be instrumental in nanospintronics. This effect could allow molecular-scale, chirality controlled spin injection and detection without the need for any ferromagnet, thus opening a fundamentally new direction for device spintronics. While CISS finds a myriad of applications in diverse areas such as chiral separation, recognition, detection, and asymmetric catalysis, in this focused Account, we exclusively review spintronic device results of this effect due to its immense potential for future spintronics. The first generation of CISS-based spintronic devices have primarily used chiral bioorganic molecules; however, many practical limitations of these materials have also been identified. Therefore, our discussion revolves around the family of chiral composite materials, which may emerge as an ideal platform for CISS due to their ability to assimilate various desirable material properties on a single platform. This class of materials has been extensively studied by the organic chemistry community in the past decades, and we discuss the various chirality transfer mechanisms that have been identified, which play a central role in CISS. Next, we discuss CISS device studies performed on some of these chiral composite materials. Emphasis is given to the family of chiral organic-carbon allotrope composites, which have been extensively studied by the authors of this Account over the past several years. Interestingly, due to the presence of multiple materials, CISS signals from hybrid chiral systems sometimes differ from those observed in purely chiral systems. Given the sheer diversity of chiral composite materials, CISS device studies so far have been limited to only a few varieties, and this Account is expected to draw increased attention to the family of chiral composites and motivate further studies of their CISS applications.

TI Quantum fitting framework applied to effective field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The use of experimental data to constrain the values of the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory involves minimizing a x2 function that may contain local minima. Classical optimization algorithms can become trapped in these minima, preventing the determination of the global minimum. The quantum annealing framework has the potential to overcome this limitation and reliably find the global minimum of nonconvex functions. We present QFitter, a quantum annealing method to perform effective field theory fits. Using a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, we show with concrete examples that QFitter can be used to fit sets of at least eight coefficients, including their quadratic contributions. An arbitrary number of observables can be included without changing the required number of qubits. We provide an example in which x2 is nonconvex and show that QFitter can find the global minimum more accurately than its classical alternatives.

TI Error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolvers using tailored
   probabilistic machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing technology has the potential to revolutionize the simulation of materials and molecules in the near future. A primary challenge in achieving near-term quantum advantage is effectively mitigating the noise effects inherent in current quantum processing units (QPUs). This challenge is also decisive in the context of quantum-classical hybrid schemes employing variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) that have attracted significant interest in recent years. In this paper, we present a method that employs parametric Gaussian process regression (GPR) within an active learning framework to mitigate noise in quantum computations, focusing on VQEs. Our approach, grounded in probabilistic machine learning, exploits a custom prior based on the VQE ansatz to capture the underlying correlations between VQE outputs for different variational parameters, thereby enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a two-site Anderson impurity model and a eight-site Heisenberg model, using the IBM open-source quantum computing framework, Qiskit, showcasing substantial improvements in the accuracy of VQE outputs while reducing the number of direct QPU energy evaluations. This paper contributes to the ongoing efforts in quantum-error mitigation and optimization, bringing us a step closer to realizing the potential of quantum computing in quantum matter simulations.

TI Single Temporal-Pulse-Modulated Parameterized Controlled-Phase Gate for
   Rydberg Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose an adiabatic protocol for implementing a controlled-phase gate CZ0 with continuous 0 of neutral atoms through a symmetrical two-photon excitation process via the second resonance line, 6P in 87Rb, with a single-temporal-modulation-coupling of the ground state and intermediate state. Relying on different adiabatic paths, the phase factor 0 of the CZ0 gate can be accumulated on the logic qubit state |11) alone by calibrating the shape of the temporal pulse where strict zero amplitudes at the start and end of the pulse are not needed. For a wide range of 0, we can obtain the fidelity of the CZ0 gate over 99.7% in less than 1 mu s, in the presence of spontaneous emission from intermediate and Rydberg states. And in particular for 0 = 7r, we benchmark the performance of the CZ gate by taking into account various experimental imperfections, such as Doppler shifts, fluctuation of Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strength, inhomogeneous Rabi frequency, and noise of driving fields, etc., and show that the predicted fidelity is able to maintain at about 98.4% after correcting the measurement error. This gate protocol provides a robustness against the fluctuation of pulse amplitude and a flexible way for adjusting the entangling phase, which may contribute to the experimental implementation of near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum computation and algorithm with neutral-atom systems.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB In this short topical review, we look at something typically considered trivial, but not given formally elsewhere-the behaviour of first multiple fermions, then multiple bosons, in a beamsplitter. Extending from this, we then describe the behaviour of multiple fermions and multiple bosons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We hope that by showing how to go from mathematically simple but unintuitive quantum field theory to a phenomenological description, this review will help both researchers and students build a stronger intuition for the behaviour of quantum particles.

TI Ultrastrong magnetic light-matter interaction with cavity mode
   engineering
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Magnetic interaction between photons and dipoles is essential in electronics, sensing, spectroscopy, and quantum computing. However, its weak strength often requires resonators to confine and store the photons. Here, we present mode engineering techniques to create resonators with ultrasmall mode volume and ultrahigh quality factor. In particular, we show that it is possible to achieve an arbitrarily small mode volume only limited by materials or fabrication with minimal quality-factor degradation. We compare mode-engineered cavities in a trade-off space and show that the magnetic interaction can be strengthened more than 10(16) times compared to free space. Proof-of-principles experiments using an ensemble of diamond nitrogen-vacancy spins show good agreement with our theoretical predictions. These methods enable new applications from high-cooperativity microwave-spin coupling in quantum computing or compact electron paramagnetic resonance sensors to fundamental science such as dark matter searches.
   Enhancing the inherently weak interaction of photons and magnetic dipoles can revolutionize emerging technologies by unlocking applications in electronics, sensing, and quantum computing. The authors present the mode engineering methods of microwave cavities, which promise enhancements of such interaction to over 10(16) times compared to free space.

TI Practical Quantum K-Means Clustering: Performance Analysis and
   Applications in Energy Grid Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this work, we aim to solve a practical use-case of unsupervised clustering that has applications in predictive maintenance in the energy operations sector using quantum computers. Using only cloud access to quantum computers, we complete thorough performance analysis of what some current quantum computing systems are capable of for practical applications involving nontrivial mid-to-high-dimensional datasets. We first benchmark how well distance estimation can be performed using two different metrics based on the swap-test, using angle and amplitude data embedding. Next, for the clustering performance analysis, we generate sets of synthetic data with varying cluster variance and compare simulation to physical hardware results using the two metrics. From the results of this performance analysis, we propose a general, competitive, and parallelized version of quantum k-means clustering to avoid some pitfalls discovered due to noisy hardware and apply the approach to a real energy grid clustering scenario. Using real-world German electricity grid data, we show that the new approach improves the balanced accuracy of the standard quantum k-means clustering by 67.8% with respect to the labeling of the classical algorithm.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network model for COVID-19
   prediction using chest X-ray images
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING
AB Despite the great efforts to find an effective way for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prediction, the virus nature and mutation represent a critical challenge to diagnose the covered cases. However, developing a model to predict COVID-19 via chest X-ray images with accurate performance is necessary to help in early diagnosis. In this paper, a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (HQ-CNN) model using random quantum circuits as a base to detect COVID-19 patients with chest X-ray images is presented. A collection of 5445 chest X-ray images, including 1350 COVID-19, 1350 normal, 1345 viral pneumonia, and 1400 bacterial pneumonia images, were used to evaluate the HQ-CNN. The proposed HQ-CNN model has achieved higher performance with an accuracy of 98.6% and a recall of 99% on the first experiment (COVID-19 and normal cases). Besides, it obtained an accuracy of 98.2% and a recall of 99.5% on the second experiment (COVID-19 and viral pneumonia cases). Also, it obtained 98% and 98.8% for accuracy and recall, respectively, on the third dataset (COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia cases). Lastly, it achieved accuracy and recall of 88.2% and 88.6%, respectively, on the multiclass dataset cases. Moreover, the HQ-CNN model is assessed with the statistical analysis (i.e. Cohen's Kappa and Matthew correlation coefficients). The experimental results revealed that the proposed HQ-CNN model is able to predict the positive COVID-19 cases.

TI Tunable Majorana corner states driven by superconducting phase bias in a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes is a key step in achieving topological quantum computation. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of Majorana corner states in a superconductor-insulators-superconductor vertical Josephson junction. The position of these Majorana corner states can be precisely and easily controlled by the superconducting phase bias, which can be confirmed through both numerical and edge state theoretical analysis. In addition, we propose a protocol for achieving topological braiding of the Majorana corner states in a system of three circular vertical Josephson junctions. Our findings advance the field of topological quantum computation by providing insights into the efficient and precise manipulation of Majorana corner states.

TI Realizing Majorana fermion modes in the Kitaev model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study the possibility to realize a Majorana zero mode that is robust and may be easily manipulated for braiding in quantum computing in the ground state of the Kitaev model in this work. To achieve this we first apply a uniform [111] magnetic field to the gapless Kitaev model and turn the Kitaev model to an effective p + ip topological superconductor of spinons. We then study possible vortex binding in such system to a topologically trivial spot in the ground state. We consider two cases in the system: one is a vacancy and the other is a fully polarized spin. We show that in both cases, the system binds a vortex with the defect and a robust Majorana zero mode in the ground state at a weak uniform [111] magnetic field. The distribution and asymptotic behavior of these Majorana zero modes are studied. The Majorana zero modes in both cases decay exponentially in space, and are robust against local perturbations and other Majorana zero modes far away, which makes them promising candidates for braiding in topological quantum computing.

TI The Quantum Panopticon: A Theory of Surveillance for the Quantum Era
SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB The advent of quantum computing will compromise current asymmetric cryptography. Awaiting this moment, global superpowers are routinely collecting and storing encrypted data, so as to later decrypt it once sufficiently strong quantum computers are in place. We argue that this situation gives rise to a new mode of global surveillance that we refer to as a quantum panopticon. Unlike traditional forms of panoptic surveillance, the quantum panopticon introduces a temporal axis, whereby data subjects' future pasts can be monitored from an unknown "superposition" in the quantum future. It also introduces a new level of uncertainty, in that the future watchman's very existence becomes a function of data subjects' efforts to protect themselves from being monitored in the present. Encryption may work as a momentary protection, but increases the likelihood of long-term preservation for future decryption, because encrypted data is stored longer than plaintext data. To illustrate the political and ethical aspects of these features, we draw on cryptographic as well as theoretical surveillance literature and call for urgent consideration of the wider implications of quantum computing for the global surveillance landscape.

TI Enhanced nonlinear interaction of polaritons via excitonic Rydberg
   states in monolayer WSe2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strong optical nonlinearities play a central role in realizing quantum photonic technologies. Exciton-polaritons, which result from the hybridization of material excitations and cavity photons, are an attractive candidate to realize such nonlinearities. While the interaction between ground state excitons generates a notable optical nonlinearity, the strength of such interactions is generally not sufficient to reach the regime of quantum nonlinear optics. Excited states, however, feature enhanced interactions and therefore hold promise for accessing the quantum domain of single-photon nonlinearities. Here we demonstrate the formation of exciton-polaritons using excited excitonic states in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) embedded in a microcavity. The realized excited-state polaritons exhibit an enhanced nonlinear response similar to g(pol-pol)(2s) similar to 46.4 +/- 13.9 mu eV mu m(2) which is similar to 4.6 times that for the ground-state exciton. The demonstration of enhanced nonlinear response from excited exciton-polaritons presents the potential of generating strong exciton-polariton interactions, a necessary building block for solid-state quantum photonic technologies.

TI Quafu-Qcover: Explore combinatorial optimization problems on cloud-based
   quantum computers
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We introduce Quafu-Qcover, an open-source cloud-based software package developed for solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum simulators and hardware backends. Quafu-Qcover provides a standardized and comprehensive workflow that utilizes the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It facilitates the automatic conversion of the original problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and its corresponding Ising model, which can be subsequently transformed into a weight graph. The core of Qcover relies on a graph decomposition-based classical algorithm, which efficiently derives the optimal parameters for the shallow QAOA circuit. Quafu-Qcover incorporates a dedicated compiler capable of translating QAOA circuits into physical quantum circuits that can be executed on Quafu cloud quantum computers. Compared to a general-purpose compiler, our compiler demonstrates the ability to generate shorter circuit depths, while also exhibiting superior speed performance. Additionally, the Qcover compiler has the capability to dynamically create a library of qubits coupling substructures in real-time, utilizing the most recent calibration data from the superconducting quantum devices. This ensures that computational tasks can be assigned to connected physical qubits with the highest fidelity. The Quafu-Qcover allows us to retrieve quantum computing sampling results using a task ID at any time, enabling asynchronous processing. Moreover, it incorporates modules for results preprocessing and visualization, facilitating an intuitive display of solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. We hope that Quafu-Qcover can serve as an instructive illustration for how to explore application problems on the Quafu cloud quantum computers.

TI A new nano-design of configurable logic module based on coplanar
   reversible adder and modified Fredkin gates using quantum technology
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) and reversible logic have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional CMOS technology, offering several advantages, such as ultra-dense structures and ultra-low-power consumption. Among the crucial components of processors, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) has witnessed significant advancements in reversible computing, leading to energy-efficient and high-speed computing systems, particularly beneficial for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. Conventional ALUs, reliant on irreversible logic, encounter energy inefficiencies due to information loss during computations, resulting in increased power consumption. Moreover, they may face limitations in processing speed, impacting real-time processing capabilities, especially for complex DSP tasks involving intensive arithmetic and logic operations. In response to these challenges, a research paper presents a pioneering approach, proposing a novel reversible ALU design using QCA nanotechnology. The proposed design ingeniously incorporates Modified Fredkin (MF) gates, and a coplanar reversible full adder based on the HNG gate, skillfully leveraging the unique features of QCA nanotechnology to optimize the ALU's energy-efficient and high-speed performance for DSP applications. This revolutionary QCA reversible ALU comprises 330 QCA cells arranged in a compact 0.41 mu m(2) area, skillfully realized through the coplanar clock-zone-based crossover approach. Its core computational elements, the three MF gates, and the innovative coplanar reversible full adder empower the ALU to execute a remarkable array of 20 distinct arithmetic and logic operations, showcasing its versatility in handling diverse DSP tasks. The proposed structure undergoes extensive simulations utilizing QCADesigner version 2.0.3 to confirm its performance. The evaluation results manifest substantial improvements compared to previous designs, boasting a 30% reduction in area occupancy, a 20% decrement in cell count, a 10% reduction in latency, and a 10% decrease in quantum cost compared to the best-known previous structure. These compelling outcomes solidify the potential of the proposed reversible ALU as a transformative advancement in energy-efficient and high-speed computing for DSP applications.

TI Hierarchical entanglement shells of multichannel Kondo clouds
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Impurities or boundaries often impose nontrivial boundary conditions on a gapless bulk, resulting in distinct boundary universality classes for a given bulk, phase transitions, and non-Fermi liquids in diverse systems. The underlying boundary states however remain largely unexplored. This is related with a fundamental issue how a Kondo cloud spatially forms to screen a magnetic impurity in a metal. Here we predict the quantum-coherent spatial and energy structure of multichannel Kondo clouds, representative boundary states involving competing non-Fermi liquids, by studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and the channels. Entanglement shells of distinct non-Fermi liquids coexist in the structure, depending on the channels. As temperature increases, the shells become suppressed one by one from the outside, and the remaining outermost shell determines the thermal phase of each channel. Detection of the entanglement shells is experimentally feasible. Our findings suggest a guide to studying other boundary states and boundary-bulk entanglement.
   Understanding the structure of the Kondo cloud formed by conduction electrons screening the impurity spin is a long-standing problem in many-body physics. Shim et al. propose the spatial and energy structure of the multichannel Kondo cloud, by studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and the channels.

TI No second law of entanglement manipulation after all
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Many fruitful analogies have emerged between the theories of quantum entanglement and thermodynamics, motivating the pursuit of an axiomatic description of entanglement akin to the laws of thermodynamics. A long-standing open problem has been to establish a true second law of entanglement, and in particular a unique function that governs all transformations between entangled systems, mirroring the role of entropy in thermodynamics. Contrary to previous promising evidence, here we show that this is impossible and that no direct counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established. This is accomplished by demonstrating the irreversibility of entanglement theory from first principles. Assuming only the most general microscopic physical constraints of entanglement manipulation, we show that entanglement theory is irreversible under all non-entangling transformations. We furthermore rule out reversibility without significant entanglement expenditure, showing that reversible entanglement transformations require the generation of macroscopically large amounts of entanglement according to certain measures. Our results not only reveal fundamental differences between quantum entanglement transformations and thermodynamic processes, but also showcase a unique property of entanglement that distinguishes it from other known quantum resources.
   A formal analysis of the physical limits of entanglement manipulation shows that it cannot be done reversibly, highlighting an important difference from thermodynamics.

TI Quantum-Fuzzy Expert Timeframe Predictor for Post-TAVR Monitoring
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper presents a novel approach to predicting specific monitoring timeframes for Permanent Pacemaker Implantation (PPMI) requirements following a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). The method combines Quantum Ant Colony Optimization (QACO) with the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and incorporates expert knowledge. Although this forecast is more precise, it requires a larger number of predictors to achieve this level of accuracy. Our model deploys expert-derived insights to guarantee the clinical relevance and interpretability of the predicted outcomes. Additionally, we employ quantum computing techniques to address this complex and high-dimensional problem. Through extensive assessments, we show that our quantum-enhanced model outperforms traditional methods with notable improvement in evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, with the integration of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods, our solution enhances the transparency and reliability of medical predictive models, hence promoting improved clinical practice decision-making. The findings highlight how quantum computing has the potential to completely transform predictive analytics in the medical field, especially when it comes to improving patient care after TAVR.

TI Recent progress on non-Abelian anyons: from Majorana zero modes to
   topological Dirac fermionic modes
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have been intensively studied in recent decades theoretically and experimentally as the most promising candidate for non-Abelian anyons supporting topological quantum computation (TQC). In addition to the Majorana scheme, some non-Majorana quasiparticles obeying non-Abelian statistics, including topological Dirac fermionic modes, have also been proposed and therefore become new candidates for TQC. In this review, we overview the non-Abelian braiding properties as well as the corresponding braiding schemes for both the MZMs and the topological Dirac fermionic modes, emphasizing the recent progress on topological Dirac fermionic modes. A topological Dirac fermionic mode can be regarded as a pair of MZMs related by unitary symmetry, which can be realized in a number of platforms, including the one-dimensional topological insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and spin superconductor. This topological Dirac fermionic mode possesses several advantages compared with its Majorana cousin, such as superconductivity-free and larger gaps. Therefore, it provides a new avenue for investigating non-Abelian physics and possible TQC.

TI Parallel Quantum Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we present the Parallel Quantum Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (Pq-RRT) algorithm, a parallel version of the Quantum Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (q-RRT) algorithm. Parallel Quantum RRT is a parallel quantum algorithm formulation of a sampling-based motion planner that uses Quantum Amplitude Amplification to search databases of reachable states for addition to a tree. In this work we investigate how parallel quantum devices can more efficiently search a database, as the quantum measurement process involves the collapse of the superposition to a base state, erasing probability information and therefore the ability to efficiently find multiple solutions. Pq-RRT uses a manager/parallel-quantum-workers formulation, inspired by traditional parallel motion planning, to perform simultaneous quantum searches of a feasible state database. We present symbolic runtime comparisons between parallel architectures, then results regarding likelihoods of multiple parallel units finding any and all solutions contained with a shared database, with and without reachability errors, allowing efficiency predictions to be made. We offer simulations in dense obstacle environments showing efficiency, density/heatmap, and speed comparisons for Pq-RRT against q-RRT, classical RRT, and classical parallel RRT. We then present Quantum Database Annealing, a database construction strategy that uses a temperature construct to define database creation over time for balancing exploration and exploitation.

TI Exciton Fine Structure in InAs Quantum Dots with Cavity-Enhanced
   Emission at Telecommunication Wavelength and Grown on a GaAs(111)A
   Vicinal Substrate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The efficient generation of entangled photons at telecom wavelength is essential for the success of many quantum communication protocols and the development of fiber-based quantum networks. Entangled light can be generated by solid-state quantum emitters with naturally low fine-structure splitting, such as highly symmetric InAs quantum dots (QDs) grown on (111)-oriented surfaces. The incorporation of these QDs into optical cavities is crucial to achieve sufficient signal intensities for applications but has so far shown major complications. In this work, we present droplet epitaxy of telecom-wavelength InAs QDs within an optical cavity on a vicinal (2 degrees miscut) GaAs(111)A substrate. We show a remarkable enhancement of the photon extraction efficiency compared to previous reports together with a reduction of the density that facilitates the isolation of single spectral lines. Moreover, we characterize the exciton-fine-structure splitting and employ numerical simulations under the framework of the empirical-pseudopotential and configuration-interaction methods to study the impact of the miscut on the optical properties of the QDs. We demonstrate that the presence of the miscut steps influences the polarization of the neutral excitons and introduces a preferential orientation in the C3v symmetry of the surface.

TI Partial randomized benchmarking
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In randomized benchmarking of quantum logical gates, partial twirling can be used for simpler implementation, better scaling, and higher accuracy and reliability. For instance, for two-qubit gates, single-qubit twirling is easier to realize than full averaging. We analyze such simplified, partial twirling and demonstrate that, unlike for the standard randomized benchmarking, the measured decay of fidelity is a linear combination of exponentials with different decay rates (3 for two qubits and single-bit twirling). The evolution with the sequence length is governed by an iteration matrix, whose spectrum gives the decay rates. For generic two-qubit gates one slowest exponential dominates and characterizes gate errors in three channels. Its decay rate is close, but different from that in the standard randomized benchmarking, and we find the leading correction. Using relations to the local invariants of two-qubit gates we identify all exceptional gates with several slow exponentials and analyze possibilities to extract their decay rates from the measured curves.

TI Effect of an uniaxial single-ion anisotropy on the quantum and thermal
   entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2, S) Heisenberg dimer
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB Exact analytical diagonalization is used to study the bipartite entanglement of the antiferromagnetic mixed spin-(1/2, S) Heisenberg dimer (MSHD) with the help of negativity. Under the assumption of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy affecting higher spin-S (S > 1/2) entities only, the ground-state degeneracy 2S is partially lifted and the ground state is two-fold degenerate with the total magnetization per dimer +/- (S-1/2). It is shown that the largest quantum entanglement is reached for the antiferromagnetic ground state of MSH D with arbitrar y half-odd-integer spins S regardless of the exchange and single-ion anisotropies. Contra r y to this, the degree of a quantum entanglement in MSH D with an integer spin S exhibits an increasing tendency with an obvious spin-S driven crossing point, when assuming the easy-plane single-ion anisotropy. It is shown that the increasing spin magnitude is a crucial driving mechanism for an enhancement of a threshold temperature above which the thermal entanglement vanishes. The easy-plane single-ion anisotropy together with an enlargement of the spin-S magnitude is other significant driving mechanism for an enhancement of the thermal entanglement in MSHD.

TI Resource-Efficient Cross-Platform Verification with Modular
   Superconducting Devices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Large-scale quantum computers are expected to benefit from modular architectures. Validating the capabilities of modular devices requires benchmarking strategies that assess performance within and between modules. In this work, we evaluate cross-platform verification protocols, which are critical for quantifying how accurately different modules prepare the same quantum state-a key requirement for modular scalability and system-wide consistency. We demonstrate these algorithms using a six-qubit flip-chip superconducting quantum device consisting of two 3-qubit modules on a single carrier chip, with connectivity for intra- and intermodule entanglement. We examine how the resource requirements of protocols relying solely on classical communication between modules scale exponentially with qubit number, and demonstrate that introducing an intermodule two-qubit gate enables subexponential scaling in cross-platform verification. This approach reduces the number of repetitions required by a factor of 4 for three-qubit states, with greater reductions projected for larger and higher-fidelity devices.

However, the low initialization efficiency and readout sensitivity of such systems hinder their further development. Unlocking the full potential of quantum technology, it is essential to achieve single-spin precision. Various quantum systems, including color centers, quantum dots, atoms, and molecules, have been demonstrated the capability for single-spin manipulation.

TI QUIRCY: QUantum Integrated ResilienCY for Power Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The increasing frequency and severity of disruptive weather events, such as windstorms and other high-impact low-probability (HILP) occurrences, emphasize the critical necessity for enhanced preparedness and resilience strategies in power systems. Operators face significant challenges in optimally deploying mobile generating resources to areas experiencing outages of crucial infrastructure components, including generators, transmission lines, and transformers. These disruptions often compromise the reliability and stability of power delivery, necessitating temporary load shedding to ensure grid stability until full restoration is achieved. This paper introduces quantum integrated resiliency for power systems (QUIRCY), a new resilience approach aimed at optimizing resource allocation in power systems. The proposed framework integrates a two-level quantum algorithm that combines the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for highly efficient quantum power flow analysis with quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) to strategically allocate distributed energy resources (DERs). The HHL algorithm significantly outperforms classical fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) methods by requiring only $\log _{2} N$ qubits to effectively represent an N-dimensional system. Simulation case studies on IEEE test systems have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed quantum approach, indicating consistent convergence to optimal solutions under various severe system constraints. These results highlight the significant promise of quantum computing approaches for improving power system resilience, particularly as advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology continue to evolve.

TI An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software
SO COMPUTING
AB As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that-unexpectedly-there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.

TI Mathematical proof of the Fisher-Escola Q statistical
   distribution in quantum consciousness modeling
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Quantum theories have long sought to explain conscious experience, yet their biggest challenge is not conceptual but methodological. A critical gap remains: the lack of statistical tools capable of empirically testing these theories against objective reality. This study introduces and formalizes the Q of Fisher-Escol & agrave; distribution, the first statistical model to integrate quantum and classical probabilities, enabling robust inferential analysis in neuroscience and consciousness studies. We examined 150 density matrices of entangled states in a 10-qubit quantum system using IBM's quantum supercomputers. Through maximum likelihood estimation, we mathematically confirmed that Q(Fisher-Escol & agrave;) similar to beta(a, b, loc, scale). As a key contribution, a novel analytical solution to the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) integral was derived, improving decoherence stability. Additionally, 10(5) Monte Carlo simulations allowed us to establish critical thresholds for alpha = 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001, while assessing Type I and II error rates. Type I errors appeared in 2-5 % of right-tailed tests at alpha = 0.05 but approached zero as alpha decreased. Type II errors occurred in left-tailed tests (1-4 % at alpha = 0.05) but also diminished with stricter significance levels. In two-tailed tests, both error types remained below 3 %, highlighting the distribution's robustness. The Q of Fisher-Escol & agrave; distribution pioneers a statistical framework for modeling quantum-classical interactions in consciousness research. It enables hypothesis testing and predicting subjective experiences, with applications in neuroscience and computational automation. Supported by mathematical proofs and empirical validation, this model advances the integration of quantum probability into neuroscience.

TI High-brightness photon-pair source based on high-Q multimode waveguide
   racetrack resonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Efficient generation of correlated photon pairs through spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in silicon devices serves as a crucial resource for integrated quantum photonic technologies. Enhancing the intracavity field in high-quality-factor (Q) resonators enables energy-efficient photon-pair generation, with the photon-pair generation rate (PGR) scaling cubically with the Q factor. In this work, we demonstrate a high-brightness on-chip photon-pair source based on a racetrack resonator with a high Q factor of 1.75 x 105, fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform requiring only a single-etch process. By combining uniform multimode waveguides with optimized Euler bends, we suppress fundamental mode loss and minimize round-trip cavity dispersion, thereby improving both field enhancement and frequency matching for SFWM processes. With a continuous-wave pump of only 44.67 mu W, we achieve an on-chip brightness of 1.54 GHz<middle dot>mW-2<middle dot>nm-1. These results establish a fabrication-friendly and efficient photon-pair source architecture for integrated quantum photonic systems.

TI Classical theories of gravity produce entanglement
SO NATURE
AB The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman1 is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of transmitting only classical, not quantum, information2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-8. Here we extend the description of matter used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, and so it gives information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly provide evidence for the quantum nature of gravity.

TI Photon blockade and single-photon generation with multiple quantum
   emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generation and manipulation of single photons are at the heart of photon-based quantum information processing. An ensemble of quantum emitters (QEs) as a versatile light-matter interface are very promising for quantum technology such as quantum storage and repeater. However, it is commonly believed that many QEs are unable to create photon blockade and generate single photons with high purity due to the multiexcitation effect. Here, we show efficient photon blockade and single-photon generation with a few to ten QEs by suppressing multiexcitation with a detuned auxiliary cavity. Because the auxiliary cavity induces a strong dipole-dipole interaction among the QEs, these QEs can be treated as a two-level superatom. By coupling this superatom to another collecting cavity, efficient photon blockade with a high transmission is obtained. With the same setup, single-photon emission can also be achieved with yield and purity larger than 90% simultaneously even in the bad-cavity limit. Our method may open up a simple route to generate and manipulate single photons on demand.

AB Noise and imperfections are among the prevalent challenges in quantum software engineering for current NISQ systems. They will remain important in the post-NISQ area, as logical, error-corrected qubits will be based on software mechanisms. As real quantum hardware is still limited in size and accessibility, noise models for classical simulation-that in some cases can exceed dimensions of actual systems-play a critical role in obtaining insights into quantum algorithm performance, and the properties of mechanisms for error correction and mitigation.
   We present, implement and validate a tunable noise model building on the Kraus channel formalism on a large scale quantum simulator system (Qaptiva). We use empirical noise measurements from IBM quantum (IBMQ) systems to calibrate the model and create a realistic simulation environment. Experimental evaluation of our approach with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state preparation and QAOA applied to an industrial use-case validate our approach, and demonstrate accurate simulation of hardware behaviour at reasonable computational cost.
   We devise and utilise a method that allows for determining the quality of noise models for larger problem instances than is possible with existing metrics in the literature. To identify potentials of future quantum software and algorithms, we extrapolate the noise model to future partially fault-tolerant systems, and give insights into the interplay between hardware-specific noise modelling and hardware-aware algorithm development.

TI Topological Classification of Correlations in 2D Electron Systems in
   Magnetic or Berry Fields
SO MATERIALS
AB Recent topology classification of 2D electron states induced by different homotopy classes of mappings of the planar Brillouin zone into Bloch space can be supplemented by a homotopy classification of various phases of multi-electron homotopy patterns induced by Coulomb interaction between electrons. The general classification of such type is presented. It explains the topologically protected correlations responsible for integer and fractional Hall effects in 2D multi-electron systems in the presence of perpendicular quantizing magnetic field or Berry field, the latter in topological Chern insulators. The long-range quantum entanglement is essential for homotopy correlated phases in contrast to local binary entanglement for conventional phases with local order parameters. The classification of homotopy long-range correlated phases induced by the Coulomb interaction of electrons has been derived in terms of homotopy invariants and illustrated by experimental observations in GaAs 2DES, graphene monolayer, and bilayer and in Chern topological insulators. The homotopy phases are demonstrated to be topologically protected and immune to the local crystal field, local disorder, and variation of the electron interaction strength. The nonzero interaction between electrons is shown, however, to be essential for the definition of the homotopy invariants, which disappear in gaseous systems.

TI Full characterization of spontaneous parametric down conversion in

SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Entangled photons are important for testing foundations of quantum physics and are at the heart of quantum technology. Integrated photonics has overwhelming dominance in terms of density and performance, making it a promise route for scalable quantum information processing. AlGaAs-based materials having large second-order non-linearities, direct bandgap and strong electro-optical effect can offer distinct advantages in quantum light source. Here we report a non-ideal quarter-wavelength Bragg reflection waveguide for generating three types of spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes. A general solution to the dispersion equation is derived and employed for designing high efficiency devices by taking into account the influence of core layer aluminium concentration. We further design and fabricate a Bragg reflection waveguide sample based on the analysis, and experimentally characterize its phase matching types and spectral brightness. Our work paves the path for the development of portable quantum light sources.

TI Parity-dependent photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The removal of photons from certain quantum light sources produces so-called photon-subtracted states with enhanced mean photon numbers and intricate quantum correlations. Here, we propose an integrated photon-subtraction scheme that, contrary to previous approaches, is not heralded by photon correlation (coincidence) measurements. In this way, our technique exploits the "Welcher Weg" ("which way") information problem, as it does not provide information about the modes from which the subtracted photons emanated. We show that this lack of information allows the generation of multiphoton states endowed with rich quantum correlations that strongly depend on the parity, evenness or oddness, of the number of subtracted photons.

TI Fundamentals and emerging optical applications of hexagonal boron
   nitride: a tutorial
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), also known as white graphite, is a transparent layered crystal with a wide bandgap. Its crystal structure resembles graphite, featuring layers composed of honeycomb lattices held together through van der Waals forces. The layered crystal structure of hBN facilitates exfoliation into thinner flakes and makes it highly anisotropic in in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Unlike graphite, hBN is both insulating and transparent, making it an ideal material for isolating devices from the environment and acting as a waveguide. As a result, hBN has found extensive applications in optical devices, electronic devices, and quantum photonic devices. This comprehensive tutorial aims to provide readers with a thorough understanding of hBN, covering its synthesis, lattice and spectroscopic characterization, and various applications in optoelectronic and quantum photonic devices. This tutorial is designed for both readers without prior experience in hBN and those with expertise in specific fields seeking to understand its relevance and connections to others.

TI Pauli Flow on Open Graphs with Unknown Measurement Labels

CY JUL 15-19, 2024
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB One-way quantum computation, or measurement-based quantum computation, is a universal model of quantum computation alternative to the circuit model. The computation progresses by measurements of a pre-prepared resource state together with corrections of undesired outcomes via applications of Pauli gates to yet unmeasured qubits. The fundamental question of this model is determining whether computation can be implemented deterministically. Pauli flow is one of the most general structures guaranteeing determinism. It is also essential for polynomial time ancilla-free circuit extraction. It is known how to efficiently determine the existence of Pauli flow given an open graph together with a measurement labelling (a choice of measurements to be performed). In this work, we focus on the problem of deciding the existence of Pauli flow for a given open graph when the measurement labelling is unknown. We show that this problem is in RP by providing a random polynomial time algorithm. To do it, we extend previous algebraic interpretations of Pauli flow, by showing that, in the case of X and Z measurements only, flow existence corresponds to the right-invertibility of a matrix derived from the adjacency matrix. We also use this interpretation to show that the number of output qubits can always be reduced to match the number of input qubits while preserving the existence of flow.

TI Three-wave-mixing quantum-limited kinetic inductance parametric
   amplifier operating at 6 T near 1 K
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Parametric amplifiers play a crucial role in modern quantum technology by enabling the enhancement of weak signals with minimal added noise. Traditionally, Josephson junctions have been the primary choice for constructing parametric amplifiers. Nevertheless, high -kinetic inductance thin films have emerged as viable alternatives to engineer the necessary nonlinearity. In this work, we introduce and characterize a kinetic inductance parametric amplifier (KIPA) built using high -quality NbN superconducting thin films. The KIPA addresses some of the limitations of traditional Josephson -based parametric amplifiers, excelling in dynamic range, operational temperature, and magnetic field resilience. We demonstrate a quantum -limited amplification (>20 dB) with a 20 -MHz gain -bandwidth product, operational at fields up to 6 T and temperatures as high as 850 mK. Harnessing kinetic inductance in NbN thin films, the KIPA emerges as a robust solution for quantum signal amplification, enhancing research possibilities in quantum information processing and low -temperature quantum experiments. Its magnetic field compatibility and quantum -limited performance at high temperatures make it an invaluable tool, promising advancements in quantum research.

TI Study of practical state-preparation error tolerant reference- frame
   distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the establishment of shared keys between two distant users, Alice and Bob, based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, and it has proven to possess information-theoretic security. In most of QKD systems, Alice and Bob require a shared reference frame, and real-time calibration of the reference frame increases system costs and reduces its performance. Fortunately, the reference-frame-independent QKD protocol has been proposed, overcoming reference-frame drift issues and receiving widespread attention. However, in practical QKD systems, the non-ideal characteristics of realistic devices introduce certain inconsistency between the theory and the practice. In real-world quantum key distribution systems, device imperfections can lead to security vulnerabilities, thereby reducing system security. For example, imperfections in the encoding apparatus at the source end may result in errors in the quantum states. The inherent defects in the detection part may cause after-pulse effects and dead-time effects, thus reducing the key rate. Therefore, in this work, we propose a practical state-preparation error tolerant reference frame-independent quantum key distribution protocol by taking imperfections in both the source and the detectors into account. Moreover, a three-intensity decoy-state scheme for modeling analysis and numerical simulations is employed. In this protocol, we reduce the influence of state-preparation errors on the key rate by utilizing virtual state methods to precisely estimate the phase-error rate. Furthermore, by characterizing the effects of after-pulses and dead-time on the key rate, our protocol exhibits higher robustness and can effectively address issues related to detector imperfections. This approach can also be extended to other quantum key distribution protocols with higher security levels, such as measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol and twin-field quantum key distribution, further mitigating the influence of device imperfections on practical implementation of QKD system. Therefore, our present work provide important reference value for putting the quantum key distributions into practical application.

TI Photon-Emission-Correlation Spectroscopy as an Analytical Tool for

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Photon-emission-correlation spectroscopy is an indispensable tool for the study of atoms, molecules, and, more recently, solid-state quantum defects. In solid-state systems, its most common use is as an indi-cator of single-photon emission, a key property for quantum technology. Beyond the single-photon purity of an emitter, however, photon-correlation measurements can provide a wealth of information that can reveal details about its electronic structure and optical dynamics that are hidden by other spectroscopy techniques. This tutorial presents a standardized framework for using photon-emission-correlation spec-troscopy to study quantum emitters, including discussion of theoretical background, considerations for data acquisition and statistical analysis, and interpretation. We highlight important nuances and best practices regarding the commonly used g(2)(tau = 0) < 0.5 test for single-photon emission. Finally, we illustrate how this experimental technique can be paired with optical-dynamics simulations to formulate an electronic model for unknown quantum emitters, enabling the design of quantum control protocols and assessment of their suitability for quantum information science applications.

TI Polarization-entangled photon-pair source with van der Waals
   3R-WS2 crystal
SO ELIGHT
AB Ultracompact entangled photon sources are pivotal to miniaturized quantum photonic devices. Van der Waals (vdW) nonlinear crystals promise efficient photon-pair generation and on-chip monolithic integration with nanophotonic circuitry. However, it remains challenging to generate maximally entangled Bell states of photon pairs with high purity, generation rate, and fidelity required for practical applications. Here, we realize a polarization-entangled photon-pair source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion in an ultrathin rhombohedral tungsten disulfide (3R-WS2) crystal. This vdW entangled photonic source exhibits a high photon-pair purity with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of above 800, a generation rate of 31 Hz, and two maximally polarization-entangled Bell states with fidelities exceeding 0.93 and entanglement degree over 0.97. These results stem from scalable optical nonlinearity, enhanced second-order susceptibility by electronic transitions, and a well-defined symmetry-enabled selection rule inherent in 3R-WS2. Our polarization entangled photon source can be integrated with photonic structures for generating more complex entangled states, thus paving an avenue for advanced quantum photonic systems toward computation and metrology.

AB As restricted quantum computers are slowly becoming a reality, the search for meaningful first applications intensifies. In this domain, one of the more investigated approaches is the use of a special type of quantum circuit - a so-called quantum neural network - to serve as a basis for a machine learning model. Roughly speaking, as the name suggests, a quantum neural network can play a similar role to a neural network. However, specifically for applications in machine learning contexts, very little is known about suitable circuit architectures, or model hyperparameters one should use to achieve good learning performance. In this work, we apply the functional ANOVA framework to quantum neural networks to analyze which of the hyperparameters were most influential for their predictive performance. We analyze one of the most typically used quantum neural network architectures. We then apply this to 7 open-source datasets from the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark whose number of features is small enough to fit on quantum hardware with less than 20 qubits. Three main levels of importance were detected from the ranking of hyperparameters obtained with functional ANOVA. Our experiment both confirmed expected patterns and revealed new insights. For instance, setting well the learning rate is deemed the most critical hyperparameter in terms of marginal contribution on all datasets, whereas the particular choice of entangling gates used is considered the least important except on one dataset. This work introduces new methodologies to study quantum machine learning models and provides new insights toward quantum model selection.

TI Antenna Array Thinning Through Quantum Fourier Transform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Thinning antenna arrays through quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is proposed. Given the lattice of the candidate locations for the array elements, the problem of selecting which antenna location has to be either occupied or not by an array element is formulated in the quantum computing (QC) framework and then addressed with an ad-hoc design method based on a suitable implementation of the QFT algorithm. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed to point out the features and the advantages of the proposed QC-based thinning technique.

The main contributions lie in: (1) A quantum-enabled EMTP formulation with Dommel's model encoded in quantum states; 2) An Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)-based QEMTP to solve the discrete-time nodal equations; 3) An iteration-based HHL revision for mitigating temporal errors to achieve high accuracy of QEMTP with limited quantum resources. Case studies verify the correctness and efficacy of QEMTP in simulating both fast and slow dynamics.

AB The quantum-like paradigm has emerged over the last decade to describe non-linear, dynamical, complex phenomena using quantum mechanics as a tool. In essence, it takes advantage of the linearity of quantum information processing, allowing for complex correlations through entanglement. In a quantum- and neuroscience truly interdisciplinary research, we found that an open quantum spin network, mapping a neural system, can successfully simulate the human sense of number as a global dynamical property, in contrast with the poor performance of conventional Artificial Neural Networks. Here, we discuss how the simulation can be extended to other important complex perceptual phenomena like the perception of space, time, and numbers, known to be interdependent with each other, suggesting that a shared neuronal mechanism is operating in the brain. Here we present a research program that aims at creating a quantum toolbox to simulate this integrated space-time-number sensory ability of our brain, with open-quantum systems methods. We will explore the implications of more general quantum-matter paradigms, and their possible coding into a quantum technology.

TI A Vision, Survey, and Roadmap Toward Space Communications in the 6G and
   Beyond Era
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB Satellite communications (SatComs) have recently been through a renaissance, both technologically and entrepreneurially. Ambitious plans have already come into fruition with the operation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations including thousands of satellites and supported by state of the art but proprietary technologies, such as active antenna arrays and intersatellite links (ISLs). In this context, this article aims to provide a forward-looking vision of use cases and a deep dive into technological enablers that will be prominent in space communications beyond 2030. In parallel, it motivates how open standards can play a role in delivering affordable communication services in space. Starting from the 5G plans for nonterrestrial networks, we provide a survey and roadmap toward artificial intelligence (AI)-supported satellite systems, space-enabled quantum networks, and joint communications and positioning (JCAP) for space missions and interplanetary exploration.

TI Quantifying continuity of characteristics of composite quantum systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We describe the most general form of the Alicki-Fannes-Winter method for obtaining uniform continuity bounds for characteristics of composite quantum systems and consider several modifications of this method, which make it applicable to a wide class of characteristics in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. We present uniform continuity bounds for the most important characteristics of composite quantum systems. Along with the results obtained earlier by various authors, we describe a number of new results proved by the proposed methods. In particular, we obtain new continuity bounds for the quantum discord, one-way classical correlation and its regularization in finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional bipartite quantum systems.

AB We investigate the connection between the complexity of nonlocal games and the arithmetical hierarchy, a classification of languages according to the complexity of arithmetical formulas defining them. It was recently shown by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen that deciding whether the (finite-dimensional) quantum value of a nonlocal game is 1 or at most 1/2 is complete for the class Sigma(1) (i.e., RE). A result of Slofstra implies that deciding whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is equal to 1 is complete for the class pi 1 (i.e., coRE). We prove that deciding whether the quantum value of a two-player nonlocal game is exactly equal to 1 is complete for pi 2; this class is in the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy and corresponds to formulas of the form "for all x there exists y phi(x,y)". This shows that exactly computing the quantum value is strictly harder than approximating it, and also strictly harder than computing the commuting operator value (either exactly or approximately). We explain how results about the complexity of nonlocal games all follow in a unified manner from a technique known as compression. At the core of our pi 2-completeness result is a new "gapless" compression theorem that holds for both quantum and commuting operator strategies. All previous works only study the setting of finite-dimensional quantum strategies; ours is the first to study compression of games in the commuting operator setting. Our compression theorem yields as a byproduct an alternative proof of Slofstra's result that the set of quantum correlations is not closed. We also show how a "gap-preserving" compression theorem for commuting operator strategies would imply that approximating the commuting operator value is complete for pi 1.

TI Chemically Tuning Room Temperature Pulsed Optically Detected Magnetic
   Resonance
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Optical detection of magnetic resonance enables spin-based quantum sensing with high spatial resolution and sensitivity-even at room temperature-as exemplified by solid-state defects. Molecular systems provide a complementary, chemically tunable, platform for room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)-based quantum sensing. A critical parameter governing sensing sensitivity is the optical contrast-i.e., the difference in emission between two spin states. In state-of-the-art solid-state defects such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, this contrast is approximately 30%. Here, capitalizing on chemical tunability, we show that room-temperature ODMR contrasts of 40% can be achieved in molecules. Using a nitrogen-substituted analogue of pentacene (6,13-diazapentacene), we enhance contrast compared to pentacene and, by determining the triplet kinetics through time-dependent pulsed ODMR, show how this arises from accelerated anisotropic intersystem crossing. Furthermore, we translate high-contrast room-temperature pulsed ODMR to self-assembled nanocrystals. Overall, our findings highlight the synthetic handles available to optically readable molecular spins and the opportunities to capitalize on chemical tunability for room-temperature quantum sensing.

TI Measurement unification
SO MEASUREMENT
AB In many quantum measurement experiments and thought experiments, unexplained results appear. As example, entangled particles appear to interact instantly across distances. A 2018 Measurement paper (Relative Measurement Theory, K. Krechmer, 2018) proposed that the calibration of a measuring apparatus to a reference is required in both quantum measurement models and empirical measurement results. Current quantum measurement models equalize the units but not to a reference. Current empirical measurement indications are equalized to a reference. These two measurements are different. The lack of calibration to a reference in quantum mechanics creates this difference. Including calibration explains the results of the particle spin experiments, quantum teleportation experiments, and Mach-Zehnder interferometer experiments, as well as Mermin's device, Schro center dot dinger's Cat, and other thought experiments.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present a flip-chip architecture for an array of coupled superconducting qubits, in which circuit components reside inside individual microwave enclosures. In contrast to other flip-chip approaches, the qubit chips in our architecture are electrically floating, which guarantees a simple, fully modular assembly of capacitively coupled circuit components, such as qubit, control, and coupling structures as well as reduced crosstalk between the components. We validate the concept with a chain of three nearest neighbor coupled generalized flux qubits in which the center qubit acts as a frequency-tunable coupler. Using this coupler, we demonstrate a transverse coupling on/off ratio approximate to 50, zz-crosstalk approximate to 0.7 kHz between resonant qubits and isolation between the qubit enclosures >60 dB.

TI Quantum Relay-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communication
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Relay-based quantum communication utilizes intermediate nodes to extend the transmission distanceof quantum signals and mitigate the masking effect caused by obstacles or turbulence in free-space optical (FSO) channels. In this study, we investigate a three-node quantum communication system, where Alice, the transmitter, sends quantum-encoded binary information to Bob, the ultimate receiver, via an intermediate relay node, Charlie. By introducing Charlie, the end-to-end transmission is divided into two shorter FSO links, improving signal stability and reliability in the presence of severe atmospheric turbulence and noise. This work proposes a quantum relaying method specifically designed for FSO links and examines the impact of two-hop relaying in terms of the probability of error. The Helstrom error bound is derived to assess the system's detection limits, while density operator calculations are performed to characterize the quantum relaying setup. In addition, a closed-form expression is obtained for key system performance metrics. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing quantum relaying strategies for long-distance quantum communication over FSO channels.

It points out that space could not be empty, and we return to the notion of an AE ther. Such a concept requires a preferred reference frame for describing universe expansion and black holes. Here, we intend to find a reference system or class of metrics that could be attributed to "AE ther".

TI On-chip scalable highly pure and indistinguishable single-photon sources
   in ordered arrays: Path to quantum optical circuits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Realization of quantum optical circuits is at the heart of quantum photonic information processing. A long-standing obstacle, however, has been the absence of a suitable platform of single photon sources (SPSs). Such SPSs need to be in spatially ordered arrays and produce, on-demand, highly pure, and indistinguishable single photons with sufficiently uniform emission characteristics to enable controlled interference between photons from distinct sources underpinning functional quantum optical networks. We report on such a platform of SPSs based on a unique class of epitaxial quantum dots dubbed mesa-top single quantum dot. Under resonant excitation, the spatially ordered SPSs (without Purcell enhancement) show single photon purity of >99% [g((2))(0) similar to 0.015], high two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibilities of 0.82 +/- 0.03 (at 11.5 kelvin, without cavity), and spectral nonuniformity of <3 nanometers, within established locally tunable technology. Our platform of SPSs paves the path to creating on-chip scalable quantum photonic networks for communication, computation, simulation, sensing and imaging.

TI Near Threshold Computation of Partitioned Ring Learning With Error
   (RLWE) Hardware Accelerator on Reconfigurable Architecture
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Ring Learning With Error (RLWE) algorithm plays a crucial role in Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The security of existing classical crypto algorithms is reduced in quantum computers. The adversaries can store all encrypted data and once quantum computers become available, they can potentially expose this encrypted data. Researchers and cryptographers are actively developing and exploring quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms like RLWE to address this emerging threat. On the other hand, the HE allows operations on encrypted data, which is appropriate for getting services from third parties without revealing confidential plain-texts. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) hardware accelerators, such as Ring Learning With Error (RLWE), offer a much cost-effective alternative to processor-based platforms and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). However, FPGA based hardware accelerators still consume more power compared to ASIC based design. Near Threshold Computation (NTC) may be a convenient solution for FPGA based RLWE implementation. This paper implements a low-power RLWE hardware accelerator in an FPGA, operating at near-threshold biasing voltage. Instead of applying uniform biasing voltage to all 14 subcomponents of RLWE, this paper applies different near-threshold biasing voltages to the different subcomponents of proposed RLWE. Based on the longest design path or critical path of the 14 subcomponents of the proposed RLWE, the entire RLWE is partitioned into different clusters where each cluster is implemented in an FPGA partition. All the subcomponents placed in the same FPGA partition use the same biasing voltage V-ccint . The clusters that have higher critical paths use higher V-ccint to avoid timing failure. The clusters that have lower critical paths use lower biasing voltage V-ccint. The proposed RLWE uses a voltage calibration algorithm to calculate the biasing voltage V-ccint required for a certain amount of average critical path of a FPGA partition. Any timing error caused by NTC can be detected by the Razor flip-flop used in each subcomponent of RLWE. This voltage scaled, partitioned RLWE can save similar to 6% and similar to 11% power in Vivado and VTR platforms, respectively. Although low-power RLWE is the primary focus, the resource usage and throughput of the implemented RLWE hardware accelerator are competitive with existing literature.

TI Probing scrambling and operator size distributions using random mixed
   states and local measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The dynamical spreading of quantum information through a many -body system, typically called scrambling, is a complex process that has proven to be essential to describe many properties of out -of -equilibrium quantum systems. Scrambling can, in principle, be fully characterized via the use of out -of -time -ordered correlation functions, which are notoriously hard to access experimentally. In this work, we put forward an alternative toolbox of measurement protocols to experimentally probe scrambling by accessing properties of the operator size probability distribution, which tracks the size of the support of observables in a many -body system over time. Our measurement protocols require the preparation of separable mixed states together with local operations and measurements, and combine the tools of randomized operations, a modern development of near -term quantum algorithms, with the use of mixed states, a standard tool in NMR experiments. We demonstrate how to efficiently probe the probability -generating function of the operator distribution and discuss the challenges associated with obtaining the moments of the operator distribution. We further show that manipulating the initial state of the protocol allows us to directly obtain the individual elements of the distribution for small system sizes.

TI Entanglement dynamics in a three-atom multi-photon nonlinear JCM with
   f-deformed Kerr nonlinearity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we explore the atomic population inversion and entanglement dynamics of a quantum system consisting of three identical two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode cavity field. The cavity is surrounded by a Kerr medium exhibiting f-deformed Kerr nonlinearity, and we consider a degenerate multi-photon transition in the nonlinear regime. The study systematically analyzes the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, detuning, Kerr nonlinearity, f-deformed Kerr nonlinearity, and multi-photon transition on the nonclassical properties of the system. Our results show that the Kerr and f-deformed Kerr nonlinearities significantly influence the atomic inversion dynamics, leading to phenomena such as collapse and revival, with distinct behaviors observed under varying detuning parameters. Furthermore, entanglement dynamics between the atoms and cavity mode are enhanced under intensity-dependent coupling and nonlinearity. The detuning parameter generally reduces entanglement but has a less pronounced effect in the two-photon transition case, where entanglement is notably enhanced. The study provides valuable insights into controlling quantum correlations in multi-atom systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing, computing, and communication.

TI Unified strategy for non-invertible Fisher information matrix in quantum
   metrology
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In quantum multi-parameter estimation, the precision of estimating unknown parameters is bounded by the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (CRB), defined via the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). However, in certain scenarios-such as distributed quantum sensing-the FIM becomes non-invertible due to parameter redundancy, which depends on the probe state and measurement. This issue is often handled using a weaker form of the CRB, potentially overestimating the uncertainty and underrepresenting achievable precision. Here, we propose an alternative approach by introducing equality constraints to remove redundancy and define the CRB via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the FIM. This framework enables systematic treatment of both simultaneous estimation and distributed sensing cases. We demonstrate its utility by reanalyzing several known examples within this unified perspective, highlighting improved interpretability and practical relevance. Our results offer a concrete guideline for addressing non-invertible FIMs and enhancing the precision of quantum multi-parameter estimation in realistic scenarios.

TI Generating two-mode squeezing with multimode measurement- induced
   nonlinearity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Measurement-induced nonclassical effects in a two-mode interferometer are investigated theoretically using numerical simulations and analytical results. We demonstrate that for certain parameters measurements within the interferometer lead to the occurrence of two-mode squeezing. The results strongly depend on the detection probability, the phase inside the interferometer, and the choice of the input states. The appropriate parameters for maximized squeezing are obtained. We analyze the influence of losses and confirm that the predicted effects are within reach of current experimental techniques.

TI Geuine tripartite entanglement in three-flavor neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities tested the quantumness of neutrino oscillations (NOs) across macroscopic distances. The quantumness can be quantified by using the tools of the quantum resource theories. Recently, a new genuine tripartite entanglement measure (Xie et al. in Phys Rev Lett 127:040403, 2021), concurrence fill, is defined as the square root of the area of the concurrence triangle satisfying all genuine multipartite entanglement conditions. It has several advantages compared to other existing tripartite measures. Here, we focus on using concurrence fill to quantify the tripartite entanglement in three-flavor NOs. Concurrence fill can reach its maximum 0.89 for the experimentally-observed electron antineutrino oscillations, but it cannot for the muon antineutrino oscillations. In both cases, we compare its performance with other three tripartite entanglement measures, including the generalized geometric measure (GGM), the three-n entanglement, and the genuinely multipartite concurrence (GMC), in the neutrino propagation, and accordingly show that concurrence fill contains the most quantum resource. Furthermore, concurrence fill and the three-pi entanglement are always smooth, while GGM and GMC measures have several sharp peaks. The genuine tripartite quantification of the quantumness of three-flavor NOs represents the first step towards the further potential application of neutrinos on quantum information processing.

TI Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation for Noisy Quantum Metrology
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Detection of very weak forces and precise measurement of time are two of the many applications of quantum metrology to science and technology. To sense an unknown physical parameter, one prepares an initial state of a probe system, allows the probe to evolve as governed by a Hamiltonian H for some time t, and then measures the probe. If H is known, we can estimate t by this method; if t is known, we can estimate classical parameters on which H depends. The accuracy of a quantum sensor can be limited by either intrinsic quantum noise or by noise arising from the interactions of the probe with its environment. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental trade-off, which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in which a party Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to evolve for a time that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock through a noisy channel to a party Bob. Meanwhile, the environment (Eve) receives any information about the clock that is lost during transmission. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information about the elapsed time is equal to Eve's gain of quantum Fisher information about a complementary energy parameter. We also prove a similar, but more general, trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to estimate the values of parameters associated with two noncommuting observables. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy of the clock to be unaffected by the noise, which form a subset of the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions. A state and its local time-evolution direction, if they satisfy these conditions, are said to form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct metrological codes in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are metrological codes that cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code with similar distance in which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator, potentially offering new schemes for constructing states that do not lose any sensitivity upon application of a noisy channel. We discuss applications of the trade-off relation to sensing using a quantum many-body probe subject to erasure or amplitude-damping noise.

TI Log-convex set of Lindblad semigroups acting on N-level system
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We analyze the set A(N)(Q) of mixed unitary channels represented in the Weyl basis and accessible by a Lindblad semigroup acting on an N-level quantum system. General necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixed Weyl quantum channel of an arbitrary dimension to be accessible by a semigroup are established. The set A(N)(Q) is shown to be log-convex and star-shaped with respect to the completely depolarizing channel. A decoherence supermap acting in the space of Lindblad operators transforms them into the space of Kolmogorov generators of classical semigroups. We show that for mixed Weyl channels, the super-decoherence commutes with the dynamics so that decohering a quantum accessible channel, we obtain a bistochastic matrix from the set A(N)(C) of classical maps accessible by a semigroup. Focusing on three-level systems, we investigate the geometry of the sets of quantum accessible maps, its classical counterpart, and the support of their spectra. We demonstrate that the set A(3)(Q) is not included in the set U-3(Q) of quantum unistochastic channels, although an analogous relation holds for N = 2. The set of transition matrices obtained by super-decoherence of unistochastic channels of order N >= 3 is shown to be larger than the set of unistochastic matrices of this order and yields a motivation to introduce the larger sets of k-unistochastic matrices.

TI On-Demand Generation of Indistinguishable Photons in the Telecom C-Band
   Using Quantum Dot Devices
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) enable the generation of single and entangled photons, which are useful for various applications in photonic quantum technologies. Specifically for quantum communication via fiber-optical networks, operation in the telecom C-band centered around 1550 nm is ideal. The direct generation of QD-photons in this spectral range with high quantum-optical quality, however, remained challenging. Here, we demonstrate the coherent on-demand generation of indistinguishable photons in the telecom C-band from single QD devices consisting of InAs/InP QD-mesa structures heterogeneously integrated with a metallic reflector on a silicon wafer. Using pulsed two-photon resonant excitation of the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade, we observe Rabi rotations up to pulse areas of 4 pi and a high single-photon purity in terms of g ((2))(0) = 0.005(1) and 0.015(1) for exciton and biexciton photons, respectively. Applying two independent experimental methods, based on fitting Rabi rotations in the emission intensity and performing photon cross-correlation measurements, we consistently obtain preparation fidelities at the pi-pulse exceeding 80%. Finally, performing Hong-Ou-Mandel-type two-photon interference experiments, we obtain a photon-indistinguishability of the full photon wave packet of up to 35(3)%, representing a significant advancement in the photon-indistinguishability of single photons emitted directly in the telecom C-band.

TI Quantum approximate optimization of non-planar graph problems on a
   planar superconducting processor
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Faster algorithms for combinatorial optimization could prove transformative for diverse areas such as logistics, finance and machine learning. Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors.

TI Quantum control based on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and its
   applications
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has emerged as an important technique for material characterization, finding extensive applications across a diverse range of disciplines including physics, materials science, chemistry, and biology. Its utility stems from the ability to probe the local atomic environments and molecular dynamics within solid materials, which provides information on the composition of the material. In recent years, the scope of solid-state NMR has expanded into the realm of quantum information science and technology, where its abundant many-body interactions pulse control methodologies make it have significant research value and application potential. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the research objects and theoretical underpinnings of solid-state NMR, delving into the critical nuclear spin interaction mechanisms and their corresponding Hamiltonian forms. These interactions, which include dipolar coupling, chemical shift anisotropy, and quadrupolar interactions, are fundamental to the interpretation of NMR spectra and the understanding of material properties at the atomic level. Moreover, the paper introduces typical dynamical control methods employed in the manipulation of solid-state nuclear spins. Techniques such as dynamical decoupling, which mitigates the effects of spin-spin interactions to extend coherence times, and magic-angle spinning, which averages out anisotropic interactions to yield high-resolution spectra. These methods are essential for enhancing the sensitivity and resolution of NMR experiments, enabling the extraction of detailed structural and dynamic information from complex materials. Then we introduce some recent advancements in quantum control based on solid-state NMR, such as nuclear spin polarization enhancement techniques, which include dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and cross polarization (CP), significantly boost the sensitivity of NMR measurements. Additionally, the control techniques of Floquet average Hamiltonians are mentioned, showcasing their role in the precise manipulation of quantum states and the realization of quantum dynamics. Finally, the paper presents a series of seminal research works that illustrate the application of solid-state NMR quantum control technologies in the field of quantum simulation.

TI Minimal action control method in quantum critical models
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present a general protocol to control closed quantum systems that is based on minimising the adiabatic action. Using tools based on the geometry of quantum evolutions through the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, we show that high fidelity control of the ground state of critical quantum systems can be achieved and requires only a reasonable approximation for the ground state spectral gap. We demonstrate our results for three widely applicable systems: the Landau-Zener, Ising, and fully connected spin models.

TI Precise control of squeezing angle to generate 11 dB entangled state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The strength of the quantum correlations of a continuous-variable entangled state is determined by several relative phases in the preparation, transmission, and detection processes of entangled states. In this paper, we report the first experimental and theoretical demonstrations of the precision of relative phases associated with the strength of quadrature correlations. Based on the interrelations of the relative phases, three precisely phase-locking methodologies are established: ultralow RAM control loops for the lengths and relative phases stabilization of the DOPAs, difference DC locking for the relative phase between the two squeezed beams, and DC-AC joint locking for the relative phases in BHDs. The phase-locking loops ensure the total phase noise to be 9.7 +/- 0.32/11.1 +/- 0.36 mrad. Finally, all the relative phase deviations are controlled to be in the range of -35 to 35 mrad, which enhances the correlations of the amplitude and phase quadratures to -11.1 and -11.3 dB. The entanglement also exhibits a broadband squeezing bandwidth up to 100 MHz. This paves a valuable resource for experimental realization and applications in quantum information and precision measurement.

TI U(1) fields from qubits: An approach via D-theory algebra
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A new quantum link microstructure was proposed for the lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian, replacing the Wilson gauge links with a bilinear of fermionic qubits, later generalized to D-theory. This formalism provides a general framework for building lattice field theory algorithms for quantum computing. We focus mostly on the simplest case of a quantum rotor for a single compact U(1) field. We also make some progress for non-Abelian setups, making it clear that the ideas developed in the U(1) case extend to other groups. These in turn are building blocks for 1 + 0-dimensional (1 + 0-D) matrix models, 1 + 1-D sigma models and non-Abelian gauge theories in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. By introducing multiple flavors for the U(1) field, where the flavor symmetry is gauged, we can efficiently approach the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the quantum O(2) rotor with increasing flavors. The emphasis of the method is on preserving the symplectic algebra exchanging fermionic qubits by sigma matrices (or hard bosons) and developing a formal strategy capable of generalization to a SU(3) field for lattice QCD and other non-Abelian 1 + 1-D sigma models or 3 + 1-D gauge theories. For U(1), we discuss briefly the qubit algorithms for the study of the discrete 1 + 1-D sine-Gordon equation.

TI Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Image Anti-Noise Classification Model
   Combined with Error Mitigation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this study, we present an innovative approach to quantum image classification, specifically designed to mitigate the impact of noise interference. Our proposed method integrates key technologies within a hybrid variational quantum neural network architecture, aiming to enhance image classification performance and bolster robustness in noisy environments. We utilize a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for feature extraction from classical images, capturing essential characteristics. The image information undergoes transformation into a quantum state through amplitude coding, replacing the coding layer of a traditional quantum neural network (QNN). Within the quantum circuit, a variational quantum neural network optimizes model parameters using parameterized quantum gate operations and classical-quantum hybrid training methods. To enhance the system's resilience to noise, we introduce a quantum autoencoder for error mitigation. Experiments conducted on FashionMNIST datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our classification model, achieving an accuracy of 92%, and it performs well in noisy environments. Comparative analysis with other quantum algorithms reveals superior performance under noise interference, substantiating the effectiveness of our method in addressing noise challenges in image classification tasks. The results highlight the potential advantages of our proposed quantum image classification model over existing alternatives, particularly in noisy environments.

TI Adiabatic quantum estimation: A numerical study of the Heisenberg XX
   model with antisymmetric exchange
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we address the adiabatic technique for quantum estimation of the azimuthal orientation of a magnetic field. Exactly solving a model consisting of a two-qubit system, where one of which is driven by a static magnetic field while the other is coupled with the magnetic field rotating adiabatically, we obtain the analytical expression of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We investigate how the two-qubit system can be used to probe the azimuthal direction of the field and analyze the roles of the intensities of the magnetic fields, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, spin-spin coupling coefficient, and the polar orientation of the rotating field on the precision of the estimation. In particular, it is illustrated that the QFI trapping or saturation may occur if the qubit is subjected to a strong rotating field. Moreover, we discuss how the azimuthal direction of the rotating field can be estimated using only the qubit not affected by that field and investigate the conditions under which this strategy is more efficient than use of the qubit locally interacting with the adiabatically rotating field. Interestingly, in the one-qubit scenario, it was found that when the rotating field is weak, the best estimation is achieved by subjecting the probe to a static magnetic field.

TI Nuclear spin-mediated relaxation mechanisms of the VB- center in hBN
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) defect in hexagonal boron nitride has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time (T1) and its control parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster expansion technique to investigate T1 relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the VB- center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed T1 time at B = 90 G and further predicts the T1 dependence on external magnetic field in the 0 <= B <= 2000 G interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing T1 relaxation in VB- centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

TI Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 207103 (2023)], it is demonstrated that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions - characterized by eigenvalue crossings - but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. Two paradigmatic models are analyzed: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, these results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.

TI Cold atoms meet lattice gauge theory
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The central idea of this review k to consider quantum field theory models relevant for particle physics and replace the fermionic matter in these models by a bosonic one. This is mostly motivated by the fact that bosons are more 'accessible' and easier to manipulate for experimentalists, but this 'substitution' also leads to new physics and novel phenomena. It allows us to gain new information about among other things confinement and the dynamics of the deconfinement transition. We will thus consider bosons in dynamical lattices corresponding to the bosonic Schwinger or Z(2) Bose-Hubbard models. Another central idea of this review concerns atomic simulators of paradigmatic models of particle physics theory such as the ereuti-Hubbard ladder, or Cross-Nevey-Wilson and Wilson-Hubbard models. This article k not a general review of the rapidly growing field-it reviews activities related to quantum simulations for lattice field theories performed by the Quantum Optics Theory group at ICFO and their collaborators from 19 institutions all over the world. Finally, we will briefly describe our efforts to design experimentally friendly simulators of these and other models relevant for particle physics.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The large-scale deployment of quantum secret sharing (QSS) in quantum networks is currently challenging due to the requirements for the generation and distribution of multipartite entanglement states. Here we present an efficient source-independent QSS protocol utilizing entangled photon pairs in quantum networks. Through the post-matching method, which means the measurement events in the same basis are matched, the key rate is almost independent of the number of participants. In addition, the unconditional security of our QSS against internal and external eavesdroppers can be proved by introducing an equivalent virtual protocol. Our protocol has great performance and technical advantages in future quantum networks. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group

TI Incompressibility of Classical Distributions
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In blind compression of quantum states, a sender Alice is given a specimen of a quantum state rho drawn from a known ensemble (but without knowing what rho is), and she transmits sufficient quantum data to a receiver Bob so that he can decode a near perfect specimen of rho. For many such states drawn iid from the ensemble, the asymptotically achievable rate is the number of qubits required to be transmitted per state. The Holevo information is a lower bound for the achievable rate, and is attained for pure state ensembles, or in the related scenario of entanglement-assisted visible compression of mixed states wherein Alice knows what state is drawn. In this paper, we prove a general and robust lower bound on the achievable rate for ensembles of classical states, which holds even in the least demanding setting when Alice and Bob share free entanglement and a constant per-copy error is allowed. We apply the bound to a specific ensemble of only two states and prove a near-maximal separation (saturating the dimension bound in leading order) between the best achievable rate and the Holevo information for constant error. This also implies that the ensemble is incompressible - compression does not reduce the communication cost by much. Since the states are classical, the observed incompressibility is not fundamentally quantum mechanical. We lower bound the difference between the achievable rate and the Holevo information in terms of quantitative limitations to clone the specimen or to distinguish the two classical states.

TI Efficient light propagation algorithm using quantum computers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome the boundary of computationally hard problems. One of the cornerstones in modern optics is the beam propagation algorithm, facilitating the calculation of how waves with a particular dispersion relation propagate in time and space. This algorithm solves the wave propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is determined from the respective dispersion relation, which can often be expanded as a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires O(NlogN) computation steps, where N is the number of points into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation can be performed as a quantum algorithm with OlogN2 single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM) and perform such propagation in both one- and two-dimensional systems for the double-slit experiment and Gaussian beam propagation. We highlight the importance of the selection of suitable observables to retain the quantum advantage in the face of the statistical nature of the quantum measurement process, which leads to sampling errors that do not exist in classical solutions.

TI Trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy of cesium magneto-optical trap with
   single-photon Rydberg excitation and the background electric field
   measurement and regulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Calibration and compensation of the background electric fields in the vicinity of the cold atomic ensemble are critically vital, for achieving quantum computing, quantum simulation, and precision measurement. Here the work presents and demonstrates a straightforward method for measuring and compensation of the background electric field by means of the trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy (TLFS) of cesium (Cs) magneto-optical trap (MOT) with the Rydberg nP3/2 states with principal quantum numbers n from 71 to 85. In our experiment, TLFS is induced by single-photon Rydberg excitation with a Cs MOT, utilizing a 319 nm ultraviolet (UV) laser characterized by narrow linewidth (less than 6 kHz), continuous fine-tuning of 1 GHZ, and ultra-low-intensity noise (the intensity fluctuates approximately +/- 0.06% over 25 minutes with sampling power of 3 mW). Using this method, we measure the intensity of the background electric field in the vicinity of a cold atomic ensemble of about 218.9 +/- 7.5 mV/cm. Through adjustment of electrode plates the residual electric field was reduced to 116.3 mV/cm, which induces a Stark shift -84.1 MHz. Our experiments provide an easier and more straightforward method for measuring and regulating the background electric field and lay a foundation for optimizing electric field compensation and fast feedback systems in the future.

TI Tunable Cr4+ Molecular Color Centers
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The inherent atomistic precision of synthetic chemistry enables bottom-up structural control over quantum bits, or qubits, for quantum technologies. Tuning paramagnetic molecular qubits that feature optical-spin initialization and readout is a crucial step toward designing bespoke qubits for applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing. Here, we demonstrate that the electronic structure that enables optical-spin initialization and readout for S = 1, Cr(aryl)(4), where aryl = 2,4-dimethylphenyl (1), o-tolyl (2), and 2,3-dimethylphenyl (3), is readily translated into Cr(alkyl)(4) compounds, where alkyl = 2,2,2-triphenylethyl (4), (trimethylsilyl)methyl (5), and cyclohexyl (6). The small ground state zero field splitting values (<5 GHz) for 1-6 allowed for coherent spin manipulation at X-band microwave frequency, enabling temperature-, concentration-, and orientation-dependent investigations of the spin dynamics. Electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy confirmed the desired electronic structures for 4-6, which exhibit photoluminescence from 897 to 923 nm, while theoretical calculations elucidated the varied bonding interactions of the aryl and alkyl Cr4+ compounds. The combined experimental and theoretical comparison of Cr(aryl)(4) and Cr(alkyl)(4) systems illustrates the impact of the ligand field on both the ground state spin structure and excited state manifold, laying the groundwork for the design of structurally precise optically addressable molecular qubits.

   variational quantum eigensolver using digital quantum computers and
   application to the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Background: Quantum simulations offer the potential to predict the structure and dynamics of nuclear many-body systems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computing. Generally, preparing the ground state of strongly interacting many-body systems relevant to nuclear physics is, however, inefficient, even using ideal quantum computers. In addition, currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum devices possess modest numbers of qubits, limiting the size of quantum many-body systems that can be simulated. In this context, a reformulation of the quantum many-body problems using truncated model spaces and Hamiltonians is desirable to make them more amenable to near-term quantum computers. The importance of symmetries in low-energy theories, including effective field theories (EFTs), lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and effective model spaces for nuclear systems, in particular their interplay with the reduction of active Hilbert spaces, is well known. Lesser known is the fact that the noncommutivity of some symmetries and truncations of the model space can be profitably combined with variational calculations to rearrange the entanglement into localized structures and enable more efficient simulations.
   Purpose: The goal of the present study is to explore and utilize the noncommutivity of symmetries and model-space truncations of quantum many-body systems important to nuclear physics, particularly in combination with variational algorithms for quantum simulations and effective Hamiltonian learning.
   Method: We introduce an iterative hybrid classical-quantum algorithm, the Hamiltonian learning variational quantum eigensolver (HL-VQE), that simultaneously optimizes an effective Hamiltonian, thereby rearranging entanglement into the effective model space, and the associated ground-state wave function. Quantum simulations, using classical computers and IBM's superconducting-qubit quantum computers, are performed to demonstrate the HL-VQE algorithm, in the context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model of interacting fermions, where the Hamiltonian transformation corresponds to an orbital rotation. We use a mapping where the number of qubits scales with the logarithm of the size of the effective model space, rather than the particle number.
   Results: HL-VQE is found to provide an exponential improvement in LMG-model calculations of the ground-state energy and wave function, compared to naive truncations without Hamiltonian learning, throughout a significant fraction of the Hilbert space. In the context of EFT, this corresponds to counterterms scaling exponentially with the cutoff as opposed to power law. Implementations on IBM's QExperience quantum computers and simulators for one- and two-qubit effective model spaces are shown to provide accurate and precise results, reproducing classical predictions.
   Conclusions: For a range of parameters defining the LMG model, the HL-VQE algorithm is found to have better scaling of quantum resources requirements than previously explored algorithms. In particular, the HL-VQE scales efficiently over a large fraction of the model space, in contrast to VQE alone. This work constitutes a step in the development of entanglement-driven quantum algorithms for descriptions of nuclear many-body systems. This, in part, leverages the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The exponential scaling of counterterms observed in this study suggests the possibility of more general applicability to other nonperturbative EFTs.

TI Single photon sources with near unity collection efficiencies by
   deterministic placement of quantum dots in nanoantennas
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Deterministic coupling between photonic nodes in a quantum network is an essential step toward implementing various quantum technologies. The omnidirectionality of free-standing emitters, however, makes this coupling highly inefficient, in particular if the distant nodes are coupled via low numerical aperture (NA) channels such as optical fibers. This limitation requires placing quantum emitters in nanoantennas that can direct the photons into the channels with very high efficiency. Moreover, to be able to scale such technologies to a large number of channels, the placing of the emitters should be deterministic. In this work, we present a method for directly locating single free-standing quantum emitters with high spatial accuracy at the center of highly directional bullseye metal-dielectric nanoantennas. We further employ non-blinking, high quantum yield colloidal quantum dots for on-demand single-photon emission that is uncompromised by instabilities or non-radiative exciton recombination processes. Taken together, this approach results in a record-high collection efficiency of 85% of the single photons into a low NA of 0.5, setting the stage for efficient coupling between on-chip, room temperature nanoantenna-emitter devices and a fiber or a remote free-space node without the need for additional optics.

TI Dynamical Sweet Spot Engineering via Two-Tone Flux Modulation of
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Current superconducting quantum processors require strategies for coping with material defects and imperfect parameter targeting in order to scale up while maintaining high performance. To that end, in situ control of qubit frequencies with magnetic flux can be used to avoid spurious resonances. However, increased dephasing due to 1/f flux noise limits performance at all of these operating points except for noise-protected sweet spots, which are sparse under dc flux bias and monochromatic flux modulation. Here we experimentally demonstrate that two-tone flux modulation can be used to create a continuum of dynamical sweet spots, greatly expanding the range of qubit frequencies achievable while first-order insensitive to slow flux noise. To illustrate some advantages of this flexibility, we use bichromatic flux control to reduce the error rates and gate times of parametric entangling operations between transmons. Independent of the gate scheme, the ability to use flux control to freely select qubit frequencies while maintaining qubit coherence represents an important step forward in the robustness and scalability of near-term superconducting qubit devices.

TI Optical noise in a free-space quantum communications link from natural
   and nuclear disturbed environments*
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Satellite communications at radio frequencies can experience a 'blackout' period following the atmospheric detonation of a nuclear weapon. The wavelengths used for free-space quantum communications will not incur the same 'blackout' effects from a nuclear detonation, but the optical systems will suffer from a phenomenon called redout. Redout occurs in an optical detector when ambient light scatters into the optical receiver, causing elevated background photon counts in the detector such that background noise overwhelms the signal. In this work, the duration of the redout effect is quantified from a nuclear disturbed environment on a ground-to-space quantum optical link. In addition, we comment on various techniques for reducing ambient and nuclear disturbed background counts in a quantum free-space optical link. For low-altitude nuclear detonations (i.e., under 50 km), the maximum interference time will be less than 1 min. Implementing a telescope, timing gate, and wavelength filter to the detector can reduce the background counts in the detector significantly. Aerosol levels and ground albedo are major contributors to background noise in a ground-to-satellite quantum channel, and ground station location should factor in both variables.

TI New record in the number of qubits for a quantum implementation of AES
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Optimizing the quantum circuit for implementing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is crucial for estimating the necessary resources in attacking AES by the Grover algorithm. Previous studies have reduced the number of qubits required for the quantum circuits of AES-128/-192/-256 from 984/1112/1336 to 270/334/398, which is close to the optimal value of 256/320/384. It becomes a challenging task to further optimize them. AimTaking aim at this task, we find a method for how the quantum circuit of AES S-box can be designed with the help of the automation tool LIGHTER-R. Particularly, the multiplicative inversion in F(2)8 , which is the main part of the S-box, is converted into the multiplicative inversion (and multiplication) in F(2)4 , then the latter can be implemented by LIGHTER-R because its search space is small enough. By this method, we construct the quantum circuits of S-box for mapping | a ?|0? to | a ?|S( a )? and | a ?| b ? to | a ?| b ? S( a )? with 20 qubits instead of 22 in the previous studies. In addition, we introduce new techniques to reduce the number of qubits required by the S-box circuit for mapping | a ? to |S( a )? from 22 in the previous studies to 16. Accordingly, we synthesize the quantum circuits of AES-128/-192/-256 with 264/328/392 qubits, which implies a new record.

TI The emergence of three-dimensional chiral domain walls in polar vortices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Chirality or handedness of a material can be used as an order parameter to uncover the emergent electronic properties for quantum information science. Conventionally, chirality is found in naturally occurring biomolecules and magnetic materials. Chirality can be engineered in a topological polar vortex ferroelectric/dielectric system via atomic-scale symmetry-breaking operations. We use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to map out the topology-driven three-dimensional domain walls, where the handedness of two neighbor topological domains change or remain the same. The nature of the domain walls is governed by the interplay of the local perpendicular (lateral) and parallel (axial) polarization with respect to the tubular vortex structures. Unique symmetry-breaking operations and the finite nature of domain walls result in a triple point formation at the junction of chiral and achiral domain walls. The unconventional nature of the domain walls with triple point pairs may result in unique electrostatic and magnetic properties potentially useful for quantum sensing applications.
   The authors investigate how the disorder and the interplay of lateral and axial polarization of the polar vortex topology in SrTiO3/PbTiO3 superlattices can lead to the formation of the chiral and achiral domain walls, and subsequently the triple point topologies.

TI Full quantum control of enantiomer-selective state transfer in chiral
   molecules despite degeneracy
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Controlling the rotational dynamics of polyatomic molecules is a key to the quantum renaissance of molecular physics with applications such as information encoding, quantum sensing, and chiral sensitive spectroscopy. Here, the authors present a method for complete control of the rotational dynamics in chiral asymmetric top molecules through quantum control theory.
   The driven quantum asymmetric top is an important paradigm in molecular physics with applications ranging from quantum information to chiral-sensitive spectroscopy. A key prerequisite for these applications is the ability to completely control the rotational dynamics. The inherent degeneracy of quantum rotors poses a challenge for quantum control since selecting a particular rotational state cannot be achieved by spectral selection alone. Here, we prove complete controllability for rotational states of an asymmetric top belonging to degenerate values of the orientational quantum number M. Based on this insight, we construct a pulse sequence that energetically separates population in degenerate M-states. Introducing the concept of enantio-selective controllability, we determine the conditions for complete enantiomer-specific population transfer in chiral molecules and construct pulse sequences for the example of propanediol and carvone molecules for population initially distributed over degenerate M-states. Our work shows how to leverage controllability analysis for the solution of practical quantum control problems.

AB Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for quantum many-body solvers represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondences of 1- and 2-site Hubbard models to two-component noninteracting fermions, a numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.

TI A noise-robust quantum dynamics learning protocol based on
   Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism: theory and experiment
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB With the rapid development of quantum technology, the growing manipulated Hilbert space makes learning the dynamics of the quantum system a significant challenge. Machine learning technique has brought apparent advantages in some learning strategies, therefore, we introduce it to indirect learning in this paper. Based on Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we propose a protocol that learns the dynamics of an inaccessible quantum system using a quantum device at hand. For an n-qubit system, the learning task can be done iteratively, with operational complexity O(poly(n,L)/epsilon 2) in each iteration, where L is the circuit depth and epsilon is the measurement error. Then we theoretically prove its noise resilience to global depolarization, state preparation and measurement noise, and unitary noise in gates implementation, where we find the learned dynamics stay invariant. Finally, we investigate the protocol experimentally on a nitrogen-vacancy center system with a natural noise source. The results show that the behavior of a relatively intractable nuclear spin can be learned through an easily accessible electron spin under different noise models, demonstrating the protocol's feasibility.

TI Entanglement measures of Majorana bound states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging, mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work, we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter, maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterizing Majorana bound states, which can also be useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.

TI Quantum-enhanced greedy combinatorial optimization solver
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Combinatorial optimization is a broadly attractive area for potential quantum advantage, but no quantum algorithm has yet made the leap. Noise in quantum hardware remains a challenge, and more sophisticated quantum-classical algorithms are required to bolster their performance. Here, we introduce an iterative quantum heuristic optimization algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The quantum algorithm reduces to a classical greedy algorithm in the presence of strong noise. We implement the quantum algorithm on a programmable superconducting quantum system using up to 72 qubits for solving paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin glass problems. We find the quantum algorithm systematically outperforms its classical greedy counterpart, signaling a quantum enhancement. Moreover, we observe an absolute performance comparable with a state-of-the-art semidefinite programming method. Classical simulations of the algorithm illustrate that a key challenge to reaching quantum advantage remains improving the quantum device characteristics.

AB Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the leading candidates for demonstrating the quantum advantage using near-term quantum computers. Unfortunately, high device error rates limit us from reliably running QAOA circuits for problems with more than a few qubits. In QAOA, the problem graph is translated into a quantum circuit such that every edge corresponds to two 2-qubit CNOT operations in each layer of the circuit. As CNOTs are extremely error-prone, the fidelity of QAOA circuits is dictated by the number of edges in the problem graph.
   We observe that the majority of graphs corresponding to real-world applications follow a "power-law" distribution, where some hotspot nodes have significantly higher number of connections. We leverage this insight and propose "FrozenQubits" that freezes the hotspot nodes or qubits and intelligently partitions the state-space of the given probleminto several smaller sub-spaces, which are then solved independently. The corresponding QAOA sub-circuits are significantly less vulnerable to gate and decoherence errors due to the reduced number of CNOT operations in each sub-circuit. Unlike prior circuit-cutting approaches, FrozenQubits does not require any exponentially complex postprocessing step. Our evaluations with 5,300 QAOA circuits on eight different quantum computers from IBM show that FrozenQubits can improve the quality of solutions by 8.73x on average (and by up to 57x), albeit while utilizing 2x more quantum resources.

AB Quantum coherent superpositions of states with different energies, i.e., states with coherence with respect to energy basis, are an important resource for modern quantum technologies. States with small coherence can be obtained either autonomously, due to the effect of a weak coherent drive, or, potentially, due to the presence of an environment. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based protocol for quantum coherence synthesis from individual systems (with low initial coherence) into a global (and higher) coherence of the joint system. As an input, it uses N noninteracting copies of two-level systems (TLS), with low initial energy and coherence. These can be supplied by, e.g., a weak external drive or can result from an interaction with a bath. This protocol conditionally synthesizes an output state with higher energy and coherence than the initial state had, representing a universal process the rules of which have not been well studied, yet. In addition to energy and coherence, we study the quantity called mutual coherence, showing increase after the protocol application, as well. This approach is based on application of sequential pairwise projective measurements on TLS pairs (conditionally removing their ground states), that are diagonal in the TLS energy basis. The functionality of the coherence synthesis is robust with respect to dephasing effects of the TLS environment on the system. Our approach may show its benefits in quantum sensing, quantum batteries charging, or other applications where synthesis of a larger coherent system from smaller (weaker) resources is useful.

TI Observations of Bell Inequality Violations with Causal Isolation between
   Source and Detectors
SO ENTROPY
AB We report the experimental observations of Bell inequality violations (BIV) in entangled photons causally separated by a rotating mirror. A Foucault mirror gating geometry is used to causally isolate the entangled photon source and detectors. We report an observed BIV of CHSH-S = 2.30 +/- 0.07 > 2.00. This result rules out theories that explain correlations with traveling communication between source and detectors, including super-luminal and instantaneous communication.

TI Quantum phase detection generalization from marginal quantum neural
   network models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum machine learning offers a promising advantage in extracting information about quantum states, e.g., phase diagram. However, access to training labels is a major bottleneck for any supervised approach, preventing getting insights about new physics. In this Letter, using quantum convolutional neural networks, we overcome this limit by determining the phase diagram of a model where analytical solutions are lacking, by training only on marginal points of the phase diagram, where integrable models are represented. More specifically, we consider the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising Hamiltonian, which possesses a ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and antiphase, showing that the whole phase diagram can be reproduced.

TI Barren plateaus from learning scramblers with local cost functions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The existence of barren plateaus has recently revealed new training challenges in quantum machine learning (QML). Uncovering the mechanisms behind barren plateaus is essential in understanding the scope of problems that QML can efficiently tackle. Barren plateaus have recently been shown to exist when learning global properties of random unitaries, which is relevant when learning black hole dynamics. Establishing whether local cost functions can circumvent these barren plateaus is pertinent if we hope to apply QML to quantum many-body systems. We prove a no-go theorem showing that local cost functions encounter barren plateaus in learning random unitary properties.

A general method of the analysis of two-particle quantum systems based on the Schmidt decomposition has been presented to analyze quantum entanglement between the system and environment, as well as the coherence of interfering alternatives.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level system in a bosonic bath and a
   Gaussian fluctuating environment with finite correlation time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The character of evolution of an open quantum system is often encoded in the correlation function of the environment or, equivalently, in the spectral density function of the interaction. When the environment is heterogeneous, e.g., consists of several independent subenvironments with different spectral functions, one of the subenvironments can be considered auxiliary and used to control decoherence of the open quantum system in the remaining part of the environment. The control can be realized, for example, by adjusting the character of interaction with the subenvironment via suitable parameters of its spectral density. We investigate non-Markovian evolution of a two-level system (qubit) under influence of three independent decoherence channels: two of them have classical nature and originate from interaction with a stochastic field, and the third is a quantum channel formed by interaction with a bosonic bath. By modifying spectral densities of the channels, we study their impact on steady states of the two-level system, evolution of its density matrix, and the equilibrium emission spectra. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the rotation-wave approximation applied to the bath channel on accuracy of the results.

TI Fast State Stabilization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for
   Measurement-Based Quantum Feedback Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The stabilization of quantum states is a fundamental problem for realizing various quantum technologies. Measurement-based-feedback strategies have demonstrated powerful performance, and the construction of quantum control signals using measurement information has attracted great interest. However, the interaction between quantum systems and the environment is inevitable, especially when measurements are introduced, which leads to decoherence. To mitigate decoherence, it is desirable to stabilize quantum systems faster, thereby reducing the time of interaction with the environment. In this article, we utilize information obtained from measurement and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, without explicitly constructing specific complex measurement-control mappings, to rapidly drive random initial quantum state to the target state. The proposed DRL algorithm has the ability to speed up the convergence to a target state, which shortens the interaction between quantum systems and their environments to protect coherence. Simulations are performed on two- and three-qubit systems, and the results show that our algorithm can successfully stabilize a random initial quantum system to the target entangled state, with a convergence time faster than traditional methods such as Lyapunov feedback control and several DRL algorithms with different reward functions. Moreover, it exhibits robustness against imperfect measurements and delays in system evolution.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical deep learning framework for balanced multiclass
   diabetic retinopathy classification
SO METHODSX
AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive eye disease and a leading cause of preventable blindness among diabetic patients. Early and accurate classification of its severity stages is crucial for effective treatment but remains challenging due to class imbalance, high-resolution data, and limited scalability of existing models. This study presents a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning framework to address these limitations in five-class DR classification. The model achieves a balanced accuracy of 80.96 % on the APTOS 2019 dataset, outperforming several classical baselines across all DR stages. It is optimized for computational efficiency and class-balanced learning, making it suitable for deployment in telemedicine platforms and low-resource clinical settings. This work contributes a scalable AI-based diagnostic approach that fuses deep learning with emerging quantum computing techniques. The methodology, results, and publicly shared codebase provide a replicable framework for researchers and practitioners working in AI for medical imaging and early disease screening. This method is well-suited for low-resource clinical environments and tele-ophthalmology applications. The method involves an: center dot ResNet-50 feature extractor with a 4-stage dense projection (2048 -> 8) for quantum-ready compression center dot 8-qubit VQC with parameterized RY-RZ gates and ring-style entanglement for high expressiveness center dot Stratified sampling + mixed-precision training for efficiency and class-balanced generalization

TI Multi-ensemble metrology by programming local rotations with atom
   movements
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Current optical atomic clocks do not utilize their resources optimally. In particular, an exponential gain in sensitivity could be achieved if multiple atomic ensembles were to be controlled or read out individually, even without entanglement. However, controlling optical transitions locally remains an outstanding challenge for neutral-atom-based clocks and quantum computing platforms. Here we show arbitrary, single-site addressing for an optical transition via sub-wavelength controlled moves of atoms trapped in tweezers. The scheme is highly robust as it relies only on the relative position changes of tweezers and requires no additional addressing beams. Using this technique, we implement single-shot, dual-quadrature readout of Ramsey interferometry using two atomic ensembles simultaneously, and show an enhancement of the usable interrogation time at a given phase-slip error probability. Finally, we program a sequence that performs local dynamical decoupling during Ramsey evolution to evolve three ensembles with variable phase sensitivities, a key ingredient of optimal clock interrogation. Our results demonstrate the potential of fully programmable quantum optical clocks even without entanglement and could be combined with metrologically useful entangled states in the future.
   Addressing optical transitions at the level of a single site is crucial to unlock the potential of quantum computers and atomic clocks. A scheme based on atom rearrangement now demonstrates such control with demonstrable metrological benefits.

TI Optimal Policies for Quantum Markov Decision Processes

AB Markov decision process (MDP) offers a general framework for modelling sequential decision making where outcomes are random. In particular, it serves as a mathematical framework for reinforcement learning. This paper introduces an extension of MDP, namely quantum MDP (qMDP), that can serve as a mathematical model of decision making about quantum systems. We develop dynamic programming algorithms for policy evaluation and finding optimal policies for qMDPs in the case of finite-horizon. The results obtained in this paper provide some useful mathematical tools for reinforcement learning techniques applied to the quantum world.

TI Variational Power of Quantum Circuit Tensor Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We characterize the variational power of quantum circuit tensor networks in the representation of physical many-body ground states. Such tensor networks are formed by replacing the dense block unitaries and isometries in standard tensor networks by local quantum circuits. We explore both quantum circuit matrix product states and the quantum circuit multiscale entanglement renormalization Ansatz, and introduce an adaptive method to optimize the resulting circuits to high fidelity with more than 10(4) parameters. We benchmark their expressiveness against standard tensor networks, as well as other common circuit architectures, for the 1D and 2D Heisenberg and 1D Fermi-Hubbard models. We find quantum circuit tensor networks to be substantially more expressive than other quantum circuits for these problems, and that they can even be more compact than standard tensor networks. Extrapolating to circuit depths which can no longer be emulated classically, this suggests a region of advantage in quantum expressiveness in the representation of physical ground states.

TI Fluctuations of subsystem entropies at late times
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the fluctuations of subsystem entropies in closed quantum many-body systems after thermalization. Using a combination of analytics and numerics for both random quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics, we find that the statistics of such entropy fluctuations is drastically different than in the classical setting. For instance, shortly after a system thermalizes, the probability of entropy fluctuations for a subregion is suppressed in the dimension of the Hilbert space of the complementary subregion. This suppression becomes increasingly stringent as a function of time, ultimately depending on the exponential of the Hilbert space dimension, until extremely late times when the amount of suppression saturates. We also use our results to estimate the total number of rare fluctuations at large timescales. We find that the "Boltzmann brain" paradox is largely ameliorated in quantum many-body systems, in contrast with the classical setting.

TI Distribution Relationship of Quantum Battery Capacity
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The distribution relationship of quantum battery capacity is investigated. First, it is proved that for two-qubit X$X$-states, the sum of the subsystem battery capacities does not exceed the total system's battery capacity, and the conditions are provided under which they are equal. Then define the difference between the total system's and subsystems' battery capacities as the residual battery capacity (RBC$RBC$) and show that this can be divided into coherent and incoherent components. Furthermore, it is observed that this capacity monogamy relation for quantum batteries extends to general n$n$-qubit X$X$ states and any n$n$-qubit X$X$ state's battery capacity distribution can be optimized to achieve capacity gain through an appropriate global unitary evolution. Specifically, for general three-qubit X$X$ states, stronger distributive relations are derived for battery capacity. Quantum batteries are believed to hold significant potential for outperforming classical counterparts in the future. These findings contribute to the development and enhancement of quantum battery theory.

TI Electrical Control of the Nuclear Spin States of Rare-Earth Adatoms
SO ACS NANO
AB Rare-earth adatoms on surfaces have been studied for potential atomic-scale magnetic storage, quantum sensing, and quantum computing applications. Despite accumulating experimental efforts, a comprehensive description of the electronic configurations of the adatoms remains elusive. Here, we investigate two charge states and several electronic configurations, including 5d and 6s valence shells, for a Sm adatom on a MgO substrate using multiconfigurational ab initio methods, for the possibility of using the Sm nuclear spin levels as qubits. For the configurations in a neutral charge state, we find that the electronic ground state is a singlet, and thus the hyperfine interaction associated with the 147Sm nucleus is absent, which may greatly enhance nuclear spin coherence time. The degeneracy of the nuclear levels is lifted by the nuclear quadrupole interaction. We show that the splitting of the nuclear levels can be controlled by a static electric field, and that Rabi oscillations between the nuclear levels can be induced by a time-dependent electric field. For the configurations in a singly charged state, electronic Kramers doublets are formed. The electronic configurations including an unpaired 6s orbital exhibit a strong hyperfine Stark effect due to a large Fermi contact contribution to the hyperfine interaction. In these configurations, electric-field-induced Rabi oscillations between the electronic-nuclear levels can occur at frequencies up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than those for the neutral charge state. The proposed system may be experimentally observed within scanning tunneling microscopy.

TI Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with multiple quantum
   coherences
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Understanding the interplay between quantum coherence and non-Hermitian features would enable the devising of quantum technologies based on dissipative systems. In turn, quantum coherence can be characterized in terms of the language of multiple quantum coherences (MQCs) originally developed in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), nowadays applied to the detection of quantum chaos and to the study of criticality in many-body quantum systems. Here, we show the usefulness of MQCs for probing equilibrium phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems. To do so, we investigate the connection of quantum coherences and critical points for several paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. For a non-Hermitian two-level system, MQCs witness the parity-symmetry-breaking phase transition from the unbroken to the broken phase. Furthermore, for the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model, MQCs capture the Yang-Lee phase transition in which the ground state energy acquires a nonzero imaginary component. For the disordered Hatano-Nelson (HN) model with periodic boundary conditions, MQCs testify the emergence of mobility edges in the spectrum of this model. In addition, MQCs signal the topological phase transition exhibited by the complex energy spectra of the disorder-free HN model. Finally, we comment on experimentally probing phase transitions in NMR systems, realizing non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our results have applications to non-Hermitian quantum sensing, quantum thermodynamics, and in the study of the non-Hermitian skin effect.

TI Revealing hidden standard tripartite nonlocality by local filtering
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum nonlocality is a kind of significant quantum correlation that is stronger than quantum entanglement and EPR steering. The standard tripartite nonlocality can be detected by the violation of the Mermin inequality. By using local filtering operations, we give a tight upper bound on the maximal expected value of the Mermin operators. By detailed examples we show that the hidden standard nonlocality can be revealed by local filtering which can enhance the robustness of the noised entangled states.

TI Scaling up electronic structure calculations on quantum computers: The
   frozen natural orbital based method of increments
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The method of increments and frozen natural orbital (MI-FNO) framework is introduced to help expedite the application of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for quantum chemistry simulations. The MI-FNO framework provides a systematic reduction of the occupied and virtual orbital spaces for quantum chemistry simulations. The correlation energies of the resulting increments from the MI-FNO reduction can then be solved by various algorithms, including quantum algorithms such as the phase estimation algorithm and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles VQE framework is used to obtain correlation energies for the case of small molecules (i.e., BeH2, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF) using the cc-pVDZ basis set. The quantum resource requirements are estimated for a constrained geometry complex catalyst that is utilized in industrial settings for the polymerization of alpha-olefins. We show that the MI-FNO approach provides a significant reduction in the quantum bit (qubit) requirements relative to the full system simulations. We propose that the MI-FNO framework can create scalable examples of quantum chemistry problems that are appropriate for assessing the progress of NISQ devices.

TI Improved upper bounds for the hitting times of quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an extremely useful framework for the design of several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required by the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from O(n(5)) to O(n(2) log n). Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the CTQW based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al. [Phys. Rev. A 102, 022227 (2020)].

TI String Diagrams for Defect-Based Surface Code Computing
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB Surface codes are a popular choice for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computing. Two-qubit gates may be realised in these codes using only nearest-neighbour interactions, either by lattice surgery [27] or by braiding defects around each other [43]. The effect of lattice surgery operations may be simply described [3] using the ZX-calculus: a graphical language that has proven effective for program design and optimisation (see e.g. [23]). In this work, we formalise a similar description via the ZX-calculus of defect braiding, as it is conventionally described. We define a graphical calculus KNOT, denoting the logical effects (in the absence of byproduct operations) of defect braiding in surface codes: we show how these effects may be described via a fragment of ZX-calculus which we call the (0, pi)-fragment. We then use a 'doubling' construction to define a subtheory of KNOT, more specialised to standard encoding techniques in the defect braiding literature. Within this subtheory, we encompass standard braiding techniques by families of 'ribbon-like' and 'tangle-like' diagrams, each with semantics distinct from KNOT, in terms of the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams (again in the absence of byproducts). These subtheories may be used interoperably, and are each sound and complete for the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams. This provides a starting point to use the formal diagrammatics to analyse the operational effects of defect braiding procedures.

TI Strategies and Trade-Offs for Controllability and Memory Time of
   Ultra-High-Quality Microwave Cavities in Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits, but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode volume results in less efficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the inverse Purcell effect that can easily destroy the advantage of a long intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for, efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly, efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities do not require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing information encoded in bosonic qubits.

TI Monogamy of entanglement for tripartite systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the monogamy of arbitrary quantum entanglement measures E for tripartite quantum systems. Both the sufficient and necessary conditions for E to be monogamous in terms of the alpha th power of E are explicitly derived. It is shown that such monogamy of an entanglement measure E only depends on the boundedness of the solution set of certain equations. Moreover, the monogamy conditions are also obtained with respect to certain subsets of quantum states for a given quantum correlation. Detailed examples are given to illustrate our results.

TI On a poset of quantum exact promise problems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Two of the most well-known quantum algorithms, those introduced by Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani, can solve promise problems with just one function query, showing an oracular separation with deterministic classical algorithms. In this work, we generalise those methods to study a family of quantum algorithms that can, with just one query, exactly solve promise problems stated over Boolean functions. We also show that these problems can be naturally ordered, inducing a partially ordered set of promise problems. We study the properties of such a poset, showing that the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani problems are, in a certain sense, extremal problems in it, determining some of its automorphisms and proving that it is connected. We also prove that, for the problems in the poset, the corresponding classical query complexities can take any value between 1 and 2(n-1) + 1.

TI Multi-pulse Fourier codes for bit transmission at the quantum limit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Bit-transmission can be enhanced by the use of quantum detection techniques, realizing a joint-detection receiver (JDR) that is able to decode transmitted signals via a collective operation and achieve the Holevo channel capacity. Explicit JDR designs proposed so far employ the Hadamard or Fourier transform to perform a phase-to-intensity translation of the information encoding, effectively falling in the class of on-off-keying (OOK) modulation techniques; they improve over classical decoders but fall short of the Holevo capacity, particularly at large signal mean photon number n greater than or similar to 1. Here we introduce new families of decoders based on multi-pulse and multi-level codes. We compute the rate of these codes exactly, and provide a comprehensive study of their performance. We show that multi-pulse codes can approach the rate of OOK closely, providing a simplified design for quantum-enhanced communication in the photon-starved regime; furthermore, multi-level codes can approach generalized-OOK strategies with multiple pulse types, thus they can be employed in the larger photon-number regime.

TI Estimation of the Wigner distribution of single-mode Gaussian states: A
   comparative study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we consider the estimation of single-mode Gaussian states using four different measurement schemes, namely, (1) homodyne measurement, (2) heterodyne measurement, (3) sequential measurement scheme, and (4) the Arthurs-Kelly measurement scheme, with a view to compare their relative performance. To this end, we work in the phase space formalism, specifically at the covariance matrix level, which provides an elegant and intuitive way to explicitly carry out the involved calculations. We show that the optimal performance of the Arthurs-Kelly and sequential measurement schemes is equal to the heterodyne measurement. While the heterodyne measurement outperforms the homodyne measurement in the mean estimation of squeezed state ensembles, the homodyne measurement outperforms the heterodyne measurement for variance estimation of squeezed state ensembles up to a certain range of the squeezing parameter. We then modify the Hamiltonian in the Arthurs-Kelly measurement scheme, such that the two meters can have correlations and show that the optimal performance is achieved when the meters are uncorrelated. We expect that these results will be useful in various quantum information and quantum communication protocols.

Replacing operators with complex Gaussian random variables in the Bogoliubov transformations for squeezed states, we find that the resulting transformed variables are not only correlated but also improper. A simple threshold exceedance model of photon detection is considered and used to demonstrate how the behavior of improper Gaussian random variables can mimic that of entangled photon pairs when coincidence post-selection is performed.

TI Quantum coherence and interference of a single moiré exciton in
   nano-fabricated twisted monolayer semiconductor heterobilayers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The moir & eacute; potential serves as a periodic quantum confinement for optically generated excitons, creating spatially ordered zero-dimensional quantum systems. However, a broad emission spectrum resulting from inhomogeneity among moir & eacute; potentials hinders the investigation of their intrinsic properties. In this study, we demonstrated a method for the optical observation of quantum coherence and interference of a single moir & eacute; exciton in a twisted semiconducting heterobilayer beyond the diffraction limit of light. We observed a single and sharp photoluminescence peak from a single moir & eacute; exciton following nanofabrication. Our findings revealed the extended duration of quantum coherence in a single moir & eacute; exciton, persisting beyond 10 ps, and an accelerated decoherence process with increasing temperature and excitation power density. Moreover, quantum interference experiments revealed the coupling between moir & eacute; excitons in different moir & eacute; potential minima. The observed quantum coherence and interference of moir & eacute; exciton will facilitate potential applications of moir & eacute; quantum systems in quantum technologies.
   Here, the authors develop a microfabrication method to realize the optical observation of quantum coherence and interference of a single moir & eacute; exciton in twisted semiconducting heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, persisting beyond 10 ps.

TI Evolutionary Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem With
   Innovative Encoding on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machines
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a widely studied NP-complete optimization challenge with significant theoretical and practical implications. This study proposes a hybrid quantum-classical framework using a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) with Sort Gray Binary Encoding to solve the TSP. The proposed method guarantees the generation of valid TSP tours by eliminating invalid solutions. It employs quantum superposition with intrinsic randomness to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. The framework was implemented on cloud-based NISQ platforms, including IBM Quantum and AWS Braket, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness. Experimental evaluations revealed that the proposed framework successfully solved TSP instances with up to 15 cities, achieving superior performance compared to classical methods and showcasing its ability to scale under NISQ constraints. The results also highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to overcome hardware limitations in current quantum systems. This study establishes a robust hybrid methodology for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It also sets a benchmark for leveraging the capabilities of NISQ-era quantum devices in real-world applications, thereby providing a foundation for future research in hybrid quantum-classical optimization techniques.

TI Tunable optical and spin properties by fullerene coupling: from an
   excitonic perspective
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the cluster-assembled hierarchical structures, the quantum confinement and interfacial coupling effects are prominent, offering versatile excitonic and optical properties for both fundamental studies and device applications. Here, we focus on a series of synthetic fullerene complex structures and demonstrate their diverse excitonic characteristics from localized exciton to quadrupolar-like excitons by tuning the inter-cluster coupling. Owing to these unique exciton states, the fullerene complexes exhibit strong fluorescence emission and quantum-confined Stark effect with large Stark shifts, distinct from an isolated fullerene. Moreover, a spin triplet state can be devised to serve as a qubit with spin initialization and readout operating at a wavelength close to the low-loss telecom band. These theoretical results provide a new perspective for manipulating charge, spin, and exciton in the cluster-assembled structures, thereby advancing their applications in light-emitting devices, electro-optic modulation, and quantum information.

TI Long-range bipartite entanglement in XXZ spin chains with exponential
   and power-law long-range interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Long-range bipartite entanglement (LBE) and its distribution properties are studied in XXZ spin chains with exponential and power-law long-range interactions (ELRIs and PLRIs). LBE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance in the infinite chain with ELRIs in the thermodynamic limit, and the long-range behavior of two-spin entanglement can detect the quantum phase transition and identify different quantum phases away from the critical point. Moreover, a fine-grained LBE distribution relation is obtained for the infinite XXZ spin chain. On the other hand, in the finite XXZ spin chain with conventional PLRIs, the long-range concurrence decays algebraically and the total one is no longer monotonic along with the chain length. The total LBE distribution property can exhibit a piecewise function, which has a close relationship with the decaying mode and strength of PLRIs. These LBE relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-Bu & zcaron;ek-Imoto bound for the prototypical long-range XXZ model, having potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Relativistic Bell Test within Quantum Reference Frames
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A still widely debated question in the field of relativistic quantum information is whether entanglement and the degree of violation of Bell's inequalities for massive relativistic particles are frame independent or not. At the core of this question is the effect that spin gets entangled with the momentum degree of freedom at relativistic velocities. Here, we show that Bell's inequalities for a pair of particles can be maximally violated in a special-relativistic regime, even without any postselection of the momentum of the particles. To this end, we use the methodology of quantum reference frames, which allows us to transform the problem to the rest frame of a particle, whose state can be in a superposition of relativistic momenta from the viewpoint of the laboratory frame. We show that, when the relative motion of two particles is noncollinear, the optimal measurements for violation of Bell's inequalities in the laboratory frame involve "coherent Wigner rotations." Moreover, the degree of violation of Bell's inequalities is independent of the choice of the quantum reference frame. Our results open up the possibility of extending entanglement-based quantum communication protocols to relativistic regimes.

TI Framework for Quantum-Based Deepfake Video Detection (Without Audio)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has made human tasks easier compared to earlier days. It has revolutionized various domains, from paper drafting to video editing. However, some individuals exploit AI to create deceptive content, such as fake videos, audios, and images, to mislead others. To address this, researchers and large corporations have proposed solutions for detecting fake content using classical deep learning models. However, these models often suffer from a large number of trainable parameters, which leads to large model sizes and, consequently, computational intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose various hybrid classical-quantum models that use a classical pre-trained model as a front-end feature extractor, followed by a quantum-based LSTM network, that is, QLSTM. These pre-trained models are based on the ResNet architecture, such as ResNet34, 50, and 101. We have compared the performance of the proposed models with their classical counterparts. These proposed models combine the strengths of classical and quantum systems for the detection of deepfake video (without audio). Our results indicate that the proposed models significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, as well as quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) parameters, which leads to a smaller model size than the classical models. Despite the reduced parameter, the performance of the proposed models is either superior to or comparable with that of their classical equivalent. The proposed hybrid quantum models, that is, ResNet34-QLSTM, ResNet50-QLSTM, and ResNet101-QLSTM, achieve a reduction of approximately 1.50%, 4.59%, and 5.24% in total trainable parameters compared to their equivalent classical models, respectively. Additionally, QLSTM linked with the proposed models reduces its trainable parameters by 99.02%, 99.16%, and 99.55%, respectively, compared to equivalent classical LSTM. This significant reduction highlights the efficiency of the quantum-based network in terms of resource usage. The trained model sizes of the proposed models are 81.35, 88.06, and 162.79, and their equivalent classical models are 82.59, 92.28, and 171.76 in MB, respectively.

TI An explainable hybrid deep learning system for tuberculosis detection
   with Grad-CAM
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease that affects millions of individuals globally. Early detection is crucial in preventing its spread and improving patient outcomes. Radiologists often utilize X-ray imaging as a diagnostic tool for tuberculosis; however, the accuracy of the results may differ depending on the radiologist's interpretation. To increase the precision of TB identification from X-ray images, a hybrid strategy combining Convolutional Neural Network, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classifier has been developed. Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. By combining the strengths of both techniques, this approach aims to capture relevant features and shape and texture information of an image. The study used state-of-the-art models such as VGG16 and AlexNet, along with a handcrafted method (HOG) and a deep learning (CNN) method to detect TB from chest X-ray images. Six distinct tests were carried out by the authors to successfully diagnose tuberculosis. All models showed promise when the data was analyzed, but the best techniques involved augmentation, image preprocessing, contrast improvement, and noise filtering. The block-matching and 3D filtering approach was used to improve image edge preservation and reduce noise. In this study, Grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation map) was applied to the convolutional neural network model to identify the model's important features (explainability) for decision-making. This focus on Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for clinical adoption, as it provides radiologists with visual evidence of the model's reasoning, fostering trust and enabling more informed decisions. The hybrid model was found to have achieved an exceptional level of accuracy in detecting and classifying TB, with an accuracy rate of 100% during training, 99.07% during validation, and 98.14% during testing. These results highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately identifying TB and its potential to be a valuable tool in the fight against this disease.

TI Two-step large-area synthesis of Bi2Se3
   topological insulator thin films via bismuth evaporation and
   selenization
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Bi2Se3 is recognized as one of the most promising topological insulators, with substantial potential for industrial applications, particularly as a qubit in quantum computing. Realizing large-area growth using cost-effective methods is crucial for practical applications. This study presents an innovative approach for fabricating high-quality large-area Bi2Se3 thin films by combining Bi thermal evaporation with cracker selenization, which inherently supports scalability. The amorphous precursor-a Bi film capped with a Se layer-reacts with highly reactive cracked Se, forming crystalline Bi2Se3 thin films with layered structures. Prolonged selenization enhances the crystallinity of the Bi2Se3 thin films and significantly reduces their oxygen content by effectively substituting the O atoms with Se atoms. Thicker precursors require extended selenization to improve their crystallinity and are more susceptible to stress. Electrical transport measurements of Bi2Se3 films formed via selenization for 8 h reveal a long phase coherence length of >375 nm and a single surface state with a spin texture, which are unique properties of topological insulators. Uniform physical and optical properties are achieved across a substrate with a large 4-in diameter under optimized conditions. This novel method exhibits great potential for the industrial fabrication of high-quality large-area Bi2Se3 topological insulator thin films.

TI Tunable Polariton Rabi Oscillation in Phase-Changing Perovskite
   Microcavities
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Exciton-polaritons are composite quasiparticles hybridized between excitons and photons, which are very promising to develop quantum information devices such as entangled photon pair sources and polariton qubit devices by utilizing the fascinating properties of strong nonlinearity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and superfluidity. Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted much interest in cavity quantum electrodynamics due to their excellent excitonic properties, including strong exciton binding energy and high oscillation strength. Here, tunable Rabi oscillation of exciton-polaritons in the lead halide perovskite microcavity is demonstrated, which experiences a phase transition between orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases by varying the temperature. Over the phase transition, the Rabi frequency is probed by tracing the dispersion relation of the exciton-polaritons using Fourier plane spectroscopy. Due to the emergence of ferroelectricity in the tetragonal phase of the perovskites, the Rabi splitting can be tuned by approximate to 20%, while the corresponding exciton oscillator strength is varied by approximate to 44%. These results provide insight into novel functionalities of polariton devices by utilizing ferroic semiconductors, which can facilitate the development of tunable quantum devices.

TI Deterministic generation of large Fock states in coupled
   optical-optomechanical cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The preparation of Fock states, as a fundamental problem in the research of quantum optics and quantum information, still faces challenges in achieving both unconditional preparation and large photon numbers. Here, we study the deterministic generation of large Fock states through the nonlinear interaction in coupled optical-optomechanical cavities. Under the condition that the mechanical frequency is twice the optical coupling strength, and much larger than the optomechanical coupling strength, there occurs a nonlinear interaction among two optical eigenmodes and the mechanical mode, i.e., a photon is annihilated, accompanied by the creation of another photon together with a phonon, and vice versa. It is analytically proved that, through this interaction, Fock states |n) and |1) will generate |n + 1) at specific evolution times if the mechanical mode is initially on the ground state. In addition, numerical results show that Fock states |n) and |p) can also generate |n + p) with the fidelities larger than 94% (1 < p n 40). The proposed mechanism achieves deterministic generation of large Fock states, which can be applied to quantum metrology and quantum simulation.

TI Generation of tripartite entangled states with fermionic systems
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a protocol based on a tunneling plus particle-detection process aimed at generating tripartite entanglement in a system of 3 indistinguishable fermions in a triple-well potential, initially prepared in a state exhibiting only exchange correlations. Particular attention is paid to the generation of fermionic ghz - and w -type states, which are analogous to the usual ghz - and w -type states defined in composites of distinguishable qubits. The protocol succeeds in generating fermionic w -type states, and the ensuing state becomes effectively equivalent to a 3distinguishable-qubit w -type state shared among three localized parties. The protocol, however, is unable to generate ghz -type states, a result that highlights the fundamental inequivalence between these two types of states, and throws light into the characterization of processes that guarantee the emergence of specific kinds of multipartite entanglement in systems of identical parties. Our findings suggest new paths for the exploration, generation and exploitation of multipartite entanglement in composites of indistinguishable particles, as a useful resource for quantum information processing.

TI Fast and High-Fidelity State Preparation and Measurement in
   Triple-Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate rapid high-fidelity state preparation and measurement in exchange-only Si/SiGe triple-quantum-dot qubits. Fast measurement integration (980-ns) and initialization (approximately 300-ns) operations are performed with all-electrical baseband control. We emphasize a leakage-sensitive joint initialization and measurement metric, developed in the context of exchange-only qubits but applicable more broadly, and report an infidelity of 2.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3). This result is enabled by a high-valley-splitting heterostructure, initialization at the two- to three-electron charge boundary, and careful assessment and mitigation of T-1 during spin-to-charge conversion. The ultimate fidelity is limited by a number of comparably important factors and we identify clear paths toward further improved fidelity and speed. Along with an observed single-qubit randomized benchmarking error rate of 1.7 x 10(-3), this work demonstrates initialization, control, and measurement of Si/SiGe triple-dot qubits at fidelities and durations that are promising for scalable quantum information processing.

TI Entangled dark state mediated by a dielectric cavity within
   epsilon-near-zero materials
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Two emitters can be entangled by manipulating them through optical fields within a photonic cavity. However, maintaining entanglement for a long time is challenging due to the decoherence of the entangled qubits, primarily caused by cavity loss and atomic decay. Here, we found the entangled dark state between two emitters mediated by a dielectric cavity within epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, ensuring entanglement maintenance over an extended period. To obtain the entangled dark state, we derived an effective model with degenerate mode modulation. In the dielectric cavities within ENZ materials, the decay rate of emitters can be regarded as 0, which is the key to achieving the entangled dark state. Meanwhile, the dark state immune to cavity loss exists when two emitters are in symmetric positions in the dielectric cavity. Additionally, by adjusting the emitters to specific asymmetric positions, it is possible to achieve transient entanglement with higher concurrence. By overcoming the decoherence of the entangled qubits, this study demonstrates stable, long-term entanglement with ENZ materials, holding significant importance for applications such as nanodevice design for quantum communication and quantum information processing.

TI Tuning Excitation Transport in a Dissipative Rydberg Ring
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate the flexible tunability of excitation transport in Rydberg atoms, under the interplay of controlled dissipation and interaction-induced synthetic flux. Considering a minimum four-site setup, i.e., a triangular configuration with an additional output site, we study the transport of a single excitation, injected into a vertex of the triangle, through the structure. While the long-range dipole-dipole interactions between the Rydberg atoms lead to geometry-dependent Peierls phases in the hopping amplitudes of excitations, we further introduce on-site dissipation to a vertex of the triangle. As a result, both the chirality and destination of the transport can be manipulated through the flux and dissipation. In particular, we illustrate a parameter regime where our Rydberg-ring structure may serve as a switch for transporting the injected excitation through to the output site. The underlying mechanism is then analyzed by studying the chiral trajectory of the excitation and the time-dependent dissipation. The switchable excitation transport reported here offers a flexible tool for quantum control in Rydberg atoms, and holds interesting potentials for applications in quantum simulation and quantum information.

AB Most muon spin rotation (mu SR) experiments are based on the coupling between a muon (a quantum, spin-1/2 particle) and a macroscopic magnetic field, either applied externally (as is often the case for experiments on superconductors) or produced internally (due to, for example, the alignment of spins in an ordered magnet). This article will review some experiments which have exploited this, essentially classical, interaction, but then will consider cases in which a more intrinsically quantum mechanical approach is needed. In these cases, one cannot ignore the back reaction of the muon's effect on the system it is probing. It can be profitable to consider the muon as a qubit, evaluating the decoherence of quantum information injected by the muon into the environmental spin system. Experiments focussed on this approach are underpinned by DFT+mu calculations (density functional theory with an included muon) and give rise to an excellent agreement between theory and experiment and open up new ways of using the muon as a probe.

TI Hybrid Integration of Silicon Photonic Devices on Lithium Niobate for
   Optomechanical Wavelength Conversion
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The rapid development of quantum information processors has accelerated the demand for technologies that enable quantum networking. One promising approach uses mechanical resonators as an intermediary between microwave and optical fields. Signals from a superconducting, topological, or spin qubit processor can then be converted coherently to optical states at telecom wavelengths. However, current devices built from homogeneous structures suffer from added noise and a small conversion efficiency. Combining advantageous properties of different materials into a heterogeneous design should allow for superior quantum transduction devices-so far these hybrid approaches have however been hampered by complex fabrication procedures. Here we present a novel integration method, based on previous pick-and-place ideas, that can combine independently fabricated device components of different materials into a single device. The method allows for a precision alignment by continuous optical monitoring during the process. Using our method, we assemble a hybrid silicon-lithium niobate device with state-of-the-art wavelength conversion characteristics.

TI Coherence of a charge stabilised tin-vacancy spin in diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information processing (QIP) with solid state spin qubits strongly depends on the efficient initialisation of the qubit's desired charge state. While the negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) centre in diamond has emerged as an excellent platform for realising QIP protocols due to long spin coherence times at liquid helium temperature and lifetime limited optical transitions, its usefulness is severely limited by termination of the fluorescence under resonant excitation. Here, we unveil the underlying charge cycle, potentially applicable to all group IV-vacancy (G4V) centres, and exploit it to demonstrate highly efficient and rapid initialisation of the desired negative charge state of single SnV centres while preserving long term stable optical resonances. In addition to investigating the optical coherence, we all-optically probe the coherence of the ground state spins by means of coherent population trapping and find a spin dephasing time of 5(1) mu s. Furthermore, we demonstrate proof-of-principle single shot spin state readout without the necessity of a magnetic field aligned to the symmetry axis of the defect.

TI Quantifying quantum coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability is a quantum analog of phase space probability of classical statistical mechanics, allowing negative or/and nonreal values. It gives an informationally complete representation of a quantum state. Recent works have revealed the important roles played by the KD quasiprobability in the broad fields of quantum science and quantum technology. In the present work, we use the KD quasiprobability to access the quantum coherence in a quantum state. We show that the l1 norm of the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability over an incoherent reference basis and a second basis, maximized over all possible choices of the latter, can be used to quantify quantum coherence, satisfying certain desirable properties. It is upper bounded by the quantum uncertainty, i.e., the quantum standard deviation, of the incoherent basis in the state. It gives a lower bound to the l1 norm quantum coherence, and for a single qubit, they are identical. We discuss the measurement of the KD coherence based on the measurement of the KD quasiprobability and an optimization procedure in hybrid quantum-classical schemes, and suggest statistical interpretations. We also discuss its relevance in the physics of linear response regime.

TI Nonnormal Hamiltonian dynamics in quantum systems and its realization on
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The eigenspectrum of a non-normal matrix, which does not commute with its Hermitian conjugate, is a central issue of non-Hermitian physics that has been extensively studied in the past few years. There is, however, another characteristic of a non-normal matrix that has often been overlooked: the pseudospectrum, or the set of spectra under small perturbations. In this paper, we study the dynamics driven by the non-normal matrix (Hamiltonian) realized as a continuous quantum trajectory of the Lindblad master equation in open quantum systems and point out that the dynamics can reveal the nature of unconventional pseudospectrum of the non-normal Hamiltonian. In particular, we focus on the transient dynamics of the norm of an unnormalized quantum state evolved with the non-normal Hamiltonian, which is related to the probability for observing the trajectory with no quantum jump. We formulate the transient suppression of the decay rate of the norm due to the pseudospectral behavior and derive a non-Hermitian/non-normal analog of the time-energy uncertainty relation. We also consider two methods to experimentally realize the non-normal dynamics and observe our theoretical findings on quantum computers: one uses a technique to realize nonunitary operations on quantum circuits and the other leverages a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm called variational quantum simulation. Our demonstrations using cloudbased quantum computers provided by IBM Quantum exhibit the frozen dynamics of the norm in transient time, which can be regarded as a non-normal analog of the quantum Zeno effect.

TI Efficient generation of polarization-entangled photons in metal-organic
   framework waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Parametric nonlinear optical processes are instrumental in optical quantum technology for generating entangled light. However, the range of materials conventionally used for producing entangled photons is limited. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a novel class of optical materials with customizable nonlinear properties and proven chemical and optical stability. The large number of combinations of metal atoms and organic ligand from which bulk MOF crystals are known to form, facilitates the search of promising candidates for nonlinear optics. To accelerate the discovery of next-generation quantum light sources, we employ a multi-scale modeling approach to study phase-matching conditions for collinear degenerate type-II spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) with MOF-based one dimensional waveguides. Using periodic-density-functional theory calculations to compute the nonlinear optical properties of selected zinc-based MOF crystals, we predict polarization-entangled pair generation rates of order 104 4 - 107 7 s-1mW-1 - 1 mW - 1 at 1064 nm for 10 mm crystals, improving the brightness of industry materials such as PPKTP and BBO in some cases. This work underscores the great potential of MOF single crystals as entangled light sources for applications in quantum communication and sensing.

What are the implications of the main findings? The protocol shows high adaptability to dynamic and low-power vehicular environments, supporting secure and efficient key exchange under quantum threats. It provides a practical and forward-compatible cryptographic framework for intelligent transportation systems in the post-quantum era.Abstract This paper proposes a post-quantum secure key agreement protocol tailored for vehicular networks (V2X), addressing the dual challenges of quantum resistance and lightweight deployment. The hybrid scheme integrates two lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)-Kyber and Saber-to construct a dual-path handshake framework that enhances cryptographic redundancy and ensures robustness against quantum attacks. The protocol achieves secure and authenticated key exchange through RSU public-key broadcasting, OBU dual-path encapsulation, and session-key derivation using HMAC and timestamps. To support efficient execution in embedded vehicular environments, several algorithm-level optimizations are incorporated, including Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) acceleration for Kyber, AVX2-based parallelism for Saber, and integer inner-product techniques to minimize computational overhead. Experimental validation on a Veins + SUMO vehicular simulation platform demonstrates that the proposed protocol reduces handshake latency by nearly 60% compared with RSA, achieves delay performance comparable to ECDH, and lowers total resource consumption by around 40%. These results confirm that the Kyber + Saber hybrid protocol provides a practical, scalable, and quantum-resistant solution for secure V2X communication in dynamic, resource-constrained, and latency-sensitive environments.

TI Quantum dynamics of two photons in the coherent feedback system
   composing of two separated resonators coupling to a waveguide *
SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE
AB Quantum coherent feedback based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics plays important roles in quantum devices design and quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the coherent dynamics of the quantum network composed of two separated resonators coupling to a waveguide. Using the dynamical feedback equation in Markovian regime, we obtain the analytical solutions to the output states for the two photons incident from the same or different directions of the waveguide. The twophoton scattering properties are analyzed based on the analytical expressions. It is found that the output states of the two photons can be controlled well by the phase induced by the single photon propagating between the two separated resonators. The results given in this paper are helpful in designing quantum devices at few-photon level. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Franklin Institute.

TI Large-S and Tensor-Network Methods for Strongly-Interacting
   Topological Insulators
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The study of correlation effects in topological phases of matter can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that combines techniques drawn from condensed matter, high-energy physics and quantum information science. In this work, we exploit these connections to study the strongly-interacting limit of certain lattice Hubbard models of topological insulators, which map onto four-Fermi quantum field theories with a Wilson-type discretisation and have been recently shown to be at reach of cold-atom quantum simulators based on synthetic spin-orbit coupling. We combine large-S and tensor-network techniques to explore the possible spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that appear when the interactions of the topological insulators are sufficiently large. In particular, we show that varying the Wilson parameter r of the lattice discretisations leads to a novel Heisenberg-Ising compass model with critical lines that flow with the value of r.

TI On the information behavior from quadratically coupled accelerated
   detectors
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In this work, we propose to investigate the information behavior of quantum systems through accelerated detectors quadratically coupled with a massless scalar field. In addition, we made detailed comparisons with the case of linear coupling. The perturbative method was used to evolve the density matrix that describes the interaction of the detector-field system during a finite time. The systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and the which-path distinguishability circuit. The results on the probability transition rates show that quadratic coupling amplifies the Unruh effect. This is due to the modification of the interaction structure, allowing the simultaneous absorption of multiple quanta. Our findings showed that the information is degraded more quickly in the case of quadratic coupling, when compared to the linear case. Furthermore, this change is mainly given by the coupling constant and by an additional factor that arises in the case of quadratic coupling. Therefore, these results indicate that the nature of the coupling between the detector and the field plays a fundamental role in the behavior of quantum information in high acceleration regimes.

TI Almost complete solution for the NP-hard separability problem of Bell
   diagonal qutrits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With a probability of success of 95% we solve the separability problem for Bell diagonal qutrit states with positive partial transposition (PPT). The separability problem, i.e. distinguishing separable and entangled states, generally lacks an efficient solution due to the existence of bound entangled states. In contrast to free entangled states that can be used for entanglement distillation via local operations and classical communication, these states cannot be detected by the Peres-Horodecki criterion or PPT criterion. We analyze a large family of bipartite qutrit states that can be separable, free entangled or bound entangled. Leveraging a geometrical representation of these states in Euclidean space, novel methods are presented that allow the classification of separable and bound entangled Bell diagonal states in an efficient way. Moreover, the classification allows the precise determination of relative volumes of the classes of separable, free and bound entangled states. In detail, out of all Bell diagonal PPT states 81.0% +/- 0.1% are determined to be separable while 13.9 +/- 0.1% are bound entangled and only 5.1 +/- 0.1% remain unclassified. Moreover, our applied criteria are compared for their effectiveness and relation as detectors of bound entanglement, which reveals that not a single criterion is capable to detect all bound entangled states.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on erasure qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) poses a major bottleneck for realizing fault-tolerant computation. To reduce this overhead, we exploit the idea of erasure qubits, relying on an efficient conversion of the dominant noise into erasures at known locations. We start by introducing a formalism for QEC schemes with erasure qubits and express the corresponding decoding problem as a matching problem. Then, we propose and optimize QEC schemes based on erasure qubits and the recently introduced Floquet codes. Our schemes are well suited for superconducting circuits, being compatible with planar layouts. We numerically estimate the memory thresholds for the circuit noise model that includes spreading (via entangling operations) and imperfect detection of erasures. Our results demonstrate that, despite being slightly more complex, QEC schemes based on erasure qubits can significantly outperform standard approaches.

TI Single-Shot Readout of Multiple Donor Electron Spins with a Gate-Based
   Sensor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Proposals for large-scale semiconductor spin-based quantum computers require high-fidelity single-shot qubit readout to perform error correction and read out qubit registers at the end of a computation. However, as devices scale to larger qubit numbers integrating readout sensors into densely packed qubit chips is a critical challenge. Two promising approaches are minimizing the footprint of the sensors, and extending the range of each sensor to read more qubits. Here we show high-fidelity single-shot electron spin readout using a nanoscale single-lead quantum dot (SLQD) sensor that is both compact and capable of reading multiple qubits. Our gate-based SLQD sensor is deployed in an all-epitaxial silicon donor spin-qubit device, and we demonstrate single-shot readout of three 31P donor quantum dot electron spins with a maximum fidelity of 95%. Importantly, in our device the quantum dot confinement potentials are provided inherently by the donors, removing the need for additional metallic confinement gates and resulting in strong capacitive interactions between sensor and donor quantum dots. Our results are consistent with a 1/d1.4 scaling of the capacitive coupling between sensor and 31P dots (where d is the sensor-dot distance), compared to 1/d2.5-3.0 in gate-defined quantum dot devices. Due to the small qubit size and strong capaci-tive interactions in all-epitaxial donor devices, we estimate a single sensor can achieve single-shot readout of approximately 15 qubits in a linear array, compared to 3-4 qubits for a similar sensor in a gate-defined quantum dot device. Our results highlight the potential for spin-qubit devices with significantly reduced sensor densities.

TI Black holes as clouded mirrors: the Hayden-Preskill protocol with
   symmetry
SO QUANTUM
AB The Hayden-Preskill protocol is a qubit-toy model of the black hole information paradox. Based on the assumption of scrambling, it was revealed that quantum information is instantly leaked out from the quantum many-body system that mod-els a black hole. In this paper, we ex-tend the protocol to the case where the system has symmetry and investigate how the symmetry affects the leakage of infor-mation. We especially focus on the conser-vation of the number of up-spins. Develop-ing a partial decoupling approach, we first show that the symmetry induces a delay of leakage and an information remnant. We then clarify the physics behind them: the delay is characterized by thermodynamic properties of the system associated with the symmetry, and the information rem-nant is closely related to the symmetry -breaking of the initial state. These rela-tions bridge the information leakage prob-lem to macroscopic physics of quantum many-body systems and allow us to in-vestigate the information leakage only in terms of physical properties of the sys-tem.

TI Dynamical non-Hermitian systems: Fingerprints and pure-dephasing-induced
   protection effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate the dynamics of the trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by the trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.

TI Controlling periodic Fano resonances of quantum acoustic waves with a
   giant atom coupled to a microwave waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nanoscale Fano resonances, with applications from telecommunications to ultrasensitive biosensing, have prompted extensive research. We demonstrate that a superconducting qubit, jointly coupled to microwave waveguides and an inter-digital transducer composite device, can exhibit acoustic Fano resonances. Our analytical framework, leveraging the Taylor series approximation, elucidates the origins of these quantum acoustic resonances with periodic Fano-like interference. By analyzing the analytical Fano parameter, we demonstrate that the Fano resonances and their corresponding Fano widths near the resonance frequency of a giant atom can be precisely controlled and manipulated by adjusting the time delay. Moreover, not just the near-resonant Fano profiles, but the entire periodic Fano resonance features can be precisely modulated from Lorentz, Fano to quasi-Lorentz shapes by tuning the coupling strength of the microwave waveguide. Our analytical framework offers insights into the control and manipulation of periodic Fano resonances in quantum acoustic waves, thereby presenting significant potential for applications such as quantum information processing, sensing, and communication.

TI Direct measurement of density-matrix elements using a phase-shifting
   technique
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A direct measurement protocol allows reconstructing specific elements of the density matrix of a quantum state without using quantum state tomography. However, the direct measurement protocols to date are primarily based on weak or strong measurements with an ancillary pointer, which interacts with the investigated system to extract information about the specified elements. Here, we present a direct measurement scheme based on phase-shifting operations which do not need ancillary pointers. In this method, estimates of at most six expectation values of projective observables suffice to determine any specific element of an unknown quantum density matrix. A concrete quantum circuit to implement this direct measurement protocol for multiqubit states is provided, which is composed of just single-qubit gates and two multiqubit controlled-phase gates. This scheme is also extended for the direct measurement of the density matrix of continuous-variable quantum states. Our method can be used in quantum information applications where only partial information about the quantum state needs to be extracted, for example, problems such as entanglement witnessing, fidelity estimation of quantum systems, and quantum coherence estimation.

TI Numerical analysis of effective models for flux-tunable transmon systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Simulations and analytical calculations that aim to describe flux-tunable transmons are usually based on effective models of the corresponding lumped-element model. However, when a control pulse is applied, in most cases it is not known how much the predictions made with the effective models deviate from the predictions made with the original lumped-element model. In this work we compare the numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for both the effective and the lumped-element models, for microwave and unimodal control pulses (external fluxes). These control pulses are used to model single-qubit (X) and two-qubit gate (iSWAP and CZ) transitions. First, we derive a nonadiabatic effective Hamiltonian for a single flux-tunable transmon and compare the pulse response of this model to the one of the corresponding circuit Hamiltonian. Here we find that both models predict similar outcomes for similar control pulses. Then, we study how different approximations affect single-qubit (X) and two-qubit gate (iSWAP and CZ) transitions in two different two-qubit systems. For this purpose we consider three different systems in total: a single flux-tunable transmon and two two-qubit systems. In summary, we find that a series of commonly applied approximations (individually and/or in combination) can change the response of a system substantially, when a control pulse is applied.

TI Universal entanglement signatures of quantum liquids as a guide to
   fermionic criticality
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB An outstanding challenge involves understanding the many-particle entanglement of liquid states of quantum matter that arise in systems of interacting electrons. The Fermi liquid (FL) shows a violation of the area-law in real-space entanglement entropy of a subsystem, believed to be a signature of the ground state of a gapless quantum critical system of interacting fermions. Here, we apply a T = 0 renormalization group approach to the FL, unveiling the long-wavelength quantum fluctuations from which long-range entanglement arises. A similar analysis of non-Fermi liquids such as the 2D marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) and the 1D Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid reveals a universal logarithmic violation of the area-law in gapless electronic liquids, with a proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the underlying Fermi surface. We extend this analysis to classify the gapped quantum liquids emergent from the destabilisation of the Fermi surface by renormalisation group relevant quantum fluctuations arising from backscattering processes.

TI Construction and Local Equivalence of Dual-Unitary Operators: From
   Dynamical Maps to Quantum Combinatorial Designs
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB While quantum circuits built from two-particle dual-unitary (maximally entangled) operators serve as minimal models of typically nonintegrable many-body systems, the construction and characterization of dual-unitary operators themselves are only partially understood. A nonlinear map on the space of unitary operators has been proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 070501 (2020) that results in operators being arbitrarily close to dual unitaries. Here, we study the map analytically for the two-qubit case describing the basins of attraction, fixed points, and rates of approach to dual unitaries. A subset of dual-unitary operators having maximum entangling power are 2-unitary operators or perfect tensors and these are equivalent to four-party absolutely maximally entangled states. It is known that they only exist if the local dimension is larger than d = 2. We use the nonlinear map, and introduce stochastic variants of it, to construct explicit examples of new dual and 2-unitary operators. A necessary criterion for their local unitary equivalence to distinguish classes is also introduced and used to display various concrete results and a conjecture in d = 3. It is known that orthogonal Latin squares provide a "classical combinatorial design" for constructing permutations that are 2-unitary. We extend the underlying design from classical to genuine quantum ones for general dual-unitary operators and give an example of what might be the smallest-sized genuinely quantum design of a 2-unitary in d = 4.

AB Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is the most natural framework for the purpose of quantum simulation, an area of research that is growing with advances in quantum-computing algorithms and hardware. It, therefore, remains an important task to identify the most accurate, while computationally economic, Hamiltonian formulation(s) in such theories, considering the necessary truncation imposed on the Hilbert space of gauge bosons with any finite computing resources. This paper is a first step toward addressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs. Such theories require the imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing additional computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1 + 1 dimensions coupled to one flavor of fermionic matter, a number of different formulations of the original Kogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the dependence of the dimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system size, and the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons. The impact of such dependencies on the accuracy of the spectrum and dynamics obtained from a Hamiltonian computation is examined, and the (classical) computational-resource requirements given these considerations are studied. Besides the well-known angular-momentum formulation of the theory, the cases of purely fermionic and purely bosonic formulations (with open boundary conditions) and the loop-string-hadron formulation are analyzed, along with a brief discussion of a quantum-link-model formulation of the same theory. Clear advantages are found in working with the loop-string-hadron framework which implements non-Abelian Gauss's laws a priori using a complete set of gauge-invariant operators. It is argued that the substantially reduced cost of simulation within the loop-string-hadron formulation compared with the angular-momentum basis has implications for more efficient and robust quantum simulations of the same theory. Future studies will extend this investigation to the analysis of resource requirements for quantum simulations of non-Abelian LGT, with the goal of shedding light on the most efficient Hamiltonian formulation of gauge theories of relevance in nature.

TI Problem-specific classical optimization of Hamiltonian simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonequilibrium time evolution of large quantum systems is a strong candidate for quantum advantage. Variational quantum algorithms have been put forward for this task, but their quantum optimization routines suffer from trainability and sampling problems. Here, we present a classical preprocessing routine for variational Hamiltonian simulation that circumvents the need for a quantum optimization by expanding rigorous error bounds in a perturbative regime for suitable time steps. The resulting cost function is efficiently computable on a classical computer. We show that there always exists potential for optimization with respect to a Trotter sequence of the same order and that the cost value has the same scaling as Trotter in simulation time and system size. Unlike previous work on classical preprocessing, the method is applicable to any Hamiltonian system independent of locality and interaction lengths. Via numerical experiments for spin-lattice models, we find that our approach significantly improves digital quantum simulation capabilities with respect to Trotter sequences for the same resources. For short times, we find accuracy improvements of more than three orders of magnitude for our method as compared to Trotter sequences of the same gate number. Moreover, for a given gate number and accuracy target, we find that the preoptimization we introduce enables simulation times that are consistently more than ten times longer for a target accuracy of 0.1%.

TI High photon-phonon pair generation rate in a two-dimensional
   optomechanical crystal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated optomechanical systems are a leading platform for manipulating, sensing, and distributing quantum information, but are limited by residual optical heating. Here, we demonstrate a two-dimensional optomechanical crystal (OMC) geometry with increased thermal anchoring and a mechanical mode at 7.4 GHz, well aligned with the operation range of cryogenic microwave hardware and piezoelectric transducers. The eight times better thermalization than current one-dimensional OMCs, large optomechanical coupling rates, g(0)/2 pi approximate to 880 kHz, and high optical quality factors, Q(opt) = 2.4 x 10(5), allow ground-state cooling (n(m) = 0.32) of the acoustic mode from 3 K and entering the optomechanical strong-coupling regime. In pulsed sideband asymmetry measurements, we show ground-state operation (n(m) < 0.45) at temperatures below 10 mK, with repetition rates up to 3 MHz, generating photon-phonon pairs at approximate to 147 kHz. Our results extend optomechanical system capabilities and establish a robust foundation for future microwave-to-optical transducers with entanglement rates exceeding state-of-the-art superconducting qubit decoherence rates.

TI Reminiscence of Classical Chaos in Driven Transmons
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Transmon qubits are ubiquitously used in superconducting quantum information processor architectures. Strong drives are required to realize fast, high-fidelity, gates and measurements, including parametrically activated processes. Here, we show that even off-resonant drives, in regimes routinely used in experiments, can cause strong modifications to the structure of the transmon spectrum rendering a large part of it chaotic. Accounting for the full nonlinear dynamics of the transmon in a Floquet-Markov formalism, we find that these chaotic states, often neglected through the hypothesis that the anharmonicity is weak, strongly impact the lifetime of the transmon's computational states. In particular, we observe that chaos-assisted quantum phase slips greatly enhance band dispersions. In the presence of a measurement resonator, we find that approaching chaotic behavior correlates with strong transmon-resonator hybridization, and an average resonator response centered on the bare resonator frequency. These results lead to a photon-number threshold characterizing the appearance of chaos-induced quantum demolition effects during strong-drive operations, such as dispersive qubit readout. The phenomena described here are expected to be present in all circuits based on low-impedance Josephson junctions.

TI Low-energy subband wave-functions and effective g-factor of
   one-dimensional hole gas
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB One-dimensional (1D) hole gas confined in a cylindrical Ge nanowire has potential applications in quantum information technologies. Here, we analytically study the low-energy properties of this 1D hole gas. The subbands of the hole gas are two-fold degenerate. The low-energy subband wave-functions are obtained exactly, and the degenerate pairs are related to each other via a combination of the time-reversal and the spin-rotation transformations. In evaluating the effective g-factor of these low-energy subbands, the orbital effects of the magnetic field are shown to contribute as strongly as the Zeeman term. Also, near the center of the k ( z ) space, there is a sharp dip or a sharp peak in the effective g-factor. At the site k ( z ) = 0, the longitudinal g-factor g (l) is much less than the transverse g-factor g (t) for the lowest subband, while away from the site k ( z ) = 0, g (l) can be comparable to g (t).

TI Local two-atom correlations induced by a two-mode cavity under nonlinear
   media: Quantum uncertainty and quantum Fisher information
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The nonlinearity effect on the various formed quantum correlations between two atoms interacting locally with a bimodal cavity is explored in this work. The local quantum Fisher information, local quantum uncertainty, and negativity are used to investigate the quantum correlation's sensitivity to the cavity modes characteristics. It is demonstrated that when the ratio of the Stark shift of the two modes increases, the atomic quantum correlations rise. During the time intervals of sudden death negativity entanglement, the three two-atom correlation quantifiers reveal that the two-atom system can contain local Fisher information and local uncertainty correlations. The Stark shift may be utilized to amplify the produced atomic correlation, while the Kerr-like medium can be used to suppress it. The regularity, the amount of generated atomic correlations, and their immunity to the Stark shift as well as the Kerr-like medium non-linearities are improved when the mean photon number is increased. As a result, the cavity modes' nonlinear parameters might be utilized as a controller to optimize atomic quantum correlations.

TI Irreversibility in an Optical Parametric Driven Optomechanical System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study investigates the role of nonlinearity via optical parametric oscillator on the entropy production rate and quantum correlations in a hybrid optomechanical system. Specifically, the modified entropy production rate of an optical parametric oscillator placed in the optomechanical cavity is derived, which is well described by the two-mode Gaussian state. The irreversibility and quantum mutual information associated with the driving the system far from equilibrium are found to be controlled by the phase and strength of nonlinearity. This analysis shows that the system entropy flow, heating, or cooling, are determined by choosing the appropriate phase of the self-induced nonlinearity. It is further demonstrated that this effect persists for a reasonable range of cavity decay rate.
   The impact of nonlinearity on irreversibility and quantum correlations is investigated using an optical parametric oscillator within an optomechanical system. The adjustment of nonlinearity's phase and strength influences the entropy production and quantum mutual information when the system is driven out-of-equilibrium. This effect governs the system's entropy flow, allowing either heating or cooling within a reasonable range of cavity decay rate.image

TI Unconventional Quantum Sound-Matter Interactions in
   Spin-Optomechanical-Crystal Hybrid Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We predict a set of unusual quantum acoustic phenomena resulting from sound-matter interactions in a fully tunable solid-state platform in which an array of solid-state spins in diamond are coupled to quantized acoustic waves in a one-dimensional optomechanical crystal. We find that, by using a spatially varying laser drive that introduces a position-dependent phase in the optomechanical interaction, the mechanical band structure can be tuned in situ, consequently leading to unconventional quantum sound-matter interactions. We show that quasichiral sound-matter interactions can occur, with tunable ranges from bidirectional to quasiunidirectional, when the spins are resonant with the hands. When the solid-state spin frequency lies within the acoustic band gap, we demonstrate the emergence of an exotic polariton bound state that can mediate long-range tunable, odd-neighbor, and complex spin-spin interactions. This work expands the present exploration of quantum phononics and can have wide applications in quantum simulations and quantum information processing.

TI Joint generation-transmission expansion planning in renewables-dominated
   power systems based on hybrid quantum-classical computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB The joint generation-transmission expansion planning (JGTEP) problem offers a broader range of feasible strategies than unilateral planning and enables more favorable cost-benefit outcomes in renewables-dominated power systems. However, it also imposes heavier computational burdens due to the proliferation of binary variables from generation units and transmission networks, as well as slower convergence caused by nonlinear, spatiotemporal coupling constraints. Leveraging the quantum tunneling effect, quantum annealing provides significant efficiency advantages in handling large-scale binary problems, while classical computing remains superior for continuous optimization and binary variable initialization. This complementarity motivates a hybrid quantum-classical framework to accelerate JGTEP. Specifically, the problem is first decomposed into a master problem and a subdual problem using Benders decomposition. A classical computer then generates multiple feasible solutions for the master problem, from which an initial warm-start solution is constructed, and the dimensionality of variables is reduced by exploiting the shared characteristics of these solutions. The master problem is subsequently reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model, which is efficiently solved on a quantum annealer using a warm-start quantum annealing algorithm. Finally, the master problem and subproblem are solved iteratively until convergence. Applied to the IEEE RTS 24-bus system, the proposed quantum-assisted method achieves more than a 70% reduction in computation time and a 50% decrease in iterations compared with classical methods, while also demonstrating strong potential for tackling larger-scale planning problems.

TI Cavity-enhanced microwave readout of a solid-state spin sensor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Overcoming poor readout is an increasingly urgent challenge for devices based on solid-state spin defects, particularly given their rapid adoption in quantum sensing, quantum information, and tests of fundamental physics. However, in spite of experimental progress in specific systems, solid-state spin sensors still lack a universal, high-fidelity readout technique. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity, room-temperature readout of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers via strong coupling to a dielectric microwave cavity, building on similar techniques commonly applied in cryogenic circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics. This strong collective interaction allows the spin ensemble's microwave transition to be probed directly, thereby overcoming the optical photon shot noise limitations of conventional fluorescence readout. Applying this technique to magnetometry, we show magnetic sensitivity approaching the Johnson-Nyquist noise limit of the system. Our results pave a clear path to achieve unity readout fidelity of solid-state spin sensors through increased ensemble size, reduced spin-resonance linewidth, or improved cavity quality factor. Conventional optical readout limits the sensitivity of solid state spin sensors due to photon shot noise and poor contrast. Here, the authors demonstrate room-temperature microwave detection of an ensemble of NV centers embedded in a microwave cavity, which offers high-fidelity readout without time overhead.

TI Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schrödinger
   cat qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this paper, we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr & ouml;dinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr & ouml;dinger cat qubits are operated under nonequilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize cat states, which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.

TI Implementing a polarisation-sensitive sensor in a plug-and-play QKD
   system
SO OPTO-ELECTRONICS REVIEW
AB We present the results of simplified polarimetric methods for detecting disturbances on a fibre-optic link in a quantum key distribution system. The proposed methods use a polarisation coupler and a single polariser as a polarisation-sensitive detection system. The effectiveness of the disturbance detection was considered in a plug-and-play quantum key distribution system with phase encoding. This paper compares the performance of two simplified methods for determining changes in the state of polarisation in response to three types of disturbances, including touching, bending, and inserting a clip-on coupler. Also, the results of an experiment involving the entire procedure of introducing eavesdropping into a telecommunications fibre-optic cable are presented. The results of the measurements indicate the subsequent steps when attacking a fibre-optic cable. This article shows that a simplified polarisation-sensitive sensor can be implemented into a quantum key distribution system to detect disturbances and eavesdropping attempts, as well as enhance the security of the system.

We derive broadly applicable criteria for quantum non-Gaussian two-photon coincidences that certify a new quality of photon sources. The criteria reject states emerging from Gaussian parametric processes, which often limit applications in quantum technologies. We also analyze the robustness of the quantum non-Gaussian coincidences and compare it to the heralded quantum non-Gaussianity of single photons based on them.

TI Nanoscale Gap-Plasmon-Enhanced Superconducting Photon Detectors at
   Single-Photon Level
SO NANO LETTERS
AB With a growing demand for detecting light at the single-photon level in various fields, researchers are focused on optimizing the performance of superconducting single-photon detectors (SSPDs) by using multiple approaches. However, input light coupling for visible light has remained a challenge in the development of efficient SSPDs. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel system that integrates NbN superconducting microwire photon detectors (SMPDs) with gap-plasmon resonators to improve the photon detection efficiency to 98% while preserving all detector performance features, such as polarization insensitivity. The plasmonic SMPDs exhibit a hot-belt effect that generates a nonlinear photoresponse in the visible range operated at 9 K (similar to 0.64T(c)), resulting in a 233-fold increase in phonon-electron interaction factor (gamma) compared to pristine SMPDs at resonance under CW illumination. These findings open up new opportunities for ultrasensitive single-photon detection in areas like quantum information processing, quantum optics, imaging, and sensing at visible wavelengths.

TI The effect of classical optimizers and Ansatz depth on QAOA performance
   in noisy devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm for Near-term Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers (NISQ) providing approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The QAOA utilizes a quantum-classical loop, consisting of a quantum ansatz and a classical optimizer, to minimize some cost function, computed on the quantum device. This paper presents an investigation into the impact of realistic noise on the classical optimizer and the determination of optimal circuit depth for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the presence of noise. We find that, while there is no significant difference in the performance of classical optimizers in a state vector simulation, the Adam and AMSGrad optimizers perform best in the presence of shot noise. Under the conditions of real noise, the SPSA optimizer, along with ADAM and AMSGrad, emerge as the top performers. The study also reveals that the quality of solutions to some 5 qubit minimum vertex cover problems increases for up to around six layers in the QAOA circuit, after which it begins to decline. This analysis shows that increasing the number of layers in the QAOA in an attempt to increase accuracy may not work well in a noisy device.

TI Scalable and Tunable Diamond Nanostructuring Process for Nanoscale NMR
   Applications
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Nanostructuring of a bulk material is used to change its mechanical, optical, and electronic properties and to enable many new applications. We present a scalable fabrication technique that enables the creation of densely packed diamond nanopillars for quantum technology applications. The process yields tunable feature sizes without the employment of lithographic techniques. High-aspect-ratio pillars are created through oxygen-plasma etching of diamond with a dewetted palladium film as an etch mask. We demonstrate an iterative renewal of the palladium etch mask, by which the initial mask thickness is not the limiting factor for the etch depth. Following the process, 300-400 million densely packed 100 nm wide and 1 mu m tall diamond pillars were created on a 3 x 3 mm(2) diamond sample. The fabrication technique is tailored specifically to enable applications and research involving quantum coherent defect center spins in diamond, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which are widely used in quantum science and engineering. To demonstrate the compatibility of our technique with quantum sensing, NV centers are created in the nanopillar sidewalls and are used to sense H-1 nuclei in liquid wetting the nanostructured surface. This nanostructuring process is an important element for enabling the wide-scale implementation of NV-driven magnetic resonance imaging or NV-driven NMR.

TI Symmetric quantum joint measurements on multiple qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the generalization of symmetric quantum joint measurements on multiple qubits. We first describe a method for constructing a symmetric joint measurement basis for three qubits by utilizing single-qubit states corresponding to the four vertices of an isohedral tetrahedron on the Bloch sphere. We then demonstrate the expected tetrahedral symmetry of the current measurement basis and discuss its application in a trilocal star-shaped network. This architecture enables us to generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to an n-qubit version, preserving the tetrahedral or hexahedral symmetry.

TI Optimized continuous dynamical decoupling via differential geometry and
   machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a strategy to develop optimally designed fields for continuous dynamical decoupling. Using our methodology, we obtain the optimal continuous field configuration to maximize the fidelity of a general one-qubit quantum gate. To achieve this, considering dephasing-noise perturbations, we employ an auxiliary qubit instead of the boson bath to implement a purification scheme, which results in unitary dynamics. Employing the sub-Riemannian geometry framework for the two-qubit unitary group, we derive and numerically solve the geodesic equations, obtaining the optimal time-dependent control Hamiltonian. Also, due to the extended time required to find solutions to the geodesic equations, we train a neural network on a subset of geodesic solutions, enabling us to promptly generate the time-dependent control Hamiltonian for any desired gate, which is crucial in circuit optimization.

TI Broadband generation and tomography of non-Gaussian states for
   ultra-fast optical quantum processors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information processors benefit from high clock frequencies to fully harness quantum advantages before they are lost to decoherence. All-optical systems offer unique benefits due to their inherent 100-THz carrier frequency, enabling the development of THz-clock frequency processors. However, the bandwidth of quantum light sources and measurement devices has been limited to the MHz range, with nonclassical state generation rates in the kHz range. In this study, we demonstrated broadband generation and quantum tomography of non-Gaussian states using an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) as a squeezed light source and an optical phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA). Our system includes a 6-THz squeezed-light source, a 6-THz PSA, and a 66-GHz homodyne detector. We successfully generated non-Gaussian states at a 0.9 MHz rate with sub-nanosecond wave packets using a continuous-wave laser. The performance is currently limited by the jitter of superconducting detectors, restricting the usable bandwidth to 1 GHz. Our technique extends the bandwidth to GHz, potentially increasing non-Gaussian state generation rates for practical optical quantum processors using OPAs.
   The use of optical phase sensitive amplifiers (PSA) has been shown to allow fast quantum tomography of Gaussian states, but non-Gaussian states are a key component for quantum computation using optical continuous-variable systems. Here, the authors extend PSA-enhanced high-bandwidth homodyne detection to non-Gaussian states.

TI Geometric Aspects of Mixed Quantum States Inside the Bloch Sphere
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB When studying the geometry of quantum states, it is acknowledged that mixed states can be distinguished by infinitely many metrics. Unfortunately, this freedom causes metric-dependent interpretations of physically significant geometric quantities such as the complexity and volume of quantum states. In this paper, we present an insightful discussion on the differences between the Bures and the Sj & ouml;qvist metrics inside a Bloch sphere. First, we begin with a formal comparative analysis between the two metrics by critically discussing three alternative interpretations for each metric. Second, we explicitly illustrate the distinct behaviors of the geodesic paths on each one of the two metric manifolds. Third, we compare the finite distances between an initial state and the final mixed state when calculated with the two metrics. Interestingly, in analogy with what happens when studying the topological aspects of real Euclidean spaces equipped with distinct metric functions (for instance, the usual Euclidean metric and the taxicab metric), we observe that the relative ranking based on the concept of a finite distance between mixed quantum states is not preserved when comparing distances determined with the Bures and the Sj & ouml;qvist metrics. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion on the consequences of this violation of a metric-based relative ranking on the concept of the complexity and volume of mixed quantum states.

TI Enhancing the direct charging performance of an open quantum battery by
   adjusting its velocity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The performance of open quantum batteries (QBs) is severely limited by decoherence due to the interaction with the surrounding environment. So, protecting the charging processes against decoherence is of great importance for realizing QBs. In this work we address this issue by developing a charging process of a qubit-based open QB composed of a qubit-battery and a qubit-charger, where each qubit moves inside an independent cavity reservoir. Our results show that, in both the Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, the charging characteristics, including the charging energy, efficiency and ergotropy, regularly increase with increasing the speed of charger and battery qubits. Interestingly, when the charger and battery move with higher velocities, the initial energy of the charger is completely transferred to the battery in the Markovian dynamics. In this situation, it is possible to extract the total stored energy as work for a long time. Our findings show that open moving-qubit systems are robust and reliable QBs, thus making them a promising candidate for experimental implementations.

TI Detecting Bell nonlocality based on weak Hardy-like paradoxes and
   Hardy-Bell inequalities
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Bell nonlocality is a special quantum nonlocality and has emerged as an important resource in quantum information processing tasks. Typically, there are two types of strategies for testing the Bell nonlocality: the Bell inequality method and the "all-versus-nothing proof", the later includes methods such as the GHZ argument and Hardy paradox. The objective of this work is to provide new methods for detecting Bell nonlocality by understanding Hardy-like paradoxes (HLPs) and Hardy-Bell inequalities (HBIs) as well as Hardy inequality. First, the weak HLP (WHLP) is established, and an HBI is obtained for tripartite correlation tensors (CTs) with two inputs and two outcomes. Based on an existing Hardy inequality for an n-qubit pure state, a Hardy inequality is proven for n-partite Bell local CTs. Second, the WHLP and HBI are proven for tripartite states in terms of conditional probabilities. Our WHLP is theoretically and practically easier to construct and more efficient in checking Bell nonlocality compared to the usual HLP.

TI Enhancement of entanglement concentration using catalysts
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Auxiliary pure quantum entangled states shared between two parties can act as catalysts in bipartite entanglement transformations. The participation of a catalyst state in the transformation can enhance its success probability. We consider transformations involving entanglement concentration of a finite number of copies of arbitrary two-qubit pure states into a single copy of a maximally entangled two-qubit pure state using bipartite local quantum operations and classical communication aided by a catalyst state. We show the enhancement of success probabilities of the catalyst-assisted procedure compared to the case where no catalysts are used. The optimal two-qubit catalyst and the maximum probability of the transformation using such catalysts can be obtained analytically. The enhancement of concentration success probability using catalysts of higher dimensions is demonstrated numerically. Finally, catalyst aided strategies for obtaining multiple maximally entangled two-qubit states are discussed.

As explicit examples, we compute the guesswork for any qubit regular polygonal and polyhedral ensemble.

TI Telecom-band hyperentangled photon pairs from a fiber-based source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hyperentanglement, the simultaneous and independent entanglement of quantum particles in multiple degrees of freedom, is a powerful resource that can be harnessed for efficient quantum information processing. In photonic systems, the two degrees of freedom (DOFs) often used to carry quantum and classical information are polarization and frequency, thanks to their robustness in transmission, both in free space and in optical fibers. Telecom-band hyperentangled photons generated in optical fibers are of particular interest because they are compatible with existing fiber-optic infrastructure and can be distributed over fiber networks with minimal loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of telecom-band biphotons hyperentangled in both the polarization and frequency DOFs using a periodically poled silica fiber and observe entanglement concurrences above 0.95 for both polarization and frequency DOFs. Furthermore, by concatenating a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference test for frequency entanglement and full state tomography for polarization entanglement in a single experiment, we can demonstrate simultaneous entanglement in both the polarization and frequency DOFs. The states produced by our hyperentanglement source can enable protocols such as dense coding and high-dimensional quantum key distribution.

TI Entanglement transition and heterogeneity in long-range quadratic
   Lindbladians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The generation of entanglement in mixed states is relevant to quantum systems coupled to an environment. The dissipative and mixing properties of the environment are unavoidable in physical platforms for quantum simulation and information processing, where entanglement can be a vital resource. In this work, we explore entanglement and heterogeneity in random Lindbladian dynamics describing open quantum systems. We propose a model of a one-dimensional chain of noninteracting, spinless fermions coupled to a local ensemble of baths. The jump operator mediating the interaction with the bath linked to each site has a power -law tail with an exponent p. We show that the system undergoes volume -to -area law entanglement phase transition in the mixed steady state by tuning p which remains stable in the presence of coherent hopping. Unlike the entanglement transition in the pure -state quantum trajectories of open systems, this transition is exhibited by the averaged steady-state density matrix of the Lindbladian. The steady state in the area -law phase is characterized by a spatial heterogeneity in local population imbalance, while the jump operators exhibit a constant participation ratio of the sites they affect. Our work provides a theoretical description of an entanglement transition realized in long -ranged open quantum systems and provides an avenue to stabilize quantum correlations in mixed states.

TI Optimized implementation of SMAUG-T on resource-constrained 16-bit
   MSP430 MCU
SO ICT EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we present an optimized implementation of SMAUG-T, one of Round 2 Key Encapsulation Mechanism algorithms in Korean Post-quantum Cryptography Competition, on a widely used 16-bit MSP430 MCU. To achieve performance efficiency of polynomial multiplication, one of the most time-consuming operations in SMAUG-T, we find the optimal method by investigating several latest algorithms such as the Toom-Cook method and the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT)-based methods (32-bit single moduli version and 16-bit multi-moduli version). Through the investigation, we found that 32-bit single moduli version is the best approach for polynomial multiplication in SMAUG-T on 16-bit MSP430 MCU. To enhance the performance of NTT-based polynomial multiplication, we proposed an improved 32-bit signed Montgomery multiplication method with a newly found Montgomery prime (0x250001) and the intrinsic hardware multiplier. We also apply the state-of-the-art techniques for NTT and inverse NTT (iNTT) such as the layer merging, CT butterfly by tuning them proper to the target device. As a result, our NTT implementation achieves around 35% of improved performance compared to the previous best result of 32-bit single moduli version implementation proposed for Dilithium on 16-bit MSP430 MCU. Finally, our SMAUG-T implementation with the proposed NTT implementation provides 43%-63%, 92%-99%, and 85%-95% of improved performance for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation compared to the reference implementation, respectively.

TI Dynamics of Hole Singlet-Triplet Qubits with Large g-Factor Differences
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The spin-orbit interaction permits to control the state of a spin qubit via electric fields. For holes it is particularly strong, allowing for fast all electrical qubit manipulation, and yet an in-depth understanding of this interaction in hole systems is missing. Here we investigate, experimentally and theoretically, the effect of the cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the mixing of the spin states by studying singlet-triplet oscillations in a planar Ge hole double quantum dot. Landau-Zener sweeps at different magnetic field directions allow us to disentangle the effects of the spin-orbit induced spin-flip term from those caused by strongly site-dependent and anisotropic quantum dot g tensors. Our work, therefore, provides new insights into the hole spin-orbit interaction, necessary for optimizing future qubit experiments.

TI Partial Independence Suffices to Rule Out Real Quantum Theory
   Experimentally
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The role of complex quantities in quantum theory has been puzzling physicists since the beginnings. It is, thus, natural to ask whether, in order to describe our experiments, the mathematical structure of the complex Hilbert spaces it is built on is really necessary. Recently, it was shown that this structure is inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. More precisely, Real Quantum Theory cannot explain the predictions of (Complex) Quantum Theory [Renou et al., Nature (London) 600, 625 (2021).]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of Real Quantum Theory. We derive a tradeoff between source independence and the Bell value achievable in Real Quantum Theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments by means of real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of Real Quantum Theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature (London) 600, 625 (2021).]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of Real Quantum Theory by allowing the sources to share an m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.

TI An Example of Parallel Merkle Tree Traversal: Post-Quantum
   Leighton-Micali Signature on the GPU
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB The hash-based signature (HBS) is the most conservative and time-consuming among many post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. Two HBSs, LMS and XMSS, are the only PQC algorithms standardised by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) now. Existing HBSs are designed based on serial Merkle tree traversal, which is not conducive to taking full advantage of the computing power of parallel architectures such as CPUs and GPUs. We propose a parallel Merkle tree traversal (PMTT), which is tested by implementing LMS on the GPU. This is the first work accelerating LMS on the GPU, which performs well even with over 10,000 cores. Considering different scenarios of algorithmic parallelism and data parallelism, we implement corresponding variants for PMTT. The design of PMTT for algorithmic parallelism mainly considers the execution efficiency of a single task, while that for data parallelism starts with the full utilisation of GPU performance. In addition, we are the first to design a CPU-GPU collaborative processing solution for traversal algorithms to reduce the communication overhead between CPU and GPU. For algorithmic parallelism, our implementation is still 4.48x x faster than the ideal time of the state-of-the-art traversal algorithm. For data parallelism, when the number of cores increases from 1 to 8,192, the parallel efficiency is 78.39%. In comparison, our LMS implementation outperforms most existing LMS and XMSS implementations.

TI Hypercubic cluster states in he phase-modulated quantum optical
   frequency comb
SO OPTICA
AB We propose and fully analyze the simplest technique to date (to our knowledge) for generating light-based universal quantum computing resources, namely, 2D, 3D, and n-hypercubic duster states in general. The technique uses two standard optical components: first, a single optical parametric oscillator pumped below threshold by a monochromatic field, which generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states, a.k.a. two-mode squeezed states, over the quantum optical frequency comb; second, phase modulation at frequencies that are multiples of the comb spacing (via RF or optical means). The compactness of this technique paves the way to implementing quantum computing on chip using quantum nanophotonics.

TI Algebraic Bethe Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB The Algebraic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) is a highly successful analytical method used to exactly solve several physical models in both statistical mechanics and condensed-matter physics. Here we bring the ABA into unitary form, for its direct implementation on a quantum computer. This is achieved by distilling the non-unitary R matrices that make up the ABA into unitaries using the QR decomposition. Our algorithm is deterministic and works for both real and complex roots of the Bethe equations. We illustrate our method on the spin- 1 2 XX and XXZ models. We show that using this approach one can efficiently prepare eigenstates of the XX model on a quantum computer with quantum resources that match previous state-ofthe-art approaches. We run small-scale errormitigated implementations on the IBM quantum computers, including the preparation of the ground state for the XX and XXZ models on 4 sites. Finally, we derive a new form of the Yang-Baxter equation using unitary matrices, and also verify it on a quantum computer.

TI Charge noise suppression in capacitively coupled singlet-triplet spin
   qubits under magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Charge noise is the main hurdle preventing high-fidelity operation, in particular that of two-qubit gates, of semiconductor-quantum-dot-based spin qubits. While certain sweet spots where charge noise is substantially suppressed have been demonstrated in several types of spin qubits, the existence of one for coupled singlet-triplet qubits is unclear. We theoretically demonstrate, using full configuration-interaction calculations, that a range of nearly sweet spots appears in the coupled singlet-triplet qubit system when a strong enough magnetic field is applied externally. We further demonstrate that ramping to and from the judiciously chosen nearly sweet spot using sequences based on the shortcut to adiabaticity offers maximal gate fidelities under charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence. These results should facilitate realization of high-fidelity two-qubit gates in singlet-triplet qubit systems.

TI Dynamics of nonlocal correlation of two superconducting charge qubits
   induced by intrinsic decoherence
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The generated nonlocal correlations of two superconducting-charge (SCC) qubits including uncertainty- induced nonlocality (UIN), Bell-Horodecki nonlocality, and negativity's entanglement have been explored by intrinsic decoherence model. An initial separable two SCC-qubits state to study the generation of nonlocal correlations. By adjusting the intrinsic decoherence intensity and the two superconducting-qubits interaction parameters (of Josephson energies, the mutual two SCC-qubits coupling energy, and the difference between the Josephson SCC-qubit energies), we can control the produced maximum Bell-Horodecki nonlocality, UIN, and entanglement, which their dynamics align with the hierarchy principle. It is found that the generations of two-qubit states, having Bell-Horodecki nonlocality, UIN, and negativity entanglement, by the interactions of two SCC-qubits depend on their interaction parameters and intrinsic decoherence. For weak mutual two SCCqubits coupling energy and the Josephson SCC-qubit energies with a slight difference between the Josephson SCC-qubit energies, the generated two SCC-qubit state has strong nonlocal correlation dynamics. The mutual coupling energy for two SCC-qubits can enhance the generation of weak nonlocal correlation dynamics when there is a significant difference between the Josephson SCC-qubit energies. Controlling Josephson energy, mutual coupling, and the energy difference of SCC-qubits can improve nonlocal correlations' robustness against intrinsic decoherence.

TI Quantum Image Steganography Schemes for Data Hiding: A Survey

AB Quantum steganography plays a critical role in embedding confidential data into carrier messages using quantum computing schemes. The quantum variant of steganography outperforms its classical counterpart from security, embedding efficiency and capacity, imperceptibility, and time-complexity perspectives. Considerable work has been carried out in the literature focusing on quantum steganography. However, a holistic view of available schemes is missing. This paper provides an overview of latest advances in the field of quantum-steganography and image-steganography schemes. Moreover, the paper includes discussion of improvements made in the aforementioned fields, a brief explanation of the methodologies used for each presented algorithm, and a comparative study of existing schemes.

TI Steering Majorana braiding via skyrmion-vortex pairs: A scalable
   platform
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Majorana zero modes are quasiparticles that hold promise as building blocks for topological quantum computing. However, the litmus test for their detection, the observation of exotic non-Abelian statistics revealed by braiding, has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we take advantage of the fact that skyrmion-vortex pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet heterostructures harboring Majorana zero modes can be easily manipulated in two spatial dimensions. We adiabatically braid the hybrid topological structures and explicitly confirm the non-Abelian statistics of the Majorana zero modes numerically using a self-consistent calculation of the superconducting order parameter. Our proposal of controlling skyrmion-vortex pairs provides the necessary leeway toward a scalable topological quantum computing platform.

TI Graphical Framework for Non-Gaussian Quantum States
SO QUANTUM
AB We provide a graphical method to describe and analyze non-Gaussian quantum states using a hypergraph framework. These states are pivotal resources for quantum computing, communication, and metrology, but their characterization is hindered by their complex high-order correlations. The framework encapsulates transformation rules for a series of typical Gaussian unitary operation and local quadrature measurement, offering a visually intuitive tool for manipulating such states through experimentally feasible pathways. Notably, we develop methods for the generation of complex hyper graph states with more or higher-order hyperedges from simple structures through Gaussian operations only, facilitated by our graphical rules. We present illustrative examples on the preparation of non Gaussian states rooted in these graph based formalisms, revealing their potential to advance continuous-variable general quantum computing capabilities.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Convolutional Neural Network With Spatial Attention for
   Accurate Classification of Maternal-Fetal Planes in Ultrasound Images
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Antenatal ultrasound (US) examination is the primary mode of assessment in fetal development and is considered completely safe for both the mother and the baby. However, ultrasound scans are subject to disturbances by various factors, which complicate the fetal biometry measurements and demand more of the examiner's time. To enhance the diagnostic efficiency of fetal plane classification for detecting abnormalities and to optimize computational efficiency, a model utilizing quantum computation to accelerate processing speeds in a practical healthcare environment is proposed. A Hybrid Quantum-Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial Attention for Fetal Ultrasound Plane Classification (HQ-CNN-SA) is developed for accurate classification of maternal-fetal planes in ultrasound images is designed for two approaches: 1) classification of pre-processed low-resolution images using HQ-CNN-SA, and 2) extraction of deep features from high-resolution images by a deep learning model, followed by HQ-CNN-SA classification. It integrates quantum and classical convolution with attention techniques to classify maternal-fetal plane ultrasound images into six categories: maternal cervix, brain, abdomen, femur, thorax, and other. Experimental findings indicate that the low-resolution HQ-CNN-SA model achieves 93% classification accuracy,whereas the high-resolution deep feature-based HQ-CNN-SA scored 95.36% accuracy. Therefore, it effectively handles resolution variability in ultrasound images and improves the reliability of fetal plane classification by supporting more consistent clinical decision-making.

We introduce the Quantum Global Minimum Finder (QGMF), an innovative quantum computing approach that efficiently identifies global minima. QGMF combines binary search techniques to shift the objective function to a suitable position and then employs Variational Quantum Search to precisely locate the global minimum within this targeted subspace. Designed with a O(n)-depth circuit architecture, QGMF also utilize the logarithmic benefits of binary search to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work demonstrates the impact of QGMF in advancing the capabilities of quantum computing to overcome complex non-convex optimization challenges effectively.

TI DELEGATING SIGNING RIGHTS IN A MULTIVARIATE PROXY SIGNATURE SCHEME
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB In the context of digital signatures, the proxy signature holds a significant role of enabling an original signer to delegate its signing ability to another party (i.e., proxy signer). It has significant practical applications. Par-ticularly it is useful in distributed systems, where delegation of authentication rights is quite common. For example, key sharing protocol, grid computing, and mobile communications. Currently, a large portion of existing proxy sig -nature schemes are based on the hardness of problems like integer factoring, discrete logarithms, and/or elliptic curve discrete logarithms. However, with the rising of quantum computers, the problem of prime factorization and dis-crete logarithm will be solvable in polynomial-time, due to Shor's algorithm, which dilutes the security features of existing ElGamal, RSA, ECC, and the proxy signature schemes based on these problems. As a consequence, construc-tion of secure and efficient post-quantum proxy signature becomes necessary. In this work, we develop a post-quantum proxy signature scheme Mult-proxy, relying on multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC), which is one of the most promising candidates of post-quantum cryptography. We employ a 5 -pass identification protocol to design our proxy signature scheme. Our work attains the usual proxy criterion and a one-more-unforgeability criterion under the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic polynomial (MQ) problem. It pro-duces optimal size proxy signatures and optimal size proxy shares in the field of MPKC.

TI Contextuality and Wigner Negativity Are Equivalent for
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum computers promise considerable speedups with respect to their classical counterparts. However, the identification of the innately quantum features that enable these speedups is challenging. In the continuous-variable setting-a promising paradigm for the realization of universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computing-contextuality and Wigner negativity have been perceived as two such distinct resources. Here we show that they are in fact equivalent for the standard models of continuousvariable quantum computing. While our results provide a unifying picture of continuous-variable resources for quantum speedup, they also pave the way toward practical demonstrations of continuous-variable contextuality and shed light on the significance of negative probabilities in phase-space descriptions of quantum mechanics.

TI A Bayesian Approach for Characterizing and Mitigating Gate and
   Measurement Errors
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Various noise models have been developed in quantum computing study to describe the propagation and effect of the noise that is caused by imperfect implementation of hardware. Identifying parameters such as gate and readout error rates is critical to these models. We use a Bayesian inference approach to identify posterior distributions of these parameters such that they can be characterized more elaborately. By characterizing the device errors in this way, we can further improve the accuracy of quantum error mitigation. Experiments conducted on IBM's quantum computing devices suggest that our approach provides better error mitigation performance than existing techniques used by the vendor. Also, our approach outperforms the standard Bayesian inference method in some scenarios.

TI Foundational Algorithms for Modern Cybersecurity: A Unified Review on
   Defensive Computation in Adversarial Environments
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Cyber defense has evolved into an algorithmically intensive discipline where mathematical rigor and adaptive computation underpin the robustness and continuity of digital infrastructures. This review consolidates the algorithmic spectrum that supports modern cyber defense, from cryptographic primitives that ensure confidentiality and integrity to behavioral intelligence algorithms that provide predictive security. Classical symmetric and asymmetric schemes such as AES, ChaCha20, RSA, and ECC define the computational backbone of confidentiality and authentication in current systems. Intrusion and anomaly detection mechanisms range from deterministic pattern matchers exemplified by Aho-Corasick and Boyer-Moore to probabilistic inference models such as Markov Chains and HMMs, as well as deep architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and Autoencoders. Malware forensics combines graph theory, entropy metrics, and symbolic reasoning into a unified diagnostic framework, while network defense employs graph-theoretic algorithms for routing, flow control, and intrusion propagation. Behavioral paradigms such as reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence transform cyber defense from reactive automation to adaptive cognition. Hybrid architectures now merge deterministic computation with distributed learning and explainable inference to create systems that act, reason, and adapt. This review identifies and contextualizes over 50 foundational algorithms, ranging from AES and RSA to LSTMs, graph-based models, and post-quantum cryptography, and redefines them not as passive utilities, but as the cognitive genome of cyber defense: entities that shape, sustain, and evolve resilience within adversarial environments.

TI Tree-tensor-network classifiers for machine learning: From quantum
   inspired to quantum assisted
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We describe a quantum-assisted machine learning method in which multivariate data are encoded into quantum states in a Hilbert space whose dimension is exponentially large in the length of the data vector. Learning in this space occurs through applying a low-depth quantum circuit with a tree-tensor-network (TTN) topology acting as an unsupervised feature extractor to identify the most relevant quantum states in a data-driven fashion and then applying a supervised linear classifier encoding the class decision in a small-dimensional quantum register. We present tools for making TTN classifiers amenable to implementation on gate-based quantum computing devices, including an embedding map with accuracy similar to the recently defined exponential machines (A. Novikov et al., arXiv:1605.03795) but which produces valid quantum state embeddings of classical data vectors, and the use of manifold-based gradient optimization schemes to produce isometric operations mapping quantum states to a register of qubits defining a class decision. We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one-point and two-point correlation functions of the vectors defining the decision boundary of the quantum model, which can be used for model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining classification decisions from partial data vectors. Further, we show that the use of isometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability of the correlation functions extracted from the decision weights and may produce models that are less susceptible to adversarial perturbations. Finally, we discuss in detail the problem of compiling classically optimized isometric TTN models into unitary operations to be run on quantum computers and how isometric models requiring postselection on quantum hardware can be used to precondition variational Anstitze for models without postselection. We demonstrate our methodologies in applications utilizing the MNIST database of handwritten digits and a multivariate time-series data set of human activity recognition.

TI Teleportation-based continuous-variable quantum digital signature
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, a continuous-variable quantum digital signature (CV-QDS) protocol based on quantum telepor-tation (QT) is proposed, and the corresponding theoretical analysis method is established. Unlike previous schemes, we use squeezed states to carry key and secret information about the teleported states that are transmitted through classical and entangled channels without infinite squeezing. In addition, for multibit information signatures, we propose to use the mean and modulation variance of the teleported quantum state to distinguish signatures, and each of which is marked and ordered. In particular, we derive the fidelity that the protocol can achieve, displaying the effectiveness of the method at different compression levels. Security analysis demonstrates that the protocol possesses unforgeability, non-repudiation and robustness, which is suitable for signing one-bit and multibit messages.

TI Triggering and detecting topological photonic states via magnon-photon
   coupling in a one-dimensional cavity magnonics chain
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Artificial quantum systems have emerged as a crucial experimental platform for investigating topological states, thanks to their customizable structures and tunable parameters. Nevertheless, the exploration of topological photonic states within cavity magnonics systems has been somewhat limited, with only a handful of reports available on this topic. Here, we propose a novel scheme to trigger and detect topological photonic states in a one-dimensional (1D) cavity magnonics chain model, wherein a series of split-ring resonator (SRR) modes are interleaved with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the coupling between the SRR modes and the magnon modes is induced by electromagnetic interactions. By adjusting the system parameters, we found that not only can different topological properties and topological quantum channels be triggered, but topological invariants can also undergo phase transition processes. Furthermore, we study the average photon number and the winding number of the reflection coefficient phase (WNRCP) to detect the topological photonic states and determine the topological invariants of the system. Additionally, considering the impact of defects on topological characteristics, we found that the system is protected by topology, making the edge states robust against defects. This work provides a breakthrough method for studying topological photonic states, paves the way for developing advanced magnon-based quantum devices and information processing systems.

TI Exploring design patterns in quantum software: a case study
SO COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing holds great promise for solving complex problems that classical computing cannot address, with applications in various industries and sectors. However, developing efficient quantum software remains a challenge. Quantum software engineering (QSE) has emerged to address this, adapting classical software engineering practices for quantum systems. Design patterns, widely used in classical software, can provide reusable solutions for common quantum development issues, but their use in quantum software remains underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the use of design patterns in 2610 Qiskit programs from GitHub. Using the QCPD Tool to detect four design patterns (initialization, superposition, entanglement, and oracle) and QMetrics to compute software metrics, the study creates a dataset linking patterns with code characteristics. Three research questions guide the study: RQ1 examines the prevalence of design patterns in quantum software, RQ2 explores the relationship between design patterns and code metrics, and RQ3 analyzes the combinations of patterns that occur together. The findings provide insights into quantum software development, offering developers practical guidance on applying specific patterns. The results contribute to QSE by revealing key relationships between patterns and metrics, which can inform future research and tool development. These findings support improved performance, maintainability, and scalability, fostering the broader adoption of quantum computing.

TI Quantum planning for swarm robotics
SO ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
AB Computational resources of quantum computing can enhance robotic motion, decision making, and path planning. While the quantum paradigm is being applied to individual robots, its approach to swarms of simple and interacting robots remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between swarm robotics and quantum computing, in the framework of a search and rescue mission. We focus on a decision-making and path-planning collective task. Thus, we present a quantum-based path-planning algorithm for a swarm of robots. Quantization enters position and reward information (measured as a robot's proximity to the target) and path-planning decisions. Pairwise information-exchange is modeled through a logic gate, implemented with a quantum circuit. Path planning draws upon Grover's search algorithm, implemented with another quantum circuit. Our case study involves a search and rescue scenario, inspired by ant-foraging behavior in nature, as an example of swarm intelligence. We show that our method outperforms two ant-behavior simulations, in NetLogo and Java, respectively, presenting a faster convergence to the target, represented here by the source of food. This study can shed light on future applications of quantum computing to swarm robotics. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High-Performance NTRU Accelerator Using a Direct Memory Access
   Controller
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB NTRU is a well-established and widely used public-key cryptography. It has been standardized in IEEE Std1363.1 and X9.98, and its variant was submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization contest. In this study, we proposed a high-performance accelerator implementation of the recent NTRU version submitted to the NIST PQC contest. In NTRU, there are two types of polynomials: ternary polynomial (TP) that has coefficients in {-1, 0, 1}, and non-TP. In contrast to previous methods that support both multiplication of a TP and a non-TP and multiplication of non-TPs, the proposed accelerator performs only multiplication of non-TPs by converting a TP to a non-TP in advance. We also leveraged a direct memory access controller and simplified the definitions of the polynomial registers. Consequently, we reduced the latency, data transfer time, and resources, such as the need for a large number of registers and multiplexers. We synthesized the accelerator using 28-nm CMOS process technology. The results showed that the accelerator can perform encryption and decryption within 0.8 and 1.8 mu s, respectively, at the maximum clock frequency of 1.67 GHz, requiring 494.9 k gate counts. Furthermore, the proposed accelerator demonstrated a higher performance with fewer resources than the existing accelerators.

TI Design and Implementation of a Post-Quantum Group Authenticated Key
   Exchange Protocol With the LibOQS Library: A Comparative Performance
   Analysis From Classic McEliece, Kyber, NTRU, and Saber
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Group authenticated key exchange protocols (GAKE) are cryptographic tools enabling a group of several users communicating through an insecure channel to securely establish a common shared high-entropy key. In the last years, the need to design cryptographic tools which provide security in the presence of attackers with access to quantum resources has become unquestionable; the field dealing with these types of protocols is usually referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography. The U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) launched in 2017 an open call to find suitable post-quantum public-key algorithms for standardization. In this work, we design a GAKE that can be instantiated with any key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that satisfies the strong security notion IND-CCA, matching NIST's requirements for this primitive. We have implemented our GAKE with the four finalist KEMs from the NIST process: Classic McEliece, Kyber, NTRU, and Saber, making use of the open-source library LibOQS where these algorithms are provided. We have conducted a detailed comparative performance analysis of the resulting GAKE protocols, taking into account all the parameter sets proposed in the submissions. We have also made a performance analysis of all the involved building pieces, including the four finalist KEMs. Finally, we also compare our GAKE with a previous proposal implemented with Kyber.

AB Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, but quantum software development faces significant challenges, including a steep learning curve, high hardware error rates, and a lack of mature engineering practices. This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

TI Quantum non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum communication can realize secure information transmission based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Photon is a crucial information carrier in quantum communication. The photonic quantum communication protocols require the transmission of photons or photonic entanglement between communicating parties. However, in this process, photon transmission loss inevitably occurs due to environmental noise. Photon transmission loss significantly reduces the efficiency of quantum communication and even threatens its security, so that it becomes a major obstacle for practical long-distance quantum communication. Quantum noiseless linear amplification (NLA) is a promising method for mitigating photon transmission loss. Through local operations and post-selection, NLA can effectively increase the fidelity of the target state or the average photon number in the output state while perfectly preserving the encoded information of the target state. As a result, employing NLA technology can effectively overcome photon transmission loss and extend the secure communication distance. In this paper, the existing NLA protocols are categorized into two types, i.e. the NLA protocols in DV quantum systems and CV quantum systems. A detailed introduction is given to the quantum scissor (QS)-based NLA protocols for single photons, single-photon polarization qubits, and single-photon spatial entanglement in the DV quantum systems. The QS-based NLA can effectively increase the fidelity of the target states while perfectly preserving its encodings. In recent years, researchers have made efforts to study various improvements to the QS-based NLA protocols. In the CV quantum systems, researchers have adopted parallel multiple QS structure and generalized QS to increase the average photon numbers of the Fock states, coherent states and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In addition to theoretical advancements, significant progress has also been made in the experimental implementations of NLA. The representative experimental demonstrations of QS-based NLA protocols are summarized. Finally, the future development directions for NLA to facilitate its practical applications are presented. This review can provide theoretical support for practically developing NLA in the future.

Many studies have been done to accelerate polynomial multiplication with newly developed hardware accelerators or special CPU instructions. However, another method utilizes previously implemented and commercial hardware accelerators for RSA/elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Reusing an existing hardware accelerator is advantageous, not only for the cost benefit but also for the improvement in performance. In this case, the developer should adopt the most efficient implementation method for the functions provided by a given legacy hardware accelerator. It is difficult to find an optimized implementation for a given hardware accelerator because there are a variety of methods, and each method depends on the functions provided by the given accelerator. In order to solve the problem, we survey methods for polynomial multiplication using RSA/ECC coprocessors and their application for Learning With Error (LWE)-based KEM algorithms of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC round 3 candidates. We implement all known methods for polynomial multiplication with RSA/ECC coprocessors in a platform, commercial mobile system-on-chip (SoC), the Exynos2100 Smart Secure Platform (SSP). We present and analyze the simulation results for various legacy hardware accelerators and give guidance for optimized implementation.

TI Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design of Split-Radix Discrete Galois
   Transformation for KyberKEM
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING
AB KyberKEM is one of the final round key encapsulation mechanisms in the NIST post-quantum cryptography competition. Number theoretic transform (NTT), as the computing bottleneck of KyberKEM, has been widely studied. Discrete Galois Transformation (DGT) is a variant of NTT that reduces transform length into half but requires more multiplication operations than the latest NTT algorithm in theoretical analysis. This paper proposes the split-radix DGT, a novel DGT variant utilizing the split-radix method, to reduce the computing complexity without compromising the transform length. Specifically, for length-128 polynomial, the split-radix DGT algorithm saves at least 10% multiplication operations compared with the latest NTT algorithm in theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we proposed a unified split-radix DGT processor with the dedicated stream permutation network for KyberKEM and implemented it on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. The processor achieves at least 49.4% faster transformation and 65.3% faster component-wise multiplication, with at most 87% and 32% LUT-NTT area-time product and LUT-CWM area-time product, compared with the state-of-the-art polynomial multipliers in KyberKEM with the same BFU setting on similar platforms. Lastly, we designed a highly efficient KyberKEM architecture using the proposed split-radix DGT processor. The implementation results on Artix-7 FPGA show significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art KyberKEM designs.

TI Towards High-Performance Supersingular Isogeny Cryptographic Hardware
   Accelerator Design
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Cryptosystems based on supersingular isogeny are a novel tool in post-quantum cryptography. One compelling characteristic is their concise keys and ciphertexts. However, the performance of supersingular isogeny computation is currently worse than that of other schemes. This is primarily due to the following factors. Firstly, the underlying field is a quadratic extension of the finite field, resulting in higher computational complexity. Secondly, the strategy for large-degree isogeny evaluation is complex and dependent on the elementary arithmetic units employed. Thirdly, adapting the same hardware to different parameters is challenging. Considering the evolution of similar curve-based cryptosystems, we believe proper algorithm optimization and hardware acceleration will reduce its speed overhead. This paper describes a high-performance and flexible hardware architecture that accelerates isogeny computation. Specifically, we optimize the design by creating a dedicated quadratic Montgomery multiplier and an efficient scheduling strategy that are suitable for supersingular isogeny. The multiplier operates on F p2 under projective coordinate formulas, and the scheduling is tailored to it. By exploiting additional parallelism through replicated multipliers and concurrent isogeny subroutines, our 65 nm SMIC technology cryptographic accelerator can generate ephemeral public keys in 2.40 ms for Alice and 2.79 ms for Bob with a 751-bit prime setting. Sharing the secret key costs another 2.04 ms and 2.35 ms, respectively.

TI Pauli transfer matrix direct reconstruction: channel characterization
   without full process tomography
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a tomographic protocol for the characterization of multiqubit quantum channels. We discuss a specific class of input states, for which the set of Pauli measurements at the output of the channel directly relates to its Pauli transfer matrix components. We compare our results to those of standard quantum process tomography, showing an exponential reduction in the number of different experimental configurations required by a single matrix element extraction, while keeping the same number of shots. This paves the way for more efficient experimental implementations, whenever a selective knowledge of the Pauli transfer matrix is needed. We provide several examples and simulations.

TI Unconventional phonon blockade via atom-photon-phonon interaction in
   hybrid optomechanical systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Phonon nonlinearities play an important role in hybrid quantum networks and on-chip quantum devices. We investigate the phonon statistics of a mechanical oscillator in hybrid systems composed of an atom and one or two standard optomechanical cavities. An efficiently enhanced atom-phonon interaction can be derived via a tripartite atom-photon-phonon interaction, where the atom-photon coupling depends on the mechanical displacement without practically changing a cavity frequency. This novel mechanism of optomechanical interactions, as predicted recently by Cotrufo et al. 'Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 133603 (2017)1, is fundamentally different from standard ones. In the enhanced atom-phonon coupling, the strong phonon nonlinearity at a single-excitation level is obtained in the originally weak-coupling regime, which leads to the appearance of phonon blockade. Moreover, the optimal parameter regimes are presented both for the cases of one and two cavities. We compared phonon-number correlation functions of different orders for mechanical steady states generated in the one-cavity hybrid system, revealing the occurrence of phonon-induced tunneling and different types of phonon blockade. Our approach offers an alternative method to generate and control a single phonon in the quantum regime and could have potential applications in single-phonon quantum technologies.

AB NTRU is a lattice-based public-key cryptosystem that has been selected as one of the Round III finalists at the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization. Compressing the key sizes to increase efficiency has been a long-standing open question for lattice-based cryptosystems. In this paper we provide a solution to three seemingly opposite demands for NTRU cryptosystem: compress the key size, increase the security level, optimize performance by implementing fast polynomial multiplications. We consider a specific variant of NTRU known as NTRU-NTT. To perform polynomial optimization, we make use of the Number-Theoretic Transformation (NTT) and hybridize it with the Karatsuba Algorithm. Previous work done in providing 2-part Hybridized NTT-Karatsuba Algorithm contained some operational errors in the product expression, which have been detected in this paper. Further, we conjectured the corrected expression and gave a detailed mathematical proof of correctness. In this paper, for the first time, we optimize NTRU-NTT using the corrected Hybridized NTT-Karatsuba Algorithm. The significance of compressing the value of the prime modulus q lies with decreasing the key sizes. We achieve a 128-bit post-quantum security level for a modulus value of 83; 969 which is smaller than the previously known modulus value of 1; 061; 093; 377, while keeping n constant at 2048.

TI Towards communication in a curved spacetime geometry
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The current race in quantum communication - endeavouring to establish a global quantum network - must account for special and general relativistic effects. The well-studied general relativistic effects include Shapiro time-delay, gravitational lensing, and frame dragging which all are due to how a mass distribution alters geodesics. Here, we report how the curvature of spacetime geometry affects the propagation of information carriers along an arbitrary geodesic. An explicit expression for the distortion onto the carrier wavefunction in terms of the Riemann curvature is obtained. Furthermore, we investigate this distortion for anti de Sitter and Schwarzschild geometries. For instance, the spacetime curvature causes a 0.10 radian phase-shift for communication between Earth and the International Space Station on a monochromatic laser beam and quadrupole astigmatism; can cause a 12.2% cross-talk between structured modes traversing through the solar system. Our finding shows that this gravitational distortion is significant, and it needs to be either pre- or post-corrected at the sender or receiver to retrieve the information. The distortion of photons propagation in a curved spacetime geometry poses a challenge for communication for Earth-to-satellite communication. Here, the distortion of localized information carriers, arising from curved spacetime geometry, as they are freely transported along a general geodesic is reported.

TI Strategies for entanglement distribution in optical fiber networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Distributing entanglement over long distances remains a challenge due to its fragility when exposed to environmental effects. In this work, we compare various entanglement distribution protocols in a realistic noisy fiber network. We focus specifically on two schemes that only require the sending of a nonentangled carrier photon to remote nodes of the network. These protocols rely on optical CNOT/CPHASE gates, and we vary the probability with which they can be successfully performed. Encoding our entangled states in photon polarization, we analyze the effect of depolarizing noise on the photonic states as the carrier passes through the fibers. Building a robust model of photon loss and calculating the distillable entanglement of the noisy states, we find the entanglement distribution rate. We discover that methods involving a separable carrier can reach a higher rate than the standard entanglement distribution protocol, provided that the success probability of the optical CNOT/CPHASE gates is sufficiently high.

TI Arbitrary-phase locking of fiber unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optical interferometers are extensively used in fundamental physics studies, gravitational wave detection, quantum metrology, topological photonics, and quantum information processing. Fiber-based interferometers are compact, mechanically robust, and cheap, and thus are ubiquitously deployed. However, the optical phase in fiber interferometers is sensitive to ambient perturbation, resulting in compromised phase-sensing precision. Therefore, phase control, shifting, and stabilization of fiber interferometers are essential. Methods to create stable interference patterns and to lock a fiber interferometer at arbitrary phase have been shown, which however are sophisticated, bulky, and delicate, preventing wider application in harsh environments outside laboratories or in space. Here we demonstrate an innovative method for arbitrary-phase locking of fiber unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Compared with existing methods, our method is much simpler. We showcase the preparation and characterization of a narrow-band, energy-time-entangled photon state generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators, where two-photon interference visibility reaches 0.993(6). Our method constitutes a critical building block for photonic quantum networks, and is useful to emerging single-photon interference in curved space-time that facilitates exploration of the interface of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

TI Digital Key Distribution Protected by Recorded Quantum Noise
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A new digital key distribution and encryption system for broad use is presented. It offers affordable perfect security for in-transit digital communications and is quantum-resistant. It uses true random bits generated from vacuum quantum fluctuations in an optical electromagnetic field to protect the bit (key) distribution. This distribution process uses recorded quantum noise and works in any channel or combination of channels. The quantum noise, independently, creates truly random bits and cloaks the transmitted signals. The default encryption, with distilled keys from these transmitted bits, is an automated one-time-pad, with no need for couriers to replenish keys. The level of security is calculated. The coexistence of encryption and quantum computers raises multi-disciplinary problems, theoretical and practical. Challenges exist now, because "harvest now, decrypt later" is increasingly practiced. An answer for a quantum resistant key distribution is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). It is purely quantum and offers unconditional security. However, many practical and technological aspects plague QKD: it is slow, distance limited, needs quantum channels and is very costly - not for broad commercial use. NIST is starting to offer encryption solutions believed to be quantum-resistant. They are based on deterministic computational complexities. Differently, the security of our solution rests primarily on non-deterministic features.

TI Optical Frequency Down-Conversion With Bandwidth Compression Based on
   Counter-Propagating Phase Matching
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Optical quantum network plays an important role in large scale quantum communication. However, different components for photon generation, transmission, storage and manipulation in network usually cannot interact directly due to the wavelength and bandwidth differences, and thus interfaces are needed to overcome such problems. We propose an optical interface for frequency down-conversion and bandwidth compression based on the counter-propagating quasi-phase-matching difference frequency generation process in the periodically-poled lithium niobate on insulator waveguide. We prove that a separable spectral transfer function can be obtained only by choosing proper pump bandwidth, thus relaxing the limitation of material, dispersion, and working wavelength as a result of the counter-propagation phase-matching configuration. With numerical simulations, we show that our design results in a nearly separable transfer function with the Schmidt number very close to 1. With proper pump bandwidth, an photon at central wavelength of 550 nm with a bandwidth ranging from 50 GHz to 5 THz can be converted to a photon at central wavelength of 1,545 nm with a much narrower bandwidth of 33 GHz.

AB We present a comprehensive framework for quantum state tomography of time-bin qudits sent through a fiber. Starting from basic assumptions, we define a positive-operator valued measure which is then applied to the quantum state reconstruction problem. A realistic scenario is considered where the time uncertainty of the detector is treated as a source of experimental noise. The performance of the quantum tomography framework is examined through a series of numerical simulations conducted for different parameters describing the apparatus. The quality of state recovery, quantified by the notion of minimum fidelity, is depicted on graphs for a range of fiber lengths. Special attention is paid to relative phase reconstruction for qubits and qutrits. The results present relevant interdependence between the fiber length and the detector jitter.

TI Boundary measurement tomography of the Bose Hubbard model on general
   graphs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Correlated quantum many-body phenomena in lattice models have been identified as a set of physically interesting problems that cannot be solved classically. Analog quantum simulators, in photonics and microwave superconducting circuits, have emerged as near-term platforms to address these problems. An important ingredient in practical quantum simulation experiments is the tomography of the implemented Hamiltonians-while this can easily be performed if we have individual measurement access to each qubit in the simulator, this could be challenging to implement in many hardware platforms. In this paper, we present a scheme for tomography of quantum simulators which can be described by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian while having measurement access to only some sites on the boundary of the lattice. We present an algorithm that uses the experimentally routine transmission and two-photon correlation functions, measured at the boundary, to extract the Hamiltonian parameters at the standard quantum limit. Furthermore, by building on quantum enhanced spectroscopy protocols that, we show that with the additional ability to switch on and off the on-site repulsion in the simulator, we can sense the Hamiltonian parameters beyond the standard quantum limit.

TI High-precision tomography of ion qubits based on registration of
   fluorescent photons
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We develop a new method for high-precision tomography of ion qubit registers under conditions of limited distinguishability of logical states. It is not always possible to achieve low error rates during the readout of the quantum states of ion qubits due to the finite lifetime of excited levels, photon scattering, detector dark counts, low numerical aperture, etc. However, the model of fuzzy quantum measurements makes it possible to ensure precise tomography of quantum states. To do this, we developed a fuzzy measurement model based on counting the number of fluorescent photons. A statistically adequate algorithm for the reconstruction of quantum states of ion qubit registers based on fuzzy measurement operators is proposed. The algorithm uses the complete information available in the experiment and makes it possible to account for systematic measurement errors associated with the limited distinguishability of the logical states of ion qubits. We show that the developed model, although computationally more complex, contains significantly more information about the state of the qubit and provides a higher accuracy of state reconstruction compared to the model based on the threshold algorithm.

TI Quantum Wire Coupled to Light
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Experimental advances in cavity QED are raising the prospect of using light to probe quantum materials beyond the linear response regime. The capability to access quantum coherent phenomena would significantly advance the field. However, theoretical work on many-body systems coupled to light in the quantum coherent regime has been select. Here, we investigate the radiative properties of a finite-sized quantum wire in a microwave cavity. Examples of quantum wires include single-walled carbon nanotubes, a key experimental system in the field of nano-optics and plasmonics. We find that, for a variety of excited states, the repeated emission of photons results in the generation of many-body quantum entanglement. This leads to an increase in the rate at which subsequent photons are emitted, an example of Dicke super- radiance. On the other hand, Pauli blocking tends to reduce this effect. Bosonization, the description of the excitations of a one-dimensional electron system as a gas of bosons, is found to be a powerful theoretical tool in this context. Its application means that many of our results generalize to wires with strong electron- electron interactions. The quantum wire thus represents a new platform to realize Dicke-model physics that does not rely on the various fine tunings necessary in traditional realizations involving many spatially isolated emitters. More broadly, this work demonstrates how quantum entanglement can be generated and measured in a many-body system.

TI Swarm-like ground-state searching based on a path-integral quantum Monte
   Carlo method for automatically fluctuation-controlled simulated
   annealing
SO IEICE NONLINEAR THEORY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIQMC) method is widely used as a classical simulation algorithm for quantum annealing. Replicas represent different points in imaginary time. We propose and demonstrate a swarm-like ground-state searching algorithm based on the PIQMC method for automatically fluctuation-controlled simulated annealing. Replicas help one another to search for the ground state of an Ising system as if forming a swarm and working cooperatively. Their interactions are local, simple and fluctuate to a certain degree. Such fluctuations are necessary to escape local minima, but the fluctuations do not need to be explicitly controlled. The size of fluctuations is automatically adjusted as annealing proceeds. We solve max-cut problems for algorithm evaluation, each of which corresponds to a graph of 100 vertices. We also solve the same problems using a conventional method based on the Metropolis algorithm for comparison.

TI A Survey on Satellite Communication System Security
SO SENSORS
AB In recent years, satellite communication systems (SCSs) have rapidly developed in terms of their role and capabilities, promoted by advancements in space launch technologies. However, this rapid development has also led to the emergence of significant security vulnerabilities, demonstrated through real-world targeted attacks such as AcidRain and AcidPour that demand immediate attention from the security community. In response, various countermeasures, encompassing both technological and policy-based approaches, have been proposed to mitigate these threats. However, the multitude and diversity of these proposals make their comparison complex, requiring a systemized view of the landscape. In this paper, we systematically categorize and analyze both attacks and defenses within the framework of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, focusing on specific threats that pose substantial risks to SCSs. Furthermore, we evaluate existing countermeasures against potential threats in SCS environments and offer insights into the security policies of different nations, recognizing the strategic importance of satellite communications as a national asset. Finally, we present prospective security challenges and solutions for future SCSs, including full quantum communication, AI-integrated SCSs, and standardized protocols for the next generation of terrestrial-space communication.

TI Robustly learning the Hamiltonian dynamics of a superconducting quantum
   processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Precise means of characterizing analog quantum simulators are key to developing quantum simulators capable of beyond-classical computations. Here, we precisely estimate the free Hamiltonian parameters of a superconducting-qubit analog quantum simulator from measured time-series data on up to 14 qubits. To achieve this, we develop a scalable Hamiltonian learning algorithm that is robust against state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors and yields tomographic information about those SPAM errors. The key subroutines are a novel super-resolution technique for frequency extraction from matrix time-series, tensorESPRIT, and constrained manifold optimization. Our learning results verify the Hamiltonian dynamics on a Sycamore processor up to sub-MHz accuracy, and allow us to construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our results constitute an accurate implementation of a dynamical quantum simulation that is precisely characterized using a new diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.
   Accurately estimating Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum system is crucial in the development of large-scale analog quantum simulators. Here, the authors develop and experimentally demonstrate an algorithm to robustly learn Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic systems undergoing dynamical evolution.

TI Cryogenic Ferroelectricity of HZO With an Aluminum Oxide Interlayer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB In this work, we investigate the cryogenic performance of hafnia-based ferroelectric capacitors with and without an aluminum oxide (ALO) interlayer, comparing conventional metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structures to metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) counterparts. Devices employing Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 as the ferroelectric layer were characterized from 300 K down to 10 K, targeting temperature ranges relevant to cryogenic logic and quantum memory. Our results reveal that the ultrathin ALO interlayer effectively suppresses leakage across all temperatures while altering the coercive field symmetry and reducing remnant polarization as the temperature is reduced. Dynamic switching measurements and analysis show that MFM capacitors achieve near temperature-independent polarization switching at a 3.0 V WRITE amplitude. In contrast, MFIM devices show more pronounced temperature dependence in the switching behavior, particularly at temperatures below 77 K. While both the MFM and MFIM devices exhibit endurance 10(7) cycles at 77 and 10 K, the MFIM devices are more affected by polarization fatigue. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art literature values confirms that our MFM and MFIM structures demonstrate among the highest reported 2P(r) values below 77 K at low operating voltages (<= 3.5 V). These results highlight the promise of interlayer-engineered hafnia capacitors for low-power cryogenic memory applications.

TI Charge-noise spectroscopy of Si/SiGe quantum dots via
   dynamically-decoupled exchange oscillations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are promising qubits due to their long coherence times, scalable fabrication, and potential for all-electrical control. However, charge noise in the host semiconductor presents a major obstacle to achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates in these devices. In this work, we measure the charge-noise spectrum of a Si/SiGe singlet-triplet qubit over nearly 12 decades in frequency using a combination of methods, including dynamically-decoupled exchange oscillations with up to 512 pi pulses during the qubit evolution. The charge noise is colored across the entire frequency range of our measurements, although the spectral exponent changes with frequency. Moreover, the charge-noise spectrum inferred from conductance measurements of a proximal sensor quantum dot agrees with that inferred from coherent oscillations of the singlet-triplet qubit, suggesting that simple transport measurements can accurately characterize the charge noise over a wide frequency range in Si/SiGe quantum dots.
   Charge noise is a major limitation to achieving high-fidelity quantum gate performance with semiconductor qubits. Here the authors report the results of charge noise spectroscopy for electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, spanning nearly twelve decades in frequency.

TI Novel Design of Resource-Constrained Quantum Reversible Logic Gates at
   Optimal Cost and Depth
SO JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Reversible logic computation and optimization of reversible circuits help synthesize applications characterized by ultra-low power consumption, including quantum information processing, the field of nanotechnology, semiconductor technology, the field of optics, and very-large-scale integration (VLSI), among others. Reversible logic design is a growing research subject that evaluates and applies resources in new advancements. This article provides an optimized, unique, resource-constrained universal quantum reversible gate for nanoscale applications that perform all fundamental logic operations. Optimization and gate relocation have enhanced a published and proposed design. Quantum reversible circuits are optimized for cost and depth via template matching, gate fusion (merging) and commutation, gate decomposition, and gate elimination. These methods reduce circuit complexity and size significantly. A step-by-step optimization of the quantum reversible logic design is first presented. The novel quantum reversible gates MRQ1, MRQ2, and M-BUS are implemented and verified on the IBM Qiskit platform. The proposed reversible gates' design complexity is assessed using 13 standard Boolean expressions. Proposed quantum reversible gates demonstrate an improvement in performance, covering a range of 12.5%-72.7% over prior designs in gate count, depth, and quantum cost. Gate count improved most, impacting other parameters and demonstrating the design's resource efficiency.

TI An Ergodic Theorem for Quantum Processes with Applications to Matrix
   Product States
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Any discrete quantum process is represented by a sequence of quantum channels. We consider ergodic quantum processes obtained by a map that takes the points along the trajectory of a discrete ergodic dynamical system to the space of quantum channels. Under a natural irreducibility condition, we obtain a theorem showing that the state under such a process converges exponentially fast to an ergodic sequence depending on the process, but independent of the initial state. As an application, we describe the thermodynamic limit of ergodic matrix product states and prove that the 2-point correlations of local observables in such states decay exponentially with their distance in the bulk.

TI Efficient Quantum Emulation of Unknown Unitaries
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a quantum algorithm, termed the universal quantum emulator, that emulates the action of an unknown unitary transformation or its inverse on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be emulated, the sample input states, or the relation between them. We rigorously prove that if the sample input states are tomographically complete, such that the action of an unknown unitary on the input subspace can be uniquely determined by its action on the sample input states, then our proposed algorithm succeeds in generating the desired output, with an error that becomes arbitrarily small by increasing the number of copies of the samples. Remarkably, the run-time of the algorithm is logarithmic in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore, the sample complexity of the algorithm-i.e., the total number of copies of the sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm-is independent of D and polynomial in d. In contrast, the run-time and sample complexity of algorithms that perform tomography on the sample states are both linear in D. This algorithm can be used as a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation. We discuss some applications of this algorithm in areas including complexity theory, secure quantum computation, and quantum resource theories.

TI A size-consistent multi-state mapping approach to surface hopping
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We develop a multi-state generalization of the recently proposed mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) for the simulation of electronically nonadiabatic dynamics. This new approach extends the original MASH method to be able to treat systems with more than two electronic states. It differs from previous approaches in that it is size consistent and rigorously recovers the original two-state MASH in the appropriate limits. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by applying it to a series of model systems for which exact benchmark results are available, and we find that the method is well suited to the simulation of photochemical relaxation processes.

TI Probing many-body dynamics in a two-dimensional dipolar spin ensemble
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Solid-state systems are established candidates to study models of many-body physics but have limited control and readout capabilities. Ensembles of defects in diamond may provide a solution for studying dipolar systems.
   The most direct approach for characterizing the quantum dynamics of a strongly interacting system is to measure the time evolution of its full many-body state. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it quickly becomes intractable as the system size grows. An alternate approach is to think of the many-body dynamics as generating noise, which can be measured by the decoherence of a probe qubit. Here we investigate what the decoherence dynamics of such a probe tells us about the many-body system. In particular, we utilize optically addressable probe spins to experimentally characterize both static and dynamical properties of strongly interacting magnetic dipoles. Our experimental platform consists of two types of spin defects in nitrogen delta-doped diamond: nitrogen-vacancy colour centres, which we use as probe spins, and a many-body ensemble of substitutional nitrogen impurities. We demonstrate that the many-body system's dimensionality, dynamics and disorder are naturally encoded in the probe spins' decoherence profile. Furthermore, we obtain direct control over the spectral properties of the many-body system, with potential applications in quantum sensing and simulation.

TI Quantum non-demolition measurement based on an
   SU(1,1)-SU(2)-concatenated atom-light hybrid interferometer
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement is an important tool in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum optics. The atom-light hybrid interferometer is of great interest due to its combination of an atomic spin wave and an optical wave, which can be utilized for photon number QND measurement via the AC-Stark effect. In this paper, we present an SU(1,1)-SU(2)-concatenated atom-light hybrid interferometer, and theoretically study QND measurement of the photon number. Compared to the traditional SU(2) interferometer, the signal-to-noise ratio in a balanced case is improved by a gain factor of the nonlinear Raman process (NRP) in this proposed interferometer. Furthermore, the condition of high-quality QND measurement is analyzed. In the presence of losses, the measurement quality is reduced. We can adjust the gain parameter of the NRP in the readout stage to reduce the impact due to losses. Moreover, this scheme is a multiarm interferometer, which has the potential of multiparameter estimation with many important applications in the detection of vector fields, quantum imaging, and so on.

In this Letter, we report the experimental realization of optical parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime on a chip. By precisely controlling the loss inherently tied to fluctuation, we observe the asymmetric Hong-Ou-Mandel dip-a hallmark of quantum fluctuation in the fluctuation-driven parametric down-conversion (PDC)-and the fluctuation-induced compression of single photons by nearly one order of magnitude. These findings pave the way for the manipulation of quantum fluctuation, quantum states, and system-reservoir interaction.

   imaging
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum imaging has non-negligible advantages in terms of sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and novel imaging schemes. Based on metasurfaces, the information density and stability of the quantum imaging system can be further improved. Here we experimentally demonstrate that two patterns, simultaneously and independently superimposed on a high-efficiency dielectric metasurface, can be remotely switched via polar ization-entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, using the time-correlated property of entangled photon pairs, the information carried by quantum light can be remarkably discriminated from background noise. This work confirms that the phase manipulation of quantum light with metasurfaces has a huge potential in the field of quantum imaging, quantum state tomography, and also promises real-world quantum metasurface devices.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Efficient fully-coherent quantum signal processing algorithms for
   real-time dynamics simulation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Simulating the unitary dynamics of a quantum system is a fundamental problem of quantum mechanics, in which quantum computers are believed to have significant advantage over their classical counterparts. One prominent such instance is the simulation of electronic dynamics, which plays an essential role in chemical reactions, non-equilibrium dynamics, and material design. These systems are time-dependent, which requires that the corresponding simulation algorithm can be successfully concatenated with itself over different time intervals to reproduce the overall coherent quantum dynamics of the system. In this paper, we quantify such simulation algorithms by the property of being fully-coherent: the algorithm succeeds with arbitrarily high success probability 1 - delta while only requiring a single copy of the initial state. We subsequently develop fully-coherent simulation algorithms based on quantum signal processing (QSP), including a novel algorithm that circumvents the use of amplitude amplification while also achieving a query complexity additive in time t, ln(1/delta), and ln(1/epsilon) for error tolerance epsilon: & UTheta;||H|||t|+ln(1/epsilon)+ln(1/delta). Furthermore, we numerically analyze these algorithms by applying them to the simulation of the spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model and the correlated electronic dynamics of an H-2 molecule. Since any electronic Hamiltonian can be mapped to a spin Hamiltonian, our algorithm can efficiently simulate time-dependent ab initio electronic dynamics in the circuit model of quantum computation. Accordingly, it is also our hope that the present work serves as a bridge between QSP-based quantum algorithms and chemical dynamics, stimulating a cross-fertilization between these exciting fields.

TI Comparing the hardness of MAX 2-SAT problem instances for quantum and
   classical algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An algorithm for a particular problem may find some instances of the problem easier and others harder to solve, even for a fixed input size. We numerically analyze the relative hardness of MAX 2-SAT problem instances for various continuous-time quantum algorithms and a comparable classical algorithm. This has two motivations: To investigate whether small-sized problem instances, which are commonly used in numerical simulations of quantum algorithms for benchmarking purposes, are a good representation of larger instances in terms of their hardness to solve, and to determine the applicability of continuous-time quantum algorithms in a portfolio approach, where we take advantage of the variation in the hardness of instances between different algorithms by running them in parallel. We find that, while there are correlations in instance hardness between all of the algorithms considered, they appear weak enough that a portfolio approach would likely be desirable in practice. Our results also show a widening range of hardness of randomly generated instances as the problem size is increased, which demonstrates both the difference in the distribution of hardness at small sizes and the value of a portfolio approach that can reduce the number of extremely hard instances. We identify specific weaknesses of these quantum algorithms that can be overcome with a portfolio approach, such their inability to efficiently solve satisfiable instances (which is easy classically).

TI Thermalization in Kitaev's quantum double models via tensor network
   techniques
SO FORUM OF MATHEMATICS SIGMA
AB We show that every ergodic Davies generator associated to any 2D Kitaev's quantum double model has a nonvanishing spectral gap in the thermodynamic limit. This validates rigorously the extended belief that those models are useless as self-correcting quantum memories, even in the non-abelian case. The proof uses recent ideas and results regarding the characterization of the spectral gap for parent Hamiltonians associated to Projected Entangled Pair States in terms of a bulk-boundary correspondence.

TI Conditions for logical contextuality and nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Contextuality and nonlocality are nonclassical properties exhibited by quantum statistics whose implications profoundly impact both the foundations and applications of quantum theory. In this paper we provide some insights into logical contextuality and inequality-free proofs. The former can be understood as the possibility version of contextuality, while the latter refers to proofs of quantum contextuality and nonlocality that are not based on violations of some noncontextuality (or Bell) inequality. By "possibilistic" we mean a description in terms of possibilities for the outcomes, which are Boolean variables assuming value one when the corresponding probability is strictly larger than zero and zero otherwise. The present work aims to build a bridge between these two concepts from what we call possibilistic paradoxes, which are sets of possibilistic conditions whose occurrence implies contextuality and nonlocality. As the main result, we demonstrate the existence of possibilistic paradoxes whose occurrence is a necessary and sufficient condition for logical contextuality in a very important class of scenarios. Finally, we discuss some interesting consequences arising from the completeness of these possibilistic paradoxes.

TI Convergence of a Reconstructed Density Matrix to a Pure State Using the
   Maximal Entropy Approach
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Impressive progress has been made in the past decade in the study of technological applications of varied types of quantum systems. With industry giants like IBM laying down their roadmap for scalable quantum devices with more than 1000-qubits by the end of 2023, efficient validation techniques are also being developed for testing quantum processing on these devices. The characterization of a quantum state is done by experimental measurements through the process called quantum state tomography (QST) which scales exponentially with the size of the system. However, QST performed using incomplete measurements is aptly suited for characterizing these quantum technologies especially with the current nature of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where not all mean measurements are available with high fidelity. We, hereby, propose an alternative approach to QST for the complete reconstruction of the density matrix of a quantum system in a pure state for any number of qubits by applying the maximal entropy formalism on the pairwise combinations of the known mean measurements. This approach provides the best estimate of the target state when we know the complete set of observables, which is the case of convergence of the reconstructed density matrix to a pure state. Our goal is to provide a practical inference of a quantum system in a pure state that can find its applications in the field of quantum error mitigation on a real quantum computer that we intend to investigate further.

AB Local hidden-variable model of singlet-state correlations discussed in Czachor (Acta Phys Polon A 139:70, 2021a) is shown to be a particular case of an infinite hierarchy of local hidden-variable models based on an infinite hierarchy of calculi. Violation of Bell-type inequalities can be interpreted as a 'confusion of languages' problem, a result of mixing different but neighboring levels of the hierarchy. Mixing of non-neighboring levels results in violations beyond the Tsirelson bounds.

TI Nonlinear Response and Crosstalk of Electrically Driven Silicon Spin
   Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Micromagnet-based electric dipole spin resonance offers an attractive path for the near-term scaling of dense arrays of silicon spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots while maintaining long coherence times and high control fidelities. However, accurately controlling dense arrays of qubits using a multiplexed drive will require an understanding of the cross-talk mechanisms that may reduce operational fidelity. We identify an unexpected cross-talk mechanism whereby the Rabi frequency of a driven qubit is drastically changed when the drive of an adjacent qubit is turned on. These observations raise important considerations for scaling single-qubit control.

TI Chained continuous quantum federated learning framework
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The integration of quantum machine learning into federated learning paradigms is poised to transform the future of technologies that depend on diverse machine learning methodologies. This research delves into Quantum Federated Learning (QFL), presenting an initial framework modeled on the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, implemented via Qiskit. Despite its potential, QFL encounters critical challenges, including (i) susceptibility to a single point of failure, (ii) communication bottlenecks, and (iii) uncertainty in model convergence. Subsequently, we dive deeper into QFL and propose an innovative alternative to traditional server-based QFL. Our approach introduces a chained continuous QFL framework (ccQFL), which eliminates the need for a central server and the FedAvg method. In our framework, clients engage in a chained continuous training process, where they exchange models and collaboratively enhance each other's performance. This approach improves both the efficiency of communication and the accuracy of the training process. Our experimental evaluation includes a proof-of-concept to demonstrate initial feasibility and a prototype study simulating TCP/IP communication between clients. This simulation enables concurrent operations, verifying the potential of ccQFL for real-world applications. We examine various datasets, including Iris, MNIST, synthetic and Genomic, covering a range of data sizes from small to large. For further validity of our proposed method, we extend our experimental analysis in other frameworks such as PennyLane and TensorCircuit where we include various ablation studies covering major considerations and factors that impact the framework to study validity, robustness, practicality, and others. Our results show that the ccQFL framework achieves model convergence, and we evaluate other critical metrics such as performance and communication delay. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to establish and discuss many factors such as model convergence, communication costs, etc.

TI Quantum-Based QoE Optimization in Advanced Cellular Networks:
   Integration and Cloud Gaming Use Case
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing End-to-End (E2E) network services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy, model loading and inference times for the estimator, time to solution and solution score for the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are identified as future research lines.

TI Comparative Analysis of Quantum Encoding Techniques for Biomarker
   Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Biomarker classification represents a significant task in biological, medical diagnostics, and bioinformatics, where high-dimensional datasets represent challenges to classical machine learning models. The study presented in this paper focuses on the impact of data encoding and explores quantum machine learning algorithms for biomarker classification. Three quantum embedding methods; Angle Embedding, Amplitude Embedding, and IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial) Embedding, were combined with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) and Quantum k-Nearest Neighbors (QkNN) and compared against classical SVM and KNN baselines. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality. Experiments were conducted on the CuMiDa breast cancer dataset using quantum simulators. Results show that IQP embedding and Angle embedding significantly outperform classical models with QSVM, achieving the best performance, where IQP embedding reaching 93.1% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.93 in higher-dimensional settings, outperforming both the other quantum embeddings and the classical SVM. For QkNN, performance depended on dimensionality, with IQP achieving the strongest results in lower dimensions, including a precision of 87.1%, surpassing both the other quantum embeddings and classical KNN. In higher dimensions, Angle embedding yielded the best quantum results, though classical KNN remained superior. Amplitude embedding consistently underperformed in QSVM but was more competitive in QkNN. These findings demonstrate that advanced quantum data encoding, such as IQP and Angle, can enhance biomarker classification performance and highlight the promise of hybrid quantum-classical approaches in biomedical applications.

AB We assess a scheme for measurement-free quantum teleportation from the perspective of the resources underpinning its performance. In particular, we focus on claims recently made about the crucial role played by the degree of non-Markovianity of the dynamics of the information carrier whose state we aim to teleport. We prove that any link between the efficiency of teleportation and the back-flow of information depends fundamentally on the way the various operations entailed by the measurement-free teleportation protocol are implemented while-in general-no claim of causal link can be made. Our result reinforces the need for the explicit assessment of the underlying physical platform when assessing the performance and resources for a given quantum protocol and the need for a rigorous quantum resource theory of non-Markovianity.

TI Quantum coherence of photons to cosmological distances
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We identify potential sources of decoherence for U(1) gauge bosons from a cosmological standpoint. Besides interactions with different species in the cosmological medium, we also consider effects due to the expansion of the Universe, which can produce particles (especially scalars) that can potentially interact with the photon in a quantum state. We look in particular at the case of axionlike particles and their predicted decay channels in our analysis. These interactions are shown to have a negligible effect as far as decoherence goes. Interaction rates with cosmic microwave background radiation or through Thomson scattering are small, so that the interstellar medium remains the biggest decoherence factor. Thus, quantum teleportation experiments with photon energies in the range 1-10 keV should be feasible at cosmological distances up to the galaxy formation epoch or beyond (z similar to 100).

TI Polarization control of THz emission using spin-reorientation transition
   in spintronic heterostructure
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Polarization of electromagnetic waves plays an extremely important role in interaction of radiation with matter. In particular, interaction of polarized waves with ordered matter strongly depends on orientation and symmetry of vibrations of chemical bonds in crystals. In quantum technologies, the polarization of photons is considered as a "degree of freedom", which is one of the main parameters that ensure efficient quantum computing. However, even for visible light, polarization control is in most cases separated from light emission. In this paper, we report on a new type of polarization control, implemented directly in a spintronic terahertz emitter. The principle of control, realized by a weak magnetic field at room temperature, is based on a spin-reorientation transition (SRT) in an intermetallic heterostructure TbCo2/FeCo with uniaxial in-plane magnetic anisotropy. SRT is implemented under magnetic field of variable strength but of a fixed direction, orthogonal to the easy magnetization axis. Variation of the magnetic field strength in the angular (canted) phase of the SRT causes magnetization rotation without changing its magnitude. The charge current excited by the spin-to-charge conversion is orthogonal to the magnetization. As a result, THz polarization rotates synchronously with magnetization when magnetic field strength changes. Importantly, the radiation intensity does not change in this case. Control of polarization by SRT is applicable regardless of the spintronic mechanism of the THz emission, provided that the polarization direction is determined by the magnetic moment orientation. The results obtained open the prospect for the development of the SRT approach for THz emission control.

TI Performance Improvement of SIMD Processor for High-Speed end Devices in
   IoT Operation Based on Reversible Logic with Hybrid Adder Configuration
SO TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
AB The reversible logic function is gaining significant consideration as a style for the logic design by implementing modern Nano and quantum computing with minimal impact on physical entropy. Recent advances in reversible logic allow for computer design applications using advanced quantum computer algorithms. In the literature, significant contributions have been made towards reversible logic gate structures and arithmetic units. However, there are many attempts to dictate the design of Single Instruction-Multiple Data (SIMD) processors. In this research work, a novel programmable reversible logic gate design is verified and a reversible processor design suggests its implementation of SIMD processor. Then, implementing the ripple-carry, carry-select and Kogge-Stone carry look-ahead adders using reversible logic and the performance is compared. The proposed reversible logic-based architecture has a minimum fan out with binary tree structure and minimum logic depth. The simulation result of the proposed design is obtained from Xilinx 14.5 software. From the simulated result, the computational path net delay for 16 x 16 reversible logic with Kogge Stone Adder is 17.247 ns. Compared with 16-bit Kogge Stone Adder, the reversible logic-based 16-bit Kogge Stone Adder gives low power and low time delay. By looking at the speed, energy and area parameters, including fast applications in which two smaller delay and low power adders are required, the effectiveness, including the proper area use of the hybrid adder recommended by it is evaluated.

TI Considerations for evaluating thermodynamic properties with hybrid
   quantum-classical computing work flows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum chemistry applications on quantum computers currently rely heavily on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm aims at finding ground-state solutions of molecular systems based on the variational principle. VQE calculations can be systematically implemented for perturbations to each molecular degree of freedom, generating a Born-Oppenheimer potential-energy surface (PES) for the molecule. The PES can then be used to derive thermodynamic properties, which are often desirable for applications in chemical engineering and materials design. It is clear from this process that quantum chemistry applications contain a substantial classical computing component in addition to steps that can be performed using a quantum computer. In order to design efficient work flows that take full advantage of each hardware type, it is critical to consider the entire process so that the high-accuracy electronic energies possible from quantum computing are not squandered in the process of calculating thermodynamic properties. We present a summary of the hybrid quantum-classical work flow to compute thermodynamic properties. This work flow contains many options that can significantly affect the efficiency and the accuracy of the results, including classical optimizer attributes, number of ansatz repetitions, and how the vibrational Schrodinger equation is solved to determine vibrational modes. We also analyze the effects of these options by employing robust statistics along with simulations and experiments on actual quantum hardware. We show that, through careful selection of work flow options, nearly order-of-magnitude increases in accuracy are possible at equivalent computing time.

AB The meteoric rise in power and popularity of machine learning models dependent on valuable training data has reignited a basic tension between the power of running a program locally and the risk of exposing details of that program to the user. At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens.
   A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model.
   Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.

AB We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing "quantum supremacy" experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain Omega(n) min-entropy, where n is the number of qubits. To achieve a net gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits-thereby "bootstrapping" from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model, and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol's output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its implementation to at most n similar to 60 qubits, a regime where attacks are expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and is physically realizable today.

TI Imaging and sensing of pH and chemical state with
   nuclear-spin-correlated cascade gamma rays via radioactive tracer
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Although computed tomography provides useful information on the accumulation of radioactive tracers in vivo, no information about the local chemical environment is obtained. Here, quantum sensing is combined with tomography to simultaneously image and measure the pH of a phantom tissue.
   Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) are highly sensitive molecular detection and imaging techniques that generally measure accumulation of radio-labeled molecules by detecting gamma rays. Quantum sensing of local molecular environment via spin, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, has also been reported. Here, we describe quantum sensing and imaging using nuclear-spin time-space correlated cascade gamma-rays via a radioactive tracer. Indium-111 (In-111) is widely used in SPECT to detect accumulation using a single gamma-ray photon. The time-space distribution of two successive cascade gamma-rays emitted from an In-111 atom carries significant information on the chemical and physical state surrounding molecules with double photon coincidence detection. We propose and demonstrate quantum sensing capability of local micro-environment (pH and chelating molecule) in solution along with radioactive tracer accumulation imaging, by using multiple gamma-rays time-and-energy detection. Local molecular environment is extracted through electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction in the intermediate nuclear spin state by the explicit distribution of sub-MeV gamma rays. This work demonstrates a proof of concept, and further work is necessary to increase the sensitivity of the technique for in vivo imaging and to study the effect of scattered radiation for possible application in nuclear medicine.

TI Neural-network-based parameter estimation for quantum detection
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Artificial neural networks (NNs) bridge input data into output results by approximately encoding the function that relates them. This is achieved after training the network with a collection of known inputs and results leading to an adjustment of the neuron connections and biases. In the context of quantum detection schemes, NNs find a natural playground. In particular, in the presence of a target (e.g. an electromagnetic field), a quantum sensor delivers a response, i.e. the input data, which can be subsequently processed by a NN that outputs the target features. In this work we demonstrate that adequately trained NNs enable to characterize a target with (i) minimal knowledge of the underlying physical model (ii) in regimes where the quantum sensor presents complex responses and (iii) under a significant shot noise due to a reduced number of measurements. We exemplify the method with a development for Yb-171(+) atomic sensors. However, our protocol is general, thus applicable to arbitrary quantum detection scenarios.

TI Emulating multiparticle emitters with pair-sources: digital discovery of
   a quantum optics building block
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Linear quantum optics is advancing quickly, driven by sources of correlated photon pairs. Multi-photon sources beyond pairs would be a powerful resource, but are a difficult technology to implement. We have discovered a way in which we can combine multiple pair-sources to act analogous to sources of four, six or even eight correlated photons for the creation of highly entangled quantum states and other quantum information tasks. The existence of such setups is interesting from a conceptual perspective, but also offers a useful abstraction for the construction of more complicated photonic experiments, ranging from state generation to complex quantum networks. We show that even just going from probabilistic two-photon sources to effective four-photon sources allows conceptually new experiments for which no other building principles were known before. The setups which inspired the formulation of these abstract building blocks were discovered by a computer algorithm that can efficiently design quantum optics experiments. Our manuscript demonstrates how artificial intelligence can act as a source of inspiration for the scientific discoveries of new ideas and concepts in physics.

TI Extracting work from random collisions: A model of a quantum heat engine
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study the statistical distribution of the ergotropy and of the efficiency of a single-qubit battery ad of a single-qubit Otto engine, respectively fueled by random collisions. The single qubit, our working fluid, is assumed to exchange energy with two reservoirs: a nonequilibrium "hot" reservoir and a zero-temperature cold reservoir. The interactions between the qubit and the reservoirs are described in terms of a collision model of open system dynamics. The qubit interacts with the nonequilibrium reservoir (a large ensemble of qudits all prepared in the same pure state) via random unitary collisions and with the cold reservoir (a large ensemble of qubits in their ground state) via a partial swap. Due to the random nature of the interaction with the hot reservoir, fluctuations in ergotropy, heat, and work are present, shrinking with the size of the qudits in the hot reservoir. While the mean, "macroscopic" efficiency of the Otto engine is the same as in the case in which the hot reservoir is a thermal one, the distribution of efficiencies does not support finite moments, so that the mean of efficiencies does not coincide with the macroscopic efficiency.

TI Frequency tuning of a squeezed vacuum state using interferometric
   enhanced acousto-optic effect
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum frequency conversion is one of the important tools for quantum information processing. So far, the frequency conversion of continuous variable quantum state in radio frequency range has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optical frequency fine tuning of a squeezed vacuum state by using an acousto-optic modulator based bi-frequency interferometer. The systematic efficiency of the frequency tuning device is 91%, which is only confined by the optical transmission efficiency of the acousto-optic modulators. The amount of frequency tuning is 80 MHz, which is orders of magnitude larger than the line-width of the laser used to generate the squeezed state and can, in principle, be further extended. A squeezed vacuum state with -3.47 +/- 0.02 dB squeezing level is sent to the frequency tuning device, and a squeezing level of -1.98 +/- 0.02 dB is directly measured by a fiber coupled homodyne detector after the frequency tuning. Our scheme can also be applied to a variety of other quantum optical states as well and will serve as a handy tool for quantum networks.

TI Certified randomness from a remote-state-preparation dimension witness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Randomness in Bell test data can be device-independently certified by Bell's theorem without placing assumptions about the experimental devices. The device-independent randomness has very demanding requirements about the experimental devices and relatively lower output randomness. With the same Bell test data we can extract substantially more randomness without using Bell's theorem. To achieve this goal, we introduce a remote-state-preparation dimension witness and a semi-device-independent randomness certification model which is based on it. This is one important step towards practical use of the Bell test in randomness generation.

TI Quantum Beam Scattering-Beam's Coherence Length, Which-Path Information
   and Weak Values
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB The conventional theory of neutron beams interacting with many-body systems treats the beam as a classical system, i.e., with its dynamical variables appearing in the quantum dynamics of the scattering process not as operators but only as c-numbers. Moreover, neutrons are described with plane waves, i.e., the concept of a neutron's (finite) coherence length is here irrelevant. The same holds for electron, atom or X-ray scattering. This simplification results in the full decoupling of the probe particle's dynamics from the quantum dynamics of the scatterer-a well-known fact also reflected in the standard formalism of time-correlation functions (see textbooks). Making contact with modern quantum-theoretical approaches (e.g., quantum entanglement, "which-path information" versus interference, von Neumann measurement, Weak Values (WV), etc.), new observable effects of non-relativistic quantum beam scattering may be exposed and/or predicted, for instance, a momentum-transfer deficit and an intensity deficit in neutron scattering from protons of hydrogen-containing samples. A new WV-theoretical treatment is provided, which explains both these "deficit effects" from first principles and on equal footing.

TI A Holistic Approach on Airfare Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
   Techniques
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Globalization of markets involves new strategies and price policies from professionals that contribute to global competitiveness. Airline companies are changing tickets' prices very often considering a variety of factors based on their proprietary rules and algorithms that are searching for the most suitable price policy. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are exploited for the latter task, due to their compactness, fast adaptability, and many potentials in data generalization. This paper represents an analysis of airfare price prediction towards finding similarities in the pricing policies of different Airline companies by using AI Techniques. More specifically, a set of effective features is extracted from 136.917 data flights of Aegean, Turkish, Austrian and Lufthansa Airlines for six popular international destinations. The extracted set of features is then used to conduct a holistic analysis from the perspective of the end user who seeks the most affordable ticket cost, considering a destination-based evaluation including all airlines, and an airline-based evaluation including all destinations. For the latter cause, AI models from three different domains and a total of 16 model architectures are considered to resolve the airfare price prediction problem: Machine Learning (ML) with eight state-of-the-art models, Deep Learning (DL) with six CNN models and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with two models. Experimental results reveal that at least three models from each domain, ML, DL, and QML, are able to achieve accuracies between 89% and 99% in this regression problem, for different international destinations and airline companies.

AB It has been shown classically that combining two chaotic random walks can yield an ordered (periodic) walk. Our aim in this paper is to find a quantum analog for this rather counterintuitive result. We study the chaotic and periodic nature of cyclic quantum walks and focus on a unique situation wherein a periodic quantum walk on 3-cycle graph is generated via a deterministic combination of two chaotic quantum walks on the same graph. We extend our results to even numbered cyclic graphs, specifically a 4-cycle graph too. Our results will be relevant in quantum cryptography and quantum chaos control.

TI Unidirectional absorption, storage, and emission of single photons in a
   collectively responding bilayer atomic array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two-dimensional regular arrays of atoms are a promising platform for quantum networks, with collective sub -radiant states providing long-lived storage and collimated emission allowing for natural coherent links between arrays in free space. However, a single-layer lattice can only efficiently absorb or emit light symmetrically in the forward and backward directions. Here we show how a bilayer lattice can absorb a single photon either incident from a single direction or an arbitrary superposition of forward and backward propagating components. The excitation can be stored in a subradiant state, transferred coherently between different subradiant states, and released, again in an arbitrary combination of highly collimated forward and backward propagating components. We explain the directionality of single and bilayer arrays by a symmetry analysis based on the scattering parities of different multipole radiation components of collective excitations. The collective modes may exhibit the conventional half-wave loss of fields near the array interface or completely eliminate it. The proposed directional control of absorption and emission paves the way for effective one-dimensional quantum commu-nication between multiple arrays, with single-photons propagating backward and forward between quantum information-processing and storage stages.

TI Development of Quantum Interconnects (QuICs) for Next-Generation
   Information Technologies
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Just as "classical" information technology rests on a foundation built of interconnected information-processing systems, quantum information technology (QIT) must do the same. A critical component of such systems is the "interconnect," a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual atoms, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical, etc.) that will form a "quantum internet" poses additional challenges. As quantum systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by participants of the NSF workshop on "Quantum Interconnects" that accelerating QuIC research is crucial for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research program including partnership between academia, industry, and national laboratories is required.

System abnormalities or illegal operations can be found in time by analyzing the log and provide evidence for intrusions. In order to ensure the integrity of the log in the current system, many researchers have designed it based on blockchain. However, the emerging blockchain is facing significant security challenges with the increment of quantum computers. An attacker equipped with a quantum computer can extract the user's private key from the public key to generate a forged signature, destroy the structure of the blockchain, and threaten the security of the log system. Thus, blind signature on the lattice in post-quantum blockchain brings new security features for log systems. In our paper, to address these, firstly, we propose a novel log system based on post-quantum blockchain that can resist quantum computing attacks. Secondly, we utilize a post-quantum blind signature on the lattice to ensure both security and blindness of log system, which makes the privacy of log information to a large extent. Lastly, we enhance the security level of lattice-based blind signature under the random oracle model, and the signature size grows slowly compared with others. We also implement our protocol and conduct an extensive analysis to prove the ideas. The results show that our scheme signature size edges up subtly compared with others with the improvement of security level.

TI Research on Repeated Quantum Games with Public Goods under Strong
   Reciprocity
SO AXIOMS
AB We developed a repeated quantum game of public goods by using quantum entanglement and strong reciprocity mechanisms. Utilizing the framework of quantum game analysis, a comparative investigation incorporating both entangled and non-entangled states reveals that the player will choose a fully cooperative strategy when the expected cooperation strategy of the competitor exceeds a certain threshold. When the entanglement of states is not considered, the prisoner's dilemma still exists, and the cooperating party must bear the cost of defactoring the quantum strategy themselves; when considering the entanglement of states, the benefits of both parties in the game are closely related, forming a community of benefits. By signing a strong reciprocity contract, the degree of cooperation between the game parties can be considered using the strong reciprocity entanglement contract mechanism. The party striving to cooperate does not have to bear the risk of the other party's defector, and to some extent, it can solve the prisoner's dilemma problem. Finally, taking the public goods green planting industry project as an example, by jointly entrusting a third party to determine and sign a strong reciprocity entanglement contract, both parties can ensure a complete quantum strategy to maximize cooperation and achieve Pareto optimality, ultimately enabling the long-term and stable development of the public goods industry project.

TI Nonreciprocal routing induced by chirality in an atom-dimer
   waveguide-QED system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The implementation of quantum routers is an important and desired task in quantum information science, since quantum routers are important components of quantum networks. Here we propose a scheme for implementing single-photon routers in a waveguide-QED system, which consists of two coupled two-level atoms coupled to two waveguides to form a four-port quantum device. We obtain the exact analytical expressions of the singlephoton scattering amplitudes using the real-space method. By taking into account or disregarding the propagating time of photons between two coupling points, we consider the system working in the Markovian and nonMarkovian regimes, respectively. In addition, we introduce the chiral coupling, which breaks the symmetry of the waveguide model, to manipulate the transmission of single photons. We find that when the system works in the non-Markovian regime, the single photon can be transmitted on demand by adjusting the asymmetry coefficient. More interestingly, the complete single-photon routing in this device does not require an ideal chiral coupling, loosening the photon transport conditions. This work should motivate studies concerning the nonreciprocal and chiral quantum devices in the waveguide-QED platform.

TI Quantum noise may limit the mechanosensory sensitivity of cilia in the
   left-right organizer of the vertebrate bodyplan
SO PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Could nature be harnessing quantum mechanics in cilia to optimize the sensitivity of the mechanism of left-right symmetry breaking during development in vertebrates? I evaluate whether mechanosensing - i.e., the detection of a left-right asymmetric signal through mechanical stimulation of sensory cilia, as opposed to biochemical signalling - might be functioning in the embryonic left-right organizer of the vertebrate bodyplan through quantum mechanics. I conclude that there is a possible role for quantum biology in mechanosensing in cilia. The system may not be limited by classical thermal noise, but instead by quantum noise, with an amplification process providing active cooling.

TI Ground-state cooling of a mechanical oscillator via a hybrid
   electro-optomechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a scheme for ground-state cooling of a mechanical resonator by simultaneously coupling it to a superconducting qubit and a cavity field. The Hamiltonian describing the hybrid system dynamics is systematically derived. The cooling process is driven by a red-detuned ac drive on the qubit and a laser drive on the optomechanical cavity. We have investigated cooling in the weak and the strong coupling regimes for both the individual system, i.e., qubit assisted cooling and optomechanical cooling, and compared them with the effective hybrid cooling. We show that in the weak coupling and resolved sideband regime, cooling is more efficient in the hybrid case for a specific choice of parameters. On the other hand, in the strong coupling, the hybrid cooling is found to be more effective compared to the individual cooling mechanisms in the resolved regimes.

TI Multi-level quantum noise spectroscopy
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB System noise identification is crucial to the engineering of robust quantum systems. Although existing quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) protocols measure an aggregate amount of noise affecting a quantum system, they generally cannot distinguish between the underlying processes that contribute to it. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a spin-locking-based QNS protocol that exploits the multi-level energy structure of a superconducting qubit to achieve two notable advances. First, our protocol extends the spectral range of weakly anharmonic qubit spectrometers beyond the present limitations set by their lack of strong anharmonicity. Second, the additional information gained from probing the higher-excited levels enables us to identify and distinguish contributions from different underlying noise mechanisms. Engineering qubits with long coherence times requires the ability to distinguish multiple noise sources, which is not possible with typical two-level qubit sensors. Here the authors utilize the multiple level transitions of a superconducting qubit to characterize two common types of external noise.

TI A new semiring and its cryptographic applications
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB This paper introduced a novel semiring structure involving nonnegative integers, where operations depended on the comparison of the magnitudes of decimal digit sums. Consequently, a corresponding matrix semiring can be established on this commutative semiring. We showed that the 3-satisfiability problem can be polynomial-time reduced to solving systems of quadratic polynomial equations over this semiring. We proposed a key exchange protocol based on this matrix semiring, with its security relying on the two-sided digital circulant matrix action problem over this semiring. This scheme provides a novel cryptographic primitive for post-quantum cryptography.

TI Direct quantification of topological protection in symmetry-protected
   photonic edge states at telecom wavelengths
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Topological on-chip photonics based on tailored photonic crystals (PhCs) that emulate quantum valley-Hall effects has recently gained widespread interest owing to its promise of robust unidirectional transport of classical and quantum information. We present a direct quantitative evaluation of topological photonic edge eigenstates and their transport properties in the telecom wavelength range using phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. Experimentally visualizing the detailed sub-wavelength structure of these modes propagating along the interface between two topologically non-trivial mirror-symmetric lattices allows us to map their dispersion relation and differentiate between the contributions of several higher-order Bloch harmonics. Selective probing of forward- and backward-propagating modes as defined by their phase velocities enables direct quantification of topological robustness. Studying near-field propagation in controlled defects allows us to extract upper limits of topological protection in on-chip photonic systems in comparison with conventional PhC waveguides. We find that protected edge states are two orders of magnitude more robust than modes of conventional PhC waveguides. This direct experimental quantification of topological robustness comprises a crucial step toward the application of topologically protected guiding in integrated photonics, allowing for unprecedented error-free photonic quantum networks.

AB Current and near-future quantum computers face resource limitations due to noise and low qubit counts. Despite this, effective quantum advantage can still be achieved due to the exponential nature of bit-to-qubit conversion. However, optimizing the software architecture of these systems is essential to utilize available resources efficiently. Unfortunately, the focus on user-friendly quantum computers has obscured critical steps in the software stack, leading to ripple effects into the stack's upper layer induced by limitations in current qubit implementations. This paper unveils the hidden interplay among layers of the quantum software stack.

TI RECONSTRUCTING BAYESIAN NETWORKS ON A QUANTUM ANNEALER
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Bayesian networks are widely used probabilistic graphical models, whose structure is hard to learn starting from the generated data. O'Gorman et al. have proposed an algorithm to encode this task, i.e., the Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), into a form that can be solved through quantum annealing, but they have not provided an experimental evaluation of it. In this paper, we present (i) an implementation in Python of O'Gorman's algorithm, (ii) a divide et impera approach that allows addressing BNSL problems of larger sizes in order to overcome the limitations imposed by the current architectures, and (iii) their empirical evaluation. Specifically, several problems with an increasing number of variables have been used in the experiments. The results have shown the effectiveness of O'Gorman's formulation for BNSL instances of small sizes, and the superiority of the divide et impera approach on the direct execution of O'Gorman's algorithm.

TI QDeepColonNet: a quantum-based deep learning network for colorectal
   cancer classification using attention-driven DenseNet and shuffled
   dynamic local feature extraction network
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and severe types of cancer globally, affecting millions of people each year. It primarily develops from benign polyps in the colon or rectum, which can turn malignant if not detected and treated early, leading to serious health risks. Current diagnostic methods for CRC detection are primarily manual and require significant time, resources and expertise. This creates a pressing need for automated solutions that are both efficient and highly accurate. This research proposes a hybrid Deep Learning (DL) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML)-based system for CRC classification, designed to address these challenges using a dual-track approach. The proposed QDeepColonNet leverages DL for robust feature extraction, combining DenseNet with an Enhanced Feature Learnable Group Attention (EFLGA) block to capture both high and mid-level features. Additionally, it integrates the Shuffled Dynamic Local Feature Extraction Network (SDLFEN) with a Lightweight Multi-Kernel Convolution (LMKC) block to capture short-range dependencies. The concatenated feature maps from both tracks are further refined by Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), enhancing cross-channel interactions without increasing complexity. Finally, the refined features are classified using a QML-based classifier, which effectively handles intricate data and captures complex feature relationships. To the best of our understanding, this is the first study to incorporate a QML-based hybrid classification network CRC detection. The performance of the proposed QDeepColonNet surpassed several state-of-the-art DL models and achieved a classification accuracy of 98.92% when tested on the EBHI dataset.

TI Spin-valley qubits in gated quantum dots in a single layer of transition
   metal dichalcogenides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We develop a microscopic and atomistic theory of electron-spin-based qubits in gated quantum dots in a single layer of transition metal dichalcogenides. The qubits are identified with two degenerate locked spin and valley states in a gated quantum dot. The two qubit states are accurately described using a multimillion atom tight-binding model solved in wave-vector space. The spin-valley locking and strong spin-orbit coupling result in two degenerate states, one of the qubit states being spin down located at the +K valley of the Brillouin zone, and the other state located at the -K valley with spin up. We describe the qubit operations necessary to rotate the spin-valley qubit as a combination of the applied vertical electric field, enabling spin-orbit coupling in a single valley, with a lateral strongly localized valley-mixing gate.

TI Efficient characterization of blinking quantum emitters from scarce data
   sets via machine learning
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Single photon emitters are core building blocks of quantum technologies, with established and emerging applications ranging from quantum computing and communication to metrology and sensing. Regardless of their nature, quantum emitters universally display fluorescence intermittency or photoblinking: interaction with the environment can cause the emitters to undergo quantum jumps between on and off states that correlate with higher and lower photoemission events, respectively. Understanding and quantifying the mechanism and dynamics of photoblinking is important for both fundamental and practical reasons. However, the analysis of blinking time traces is often afflicted by data scarcity. Blinking emitters can photo-bleach and cease to fluoresce over time scales that are too short for their photodynamics to be captured by traditional statistical methods. Here, we demonstrate two approaches based on machine learning that directly address this problem. We present a multi-feature regression algorithm and a genetic algorithm that allow for the extraction of blinking on/off switching rates with >= 85% accuracy, and with >= 10x less data and >= 20x higher precision than traditional methods based on statistical inference. Our algorithms effectively extend the range of surveyable blinking systems and trapping dynamics to those that would otherwise be considered too short-lived to be investigated. They are therefore a powerful tool to help gain a better understanding of the physical mechanism of photoblinking, with practical benefits for applications based on quantum emitters that rely on either mitigating or harnessing the phenomenon.

TI Molecular docking via weighted subgraph isomorphism on quantum annealers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. The proposed quantum annealing-based method for molecular docking achieves valid ligand placements. Compared to simulated annealing, quantum solvers sampled fewer but higher-quality solutions with lower root-mean-square deviation, demonstrating competitive performance within hardware limits.

TI Quantum Walk Experiments Using a 32 x 32 Silicon Photonic
   Path-Independent Insertion Loss Switch as a Stable Multiport
   Interferometer
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We study a 32 x 32 silicon photonic path-independent insertion loss switch used as a programmable multiport interferometer, with a robustness to optical losses appropriate for many classical and quantum photonic applications since any route through the interferometer has the same loss. Its operation stability was investigated by monitoring the fidelity (closeness to the ideal case) of single-photon quantum-walk experiments, where heralded single photons with a 10-nm bandwidth centered at 1547 nm were used as walkers in the interferometer. Fidelities of 0.98 and 0.97 were observed for 4- and 8-step quantum walks, respectively. The experiment took 21 hours to collect the data for the fidelity calculations. Similar fidelities were confirmed using narrowband classical light sources (200-kHz linewidth), for which a fidelity degradation as small as 10(-5)/hour was achieved in the 45-hour free-running operation. The experiments demonstrate that our optical circuit has a wide range of potential applications to classical and quantum photonic processors based on a multiport input-output interference design.

TI Hybrid Optimization Method Using Simulated-Annealing-Based Ising Machine
   and Quantum Annealer
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Ising machines have been developed as fast and highly accurate solvers for combinatorial optimization problems. They are classified based on their internal algorithms, with examples including simulated-annealing-based Ising machines (non-quantum-type Ising machines) and quantum-annealing-based Ising machines (quantum annealers). Herein, we have investigated the performance of a hybrid optimization method that capitalizes on the advantages of both types, utilizing a non-quantum-type Ising machine to enhance the performance of the quantum annealer. In this method, the non-quantum-annealing Ising machine initially solves an original Ising model multiple times during preprocessing. Subsequently, reduced-size sub-Ising models, generated by spin fixing, are solved by a quantum annealer. Performance of the method is evaluated via simulations using Simulated Annealing (SA) as a non-quantum-type Ising machine and D-Wave Advantage as a quantum annealer. Additionally, we investigate the parameter dependence of the hybrid optimization method. The method outperforms the preprocessing SA and the quantum annealer alone in fully connected random Ising models.

TI Some constructions of quantum MDS codes
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We construct quantum MDS codes with parameters [[q(2) + 1, q(2) + 3 - 2d, d]](q) for all d <= q + 1, d not equal q. These codes are shown to exist by proving that there are classical generalised Reed-Solomon codes which contain their Hermitian dual. These constructions include many constructions which were previously known but in some cases these codes are new. We go on to prove that if d >= q + 2 then there is no generalised Reed-Solomon [n, n - d + 1, d](q2) code which contains its Hermitian dual. We also construct an [[18, 0, 10](5) quantum MDS code, an [[18, 0, 10]](7) quantum MDS code and a [[14, 0, 8]](5) quantum MDS code, which are the first quantum MDS codes discovered for which d >= q + 3, apart from the [[10, 0, 6]](3) quantum MDS code derived from Glynn's code.

TI Wafer-scale nanofabrication of telecom single-photon emitters in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A highly promising route to scale millions of qubits is to use quantum photonic integrated circuits (PICs), where deterministic photon sources, reconfigurable optical elements, and single-photon detectors are monolithically integrated on the same silicon chip. The isolation of single-photon emitters, such as the G centers and W centers, in the optical telecommunication O-band, has recently been realized in silicon. In all previous cases, however, single-photon emitters were created uncontrollably in random locations, preventing their scalability. Here, we report the controllable fabrication of single G and W centers in silicon wafers using focused ion beams (FIB) with high probability. We also implement a scalable, broad-beam implantation protocol compatible with the complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology to fabricate single telecom emitters at desired positions on the nanoscale. Our findings unlock a clear and easily exploitable pathway for industrial-scale photonic quantum processors with technology nodes below 100 nm. The recently demonstrated approaches to fabrication of quantum emitters in silicon result in their random positioning, hindering applications in quantum photonic integrated circuits. Here the authors demonstrate controlled fabrication of telecom-wavelength quantum emitters in silicon wafers by focused ion beams.

TI Extremely large lamb shift in a deep-strongly coupled circuit QED system
   with a multimode resonator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We report experimental and theoretical results on the extremely large Lamb shift in a multimode circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system in the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, where the qubit-resonator coupling strength is comparable to or larger than the qubit and resonator frequencies. The system comprises a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) and a quarter-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator (lambda/4 CPWR) that are coupled inductively through a shared edge that contains a Josephson junction to achieve the DSC regime. Spectroscopy is performed around the frequency of the fundamental mode of the CPWR, and the spectrum is fitted by the single-mode quantum Rabi Hamiltonian to obtain the system parameters. Since the qubit is also coupled to a large number of higher modes in the resonator, the single-mode fitting does not provide the bare qubit energy but a value that incorporates the renormalization from all the other modes. We derive theoretical formulas for the Lamb shift in the multimode resonator system. As shown in previous studies, there is a cut-off frequency omega(cutoff) for the coupling between the FQ and the modes in the CPWR, where the coupling grows as root omega(n) for omega(n)/omega(cutoff) << 1 and decreases as root omega(n) for omega(n)/omega(cutof) >> 1. Here omega(n) is the frequency of the nth mode. The cut-off effect occurs because the qubit acts as an obstacle for the current in the resonator, which suppresses the current of the modes above omega(cutoff) at the location of the qubit and results in a reduced coupling strength. Using our observed spectrum and theoretical formulas, we estimate that the Lamb shift from the fundamental mode is 82.3% and the total Lamb shift from all the modes is 96.5%. This result illustrates that the coupling to the large number of modes in a CPWR yields an extremely large Lamb shift but does not suppress the qubit energy to zero, which would happen in the absence of a high-frequency cut-off.

TI Investigating the Chinese postman problem on a quantum annealer
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The recent availability of quantum annealers has fueled a new area of information technology where such devices are applied to address practically motivated and computationally difficult problems with hardware that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. D-Wave annealers are promising platforms to solve these problems in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. Here we provide a formulation of the Chinese postman problem that can be used as a tool for probing the local connectivity of graphs and networks. We treat the problem classically with a tabu algorithm and simulated annealing, and using a D-Wave device. The efficiency of quantum annealing with respect to the simulated annealing has been demonstrated using the optimal time to solution metric. We systematically analyze computational parameters associated with the specific hardware. Our results clarify how the interplay between the embedding due to limited connectivity of the Chimera graph, the definition of logical qubits, and the role of spin-reversal controls the probability of reaching the expected solution.

TI Classically verifiable quantum advantage from a computational Bell test
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Existing experimental demonstrations of quantum computational advantage have had the limitation that verifying the correctness of the quantum device requires exponentially costly classical computations. Here we propose and analyse an interactive protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage, which is efficiently classically verifiable. Our protocol relies on a class of cryptographic tools called trapdoor claw-free functions. Although this type of function has been applied to quantum advantage protocols before, our protocol employs a surprising connection to Bell's inequality to avoid the need for a demanding cryptographic property called the adaptive hardcore bit, while maintaining essentially no increase in the quantum circuit complexity and no extra assumptions. Leveraging the relaxed cryptographic requirements of the protocol, we present two trapdoor claw-free function constructions, based on Rabin's function and the Diffie-Hellman problem, which have not been used in this context before. We also present two independent innovations that improve the efficiency of our implementation and can be applied to other quantum cryptographic protocols. First, we give a scheme to discard so-called garbage bits, removing the need for reversibility in the quantum circuits. Second, we show a natural way of performing postselection that reduces the fidelity needed to demonstrate quantum advantage. Combining these results, we describe a blueprint for implementing our protocol on Rydberg atom-based quantum devices, using hardware-native operations that have already been demonstrated experimentally.
   Interactive protocols can verify that a quantum computer exhibits a computational speedup using only classical analysis of its output. Exploiting a connection to Bell's theorem gives a simpler protocol that is much less demanding for experiments.

TI Snowmass white paper: beyond the standard model effects on neutrino
   flavor
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Neutrinos are one of the most promising messengers for signals of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). On the theoretical side, their elusive nature, combined with their unknown mass mechanism, seems to indicate that the neutrino sector is indeed opening a window to new physics. On the experimental side, several long-standing anomalies have been reported in the past decades, providing a strong motivation to thoroughly test the standard three-neutrino oscillation paradigm. In this Snowmass21 white paper, we explore the potential of current and future neutrino experiments to explore BSM effects on neutrino flavor during the next decade.

TI Building blocks of a flip-chip integrated superconducting quantum
   processor
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We have integrated single and coupled superconducting transmon qubits into flip-chip modules. Each module consists of two chips-one quantum chip and one control chip-that are bump-bonded together. We demonstrate time-averaged coherence times exceeding 90 mu s, single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.9%, and two-qubit gate fidelities above 98.6%. We also present device design methods and discuss the sensitivity of device parameters to variation in interchip spacing. Notably, the additional flip-chip fabrication steps do not degrade the qubit performance compared to our baseline state-of-the-art in single-chip, planar circuits. This integration technique can be extended to the realisation of quantum processors accommodating hundreds of qubits in one module as it offers adequate input/output wiring access to all qubits and couplers.

TI Relaxation-assisted reverse annealing on nonnegative/binary matrix
   factorization
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.
