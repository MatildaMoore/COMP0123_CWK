TI Ultra-low-noise microwave to optics conversion in gallium phosphide
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coherently interfacing microwave and optical radiation at the single photon level is an outstanding challenge in quantum technologies. Here, the authors show bi-directional on-chip conversion between MW and optical frequencies exploiting piezoelectric actuation of a gallium phosphide optomechanical resonator.
   Mechanical resonators can act as excellent intermediaries to interface single photons in the microwave and optical domains due to their high quality factors. Nevertheless, the optical pump required to overcome the large energy difference between the frequencies can add significant noise to the transduced signal. Here we exploit the remarkable properties of thin-film gallium phosphide to demonstrate bi-directional on-chip conversion between microwave and optical frequencies, realized by piezoelectric actuation of a Gigahertz-frequency optomechanical resonator. The large optomechanical coupling and the suppression of two-photon absorption in the material allows us to operate the device at optomechanical cooperativities greatly exceeding one. Alternatively, when using a pulsed upconversion pump, we demonstrate that we induce less than one thermal noise phonon. We include a high-impedance on-chip matching resonator to mediate the mechanical load with the 50-omega source. Our results establish gallium phosphide as a versatile platform for ultra-low-noise conversion of photons between microwave and optical frequencies.

TI Microcavity-Modified Emission from Rare-Earth Ion-Based Molecular
   Complexes
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Despite the remarkable optical properties of rare-earth ion materials, their applications as light sources and in quantum technologies are often hindered by their long lifetimes and weak emission. Leveraging the natural compatibility of rare-earth ion molecular complexes with photonic structures, here we modify their photoluminescence properties by coupling them to a flexible open Fabry-Perot cavity. The full in situ tunability of the Fabry-Perot cavity allows fine control over its cavity modes and the achievement of resonant coupling between the rare-earth ion emission and the cavity modes. This configuration allows us to achieve a maximum photoluminescence enhancement factor of 30 and accelerate the decay rate up to two orders of magnitude. Our pump-power-dependent spectroscopic studies of the emitter-cavity system suggest that the cavity-modified emission is primarily caused by amplified spontaneous emission. These results suggest that integrating rare-earth ion molecular complexes with photonic structures could be a viable approach for the effective tuning of their optical properties. This natural compatibility, together with their versatile molecular structures and the resultant electronic states, renders rare-earth ion molecular complexes a potential alternative material platform for lighting and quantum applications.

TI Chiral and Quantum Plasmonic Sensors: New Frontiers in Selective and
   Ultra-Sensitive Sensing
SO SMALL
AB Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances (LSPRs) are fundamental phenomena in plasmonics that enable the confinement of electromagnetic waves beyond the diffraction limit. This confinement results in a significant enhancement of the electric field, making this phenomenon particularly beneficial for sensitive detection applications. However, conventional plasmonic sensors face several challenges, notably their difficulty in distinguishing chiral molecules, which are vital in drug development. Furthermore, these sensors exhibit sensitivity issues and energy losses, leading to broader resonance peaks and diminished signal-to-noise ratios. Recent research has concentrated on integrating chirality and quantum effects in plasmonics to overcome these limitations. Particularly, the development of plasmonic sensors with exceptional sensitivity and precision at scales smaller than the diffraction limit. This review assesses the latest advancements in chiral and quantum plasmonic sensing technologies. The first section details the theory and operational principles of conventional sensors based on SPPs and LSPRs. The second section discusses recent developments in chiral plasmonic sensors, while the third section focuses on plasmonic quantum sensing, highlighting contemporary findings. Specifically, this section emphasizes quantum-enhanced sensing techniques that mitigate shot noise, a significant barrier to single-molecule detection. The concluding section summarizes the review and identifies potential future research directions.

TI Molecular dynamics simulation study of nitrogen vacancy color centers
   prepared by carbon ion implantation into diamond
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION ENGINEERING
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have useful applications in quantum sensing and fluorescent marking. They can be generated experimentally by ion implantation, femtosecond lasers, and chemical vapor deposition. However, there is a lack of studies of the yield of NV color centers at the atomic scale. In the molecular dynamics simulations described in this paper, NV color centers are prepared by ion implantation in diamond with pre-doped nitrogen and subsequent annealing. The differences between the yields of NV color centers produced by implantation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) ions, respectively, are investigated. It is found that C-ion implantation gives a greater yield of NV color centers and superior location accuracy. The effects of different pre-doping concentrations (400-1500 ppm) and implantation energies (1.0-3.0 keV) on the NV color center yield are analyzed, and it is shown that a pre-doping concentration of 1000 ppm with 2 keV C-ion implantation can produce a 13% yield of NV color centers after 1600 K annealing for 7.4 ns. Finally, a brief comparison of the NV color center identification methods is presented, and it is found that the error rate of an analysis utilizing the identify diamond structure + coordination analysis method is reduced by about 7% compared with conventional identification methods.

TI Fast simulation for interacting four-level Rydberg atoms:
   electromagnetically induced transparency and Autler-Townes splitting
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum sensing using Rydberg atoms is an emerging technology for precise measurement of electric fields. However, most existing computational methods are all based on a single -particle model and neglect Rydberg -Rydberg interaction between atoms. In this study, we introduce the interaction term into the conventional four -level optical Bloch equations. By incorporating fast iterations and solving for the steady-state solution efficiently, we avoid the computation of a massive 4 N x 4 N dimensional matrix. Additionally, we apply the Doppler frequency shift to each atom used in the calculation, eliminating the requirement for an additional Doppler iteration. These schemes allow for the calculation of the interaction between 7000 atoms around one minute. Based on the many -body model, we investigate the Rydberg -Rydberg interaction of Rydberg atoms under different atomic densities. Furthermore, we compare our results with the literature data of a three -level system and the experimental results of our own four -level system. The results demonstrate the validity of our model, with an effective error of 4.59% compared to the experimental data. Finally, we discover that the many -body model better predicts the linear range for measuring electric fields than the single -particle model, making it highly applicable in precise electric field measurements.

TI Thin-film InGaAs metamorphic buffer for telecom C-band InAs quantum dots
   and optical resonators on GaAs platform
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The GaAs-based material system is well-known for hosting InAs quantum dots (QDs) with outstanding optical properties, typically emitting at a wavelength of around 900 nm. The insertion of a metamorphic buffer (MMB) can shift this emission to the technologically attractive telecom C-band range centered at 1550 nm. However, the thickness of common MMB designs (>1 mu m) limits their compatibility with most photonic resonator types. Here, we report on the metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) growth of a novel InGaAs MMB with a nonlinear indium content grading profile designed to maximize plastic relaxation within minimal layer thickness. This allows us to achieve the necessary transition of the lattice constant and to provide a smooth surface for QD growth within 180 nm. Single-photon emission at 1550 nm from InAs QDs deposited on top of this thin-film MMB is demonstrated. The strength of the new design is proven by integrating it into a bullseye cavity via nano-structuring techniques. The presented advances in the epitaxial growth of QD/MMB structures form the basis for the fabrication of high-quality telecom nonclassical light sources as a key component of photonic quantum technologies.

TI Semicomputational calculation of Bragg shift in stratified materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) may be viewed as a one dimensional photonic band-gap crystal by virtue of the periodic spatial perturbation imposed on the fiber core dielectric material. Similar to media supporting Bloch waves, the engraved weak index modulation, presenting a periodic "potential" to an incoming guided mode photon of the fiber, yields useful spectral properties that have been the basis for sensing applications and emerging quantum squeezing and solitons. The response of an FBG sensor to arbitrary external stimuli represents a multiphysics problem without a known analytical solution despite the growing use of FBGs in classical and quantum sensing and metrology. Here, we study this problem by first presenting a solid mechanics model for the thermal and elastic states of a stratified material. The model considers an embedded optical material domain that represents the Bragg grating, here in the form of an FBG. Using the output of this model, we then compute the optical modes and their temperature- and stress-induced behavior. The developed model is applicable to media of arbitrary shape and composition, including soft matter and materials with nonlinear elasticity and geometric nonlinearity. Finally, we employ the computed surface stress and temperature distributions along the grating to analytically calculate the Bragg shift, which is found to be in reasonable agreement with our experimental measurements.

TI Laser-Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The competing and non-equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (K-TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns pulsed laser (532 nm, 15 MW cm(-2), 10 Hz) in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long-lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (approximate to 42 omega cm), showing the charge-spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high-pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such an transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicate charge-spin-lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh-strain-rate (above 10(6) s(-)(1)) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro-magnetic phases with technological promises.

TI Achieving High-Yield Conversion of Janus Transition Metal
   Dichalcogenides on Diverse Substrates
SO ACS NANO
AB Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intrinsic broken mirror symmetry and vertical dipole moment provide an additional degree of freedom to manipulate material symmetry down to atomic-layer thickness. However, despite advances in synthesis strategies, fundamental understanding of this atomic substitution process remains limited, which has impeded their implementation in advanced devices. Here, by using a room-temperature atomic-layer substitution (RT-ALS) strategy, we systematically investigate the critical factors facilitating the high-yield conversion of Janus TMDCs on diverse substrates. Combining Raman spectroscopy probes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that substrates with enhanced electron doping or larger surface polarity substantially benefit the conversion of Janus TMDCs reaching a near-unity yield. Intriguingly, the strong affinity between Janus TMDCs and substrates (e.g., Au) brings about abnormal Raman spectroscopic phenomena. These findings highlight the significance of substrates in achieving the reliable synthesis of Janus two-dimensional materials with improved homogeneity on various substrates. In addition, this takes us one step closer to utilizing Janus TMDCs as a versatile platform in next-generation optoelectronic devices, sensors, and quantum technologies.

TI Student review of innovations in quantum biophotonics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB The aim of the paper is to show how graduated engineering students in classical ICT view practically the advent of the QIT. The students do their theses in El.Eng. and ICT and were asked how to implement now or in the future the QIT in their current or future work. Most of them have strictly defined research topics and in some cases t he r ealization stage is advanced. Thus, most of the potential QIT application areas are defined and quite narrow. In s uch a case, the issue t o be considered is the incorporation of QIT components and interfaces into the existing ICT infrastructure, software and hardware alike, and propose a solution as a reasonable functional hybrid system. The QIT components or circuits are not standalone in most cases, they should be somehow incorporated into existing environment, with a measurable added value. Not an easy task indeed. We have to excuse the students if the proposed solutions are not ripe enough. The exercise was proposed as an on-purpose publication workshop, related strictly to the fast and fascinating development of the QIT. The paper is a continuation of publishing exercises with previous groups of students participating in QIT lectures.

TI A Framework to Compute Resonances Arising from Multiple Scattering
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi-scattering framework is coupled with the state-of-the-art adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. The AAA algorithm is tied into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi-scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton-polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi-scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.

TI Twist-angle dependent dehybridization of momentum-indirect excitons in
   MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructures
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB The moire superlattice has emerged as a powerful way to tune excitonic properties in two-dimensional van der Waals structures. However, the current understanding of the influence of the twist angle for interlayer excitons (IXs) in heterostructures is mainly limited to momentum-direct K-K transitions. In this work, we use a judicious combination of spectroscopy and many-particle theory to investigate the influence of the twist angle on momentum-indirect IXs of a MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructure. Here, the energetically lowest state is a dark and strongly hybridized Gamma K exciton. We show that increasing the twist angle from an aligned structure (0(circle) or 60(circle)) gives rise to a large blue shift of the IX, which is a manifestation of the strong dehybridization of this state. Moreover, for small twist angle heterostructures, our photoluminescence measurements reveal contributions from two IX states, which our modelling attributes to transitions from different moire minibands. Our finding contributes to a better fundamental understanding of the influence of the moire pattern on the hybridization of momentum-dark IX states, which may be important for applications in moire-tronics including novel quantum technologies.

TI Simulation study of ultrahigh-precision single-ion extraction from a
   linear Paul trap
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB A detailed simulation study is conducted to explore the possibility of transporting a single ion precisely along a particular design orbit. As a practically useful example, we consider nitrogen ions sympathetically cooled with ultracold calcium ions produced in a linear Paul trap (LPT) by the Doppler laser-cooling technique. A single nitrogen almost completely frozen in the laboratory frame is extracted from the LPT by manipulating the axial potential barriers. A similar idea was recently implemented by Groot-Berning et al. [New J. Phys. 23, 063067 (2021)] to create nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a platform for some important quantum technologies. We here perform systematic 3D simulations taking a standard LPT structure into account and figure out the necessary conditions to achieve the ultrahigh-precision irradiation of a single nitrogen onto any target. In addition to the string Coulomb crystal used in the previous work above, we show that even the shell crystalline structure can be employed for our purpose. When several specific conditions are satisfied, a normalized root-mean-squared emittance of ejected nitrogen ions can be made of the order of 10(-16) m center dot rad in transverse dimensions perpendicular to the design orbit.

TI Advanced functionalization strategies of diamond and diamond-like carbon
   for emerging applications in sensing, electronics, and energy conversion
SO CARBON TRENDS
AB This comprehensive review aims to rigorously assess how sophisticated functionalization methodologies enhance the structural, electronic, and interfacial properties of diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) materials, thereby facilitating their integration into high-performance sensors, electronic devices, and energy conversion systems. In particular, we investigate heteroatom doping, covalent grafting, nanostructuring, and hybridization with two-dimensional (2D) materials, thereby establishing explicit correlations between processing techniques and performance metrics. Notable findings documented in the literature indicate that boron doping reduces the resistivity of diamond to approximately 10-252 & sdot;cm while preserving electrochemical stability, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers permit nanotesla-level quantum magnetometry with coherence durations surpassing 100 mu s, nanostructuring amplifies the electroactive surface area by as much as tenfold and diminishes the oxygen evolution overpotential by approximately 100 mV, and diamond/DLC-graphene composites achieve specific capacitance values exceeding 250F g-1 with sheet resistances below 5052 sq-1. These advancements have led to significant improvements in electrochemical biosensors, high-frequency field-effect transistors, flexible supercapacitors, and robust fuel cell electrodes. Furthermore, the review delineates ongoing challenges associated with lattice distortions, surface instability, and scalable manufacturing, while proposing future directions focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted material design, eco-friendly synthesis routes, and standardized benchmarking protocols to expedite industrial implementation.

TI Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic
   separation of pump and signal tones
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of similar to 2000, we measured a peak signal gain of 15dB whilst achieving pump separation of 12dB. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be 0.15dB over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at 3.2K and achieved a peak signal gain of 11dB whilst having a pump separation factor of 10.5dB. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.

TI Magnon-phonon interactions from first principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here, we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in two-dimensional ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation times decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, revealing a low-energy window where magnons are long lived. Averaging over this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this Letter enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.

TI Establishing coherent momentum-space electronic states in locally
   ordered materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Rich momentum-dependent electronic structure naturally arises in solids with long-range crystalline symmetry. Reliable and scalable quantum technologies rely on materials that are either not perfect crystals or non-crystalline, breaking translational symmetry. This poses the fundamental questions of whether coherent momentum-dependent electronic states can arise without long-range order, and how they can be characterized. Here we investigate Bi2Se3, which exists in crystalline, nanocrystalline, and amorphous forms, allowing direct comparisons between varying degrees of spatial ordering. Through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show for the first time momentum-dependent band structure with Fermi surface repetitions in an amorphous solid. The experimental data is complemented by a model that accurately reproduces the vertical, dispersive features as well as the replication at higher momenta in the amorphous form. These results reveal that well-defined real-space length scales are sufficient to produce dispersive band structures, and that photoemission can expose the imprint of these length scales on the electronic structure.
   Recent studies showing dispersive surface states in an amorphous topological insulator has deepened the understanding of momentum-space electronic structure. Here the authors report dispersive electronic states and a distinct Fermi surface with Brillouin-zone-like repetitions in amorphous Bi2Se3.

TI Slit-loaded coplanar waveguide for color-center spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The spin qubits of color centers are extensively investigated for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing, with their states generally controlled using lasers and microwaves. However, it is challenging to effectively irradiate both lasers and microwaves onto color centers using small-footprint microwave waveguides or antennas that are compatible with semiconductor devices. We show experimentally that, by introducing a compact coplanar waveguide with a thin slit in its signal line, effective irradiation of both lasers and microwaves is enabled, allowing spin-state control of color centers created around the slit. Microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, intrinsically generated by a standard coplanar waveguide, persist even after loading the slit, which is necessary to control the color centers whose spin quantization axes are oriented perpendicular to the surface, while laser light for the initialization and readout of spin states can access the color centers through the slit. Continuous and pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance measurements are performed for the silicon vacancies (VSi) in silicon carbide 4H-SiC(0001). Experimental results indicate that the spin states of VSi are effectively controlled by the microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, which agrees with numerical results from electromagnetic field simulations. Our small-footprint waveguide is suitable for integrating color-center-based quantum sensors into semiconductor electronic devices and other small-scale systems.

TI Probing molecules in gas cells of subwavelength thickness with high
   frequency resolution
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Miniaturizing and integrating atomic vapor cells is widely investigated for the purposes of fundamental measurements and technological applications such as quantum sensing. Extending such platforms to the realm of molecular physics is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for compact frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interactions with complex quantum objects. Here, we perform molecular rovibrational spectroscopy in a thin-cell of micrometric thickness, comparable to excitation wavelengths. We operate the cell in two distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, probing nu 1 + nu 3 resonances of acetylene at 1.530 mu m, within the telecommunications wavelength range, as well as the nu 3 and nu 2 resonances of SF6 and NH3 respectively, in the mid-infrared fingerprint region around 10.55 mu m. Thin-cell confinement allows linear sub-Doppler transmission spectroscopy due to the coherent Dicke narrowing effect, here demonstrated for molecular rovibrations. Our experiment can find applications extending to the fields of compact molecular frequency references, atmospheric physics or fundamental precision measurements.
   Using gas cells for spectroscopic studies opens possibility for miniaturized platforms that can be integrated with other optical components. Here the authors demonstrate molecular rovibrational spectroscopy by confining molecules in a cell of subwavelength thickness.

TI Varied Magnetic Phases in a van der Waals Easy-Plane Antiferromagnet
   Revealed by Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Microscopy
SO ACS NANO
AB Interest in van der Waals materials often stems from a desire to miniaturize existing technologies by exploiting their intrinsic layered structures to create near-atomically thin components that do not suffer from surface defects. One appealing property is an easily switchable yet robust magnetic order, which is only sparsely demonstrated in the case of in plane anisotropy. In this work, we use widefield nitrogen vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to measure the properties of individual flakes of CuCrP2S6, a multiferroic van der Waals magnet known to exhibit weak easy-plane anisotropy in the bulk. We chart the crossover between the in-plane ferromagnetism in thin flakes down to the trilayer and the bulk behavior dominated by a low-field spin-flop transition. Further, by exploiting the directional dependence of NV center magnetometry, we are able to observe an instance of a predominantly out-of-plane ferromagetic phase near zero field, in contrast with our expectation and previous experiments on the bulk material. We attribute this to the presence of surface anisotropies caused by the sample preparation process or exposure to the ambient environment, which is expected to have more general implications for a broader class of weakly anisotropic van der Waals magnets.

TI Correlation Technologies for Emerging Wireless Applications
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In this article, we introduce correlation technologies both at RF/mmWave and baseband frequencies. At RF and mmWave frequencies, power-spectra and energy-spectra metrics are introduced for measuring the power-density of mobile devices and systems. New ASIC-embedded smart connectors are developed for bringing correlation-based signal processing close to antenna modules. At baseband frequencies, DSP-based convolutional accelerators are proposed for fast and accurate measurement of EVM (error vector magnitude) using correlation technologies. Porting of the DSP-based convolutional accelerators into advanced fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI)-based ASIC platforms for co-integration with adaptive RF/mmWave front-end modules will enable real-time extraction of auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions of stochastic signals. Perspectives for optically synchronized interferometric-correlation technologies are drawn for accurate measurements in noisy environments of stochastic EM fields using power-spectra and energy-spectra metrics. Adoption of correlation technologies will foster new paradigms relative to interactions of humans with smart devices and systems in randomly fluctuating environments. The resulting new paradigms will open new possibilities in communication theory for properly combining and reconciling information signal theory (Shannon information-based entropy) and physical information theory (statistical-physics-based entropy) into a unified framework.

TI Reconfigurable nonlinear Pancharatnam-Berry diffractive optics with
   photopatterned ferroelectric nematics
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Planar optical elements incorporating space-varying Pancharatnam-Berry phase have revolutionized the manipulation of light fields by enabling continuous control over amplitude, phase, and polarization. While previous research focusing on linear functionalities using apolar liquid crystals (LCs) has attracted much attention, extending this concept to the nonlinear regime offers unprecedented opportunities for advanced optical processing. Here, we demonstrate the reconfigurable nonlinear Pancharatnam-Berry LC diffractive optics in photopatterned ion-doped ferroelectric nematics. By customizing the spatial phase distribution of efficient second-harmonic excitation, we accomplish programmable beam steering of various optical states towards predefined diffraction directions. Experimental results reveal continuous evolution of diffraction orders, intensity distributions, and polarization states under electrically varying splay conditions, consistent with our theoretical predictions. This work opens new avenues for designing reconfigurable nonlinear beam shaping and steering devices with potential applications in advanced optical and quantum information processing.

TI Experimental verification of entangled states in the adversarial
   scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efficient verification of entangled states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, the effectiveness of standard quantum state verification (QSV) is based on the condition of independent and identical distribution (IID), which impedes its applications in many practical scenarios. Here we demonstrate a defensive QSV protocol, which is effective in all kinds of non-IID scenarios, including the extremely challenging adversarial scenario. To this end, we build a high-speed preparationand-measurement apparatus controlled by quantum random-number generators. Our experiments clearly show that standard QSV protocols often provide unreliable fidelity certificates in non-IID scenarios. In sharp contrast, the defensive QSV protocol based on a homogeneous strategy can provide reliable and nearly tight fidelity certificates at comparable high efficiency, even under malicious attacks. Moreover, our scheme is tolerant of the imperfections in a realistic experiment, which is very appealing to practical applications.

TI Regularized entanglement entropy of electron-positron scattering with a
   witness photon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Regularized quantum information metrics are calculated for the scattering process e-e+-* gamma; Z-* mu - mu + that has a witness photon entangled with the initial electron-positron state. Unitarity implies the correct regularization of divergences that appear in both the final density matrix and von Neumann entanglement entropies. The entropies are found to quantify uncertainty or randomness. The variation of information, entanglement entropy, and correlation between the muon's and witness photon's helicities are found to convey equivalent information. The magnitude of the muon's expected helicity rises (falls) as the helicity entropy falls (rises). Area, or the scattering cross section, is a source of entropy for the muon's helicity entropy and momentum entropy. The muon's differential angular entropy distribution is similar to the differential angular cross section distribution, capturing the forward-backward asymmetry at high center- of-mass energies.

TI Disordered monitored free fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Scrambling of quantum information in unitary evolution can be hindered due to measurements and localization, which pin quantum mechanical wave functions in real space, suppressing entanglement in the steady state. In monitored free-fermionic models, the steady state undergoes an entanglement transition from a logarithmically entangled critical state to area law. However, disorder can lead to Anderson localization. We investigate free fermions in a random potential with continuous monitoring, which enables us to probe the interplay between measurement-induced and localized phases. We show that the critical phase is stable up to a finite disorder, and the criticality is consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality. Furthermore, monitoring destroys localization, and the area-law phase at weak dissipation exhibits power-law decay of single-particle wave functions. Our work opens an avenue to probe this phase transition in electronic systems of quantum dot arrays and nanowires and allow quantum control of entangled states.

TI Controllable Spin-Split Phantom Scars in Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum states of systems with an underlying classical chaotic dynamics can be "scarred," meaning that the associated probability density is localized around the short, unstable periodic orbits. Here, it is shown that, via tunneling, the scarred state can be imaged to a region that does not support scarring. This "phantom scar" is also present in the spin channel and has marked influence on the spin-dependent system dynamics, as illustrated by explicit calculations for the fidelity and correlation functions. Numerical simulations and analysis are performed for the spin-dependent electron dynamics in semiconductor-based double quantum dots, including disorder, Rashba-type spin-orbital coupling, exchange fields, and external magnetic fields. The results elucidate the unique feature of scarring as a coherent phenomenon spanning the whole system and affecting its localization properties in a narrow spectral window.

TI High finesse microcavities in the optical telecom O-band
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Optical microcavities allow us to strongly confine light in small mode volumes and with long photon lifetimes. This confinement significantly enhances the interaction between light and matter inside the cavity with applications such as optical trapping and cooling of nanoparticles, single-photon emission enhancement, quantum information processing, and sensing. For many applications, open resonators with direct access to the mode volume are necessary. Here, we report on a scalable, open-access optical microcavity platform with mode volumes < 30 lambda(3) and finesse approaching 5 x 10(5). This result significantly exceeds the highest optical enhancement factors achieved to date for Fabry-Perot microcavities. This platform provides a building block for high-performance quantum devices relying on strong light-matter interactions. (c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Using an Atom Interferometer to Infer Gravitational Entanglement
   Generation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB If gravitational perturbations are quantized into gravitons in analogy with the electromagnetic field and photons, the resulting graviton interactions should lead to an entangling interaction between massive objects. We suggest a test of this prediction. To do this, we introduce the concept of interactive quantum information sensing. This novel sensing protocol is tailored to provable verification of weak dynamical entanglement generation between a pair of systems. We show that this protocol is highly robust to typical thermal noise sources. Moreover, the sensitivity can be increased both using an initial thermal state and/or an initial phase of entangling via a nongravitational interaction. We outline a concrete implementation testing the ability of the gravitational field to generate entanglement between an atomic interferometer and a mechanical oscillator. Preliminary numerical estimates suggest that near-term devices could feasibly be used to perform the experiment.

TI Programmable Mach-Zehnder Interferometer without bends for high density
   and integrated linear operation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB The growth in computing demands driven by the advancements in artificial intelligence and data communication necessitate energy-efficient devices that can process information at high speeds and integrate seamlessly into compact platforms. Integrated photonic devices, networks of tunable Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) in particular, have emerged as a promising platform for performing linear computational tasks. The existing MZI networks suffer from having large footprint, significant losses and poor scalability. We present a novel design of MZI which does not have bends and, consequently, it has no bending losses, is significantly less complex and smaller than the conventional MZIs resulting in improved performance and enhanced device scalability. This work is a significant step towards the realization of larger and denser MZI networks enabling applications in both classical and quantum information processing tasks.

TI Mutual Correlation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantifying correlation and complexity in quantum many-body states is central to advancing theoretical and computational chemistry, physics, and quantum information science. This work introduces a novel framework, mutual correlation, based on the Frobenius norm squared of the two-body reduced density matrix cumulant. Through systematic partitioning of the cumulant norm, mutual correlation quantifies nonadditive correlations among interacting subsystems. To assess the ability of mutual correlation to identify orbital interactions, we performed benchmark studies on model systems, including H10, N2, and p-benzyne, and performed a formal and numerical comparison with orbital mutual information. Maximally correlated orbitals, obtained by maximizing a nonlinear cost function of the mutual correlation, are also considered to identify a basis-independent partitioning of correlation. This study suggests that mutual correlation is a broadly applicable metric, useful in active space selection and the interpretation of electronic states.

TI Modulating spin-valley relaxation in WSe2 with variable
   thickness VOPc layers
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Combining the synthetic tunability of molecular compounds with the optical selection rules of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) that derive from spin-valley coupling could provide interesting opportunities for the readout of quantum information. However, little is known about the electronic and spin interactions at such interfaces and the influence on spin-valley relaxation. In this work, vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecular layers are thermally evaporated on WSe2 to explore the effect of molecular layer thickness on excited-state spin-valley polarization. The thinnest molecular layer supports an interfacial state which destroys the spin-valley polarization almost instantaneously, whereas a thicker molecular layer results in longer-lived spin-valley polarization than the WSe2 monolayer alone. The mechanism appears to involve a tightly bound species at the molecule/TMDC interface that strengthens exchange interactions and is largely avoided in thicker VOPc layers that isolate electrons from WSe2 holes.

TI Decoherence of cosmological perturbations from boundary terms and the
   non-classicality of gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We note that the decoherence of inflationary curvature perturbation zeta is dominated by a boundary term of the gravity action. Although this boundary term cannot affect cosmological correlators <zeta(n)& rang;, it induces much faster decoherence for zeta than that of previous calculations. The gravitational origin of inflationary decoherence sheds light on the quantum (or non-classical) nature of gravity. By comparing with a Schrodinger-Newton toy model of classical gravity, we show that gravity theories of classical or quantum origins can be distinguished by comparing their different impacts on decoherence rate of zeta. Our calculation also indicates that density fluctuation delta rho better preserves quantum information than zeta for the purpose of constructing cosmological Bell-like experiments.

TI Dissipative Phase Transition in Systems with Two-Photon Drive and
   Nonlinear Dissipation near the Critical Point
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this paper, we examine dissipative phase transition (DPT) near the critical point for a system with two-photon driving and nonlinear dissipations. The proposed mean-field theory, which explicitly takes into account quantum fluctuations, allowed us to describe properly the evolutionary dynamics of the system and to demonstrate new effects in its steady-state. We show that the presence of quantum fluctuations leads to a power-law dependence of the anomalous average at the phase transition point, with which the critical exponent is associated. Also, we investigate the effect of the quantum fluctuations on the critical point renormalization and demonstrate the existence of a two-photon pump "threshold". It is noteworthy that the obtained results are in a good agreement with the numerical simulations.

TI Optimal fidelity witnesses for gravitational entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optomechanical systems open new possibilities in fundamental research at the interface between quantum information and gravity. Recently, an ambitious experimental proposal was suggested by Bose et al. [S. Bose, G. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 240401 (2017)] to measure the entanglement between two optomechanical systems generated by their gravitational interaction. The scheme relied on witnessing entanglement between the two systems. Here we develop a general framework to study the quality of bipartite entanglement witnesses using fidelity witnesses. We then apply this framework to the gravitational entanglement proposal, optimizing for the detection of entanglement. We construct a witness consisting of only five nontrivial spin measurements, which we compare with other proposed witnesses. With postprocessing our witness can detect entanglement for any choice of phases in the setup, up to a set of measure zero, for a closed system. We also explore the effects of a simple dephasing channel on this witness.

TI Theoretical framework for photon subtraction with non-mode-selective
   resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper establishes a versatile theoretical framework that explicitly describes single-photon subtraction from multimode quantum light in the context of non-Gaussian state generation and manipulation. The treatment focuses on easy-to-implement configurations in which no mode-selective operation is available and evaluates features and advantages of schemes where only simple filtering stages are employed on the experiments. Such configuration, by considerably reducing the experimental overheads, makes experiments involving single-photon subtraction easier to be implemented. The obtained theoretical framework allows retrieving, given a multimode input state, optimal conditions required to herald and then to detect non-Gaussian states, providing a practical and powerful toolbox for experiments' design. The application of the proposed approach to the case study of Schrodinger cat state preparation starting from a frequency multimode squeezed state illustrates the impact of the derived theoretical tools.

TI Measurements in QFT: Weakly coupled local particle detectors and
   entanglement harvesting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a comparison of the AQFT-based Fewster-Verch framework with the Unruh-DeWitt particle detector models commonly employed in relativistic quantum information and QFT in curved space. We use this comparison to respond to a recent paper [M. H. Ruep, Weakly coupled local particle detectors cannot harvest entanglement, arXiv:2103.13400.] in which it was argued that the Reeh-Schlieder theorem prevents weakly coupled local particle detectors from harvesting vacuum entanglement from a quantum field. Their claim can be traced back to the mixedness that a local particle detector cannot escape from because of the entanglement that it must have with the quantum fields outside of the localization area. We argue that for any realistic scale of localization for physical particle detectors, the effect of that mixedness is negligible, and that weakly coupled, localized particle detectors are not impeded from harvesting vacuum entanglement.

AB Efficient control of qubits plays a key role in quantum information processing. In the current work, an alternative set of differential equations are derived for an optimal quantum control of single or multiple qubits with or without interaction. The new formulation enables a great reduction of the computation load by eliminating possible redundant complexity involved in previous algorithms. A relaxation technique is designed for numerically detecting optimal paths involving entanglement. Interesting continuous symmetries are identified in the Lagrangian, which indicates the existence of physically equivalent classes of paths and may be utilized to remove neutral directions in the Jacobian of the evolution. In the 'ground state' solution among the set of optimal paths, the time-reversal symmetry of the system shows up, which is expected to be universal for the symmetry-related initial and final state.

   process
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Exact results about the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open quantum systems at arbitrary timescales are obtained by considering all possible variations of initial conditions of a system. First we obtain a quantum-information theoretic equality for entropy production, valid for an arbitrary initial joint state of system and environment. For any finite-time process with a fixed initial environment, we then show that the system's loss of distinction-relative to the minimally dissipative state-exactly quantifies its thermodynamic dissipation. The quantum component of this dissipation is the change in coherence relative to the minimally dissipative state. Implications for quantum state preparation and local control are explored. For nonunitary processes-like the preparation of any particular quantum state-we find that mismatched expectations lead to divergent dissipation as the actual initial state becomes orthogonal to the anticipated one.

TI Information Scrambling versus Decoherence-Two Competing Sinks for
   Entropy
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A possible solution of the information paradox can be sought in quantum information scrambling. In this paradigm, it is postulated that all information entering a black hole is rapidly and chaotically distributed across the event horizon, making it impossible to reconstruct the information by means of any local measurement. However, in this scenario, the effects of decoherence are typically ignored, which may render information scrambling moot in cosmological settings. In this work, we develop key steps toward a thermodynamic description of information scrambling in open quantum systems. In particular, we separate the entropy change into contributions arising from scrambling and decoherence, for which we derive statements of the second law. This is complemented with a numerical study of the SachdevYe-Kitaev, Maldacena-Qi, XXX, mixed-field Ising, and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models in the presence of decoherence in the energy or in the computational basis.

TI Parameter optimization of Rydberg atomic receiver based on channel
   capacity criterion
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Rydberg atoms possess a large electric dipole moment and exhibit high sensitivity to electromagnetic signals. Receivers based on Rydberg atoms represent a novel reception mechanism, demonstrating broad application prospects in the field of communication. Current research has not addressed the influence of the operating parameters of Rydberg atomic receiver on channel capacity. This study establishes a channel capacity model for Rydberg atomic receiver based on Shannon's formula and the response mechanism of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect. Using this model, the influences of atomic number density, laser beam waist, and coupling laser Rabi frequency on the channel capacity of Rydberg atomic receiver are analyzed. A strategy for optimizing channel capacity by adjusting the coupling laser Rabi frequency is proposed, and an analytical solution for the Rabi frequency that maximizes channel capacity is derived. The accuracy of this analytical solution is then verified through numerical simulations. The channel capacity corresponding to the analytical solution in this study is similar to the optimal channel capacity obtained using the one-dimensional optimization method (Newton's method) and is superior to the results obtained by the quadratic interpolation method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed analytical solution in optimizing the channel capacity of Rydberg atomic receiver. This research provides theoretical guidance for designing high-performance Rydberg atomic receiver and optimizing channel capacity.

   sensors
SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS
AB High-quality factor (high-Q) optical ring resonators have become essential in modern photonic sensing systems due to their exceptional sensitivity, compact footprint, and compatibility with integrated platforms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles, material platforms, fabrication techniques, and architectural advancements that govern the performance of high-Q ring resonator sensors. Key factors influencing the Q-factor, including waveguide geometry, surface roughness, and coupling conditions, are examined in detail, along with their impact on sensor sensitivity, limit of detection, and stability. Various resonator architectures such as microrings, racetracks, microtoroids, and photonic crystal rings are analyzed, highlighting strategies to achieve ultra-high Q-factors and enhanced light-matter interactions. Applications in biosensing, environmental monitoring, and physical parameter detection are discussed, emphasizing label-free single-molecule detection and integration into lab-on-chip systems. Challenges such as fabrication reproducibility, thermal drift, environmental noise, and scalability to large sensor arrays are critically evaluated. The review concludes by exploring emerging trends, including hybrid integration, nonlinear enhancements, and quantum sensing applications.

TI Electromagnetically induced transparency in inhomogeneously broadened
   divacancy defect ensembles in SiC
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a phenomenon that can provide strong and robust interfacing between optical signals and quantum coherence of electronic spins. In its archetypical form, mainly explored with atomic media, it uses a (near-)homogeneous ensemble of three-level systems, in which two low-energy spin-1/2 levels are coupled to a common optically excited state. We investigate the implementation of EIT with c-axis divacancy color centers in silicon carbide. While this material has attractive properties for quantum device technologies with near-IR optics, implementing EIT is complicated by the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions throughout the ensemble and the presence of multiple ground-state levels. These may lead to darkening of the ensemble upon resonant optical excitation. Here, we show that EIT can be established with high visibility also in this material platform upon careful design of the measurement geometry. Comparison of our experimental results with a model based on the Lindblad equations indicates that we can create coherences between different sets of two levels all-optically in these systems, with potential impact for RF-free quantum sensing applications. Our work provides an understanding of EIT in multi-level systems with significant inhomogeneities, and our considerations are valid for a wide array of defects in semiconductors.

TI Visualization and quantum control of light-accelerated condensates by
   terahertz multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Characterizing and controlling high-order correlation of quantum systems is key for developing quantum devices and switching technologies. Although conventional static and ultrafast spectroscopy gives access to collective excitations characterizing quantum states, more exotic correlations cannot be easily separated from other contributions. Here we develop density matrix simulations to show that seventh-order-wave-mixing peaks with distinct temperature and field dependences in two-dimensional terahertz nonlinear spectra reveal light-induced correlations in non-equilibrium superconducting states. Above critical terahertz driving, these emerging peaks split from conventional peaks along the second axis introduced by pump-probe relative phase in two-dimensional frequency space. They are photo-generated by correlations between two-photon fluctuations and interacting quasi-particle and quasi-particle/Higgs superconductor excitations. By photo-inducing persistent symmetry breaking via light-wave propagation, we also demonstrate seventh-order-wave-mixing sensing of Higgs collective modes. Our theory suggests to use multi-dimensional spectroscopy for quantum sensing of light-driven superconductivity and paves a path for quantum operations by few-cycle-THz-periodic photocurrent modulation.
   At ultrafast time scales, for example, through light-matter interactions, exotic phases in quantum systems can be realised but identifying and characterising these phases from other excitations is complex. Here, the authors theoretically demonstrate how to identify the experimental signatures of a non-equilibrium superconducting state using multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy in the terahertz regime.

TI Tuning Intersystem Crossing to Triplet Excitons in
   sp3-Functionalized (6,5) Carbon Nanotubes through Defect
   Density and Functional Groups
SO ACS NANO
AB Manipulation of triplet states lies at the origin of the emerging applications in quantum sensing and spin-based optoelectronics. In this work, we employ optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy to investigate how sp(3) functionalization of (6,5) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) influences triplet exciton (TE) behavior. Functionalization with closed-shell 4-nitrophenyl groups at varying defect densities reveals that similar to singlet excitons, the TEs localize at the defect sites, leading to reduced zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters and a distortion from the axial symmetry typically observed for pristine tubes. ODMR contrast is highest at low defect densities, suggesting that interdefect interactions significantly affect TE generation and spin polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the experimental observations that a reduced ZFS is observed for the sp(3)-functionalized SWCNTs. Open-shell (radical) functionalization introduces strong exchange interactions between the radical's unpaired electron and the TEs, resulting in an effective S = 3/2 system with enhanced ODMR contrast. These findings highlight how tuning the nature and spatial arrangement of sp(3) defects offers a powerful strategy to control TE dynamics in SWCNTs, toward their integration into advanced quantum materials and devices.

TI Average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem in a constrained pure
   Gaussian state ensemble*
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrised by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalise, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.

AB The discovery of functional dye materials with superior optical properties is crucial for advancing technologies in biomedical imaging, organic photovoltaics, and quantum information systems. Recent advancements highlight the need to accelerate this discovery process by integrating computational strategies with experimental methods. In this regard, we have employed a computational approach to explore the latent space of dye materials, utilizing swarm optimization techniques to efficiently navigate complex chemical spaces and identify optimal values of molecular properties using machine learning methods based on target properties, such as high extinction coefficients (epsilon). The latent space based evaluation outperformed all available features of a domain. This approach enhances inverse material design by systematically correlating molecular parameters with desired optical characteristics by implementing VAEs. In this process, by defining target properties as inputs, the model effectively determines the key molecular features necessary for engineering high-performance dye compounds.

TI Spin-Phonon Relaxation Dynamics from a Conical Intersection of Trapped
   Rydberg Ions
SO PHOTONICS
AB Non-adiabatic processes near conical intersections are rooted in the stronger coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Using a system of two trapped Rydberg ions, their high polarizability and strong dipolar interactions allow to form a conical intersection, where dynamics takes place on a microsecond time scale. Rydberg lifetimes are typically from a few to tens of microseconds, which could affect the conical dynamics. We study the effect of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg state on the vibronic dynamics around the conical intersection via analyzing the master equation. Through mean field and numerical calculations, damping dynamics are found in both the phonon populations and electronic states depending on the initial states. It is found that oscillatory vibronic dynamics can be seen clearly within the Rydberg lifetime, permitting to observe the conical effect in the trapped Rydberg ion system.

TI Inducing room-temperature valley polarization of excitonic emission in
   transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The lowest energy states in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers follow valley selection rules, which have attracted vast interest due to the possibility of encoding and processing of quantum information. However, these quantum states are strongly affected by temperature-dependent intervalley scattering leading to complete valley depolarization, which hampers practical applications at room temperature. Therefore, for achieving clear and robust valley polarization in TMD monolayers one needs to suppress parasitic depolarization processes, which is the central challenge in the growing field of valleytronics. Here, in electron-doping experiments on TMD monolayers, we show that strong doping levels beyond 1013 cm-2 can induce 61% and 37% valley contrast at room temperature in tungsten diselenide and molybdenum diselenide monolayers, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that charged excitons in TMD monolayers hold the potential for the development of efficient valleytronic devices functional at 300 K.

TI Confirming X-ray parametric down conversion by time-energy correlation
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We present measurements of X-ray Parametric Down Conversion at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron facility. Using an incoming pump beam at 22 keV, we observe the simultaneous, elastic emission of downconverted photon pairs generated in a diamond crystal. The pairs are detected using high count rate silicon drift detectors with low noise. Production by down -conversion is confirmed by measuring time-energy correlations in the detector signal, where photon pairs within an energy window ranging from 10 to 12 keV are only observed at short time differences. By systematically varying the crystal misalignment and detector positions, we obtain results that are consistent with the constant total of the down -converted signal. Our maximum rate of observed pairs was 130/h, corresponding to a conversion efficiency for the down -conversion process of 5.3 +/- 0.5 x 10-13.

Furthermore, the paramagnetic nature of their open-shell structures broadens their applicability, allowing them to be magnetic field-active while also offering promising spin transport properties. These molecular design features position radical polymers as interesting materials for next-generation quantum information systems as well. In this review, we highlight the progress regarding several stable open-shell radical macromolecular architectures. We commence by examining their synthetic methods along with the mechanisms governing charge transport in such materials, followed by emphasizing their significant development of solid-state optoelectronic materials, and we conclude by discussing their emerging roles in spintronic applications.

For quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement, we show that the system evolves on an appropriately chosen manifold and we express the exact solution of the quantum filter equation in terms of the solution of a lower dimensional stochastic differential equation. In order to further reduce the dimension of the system under study, we consider the projection on the lower dimensional manifold originally introduced in Gao et al. (2019) for the case of perfect measurements. An error analysis is performed to evaluate the precision of this approximate quantum filter, focusing on the case of QND measurement. Simulations suggest the efficiency of the proposed quantum projection filter, even in presence of a stabilizing feedback control which depends on the projection filter.

   chirped pulses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a nanostructure consisting of a semiconductor quantum dot coupled to a metal nanoparticle, and we show with numerical simulations that the exciton state of the quantum dot can be robustly generated from the ground state even for small interparticle distances, using conventional chirped pulses with a Gaussian envelope. The asymmetry observed in the final exciton population with respect to the chirp sign of the applied pulses is explained using the nonlinear density matrix equations describing the system and is attributed to the real part of the parameter emerging from the interaction between excitons in the quantum dot and plasmons in the metal nanoparticle. The simplicity of Gaussian chirped pulses, which can also be easily implemented in the laboratory, makes the proposed robust quantum control scheme potentially useful for the implementation of ultrafast nanoswitches and quantum information processing tasks with semiconductor quantum dots.

TI Engineering of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with effective noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect lies at the heart of quantum interferometry, having multiple applications in the field of quantum information processing and no classical counterpart. Despite its popularity, only a few works have considered polarization-frequency interaction within the interferometer. In this paper, we fill this gap. Our system of interest is a general biphoton polarization state that experiences effective dephasing noise by becoming entangled with the same photons' frequency state, as the photons propagate through birefringent media. The photons then meet at a beam splitter, where either coincidence or bunching occurs, after which the polarizationfrequency interaction continues on the output paths. Along with performing extensive theoretical analysis on the coincidence probability and different polarization states, we outline multiple interesting applications that range from constructing Bell states to an alternative delayed choice quantum eraser.

TI Impact ionization-induced bistability in CMOS transistors at cryogenic
   temperatures for capacitorless memory applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Cryogenic operation of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) silicon transistors is crucial for quantum information science, but it brings deviations from standard transistor operation. Here, we report on sharp current jumps and stable hysteretic loops in the drain current as a function of gate voltage V-G for both n- and p-type commercial-foundry 180-nm-process CMOS transistors when operated at voltages exceeding 1.3V at cryogenic temperatures. The physical mechanism responsible for the device bistability is impact ionization charging of the transistor body, which leads to effective back-gating of the inversion channel. This mechanism is verified by independent measurements of the body potential. The hysteretic loops, which have a >10(7) ratio of high to low drain current states at the same V-G, can be used for a compact capacitorless single-transistor memory at cryogenic temperatures with long retention times.

TI Coherent control of quantum and entanglement dynamics via periodic
   modulations in optomechanical semiconductor resonator coupled to
   quantum-dot excitons
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We systematically study the influence of simultaneously modulating the input laser intensity and quantum-dot (QD) resonance frequency on the mean-field dynamics, fluctuation energy transfer and entanglement in a optomechanical semiconductor resonator embedded with a QD. We show that the modulation and the hybrid system can be engineered to attain the desired mean-field values and control the fluctuation energy transfer and the entanglement among the various degrees of freedom. A remarkably high degree of entanglement can be generated by modulating only the QD frequency. The interplay between the two modulations leads to a decrease in the entanglement. Switching on the modulation leads to a transition from low stationary to large dynamical entanglement. This investigation provides novel strategies to coherently control data signal transfer and storage in quantum information processing networks.

TI Valley Spin-Polarization of MoS2 Monolayer Induced by
   Ferromagnetic Order in an Antiferromagnet
SO MATERIALS
AB Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers exhibit unique valleytronics properties due to the dependency of the coupled valley and spin state at the hexagonal corner of the first Brillouin zone. Precisely controlling valley spin-polarization via manipulating the electron population enables its application in valley-based memory or quantum technologies. This study uncovered the uncompensated spins of the antiferromagnetic nickel oxide (NiO) serving as the ferromagnetic (FM) order to induce valley spin-polarization in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers via the magnetic proximity effect (MPE). Spin-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (SR-PL) was employed to observe MoS2, where the spin-polarized trions appear to be responsible for the MPE, leading to a valley magnetism. Results indicate that local FM order from the uncompensated surface of NiO could successfully induce significant valley spin-polarization in MoS2 with the depolarization temperature approximately at 100 K, which is relatively high compared to the related literature. This study reveals new perspectives in that the precise control over the surface orientation of AFMs serves as a crystallographic switch to activate the MPE and the magnetic sustainability of the trion state is responsible for the observed valley spin-polarization with the increasing temperature, which promotes the potential of AFM materials in the field of exchange-coupled Van der Waals heterostructures.

TI Selective mode excitations and spontaneous emission engineering in
   quantum emitter-photonic structure coupled systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study the excitation conditions of the supported field modes, as well as the spontaneous decay property of a two-level quantum emitter coupled to photonic structures containing topological insulators (TIs) and left-handed materials. Within the proper field quantization scheme, the spontaneous decay rates of dipoles with different polarizations are expressed in forms of the Green's functions. We find that in the proposed structure, the variation in the topological magnetoelectric polarizability (TMP) has a deterministic effect on the excitation of different field modes. As the result, the spontaneous decay property of the quantum emitter can be engineered. For a dipole placed in different spatial regions, the spontaneous decay feature indicates a dominant contribution from the waveguide modes, the surface plasmon modes or the free vacuum modes. Moreover, a special kind of the surface plasmon modes displaying asymmetric density of states at the interfaces, becomes legal in the presence of nontrivial TIs. These phenomena manifest the feasibility in controlling dipole emissions via manipulations of the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect. Our results have potential applications in quantum technologies relied on the accurate control over light-matter interactions.

TI Fabrication of Detonation Nanodiamonds Containing Silicon-Vacancy Color
   Centers by High Temperature Annealing
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) with sizes below 10 nm have attracted attention as single photon emitters with potential in many research fields from life sciences to quantum technologies. However, while nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers are found in nanodiamonds directly after the detonation synthesis without the need for irradiation or annealing, silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers are not present in these pristine samples. Herein, SiV centers are created in DNDs by an annealing treatment up to 1100 degrees C in high vacuum. As silicon is not added, the precursor of the SiV centers must be pristine silicon impurities inside the nanodiamond lattice. A sharp emission line at the wavelength of 737 nm with a linewidth of 7.7 nm is observed in DNDs that are electron irradiated before annealing. This wavelength is consistent with the characteristic emission line of SiV centers and its linewidth is comparable with that in larger nanodiamonds created by chemical vapor deposition and subsequent milling. The average lifetime (0.4 +/- 0.04 ns) of the fluorescence, which is in the range of reported lifetimes in nanodiamonds, also support that the observed emission peak are due to SiV centers in DNDs.

TI Broadband plasmonic vortex lattice generator based on a hexagonal
   metasurface
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB The plasmonic vortex lattice offers significant potential for optical tweezers, biomolecule screening, and femtosecond vortex electron pulse generation. In this study, we demonstrated a broadband plasmonic vortex lattice generator consisting of a hexagonal metasurface etched onto a gold film. By adjusting the orientation of nanoslits in the generator, we can flexibly control the lattice's periodicity, shape, and topological charge. Based on a near-field interference model, we have confirmed that plasmonic vortex lattice manipulation arises from the combined effects of the spiral phase due to spin-orbit coupling and the Pancharatnam-Berry phase induced by nanoslits. Furthermore, by minimizing spiral phase accumulation, we achieve plasmonic vortex field superposition states. We also investigate how hexagonal metasurfaces can create composite plasmonic vortex lattices. These discoveries advance multiparticle trapping and high-capacity quantum information encryption.

TI Zeeman and hyperfine interactions of a single
   167Er3+ ion in Si
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Er-doped Si is a promising candidate for quantum information applications due to its telecom wavelength optical transition and its compatibility with Si nanofabrication technologies. Recent spectroscopic studies based on photoluminescence excitation have shown multiple well-defined lattice sites that Er occupies in Si. Here we report a measurement of the Zeeman and hyperfine tensors of a single Er-167(3+) ion in Si. All the obtained tensors are highly anisotropic with the largest value principal axes aligning in nearly the same direction, and the trace of the lowest crystal field level g-tensor is 17.78 +/- 0.40. The results indicate that this specific Er site is likely to be a distorted cubic site that exhibits monoclinic (C1) symmetry. Finally, zero first-order-Zeeman fields are identified for this site and could be used to reduce decoherence of hyperfine spin states in future experiments.

TI Generation of quantum states with nonlinear squeezing by Kerr
   nonlinearity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In quantum optics, squeezing corresponds to the process in which fluctuations of a quadrature operator are reduced below the shot noise limit. In turn, nonlinear squeezing can be defined as reduction of fluctuations related to nonlinear combination of quadrature operators. Quantum states with nonlinear squeezing are a necessary resource for deterministic implementation of high-order quadrature phase gates that are, in turn, sufficient for advanced quantum information processing. We demonstrate that this class of states can be deterministically prepared by employing a single self-Kerr gate accompanied by suitable Gaussian processing. The required Kerr coupling depends on the energy of the initial system and can be made arbitrarily small. We also employ numerical simulations to analyze the effects of imperfections and to show to which extent can they be neglected.

TI Ultrabroadband, achromatic, and non-diffracting perfect optical vortex
   generation via radial momentum control in dielectric metasurfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical vortices, beams that carry a twist, are pivotal in advanced technologies like optical manipulation, optical communications and imaging. However, their utility has been hampered by a fundamental limitation: the size and spread of the beam change inevitably with its twist and color, making stable, scalable systems difficult to achieve. Here we show that using precisely engineered metasurfaces to control light's radial momentum enables the generation of a class of 'achromatic non-diffracting perfect vortex beams' (ANPVBs). These beams maintain an almost perfectly constant diameter, regardless of their twist or color across the visible spectrum (450-780 nm), and resist spreading over long distances. By decoupling beam size from these previously limiting factors, our work provides a robust and versatile platform for applications in high-capacity optical communication, quantum information processing and imaging.

TI Dynamics of transport by helical edge states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Topologically nontrivial band structure of a material may give rise to special states that are confined to the material's boundary and protected against disorder and scattering. Quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is a paradigmatic example of phenomenon in which such states appear in the presence of time-reversal symmetry in two dimensions. Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies.

TI Robust Ferromagnetism with High Curie Temperature in 2D Tri-Layer
   Ti3S2X2 (X = Se/Te) Monolayer
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB 2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half-metals offer promising prospects for quantum information technologies in miniature devices. However, the low Curie temperature (TC) severely limits their application in spintronic devices. Here, two stable FM transition metal chalcogenides, Ti3S2X2 (X = Se, Te) monolayers, based on first-principles calculations are presented. It is found that the Ti3S2Se2 monolayer is a bipolar magnetic semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 0.094 eV, while Ti3S2Te2 exhibits be FM half-metallic feature. Notably, the TCs of Ti3S2Se2 monolayer and Ti3S2Te2 monolayer are 641 and 408 K, respectively, much higher than room temperature. Moreover, the TCs and electronic properties of both Ti3S2X2 (X = Se, Te) monolayers can be modulated by applying biaxial strains. These promising properties make Ti3S2X2 (X = Se, Te) monolayers ideal candidates for 2D spintronic devices.

TI Changing states in holography: From modular Berry curvature to the bulk
   symplectic form
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a new perspective on bulk reconstruction using Berry phases in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). Our parallel transport of modular Hamiltonians is associated to a trajectory in the space of states, which we obtain from the insertion of a source in the Euclidean path integral. Using a modular version of the extrapolate dictionary and the equivalence between modular flow in the boundary and the bulk, we show that the expectation value of the modular Berry curvature on the boundary agrees with an appropriately defined bulk symplectic form associated to the entanglement wedge. In addition, we derive a quantum information metric on the space of density matrices from the Berry curvature, which is related to the canonical energy in the bulk. We also explore the case where a state change reduces to a shape change, uncovering the coadjoint orbit structure of kinematic space in higher dimensions.

TI Interplay of vibration- and environment-assisted energy transfer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the interplay between two environmental influences on excited state energy transfer in photosynthetic light harvesting complexes, namely, vibrationally assisted energy transfer (VAET) and environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT), considering a dimeric chromophore donor-acceptor model as a prototype for larger systems. We demonstrate how the basic features of the excitonic energy transfer are influenced by these two environments, both separately and together, with the environment being fully quantum in the case of VAET and treated in the Haken-Strobl-Reineker classical limit in the case of ENAQT. Our results reveal that in the weak noise regime, the presence of a classical noise source is detrimental to the energy transfer that is resonantly assisted by the exciton-vibration interactions intrinsic to VAET. In the strong noise regime we reproduce all the features of ENAQT, including the turnover into a Zeno regime where energy transfer is suppressed, and VAET is insignificant.

TI Terahertz vortex beam generator based on bound states in the continuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vortex beams are playing an increasingly crucial role in wireless optical communications. Traditional vortex beam generators based on spiral phase plates and metasurfaces have a geometric center in real space, which limit their convenience in practical applications. In this work, we propose that the creation of a vortex beam can be achieved by using the bound state in the continuum (BIC) supported by a photonic crystal slab structure. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed structure can be used as a kind of "momentum-space resonators" and thus can generate vortex beams. Moreover, higher-order vortex beams can also be achieved by changing the symmetry of photonic crystal slab, thus paving the way for the application of vortex beams in the fields of quantum information processing and micro optical micromanipulation.

TI Entropy, purity and gluon cascades at high energies with recombinations
   and transitions to vacuum
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study one dimensional dipole cascade models in the high-energy limit of QCD. Motivated by data on hadron multiplicities in the LHCb kinematical range, we generalize existing cascade models for splitting and recombination to account also for transitions to the vacuum. This modification allows us to describe the data. Furthermore, we perform both analytical and numerical studies of the cascades and find that the cascade including loop corrections, as well as the one accounting for transitions to the vacuum, can both be related to the Negative Binomial Distribution. In the latter case, however, one must properly normalize the cascade to account for transitions to the vacuum. We also study the scaling properties of the cascades and identify new regimes, which we call "focal" and "parallel." Finally, we investigate the Quantum Information (QI) measures of the cascades, which allow us to highlight their distinctive properties.

TI High-dimensional Poincaré beams generated through cascaded metasurfaces
   for high-security optical encryption
SO PHOTONIX
AB Optical encryption plays an increasingly important role in the field of information security owing to its parallel processing capability and low power consumption. Employing the ultrathin metasurfaces in optical encryption has promoted the miniaturization and multifunctionality of encryption systems. Nevertheless, with the few number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) multiplexed by single metasurface, both key space and encoding space are limited. To address this issue, we propose a high-security and large-capacity optical encryption scheme based on perfect high-dimensional Poincare beams with expanded DoFs. By cascading two arrayed metasurfaces, more beam properties can be independently engineered, which gives rise to the extensively expanded key and encoding spaces. Our work provides a promising strategy for optical encryption with high security level and large information capacity and might facilitate the applications of Poincare beams in optical communications and quantum information.

TI Spectral Characterization of Two-Photon Interference between Independent
   Sources
SO PHOTONICS
AB We present a spectral characterization of two-photon nonclassical interference on a beam splitter (BS) between a weak coherent state source and another source, which emits a phase-randomized weak coherent state, a single-photon state, or a thermal state. Besides spectral characteristics, the average photon number ratio in a given time interval is also considered in our model. The two-photon coincidence probability of two outputs of the BS is numerically calculated with spectral bandwidth ratio and average photon number ratio. Furthermore, the noise of the detection system is taken into account. This also indicates that two-photon interference is able to significantly improve by subtracting two-photon contributions from the input state. All these parameters have a close relation to a real experiment performance and the results may pave new avenues for quantum information technology when two-photon interference between independent sources is necessary.

TI Composed Effects of Electron-Hole Exchange and Near-Field Interaction in
   Quantum-Dot-Confined Radiative Dipoles
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB Conservation of polarization is an important requirement for reliable single-photon emitters, which, in turn, are essential building blocks for light-based quantum information processing. In this work, we study the exciton-spin dynamics in a double quantum dot under the combined effects of electron-hole exchange and Forster resonance energy transfer. By means of numerical solutions of the quantum master equation, we simulate the time-dependent spin polarization for two neighboring dots. According to our results, under some conditions, the depolarization caused by the electron-hole exchange may be slowed by the near field-induced interdot energy transfer, suggesting a new mechanism to extend the exciton coherence time. This opens doors to alternative schemes for improved solid-state quantum light sources.

TI The asymmetric quantum cloning region
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum cloning is a fundamental protocol of quantum information theory. Perfect universal quantum cloning is prohibited by the laws of quantum mechanics, only imperfect copies being reachable. Symmetric quantum cloning is concerned with case when the quality of the clones is identical. In this work, we study the general case of 1 & RARR;N asymmetric cloning, where one asks for arbitrary qualities of the clones. We characterize, for all Hilbert space dimensions and number of clones, the set of all possible clone qualities. This set is realized as the nonnegative part of the unit ball of a newly introduced norm, which we call the Q-norm. We also provide a closed-form expression for the quantum cloner achieving a given clone quality vector. Our analysis relies on the Schur-Weyl duality and on the study of the spectral properties of partially transposed permutation operators.

TI Generation of robust optical entanglement in cavity optomagnonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to realize robust optical entanglement in cavity optomagnonics, where two optical whispering gallery modes (WGMs) couple to a magnon mode in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere. The beam-splitter-like and two-mode squeezing magnon-photon interactions can be realized simultaneously when the two optical WGMs are driven by external fields. Entanglement between the two optical modes is then generated via their coupling with magnons. By exploiting the destructive quantum interference between the bright modes of the interface, the effects of initial thermal occupations of magnons can be eliminated. Moreover, the excitation of the Bogoliubov dark mode is capable of protecting the optical entanglement from thermal heating effects. Therefore, the generated optical entanglement is robust against thermal noise and the requirement of cooling the magnon mode is relaxed. Our scheme may find applications in the study of magnon-based quantum information processing.

TI Relating incompatibility, noncommutativity, uncertainty, and
   Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We provide an in-depth study of the recently introduced notion of completely incompatible observables and its links to the support uncertainty and to the Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality of pure quantum states. The latter notion has recently been proved central to a number of issues in quantum information theory and quantum metrology. In this last context, it was shown that a quantum advantage requires the use of Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassical states. We establish sharp bounds of very general validity that imply that the support uncertainty is an efficient Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality witness. When adapted to completely incompatible observables that are close to mutually unbiased ones, this bound allows us to fully characterize the Kirkwood-Dirac classical pure states as the eigenvectors of the two observables. We show furthermore that complete incompatibility implies several weaker notions of incompatibility, among which features a strong form of noncommutativity.

TI Quantum Statistical Complexity Measure as a Signaling of Correlation
   Transitions
SO ENTROPY
AB We introduce a quantum version for the statistical complexity measure, in the context of quantum information theory, and use it as a signaling function of quantum order-disorder transitions. We discuss the possibility for such transitions to characterize interesting physical phenomena, as quantum phase transitions, or abrupt variations in correlation distributions. We apply our measure on two exactly solvable Hamiltonian models: the 1D-Quantum Ising Model (in the single-particle reduced state), and on Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain (in the two-particle reduced state). We analyze its behavior across quantum phase transitions for finite system sizes, as well as in the thermodynamic limit by using Bethe Ansatz technique.

TI Verification of joint measurability using phase-space quasiprobability
   distributions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Measurement incompatibility is a distinguishing property of quantum physics and an essential resource for many quantum information processing tasks. We introduce an approach to verify the joint measurability of measurements based on phase-space quasiprobability distributions. Our results, therefore, establish a connection between two notions of nonclassicality, namely the negativity of quasiprobability distributions and measurement incompatibility. We show how our approach can be applied to the study of incompatibility-breaking channels and derive incompatibility-breaking sufficient conditions for bosonic systems and Gaussian channels. In particular, these conditions provide useful tools for investigating the effects of errors and imperfections on the incompatibility of measurements in practice. To illustrate our method, we consider all classes of single-mode Gaussian channels. We show that pure lossy channels with 50% or more losses break the incompatibility of all measurements that can be represented by non-negative Wigner functions, which includes the set of Gaussian measurements.

TI Continuity Bounds for Quantum Entropies Arising From a Fundamental
   Entropic Inequality
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We establish a tight upper bound for the differ-ence in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, rho(1 )and rho(2). This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator (rho(1)-rho(2)). This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the wellknown Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.

TI Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity, and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.

TI Quantumness near a Schwarzschild black hole
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The merging of quantum information science with the relativity theory presents novel opportunities for understanding the enigmas surrounding the transmission of information in relation to black holes. For this purpose, we study the quantumness near a Schwarzschild black hole in a practical model under decoherence. The scenario we consider in this paper is that a stationary particle in the flat region interacts with its surroundings while another particle experiences free fall in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole's event horizon. We explore the impacts of Hawking radiation and decoherence on the system under investigation and find that these effects can limit the survival of quantum characteristics, but cannot destroy them completely. Hence, the results of this study possess the potential to yield valuable insights into the comprehension of the quantum properties of a real system operating within a curved space-time framework.

TI Giant-atom effects on population and entanglement dynamics of Rydberg
   atoms in the optical regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Giant atoms are attracting interest as an emerging paradigm in the quantum optics of engineered waveguides. At variance with the well-known artificial giant atoms for microwave photonics, here we propose the archetype of a giant atom working in the optical regime by considering a pair of interacting Rydberg atoms coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) and also driven by a coherent field. Giant-atom effects are observed as a phase-dependent decay of the double Rydberg excitation during the initial evolution stage while a nontrivial internal entanglement is exhibited at later times. Such an entanglement onset occurs in the presence of intrinsic atomic decay toward nonguided vacuum modes and is accompanied by antibunching in the emitted photons. Our predictions should be observable in current Rydberg-PCW experiments and may open the way toward giant-atom optical photonics for quantum information processing.

TI Bound states in the continuum in subwavelength emitter arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ordered lattices of emitters with subwavelength periodicities support unconventional forms of light-matter interactions arising from collective effects. Here, we propose the realization and control of subradiant optical states within the radiation continuum in two-dimensional lattices. We show how bound states in the contin-uum (BICs) which are completely decoupled from radiative states emerge in non-Bravais lattices of emitters. Symmetry breaking results in quasi-BICs with greatly extended lifetimes, which can be exploited for quantum information storage. The analytical derivation of a generalized effective polarizability tensor allows us to study the optical response of these arrays. We discuss how thanks to the quasi-BICs, a rich phenomenology takes place in the reflectivity spectrum, with asymmetric Fano resonances and an electromagnetically induced transparency window. Finally, we exploit these lattices as quantum metasurfaces acting as efficient light polarizers.

TI Quantum Science and the Search for Axion Dark Matter
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The dark-matter puzzle is one of the most important open problems in modern physics. The ultralight axion is a well-motivated dark-matter candidate, conceived to resolve the strong-CP problem of quantum chromodynamics. Numerous precision experiments are searching for the three nongravitational interactions of axionlike dark matter. Some of the searches are approaching fundamental quantum limits on their sensitivity. This Perspective describes several approaches that use quantum engineering to circumvent these limits. Squeezing and single-photon counting can enhance searches for the axion-photon interaction. Optimization of quantum spin-ensemble properties is needed to realize the full potential of spin-based searches for the electric dipole moment and the gradient interactions of axion dark matter. Several metrological and sensing techniques, developed in the field of quantum information science, are finding natural applications in this area of experimental fundamental physics.

TI The cost of building a wall for a fermion
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We analyse the energy cost of building or demolishing a wall for a mass-less Dirac field in (1+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and the response of an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector to the generated radiation. For any smoothly-evolving wall, both the field's energy density and the detector's response are finite. In the limit of rapid wall creation or demolition, the energy density displays a delta function squared divergence. By contrast, the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector, evaluated within first-order perturbation theory, diverges only logarithmically in the duration of the wall evolution. The results add to the evidence that a localised matter system may not be as sensitive to the rapid wall creation as the local expectation values of field observables. This disparity has potential interest for quantum information preservation scenarios.

TI Effective protection of quantum coherence by a non-Hermitian driving
   potential
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the effects of non-Hermitian driving potential on quantum coherence in a bipartite system. The results show that the dynamical localization will revive after being destroyed by the Hermitian interaction, which provides evidence of the restoration of quantum coherence by a non-Hermitian driving potential. Besides, the entanglement between the two subsystems also decays with the boosting of non-Hermitian driving strength, which gives more evidence that non-Hermitian driving potential will protect quantum coherence. The physics behind this phenomenon is the domination of the quasieigenstate with maximum imaginary value of the quasieigenvalue over the dynamics of the non-Hermitian system. Our discovery establishes a restoration mechanism of quantum coherence in interacting and dissipative quantum systems which is highly expectable in updated experiments from many-body physics to quantum information.

AB We present a framework for understanding the dynamics of operator size, and bounding the growth of out-of-time-ordered correlators, in models of large-S spins. Focusing on the dynamics of a single spin, we show the finiteness of the Lyapunov exponent in the large-S limit; our bounds are tighter than the best known Lieb-Robinson-type bounds on these systems. We numerically find our upper bound on Lyapunov exponents is within an order of magnitude of numerically computed values in classical and quantum kicked top models. Generalizing our results to coupled large-S spins on lattices, we show that the butterfly velocity, which characterizes the spatial speed of quantum information scrambling, is finite as S ->infinity. We emphasize qualitative differences between operator growth in semiclassical large-spin models and quantum holographic systems including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.Y

TI Shallow Nitrogen Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond by Ion Implantation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Recent advancements in quantum technologies are fueled by the ability to engineer materials with specific quantum properties, enabling various applications. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a key system for nanoscale sensors, capable of detecting weak magnetic fields with nanotesla-range sensitivity. To achieve high spatial resolution and sensitivity, NV centers must be placed near the diamond surface. This study investigates the creation of NV defects in a pure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond single crystal via broad-beam ion implantation. The implantations are performed through thin (100 nm) SiO2 layers deposited by plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD). Both normal and oblique ion beam incidences are used, with the oblique incidence chosen to reduce the nitrogen ion penetration depth. Simulations show a subsurface NV center distribution, with the highest concentration near the surface; the expected trends are confirmed by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). This distribution extends to a depth of 30 nm. By adjusting the ion beam incidence angle, NV center density can be modulated. This work contributes to optimizing the fabrication process for shallow color centers through ion implantation using a screening layer.

TI Photonics in wide-band-gap materials: The challenge of color-center
   waveguides in lithium fluoride
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Lithium fluoride is an insulating material with outstanding optical properties, among them wide optical transparency. Its ionizing radiation sensitivity allows the formation of primary and aggregate point defects, known as color centers, some of which are laser active in the visible and near-infrared even at room temperature. Among their peculiarities, the simultaneous light emission in the green-red wavelength interval under optical excitation in the blue spectral range is suitable for the realization of solid-state photonic light sources, miniaturized optical amplifiers and lasers compatible with integrated optical circuits. Despite the material's low refractive index, broad-band light-emitting color-center active waveguides were realized at the surface of lithium fluoride crystals and thin films by direct writing with low-energy electron beams and light ions. Due to the complex behavior of radiation-induced defects at high concentrations, the balance between optical gain and losses remains a technological challenge for laser operation. This review will revise the main achievements of our group and emphasize some interesting features, along with a discussion of new experimental results, aiming to promote further developments in photonics and quantum technologies.

TI Inverse-Designed Lithium Niobate Nanophotonics
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform that exhibits favorable material properties (such as low optical loss, strong nonlinearities, and stability) and enables large-scale integration with stronger optical confinement, showing promise for future optical networks, quantum processors, and nonlinear optical systems. However, while photonics engineering has entered the era of automated "inverse design" via optimization in recent years, the design of LNOI integrated photonic devices still mostly relies on intuitive models and inefficient parameter sweeps, limiting the accessible parameter space, performance, and functionality. Here, we implement a 3D gradient-based inverse-design model tailored for topology optimization based on the LNOI platform, which not only could efficiently search a large parameter space, but also takes into account practical fabrication constraints, including minimum feature sizes and etched sidewall angles. We experimentally demonstrate a spatial-mode multiplexer, a waveguide crossing, and a compact waveguide bend, all with low insertion losses, tiny footprints, and excellent agreement between simulation and experimental results. The devices, together with the design methodology, represent a crucial step toward the variety of advanced device functionalities needed in future LNOI photonics and could provide compact and cost-effective solutions for future optical links, quantum technologies, and nonlinear optics.

TI Designing optimal protocols in Bayesian quantum parameter estimation
   with higher-order operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Using quantum systems as sensors or probes has been shown to greatly improve the precision of parameter estimation by exploiting unique quantum features such as entanglement. A major task in quantum sensing is to design the optimal protocol, i.e., the most precise one. It has been solved for some specific instances of the problem, but in general even numerical methods are not known. Here, we focus on the single -shot Bayesian setting, where the goal is to find the optimal initial state of the probe (which can be entangled with an auxiliary system), the optimal measurement, and the optimal estimator function. We leverage the formalism of higherorder operations to develop a method based on semidefinite programming that finds a protocol that is close to the optimal one with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is not restricted to any specific quantum evolution, cost function, or prior distribution, and thus can be applied to any estimation problem. Moreover, it can be applied to both single -parameter or multiparameter estimation tasks. We demonstrate our method with three examples, consisting of unitary phase estimation, thermometry in a bosonic bath, and multiparameter estimation of an SU(2) transformation. Exploiting our methods, we extend several results from the literature. For example, in the thermometry case, we find the optimal protocol at any finite time and quantify the usefulness of entanglement.

TI Variational transformer ansatz for the density operator of steady states
   in dissipative quantum many-body systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the transformer density operator ansatz for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.

TI All Incompatible Measurements on Qubits Lead to Multiparticle Bell
   Nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question of which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multiparticle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.

TI State-insensitive wavelengths for light shifts and photon scattering
   from Zeeman states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Atoms are not two-level systems, and their rich internal structure often leads to complex phenomena in the presence of light. Here, we analyze off-resonant light scattering including the full hyperfine and magnetic structure. We find a set of frequency detunings where the induced atomic dipole is the same irrespective of the Zeeman state, and where two-photon transitions that alter the atomic state turn off. For alkali-metal atoms and alkaline-earth-metal ions, if the hyperfine splitting is dominated by the magnetic dipole moment contribution, these detunings approximately coincide. Therefore, at a given "magical" detuning, all Zeeman states in a hyperfine manifold behave almost identically, and can be traced out to good approximation. This feature prevents state decoherence due to light scattering, which impacts quantum optics experiments and quantum information applications.

TI Tempering Multichannel Photon Emission from Emitter-Coupled Holographic
   Metasurfaces
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB On-chip manipulation of photon emission from quantum emitters (QEs) is crucial for quantum nanophotonics and advanced optical applications. At the same time, the general design strategy is still elusive, especially for fully exploring the degrees of freedom of multiple channels. Here, the vectorial scattering holography (VSH) approach developed recently for flexibly designing QE-coupled metasurfaces is extended to tempering the strength of QE emission into a particular channel. The VSH power is demonstrated by designing, fabricating, and optically characterizing on-chip QE sources emitted into six differently oriented propagation channels, each representing the entangled state of orthogonal circular polarizations with different topological charges and characterized with a specific relative strength. We postulate that the demonstration of tempered multichannel photon emission from QE-coupled metasurfaces significantly broadens the possibilities provided by the holographic metasurface platform, especially those relevant for high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Frequency Transducer and Its Applications
SO ADVANCED DEVICES & INSTRUMENTATION
AB Quantum frequency transducer (QFT) is an important technology in quantum information processing. QFT can coherently convert quantum state from one wavelength to another wavelength, while the coherence, entanglement, and information encoded in the light beam can be well preserved. There are 2 main application directions based on the intrinsic properties of QFT: (a) quantum frequency interface, which transfer quantum state between different quantum systems work at different wavelengths; and (b) frequency conversion detection, which convert photon from the weak detection ability waveband to the waveband that has better detection ability. In this review article, after giving a brief introduction of the basic principle of QFT, some main progresses for applications of QFT in the aforementioned 2 aspects are described in detail. Finally, we indicate the research trend of the QFT and the problems that remain to be solved in this field.

TI Digital holographic imaging via direct quantum wavefunction
   reconstruction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Wavefunction is a fundamental concept of quantum theory. Recent studies have shown surprisingly that wavefunction can be directly reconstructed via the measurement of weak value. The weak value based direct wavefunction reconstruction not only gives the operational meaning of wavefunction, but also provides the possibility of realizing holographic imaging with a totally new quantum approach. Here, we review the basic background knowledge of weak value based direct wavefunction reconstruction combined with recent experimental demonstrations. The main purpose of this work focuses on the idea of holographic imaging via direct wavefunction reconstruction. Since research on this topic is still in its early stage, we hope that this work can attract interest in the field of traditional holographic imaging. In addition, the wavefunction holographic imaging may find important applications in quantum information science.

AB It is a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high interpretability and high efficiency with the current schemes of deep machine learning (ML). The tensor network (TN), a well-established mathematical tool originating from quantum mechanics, has shown its unique advantages in developing efficient "white-box" ML schemes. Here, we provide a brief review of the inspiring progress in TN-based ML. On the one hand, the interpretability of TN ML can be accommodated by a solid theoretical foundation based on quantum information and many-body physics. On the other hand, high efficiency can be obtained from powerful TN representations and the advanced computational techniques developed in quantum many-body physics. Keeping pace with the rapid development of quantum computers, TNs are expected to produce novel schemes runnable on quantum hardware in the direction of "quantum artificial intelligence" in the near future.

TI Charge-Noise Insensitive Chiral Photonic Interface for Waveguide Circuit
   QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A chiral photonic interface is a quantum system that has different probabilities for emitting photons to the left and right. An on-chip compatible chiral interface is attractive for both fundamental studies of lightmatter interactions and applications to quantum information processing. We propose such a chiral interface based on superconducting circuits, which has wide bandwidth, rich tunability, and high tolerance to fabrication variations. The proposed interface consists of a core that uses Cooper-pair boxes (CPBs) to break time-reversal symmetry, and two superconducting transmons that connect the core to a waveguide in the manner reminiscent of a "giant atom." The transmons form a state decoupled from the core, akin to dark states of atomic physics, rendering the whole interface insensitive to the CPB charge noise. The proposed interface can be extended to realize a broadband fully passive on-chip circulator for microwave photons.

TI Motional n-phonon bundle states of a trapped atom with clock
   transitions
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum manipulation of individual phonons could offer new resources for studying fundamental physics and creating an innovative platform in quantum information science. Here, we propose to generate quantum states of strongly correlated phonon bundles associated with the motion of a trapped atom. Our scheme operates in the atom-phonon resonance regime where the energy spectrum exhibits strong anharmonicity such that energy eigenstates with different phonon numbers can be well-resolved in the parameter space. Compared to earlier schemes operating in the far dispersive regime, the bundle states generated here contain a large steady-state phonon number. Therefore, the proposed system can be used as a high-quality multiphonon source. Our results open up the possibility of using long-lived motional phonons as quantum resources, which could provide a broad physics community for applications in quantum metrology.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Localized electronic and nuclear spin qubits in the solid state constitute a promising platform for storage and manipulation of quantum information, even at room temperature. However, the development of scalable systems requires the ability to entangle distant spins, which remains a challenge today. We propose and analyze an efficient, heralded scheme that employs a parity measurement in a decoherence free subspace to enable fast and robust entanglement generation between distant spin qubits mediated by a hot mechanical oscillator. We find that high-fidelity entanglement at cryogenic and even ambient temperatures is feasible with realistic parameters and show that the entangled pair can be subsequently leveraged for deterministic controlled-NOT operations between nuclear spins. Our results open the door for novel quantum processing architectures for a wide variety of solid-state spin qubits.

TI Quantum Bose-Einstein Statistics for Indistinguishable Concepts in Human

SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB We investigate the hypothesis that within a combination of a 'number concept' plus a 'substantive concept', such as 'eleven animals', the identity and indistinguishability present on the level of the concepts, i.e., all eleven animals are identical and indistinguishable, gives rise to a statistical structure of the Bose-Einstein type similar to how Bose-Einstein statistics is present for identical and indistinguishable quantum particles. We proceed by identifying evidence for this hypothesis by extracting the statistical data from the World-Wide-Web utilizing the Google Search tool. By using the Kullback-Leibler divergence method, we then compare the obtained distribution with the Maxwell-Boltzmann as well as with the Bose-Einstein distributions and show that the Bose-Einstein's provides a better fit as compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann's.

TI Enhancement, brightening and control of radiative emission of dark
   exciton in WSe2 monolayer by plasmonic effect
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Dark excitons in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors (TMDs) have long radiative lifetimes, making them promising for quantum information and optoelectronics. Their detection and control are challenging due to weak out-of-plane dipole moments and momentum mismatch with free-space photons. Using ab initio calculations (DFT + G0W0 + BSE), a Wannier-Mott exciton model, and a numerical solution of the Laplace equation, we model the tip-enhanced near-field and its interaction with excitons via first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. Focusing on WSe2 monolayers, we show that the strong out-of-plane near field from a metallic tip enhances radiative recombination of spin-forbidden dark excitons by providing additional in-plane momentum to overcome momentum mismatch. We also analyze substrate screening effects on excitonic properties and lifetimes. Our results offer a theoretical framework for controlled activation of dark excitons toward quantum and nanophotonic applications.

TI Dual-domain coherent emission: Photon-magnon laser in a hybrid quantum
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantum theoretical framework that describes the simultaneous emergence of magnon-and photon lasing in a tripartite hybrid solid-state platform. The system integrates optically pumped nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, a magnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) microsphere, and a microwave (MW) cavity. Through a comprehensive analysis of the system's dynamics, we reveal the cooperative interactions that drive coherent-stimulated emission in both the magnonic (spin-wave) and photonic (electromagnetic) domains. The model outlines a scalable configuration in which NV centers, excited via optical pumping, couple efficiently to the magnon modes of the YIG sphere placed inside the microwave cavity. Numerical simulations based on experimentally accessible parameters confirm the feasibility of dual-domain lasing. This work advances the integration of photonic and magnonic platforms, opening new opportunities for quantum-enhanced sensing, low-power spintronics, and on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Matchgate Circuits Deeply Thermalize
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this "projected ensemble" exhibits deep thermalization: for large system sizes, it converges toward a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving momentwise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale t L2 set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.

TI Superdense coding for V-shaped channel and cylindrical geometry
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We have examined the possibility of quantum dense coding for the V-shaped channel and cylindrical geometry of plasmonic waveguides by assuming certain initial states at different dipole-dipole distances. It is found that the dense coding capacity initially decreases and then gradually increases until it becomes steady (& chi; = 1) at later time. We also revealed the optimal time valid for super-dense coding regarding each initial state. It is worth noting that dense coding capacity is valid for all other states for a time less than optimal time (t < & tau; ( o )) except for pure state. The estimated optimal time for a V-shaped channel is prominent due to greater & beta;-factor accomplishing it as a prosperous geometry for Superdense coding. The greater optimal time for V-shaped channel entitles this geometry a benchmark for the practical applications of quantum information technology.

TI Quantifying Complementarity via Robustness of Asymmetry
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Complementarity plays a central role in the conceptual development of quantum mechanics, and also provides practical applications in quantum information technologies. How to properly quantify it is an important problem in quantum foundations, and there exists different types of complementarity relations. In this paper, a complementarity relation is established with the robustness of asymmetry. Specifically, the two complementary aspects are quantified by applying the robustness of asymmetry corresponding to two cyclic groups whose generators are linked by the Fourier matrix. This complementarity relation is compared with known results and considered in other perspectives, especially its operational meaning regarding quantum state discrimination. We conclude that the internal asymmetry of quantum states is closely related to other fundamental concepts, such as complementarity and coherence, and it is possible to quantitatively investigate complementarity and quantum state discrimination using the robustness of asymmetry.

TI Dilution refrigerator and its heat transfer problems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the research of cryogenic physics and quantum information science, it is essential to maintain a steady low temperature of millikelvin regime continuously. Dilution refrigerator is a widely used refrigeration device to achieve extremely low temperature. It utilizes the phase separation effect of superfluid He-4 and its isotope He-3 mixed solution at ultra-low temperatures. The performance of heat exchanger is the key factor to determine the performance of continuous cycle refrigerating machine. At extremely low temperatures, there appears a huge interfacial thermal resistance between helium and metal (Kapitza resistance), and the problem of heat exchange can be effectively solved by using the porous sintered metal particles to increase the contact area. Therefore, it is of significance to study the heat exchange between metal particles and liquid helium at extremely low temperature and to develop the relevant high-performance sintered Ag powder heat exchanger.

TI Entangling entanglement: coupling frequency and polarization of
   biphotons on demand
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information is often carried in the frequency and polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) in single photons and entangled photons. We demonstrate an approach to couple and decouple the frequency and polarization DoFs of broadband biphotons. Our approach is based on a nonlinear interferometer consisting of a linear dispersive medium and a polarization controller in between the two biphoton sources (nonlinear media). When the two DoFs are decoupled, maximally polarization-entangled biphotons are observed in the polarization DoF, while interference fringes are observed in the spectrum of the biphotons. When the two DoFs are coupled, by adjusting the polarization controller, interference fringes disappear from the spectrum and instead appear in the degree of polarization entanglement, varying between 0 and 1, depending on the signal and idler frequencies. Our approach offers a convenient means of tuning the polarization entanglement and can be employed for arbitrary biphoton polarization state generation.

TI Quantum flux operators for Carrollian diffeomorphism in general
   dimensions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We construct Carrollian scalar field theories in general dimensions, mainly focusing on the boundaries of Minkowski and Rindler spacetime, whose quantum flux operators form a faithful representation of Carrollian diffeomorphism up to a central charge, respectively. At future/past null infinity, the fluxes are physically observable and encode rich information of the radiation. The central charge may be regularized to be finite by the spectral zeta function or heat kernel method on the unit sphere. For the theory at the Rindler horizon, the effective central charge is proportional to the area of the bifurcation surface after regularization. Moreover, the zero mode of supertranslation is identified as the modular Hamiltonian, linking Carrollian diffeomorphism to quantum information theory. Our results may hold for general null hypersurfaces and provide new insight in the study of the Carrollian field theory, asymptotic symmetry group and entanglement entropy.

TI Near-unity efficiency and photon indistinguishability for the
   "hourglass" single-photon source using suppression of the background
   emission
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB An on-going challenge within scalable optical quantum information processing is to increase the collection efficiency epsilon and the photon indistinguishability eta of the single-photon source toward unity. Within quantum dot-based sources, the prospect of increasing the product epsilon eta arbitrarily close to unity was recently questioned. In this work, we discuss the influence of the trade-off between efficiency and indistinguishability in the presence of phonon-induced decoherence, and we show that the photonic "hourglass " design allows for improving epsilon eta beyond the predicted maximum for the standard micropillar design subject to this trade-off. This circumvention of the trade-off is possible thanks to control of the spontaneous emission into background radiation modes, and our work highlights the importance of engineering of the background emission in future pursuits of near-unity performance of quantum dot single-photon sources.

TI Tunable gyromagnetic augmentation of nuclear spins in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Nuclear spins in solids exhibit long coherence times due to the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio. This weak environmental coupling comes at the expense of slow quantum gate operations, which should be as fast as possible for many applications in quantum information processing and sensing. In this work we use nitrogenvacancy centers in diamond to probe the nuclear spins within dark paramagnetic nitrogen defects (P1 centers) in the diamond lattice. The gyromagnetic ratio of the P1 nuclear spin is augmented by hyperfine coupling to the electron spin, resulting in greatly enhanced coupling to radio frequency control fields. We then demonstrate that this effect can be tuned by variation of an external magnetic field. Our work identifies regimes in which we are able to implement fast quantum control of dark nuclear spins and lays the foundations for further inquiry into rapid control of long-lived spin qubits at room temperature.

TI Bootstrapping quantum extremal surfaces. Part I. The area operator
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum extremal surfaces are central to the connection between quantum information theory and quantum gravity and they have played a prominent role in the recent progress on the information paradox. We initiate a program to systematically link these surfaces to the microscopic data of the dual conformal field theory, namely the scaling dimensions of local operators and their OPE coefficients. We consider CFT states obtained by acting on the vacuum with single-trace operators, which are dual to one-particle states of the bulk theory. Focusing on AdS(3)/CFT2, we compute the CFT entanglement entropy to second order in the large c expansion where quantum extremality becomes important and match it to the expectation value of the bulk area operator. We show that to this order, the Virasoro identity block contributes solely to the area operator.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A quantum processor to import, process, and export optical quantum states is a common core technology enabling various photonic quantum information processing. However, there has been no photonic processor that is simultaneously universal, scalable, and programmable. Here, we report on an original loop-based single-mode versatile photonic quantum processor that is designed to be universal, scalable, and programmable. Our processor can perform arbitrarily many steps of programmable quantum operations on a given single-mode optical quantum state by time-domain processing in a dynamically controlled loop-based optical circuit. We use this processor to demonstrate programmable single-mode Gaussian gates and multistep squeezing gates. In addition, we prove that the processor can perform universal quantum operations by injecting appropriate ancillary states and also be straightforwardly extended to a multimode processor. These results show that our processor is programmable, scalable, and potentially universal, leading to be suitable for general-purpose applications.

TI Cavity-enhanced broadband photonic Rabi oscillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A coherent coupling among different energy photons provided by nonlinear optical interaction is regarded as a photonic version of the Rabi oscillation. Cavity enhancement of the nonlinearity reduces an energy requirement significantly and pushes the scalability of the frequency-encoded photonic circuit based on the photonic Rabi oscillation. However, the confinement of the photons in the cavity severely limits the number of interactable frequency modes. Here we demonstrate a wide-bandwidth and efficient photonic Rabi oscillation achieving full-cycle oscillation based on a cavity-enhanced nonlinear optical interaction with a monolithic integration. We also show its versatile manipulation beyond the frequency degree of freedom such as an all-optical control for polarizing photons with geometric phase. Our results will open up full control accessible to synthetic dimensional photonic systems over wide frequency modes as well as a large-scale photonic quantum information processing.

TI Fidelity-based supervised and unsupervised learning for binary
   classification of quantum states
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Here, we develop two quantum-computational schemes for supervised and unsupervised classification tasks in a quantum world by employing the quantum information-geometric tools of quantum fidelity and quantum search algorithm. Presuming that pure states of a set of given quantum systems (or objects) belong to one of two known classes, the objective here is to decide to which of these classes each system belongs-without knowing its state. The supervised binary classification algorithm is based on having a training sample of quantum systems whose class memberships are already known. The unsupervised binary classification algorithm, however, uses a quantum oracle which knows the class membership of the states of the computational basis. Both algorithms require the ability to evaluate the fidelity between states of the quantum systems with unknown states, for which here we also develop a general scheme.

TI Harvesting stabilizer entropy and nonlocality from a quantum field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as nonstabilizerness, commonly dubbed magic and quantified by the stabilizer Renyi entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular nonlocal form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This nonlocal SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and nonstabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the ClauserHorne-Shimony-Holt inequalities: when restricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e., Pauli measurements, one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field.

TI Critical size for sustaining magnetic flux: Revisiting del. B=0 at the
   nanoscale
SO MRS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We establish the theoretical construct of an isolated magnetic nanoparticle, defined as a single magnetic particle free from inter-particle dipolar interactions. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the classical Maxwellian condition del.B = 0 breaks down at a critical nanoscale size (similar to 25.7 nm), below which the condition loses physical relevance for isolated particles. At these dimensions, discrete dipole effects, flux quantization, and incomplete flux closure dominate, replacing the smooth field behavior of bulk systems. The requirement of a minimum cross-sectional area to sustain a single magnetic flux quantum provides a natural size threshold for magnetic stability at the nanoscale. This work establishes a conceptual and quantitative boundary between classical and quantum magnetism, offering new insights into nanoscale magnetic phenomena and guiding the design of novel magnetic nanostructures, spintronic elements, and quantum magnetic devices.

TI Maximizing the azimuthal-angle correlation in the decay of vector boson
   pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Spin correlation observables of particles produced at colliders generally depend on the coordinate basis. While spin correlations and their associated basis dependence have been studied in top-quark pair production, the basis dependence of spin correlations of W-+/- pairs has not been studied. In this work, we focus on the azimuthal-angle correlation in the decay of W-+/- pairs, which encodes spin information in the direction transverse to the rotational axis. We quantitatively describe the basis dependence of the relative azimuthal angle. We further present the optimal coordinate direction to define the azimuthal angle between the decay products of W-+/- bosons to achieve the maximal spin correlation based on symmetry considerations. The results can be used to optimize the measurement of the CP-even and CP-odd interactions, and have applications to quantum information observables in the vector boson pair system.

TI Characterization of near-infrared to telecom frequency conversion in a

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We experimentally investigate near-infrared to telecommunications frequency conversion via a diamond four-wave mixing scheme in rubidium vapor contained within a hollow-core photonic-crystal fiber. The strong light-atom interaction in the fiber results in lower pump power requirements and higher conversion efficiency than can be achieved under equivalent conditions in a rubidium vapor cell. We also observe non-intuitive pump and signal frequency dependence of the four-wave mixing efficiency in the fiber due to the large nonlinearities present in the system. These results indicate the potential for hollow-core fibers to provide a scalable solution for quantum information network infrastructure, with additional modelling required for a full understanding of the extreme atom-light interaction effects present.

The membrane resonator has a thickness of 100 nm and 2D-photonic and phononic crystal patterns.

TI Multi-parameter quantum estimation of single- and two-mode pure Gaussian
   states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We discuss the ultimate precision bounds on the multiparameter estimation of single- and two-mode pure Gaussian states. By leveraging on previous approaches that focused on the estimation of a complex displacement only, we derive the Holevo Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (HCRB) for both displacement and squeezing parameter characterizing single and two-mode squeezed states. In the single-mode scenario, we obtain an analytical bound and find that it degrades monotonically as the squeezing increases. Furthermore, we prove that heterodyne detection is nearly optimal in the large squeezing limit, but in general the optimal measurement must include non-Gaussian resources. On the other hand, in the two-mode setting, the HCRB improves as the squeezing parameter grows and we show that it can be attained using double-homodyne detection.

TI Parallel Assembly of Arbitrary Defect-Free Atom Arrays with a
   Multitweezer Algorithm br
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Defect-free atom arrays are a precursor for quantum information processing and quantum simulationwith neutral atoms. Yet, large-scale defect-free atom arrays can be challenging to realize, due to the lossesencountered when rearranging stochastically loaded atoms to achieve a desired target array. Here, wedemonstrate a parallel rearrangement algorithm that uses multiple mobile tweezers to independently sortand compress atom arrays in a way that naturally avoids atom collisions. With a high degree of parallelism,our algorithm offers a reduced move complexity compared to both single-tweezer algorithms and existingmultitweezer algorithms. We further determine the optimal degree of parallelism to be a balance betweenan algorithmic speedup and multitweezer inhomogeneity effects. The defect-free probability for a 225-atom array is demonstrated to be as high as 33(1)% in a room-temperature setup after multiple cycles ofrearrangement. The algorithm presented here can be implemented for any target array geometry with anunderlying periodic structure.

TI Colossal Nernst power factor in topological semimetal NbSb2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Today solid-state cooling technologies below liquid nitrogen boiling temperature (77K), crucial to quantum information technology and probing quantum state of matter, are greatly limited due to the lack of good thermoelectric and/or thermomagnetic materials. Here, we report the discovery of colossal Nernst power factor of 3800x10(-4)Wm(-1) K-2 under 5T at 25K and high Nernst figure-of-merit of 71x10(-4)K(-1) under 5T at 20K in topological semimetal NbSb2 single crystals. The observed high thermomagnetic performance is attributed to large Nernst thermopower and longitudinal electrical conductivity, and relatively low transverse thermal conductivity. The large and unsaturated Nernst thermopower is the result of the combination of highly desirable electronic structures of NbSb2 having compensated high mobility electrons and holes near Fermi level and strong phonon-drag effect. This discovery opens an avenue for exploring material option for the solid-state heat pumping below liquid nitrogen temperature.

TI Giant atom-mediated single photon routing between two waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, the single photon scattering due to a giant atom coupled with a pair of waveguides is investigated theoretically. Using the real-space Hamiltonian, four scattering amplitudes are obtained, and the single photon routing properties are studied. Calculations reveal that the single photon routing properties are strongly dependent on the size of the giant atom. The possible physical mechanism is also discussed. To improve routing efficiency, the configuration where one waveguide is terminated is further studied. The calculated results indicate that an incident photon can be transferred to the other waveguide with unit efficiency by choosing the appropriate configuration for a fixed size of the giant atom. Our results may be used in quantum information processing and design quantum devices at single-photon level.

TI On-chip optical levitation with a metalens in vacuum
SO OPTICA
AB Optical levitation of dielectric particles in vacuum is a powerful technique for precision measurements, testing fundamental physics, and quantum information science. Conventional optical tweezers require bulky optical components for trapping and detection. Here, we design and fabricate an ultrathin dielectric metalens with a high numerical aperture of 0.88 at 1064 nm in vacuum. It consists of 500-nm-thick silicon nano-antennas, which are compatible with an ultrahigh vacuum. We demonstrate optical levitation of nanoparticles in vacuum with a single metalens. The trapping frequency can be tuned by changing the laser power and polarization. We also transfer a levitated nanoparticle between two separated optical tweezers. Optical levitation with an ultrathin metalens in vacuum provides opportunities for a wide range of applications including on-chip sensing. Such metalenses will also be useful for trapping ultracold atoms and molecules. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Controllable Spin Switching in a Single-Molecule Magnetic Tunneling
   Junction
SO NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB A new type of spin-current filter is proposed that consists of a single-molecule magnet (SMM) coupled to two normal metal electrodes. It is shown that this tunneling junction can generate a highly spin-polarized current, whose spin polarization can be switched by means of magnetic fields and gate voltages applied to the SMM. This spin switching in the SMM tunnel junction arises from spin-selective single-electron resonant tunneling via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit of the SMM. The electron current spectrum is still spin polarized in the absence of an external magnetic field, which can help to judge whether the molecule's spin state has reached the ground-state doublet vertical bar +/- S). This device can be realized with current technologies and may have practical use in spintronics and quantum information.

TI Refining Ky Fan's Majorization Relation with Linear Programming
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established on the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.

TI Out-of-time-ordered correlators of mean-field bosons via Bogoliubov
   theory
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum many-body chaos concerns the scrambling of quantum information among large numbers of degrees of freedom. It rests on the prediction that out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) of the form ([A(t), B]2) can be connected to classical symplectic dynamics. We rigorously prove a variant of this correspondence principle for mean-field bosons. We show that the N -+ o0 limit of the OTOC ([A(t), B]2) is explicitly given by a suitable symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics. In practical terms, we describe the dynamical build-up of many-body entanglement between a particle and the whole system by an explicit nonlinear PDE on L2(R3) L2(R3). For higher-order correlators, we obtain an out-of-time-ordered analog of the Wick rule. The proof uses Bogoliubov theory. Our finding spotlights a new problem in nonlinear dispersive PDE with implications for quantum many-body chaos.

TI Realizing robust edge-to-edge transport of atomic momentum states in a
   dynamically modulated synthetic lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum transport between distant nodes that is robust to experimental imperfections is essential for quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate efficient and robust edge-to-edge transport of atomic momentum states in a synthetic lattice of Bose-Einstein condensate, simulating a dynamically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This transport process relies on continuously controlling the effective nearest-neighbor couplings in the synthetic lattice, which constructs a unique chain between the left-and right edge states. The robustness of such transport is protected by the chiral symmetry of the system, demonstrated by subjecting the lattices to coupling-strength disorders. Furthermore, we implement a splitter operation through an SSH model with a topological interface at its center. Our approach provides an efficient single operation to achieve robust momenta transport with potential applications in coherent quantum control in atom optics.

TI Processing Entangled Photons in High Dimensions with a Programmable
   Light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-dimensional entanglement offers a variety of advantages for both fundamental and applied applications in quantum information science. A central building block for such applications is a programmable processor of entangled states, which is crucial for the certification, manipulation, and distribution of high-dimensional entanglement. The leading technology for processing photons is integrated multiport interferometers. However, such devices are incompatible with structured light and their scaling is challenging. Here, we unlock these limitations by demonstrating a reconfigurable processor of entangled photons in high dimensions that is based on multiplane light conversion (MPLC), a technology that has recently been developed for multiplexing hundreds of spatial modes for classical communication. We use our programmable MPLC platform to certify three-dimensional entanglement in two mutually unbiased bases, perform 400 arbitrary random transformations on entangled photons, and convert the mode basis of entangled photons for entanglement distribution.

TI Precisely spun super rotors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Improved optical control of molecular quantum states promises new applications including chemistry in the quantum regime, precision tests of fundamental physics, and quantum information processing. While much work has sought to prepare ground state molecules, excited states are also of interest. Here, we demonstrate a broadband optical approach to pump trapped SiO+ molecules into pure super rotor ensembles maintained for many minutes. Super rotor ensembles pumped up to rotational state N=67, corresponding to the peak of a 9400K distribution, had a narrow N spread comparable to that of a few-kelvin sample, and were used for spectroscopy of the previously unobserved C-2 Pi state. Significant centrifugal distortion of super rotors pumped up to N=230 allowed probing electronic structure of SiO+ stretched far from its equilibrium bond length. Optical pulses can be useful to create and control molecules in higher quantum states. Here the authors use optical pumping to create rotationally excited states of SiO+ molecular ion into super rotor ensemble.

TI Breaking adiabatic quantum control with deep learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, optimal digitized pulses are requisite for efficient quantum control. This goal is translated into dynamic programming, in which a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent is gifted. As a reference, shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) provide analytical approaches to adiabatic speedup by pulse control. Here, we select the single-component control of qubits, resembling the ubiquitous two-level Landau-Zener problem for gate operation. We aim at obtaining fast and robust digital pulses by combining the STA and DRL algorithm. In particular, we find that DRL leads to robust digital quantum control with the operation time bounded by quantum speed limits dictated by STA. In addition, we demonstrate that robustness against systematic errors can be achieved by DRL without any input from STA. Our results introduce a general framework of digital quantum control, leading to a promising enhancement in quantum information processing.

TI Effect of Active Photons on Dynamical Frustration in Cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the far-from-equilibrium dynamical regimes of a many-body spin-boson model with disordered couplings relevant for cavity QED and trapped ion experiments, using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation. We focus on the dynamics of spin observables upon varying the disorder strength and the frequency of the photons, finding that the latter can considerably alter the structure of the system's dynamical responses. When the photons evolve at a similar rate as the spins, they can induce qualitatively distinct frustrated dynamics characterized by either logarithmic or algebraically slow relaxation. The latter illustrates resilience of glassylike dynamics in the presence of active photonic degrees of freedom, suggesting that disordered quantum many-body systems with resonant photons or phonons can display a rich diagram of nonequilibrium responses, with near future applications for quantum information science.

TI Local models and Bell inequalities for the minimal triangle network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocal correlations created in networks with multiple independent sources enable surprising phenomena in quantum information and quantum foundations. The presence of independent sources, however, makes the analysis of network nonlocality challenging, and even in the simplest nontrivial scenarios a complete characterization is lacking. In this Letter we study one of the simplest of these scenarios, namely that of distributions invariant under permutations of parties in the minimal triangle network, which features no inputs and binary outcomes. We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario. Armed with them and with improved outer approximations of the set, we provide insights on the existence of a classical-quantum gap in the triangle network with binary outcomes.

TI Correlation-driven attosecond photoemission delay in the plasmonic
   excitation of C60 fullerene
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Extreme light confinement in plasmonic nanosystems enables novel applications in photonics, sensor technology, energy harvesting, biology, and quantum information processing. Fullerenes represent an extreme case for nanoplasmonics: They are subnanometer carbon-based molecules showing high-energy and ultrabroad plasmon resonances; however, the fundamental mechanisms driving the plasmonic response and the corresponding collective electron dynamics are still elusive. Here, we uncover the dominant role of electron correlations in the dynamics of the giant plasmon resonance (GPR) of the subnanometer system C60 by using attosecond photoemission chronoscopy. We find a characteristic photoemission delay of up to about 300 attoseconds that is purely induced by coherent large-scale electron correlations in the plasmonic potential. These results provide insights into the nature of the plasmon resonances in subnanometer systems and open perspectives for advancing nanoplasmonic applications.

TI Photonic implementation of the quantum Morra game
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Morra game, an age-old noncooperative game, traditionally played on one's hand, has proved to be a rich setting to study game-theoretic strategies, both classically and within the quantum realm. In this paper, we study a faithful translation of a two-player quantum Morra game, which builds on previous study by including the classical game as a special case. We propose a natural deformation of the game in the quantum regime in which Alice has a winning advantage, breaking the balance of the classical game. A Nash equilibrium can be found in some cases by employing a pure strategy, which is impossible in the classical game where a mixed strategy is always required. We prepared our states using photonic qubits on a linear optics setup, with an average deviation .2% with respect to the measured outcome probabilities. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the quantum Morra game to the study of quantum information and communication.

TI Microscopic origin of polarization-entangled Stokes-anti-Stokes photons
   in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Time-correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering has been studied in different transparent media, more frequently in diamond. While the nonclassical nature of the SaS scattered photons has been well established, the presence of entanglement in this spontaneous four-wave mixing process has not been demonstrated. Here, we show the violation of the Bell-type Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for the polarization of SaS photon pairs near a Raman resonance in diamond. The degree of entanglement depends on the detuning of the photon pairs from the degenerate two-photon pump and on the orientation of the polarization of the incident light with respect to the crystallographic orientation of the sample. This result opens up the possibility to tailor the quantum state of photon pairs without stringent constraints of phase matching and to combine quantum optics and SaS Raman spectroscopy for new applications in materials science and quantum information.

TI Avenues to generalising Bell inequalities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Characterizing the set of all Bell inequalities is a notably hard task. An insightful method of solving it in case of Bell correlation inequalities for scenarios with two dichotomic measurements per site-for arbitrary number of parties-was given in references [2001 Phys. Rev. A 64 010102(R)] and [2001 Phys. Rev. A 64 032112]. Using complex-valued correlation functions, we generalize their approach to a broader class of Bell scenarios, in which the parties may choose from more than two multi-outcome measurements. Although the resulting families of Bell inequalities are not always tight, their coefficients have an intuitively understandable structure. We probe their usefulness by numerically testing their ability to detect Bell nonclassicality in simple interferometric experiments. Moreover, we identify a similar structure in the CGLMP inequality expressed in a correlation-based form, which allows us to generalise it to three parties.

TI Circuit Complexity in Topological Quantum Field Theory
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum circuit complexity has played a central role in recent advances in holography and many-body physics. Within quantum field theory, it has typically been studied in a Lorentzian (real-time) framework. In a departure from standard treatments, we aim to quantify the complexity of the Euclidean path integral. In this setting, there is no clear separation between space and time, and the notion of unitary evolution on a fixed Hilbert space no longer applies. As a proof of concept, we argue that the pants decomposition provides a natural notion of circuit complexity within the category of 2-dimensional bordisms and use it to formulate the circuit complexity of states and operators in 2-dimensional topological quantum field theory. We comment on analogies between our formalism and others in quantum mechanics, such as tensor networks and second quantization.

TI Quantum phase modulation with acoustic cavities and quantum dots
SO OPTICA
AB Fast, efficient, and low-power modulation of light at microwave frequencies is crucial for chip-scale classical and quantum processing as well as for long-range networks of superconducting quantum processors. A successful approach to bridge the gap between microwave and optical photons has been to use intermediate platforms, such as acoustic waves, that couple efficiently to a variety of quantum systems. Here, we use gigahertz-frequency focusing surface acoustic wave cavities on GaAs that are piezo-electrically coupled to superconducting circuits and parametrically coupled, via strain, to photons scattered from InAs quantum dots. We demonstrate modulation of single photons with a half-wave voltage as low as 44 mV, and subnatural modulation sideband linewidths. These demonstrations pave the way for efficient and low-noise transduction of quantum information between microwave and optical domains.

TI Entanglement amplification from rotating black holes
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB The quantum vacuum has long been known to be characterized by field correlations between spacetime points. We show that such correlations-vacuum entanglement-in the environment of near-extremal black holes is significantly amplified (up to ten-fold) relative to their slowly rotating counterparts. We demonstrate this effect for rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes by measuring the entanglement through the concurrence extracted from the vacuum via two-level quantum systems (Unruh-DeWitt detectors). The effect is manifest at intermediate distances from the horizon, and is most pronounced for near-extremal small mass black holes. The effect is also robust, holding for all boundary conditions of the field and at large spacelike detector separations. Smaller amplification occurs near the horizon, where we find that the entanglement shadow-a region near the black hole from which entanglement cannot be extracted-is diminished in size as the black hole's angular momentum increases.

TI Random density matrices: Analytical results for mean root fidelity and
   the mean-square Bures distance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Bures distance holds a special place among various distance measures due to its several distinguishing features and has applications in diverse problems in quantum information theory. It is related to fidelity, and among other things, it serves as a bona fide measure for quantifying the separability of quantum states. In this work, we calculate exact analytical results for the mean root fidelity and mean-square Bures distance between a fixed density matrix and a random density matrix and also between two random density matrices. In the course of derivation, we also obtain the spectral density for the product of the above pairs of density matrices. We corroborate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, we compare these results with the mean-square Bures distance between reduced density matrices generated using coupled kicked tops and find very good agreement.

TI Quantum detector tomography of a superconducting nanostrip
   photon-number-resolving detector
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Superconducting nanostrip photon detectors have been used as single-photon detectors, which can discriminate only photons' presence or absence. It has recently been found that they can discriminate the number of photons by analyzing the output signal waveform, and they are expected to be used in various fields, especially in optical-quantum-information processing. Here, we improve the photon-number-resolving performance for light with a high-average photon number by pattern matching of the output signal waveform. Furthermore, we estimate the positive-operator-valued measure of the detector by a quantum detector tomography. The result shows that the device has photon-number-resolving performance up to five photons without any multiplexing or arraying, indicating that it is useful as a photon-number-resolving detector.

TI Nuclear-spin relaxation in solid-state-defect quantum bits via
   electron-phonon coupling in the optically excited state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optically accessible solid-state-defect spins serve as a primary platform for quantum information processing, where precise control of the electron spin and ancillary nuclear spins is essential for operation. With use of the nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond as an example, by a combined group theory and density functional theory study we demonstrate that spin-lattice relaxation of the 14N nuclear spin is significantly enhanced due to strong entanglement with orbital degrees of freedom in the 3E) optically excited state of the defect. This mechanism is common to other solid-state-defect nuclear spins with similar optically excited states. Additionally, we propose a straightforward and versatile ab initio scheme for predicting orbital-dependent spin Hamiltonians for trigonal defects exhibiting orbital degeneracy.

TI Quantum Coherence and Mixedness in Hydrogen Atoms: Probing Hyperfine
   Structure Dynamics Under Dephasing Constraints
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We investigate the quantum dynamics of coherence in the hyperfine structure of hydrogen atoms subjected to dephasing noise, modeled using the Lindblad master equation. The effective Hamiltonian describes the spin-spin interaction between the electron and proton, with dephasing introduced via Lindblad operators. Analytical solutions for the time-dependent density matrix are derived for various initial states, including separable, partially entangled, and maximally entangled configurations. Quantum coherence is quantified through the l1-norm measures, while purity is evaluated to assess mixedness. Results demonstrate that coherence exhibits oscillatory decay modulated by the dephasing rate, with antiparallel spin states showing greater resilience against noise compared to parallel configurations. These findings highlight the interplay between coherent hyperfine dynamics and environmental dephasing, offering insights into preserving quantum resources in atomic systems for applications in quantum information science.

TI Chiral light detection with centrosymmetric-metamaterial-assisted
   valleytronics
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB The full-range, high-sensitivity and integratable detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is critically important for quantum information processing, advanced imaging systems and optical sensing technologies. However, mainstream CPL detectors rely on chiral absorptive materials, and thus suffer from limited response wavelengths, low responsivity and poor discrimination ratios. Here we present a chiral light detector by utilizing valley materials to observe the spin angular momentum carried by chiral light. Delicately designed centrosymmetric metamaterials that can preserve the sign of optical spin angular momentum and greatly enhance its intensity in the near field are harnessed as a medium to inject polarized electrons into valley materials, which are then detected by the valley Hall effect. This enables high-sensitivity infrared CPL detection at room temperature by valleytronic transistors, and the detection wavelength is extended to the infrared. This approach opens pathways for chiral light detection and provides insights into potential applications of valleytronics in optoelectronic sensing.

We proposed two types of cooperation between the converted photon processes in these multiple steps of scattering nutation in the cavity. One of them takes into consideration the cooperative process between the photons of each step of the multiple steps of Raman conversion. The second cooperative process takes place between the photons belonging to different steps of multiple scattering conversions. The proposed novel bimodal entangled sources take into consideration both the coherence and collective phenomena between the photons belonging to the system of the bimodal field obtained in multiple scattering emissions. The application of higher-order multiple Raman bimodal coherent field in quantum information is proposed.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the phase sensitivity by introducing the number -conserving generalized superposition of product into squeezed thermal state of the traditional SU(1,1) interferometer with intensity detection. We investigate the effect of different parameter and photon losses on phase sensitivity under the condition of the ideal and the realistic phase estimation process, respectively. Moreover, compared with the previous methods, our scheme can not only enhance the phase sensitivity, but also significantly suppress the photon losses with only first -order GSP operation. It means that our scheme needs less resources and less operations to obtain higher phase sensitivity. These above results indicate that our scheme is viable in the phase sensitivity improvement, which may have practical applications in quantum information processing.

TI Correlation engineering via nonlocal dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Controlling the spread of correlations in quantum many-body systems is a key challenge at the heart of quantum science and technology. Correlations are usually destroyed by dissipation arising from coupling between a system and its environment. Here, we show that dissipation can instead be used to engineer a wide variety of spatiotemporal correlation profiles in an easily tunable manner. We describe how dissipation with any translationally invariant spatial profile can be realized in cold atoms trapped in an optical cavity. A uniform external field and the choice of spatial profile can be used to design when and how dissipation creates or destroys correlations. We demonstrate this control by generating entanglement preferentially sensitive to a desired spatial component of a magnetic field. We thus establish nonlocal dissipation as a route toward engineering the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information, with potential applications in quantum metrology, state preparation, and transport.

TI Quantum estimation of Chernoff bound and Hoeffding bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Determining the closeness of two quantum states with minimal error probability is a central problem in quantum information theory. The optimal exponents characterizing the error probability in the symmetric and asymmetric settings are given by the quantum Chernoff bound (QCB) and the quantum Hoeffding bound (QHB), respectively. In this work, we introduce the first algorithms for estimating the QCB and QHB of two unknown states. We propose a unitary encoding for diagonal density matrix based on the copy matrix, which enables unbiased estimation of nonlinear matrix functions via quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For general density matrices, we combine QSVT with the Hadamard test to estimate both QCB and QHB. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm converges to the optimal value within a limited number of iterations. Furthermore, we establish the first integration of QSVT with convex optimization, yielding a hybrid quantum-classical framework for quantum estimation.

TI Periodic source of energy-entangled electrons in helical states coupled

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a source of purely electronic energy-entangled states implemented in a solid-state system with potential applications in quantum information protocols based on electron flying qubits. The proposed device relies on the standard tools of electron quantum optics and exploits entanglement of the Cooper pairs of a BCS superconductor. The latter is coupled via an adjustable quantum point contact to two opposite spin-polarized electron waveguides, which are driven by trains of Lorentzian pulses. This specific choice for the drive is crucial to inject purely electronic entangled states devoid of spurious electron-hole pairs. In the Andreev regime, a perturbative calculation in the tunnel coupling confirms that entangled electron states are generated at the output of the normal side. We introduce a quantity related to charge current cross correlations which allows one to experimentally verify the entangled nature of the emitted state.

TI Weak entanglement approximation for nuclear structure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB The interacting shell model, a configuration-interaction method, is a venerable approach for low-lying nuclear structure calculations, but it is hampered by the exponential growth of its basis dimension as one increases the single-particle space and/or the number of active particles. Recent, quantum-information-inspired work has demonstrated that the proton and neutron sectors of a nuclear wave function are weakly entangled. Furthermore, the entanglement is smaller for nuclides away from N = Z, such as heavy, neutron-rich nuclides. Here we implement a weak entanglement approximation to bipartite configuration-interaction wave functions, approximating low-lying levels by coupling a relatively small number of many-proton and many-neutron states. This truncation scheme, which we present in the context of past approaches, reduces the basis dimension by many orders of magnitude while preserving essential features of nuclear spectra.

TI Two-photon pumped exciton-polariton condensation
SO OPTICA
AB Two-photon absorption (TPA) allows accessing "dark" states of matter that are otherwise inaccessible to light, which serve as important building blocks for quantum information processing. In a semiconductor microcavity, TPA-driven condensation of strongly coupled light-matter exciton-polaritons can enable new solid-state quantum simulations of "dark" state-condensate interactions and was predicted to stimulate THz emission. Here, we report the first observation of two-photon-pumped polariton condensation, demonstrated by angle-resolved photoluminescence in a GaAs-based microcavity. TPA is evidenced in the quadratic emission dependence on pump power below and above the condensation threshold, and second-harmonic generation is ruled out by both this threshold behavior and by the emission peak energy showing no dependence on pump photon energy. Our results pave the way toward novel polariton-based sources and solid-state coherent control of collective quantum states with individual two-level systems.

TI Time scaling of entanglement in integrable scale-invariant theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In two-dimensional isotropic scale-invariant theories, the time scaling of the entanglement entropy of a segment is fixed via the conformal symmetry. We consider scale invariance in a more general sense and show that in integrable theories in which the scale invariance is anisotropic between time and space, parametrized by z, most of the entanglement is carried by the slow modes. At early times entanglement grows linearly due to the contribution of the fast modes, before smoothly entering a slow mode regime where it grows forever with t(1/1-z). The slow-mode regime admits a logarithmic enhancement in bosonic theories. We check our analytical results against numerical simulations in corresponding fermionic and bosonic lattice models and find extremely good agreement. We show that due to the dominance of the slow modes in these non-relativistic theories, local quantum information is scrambled independent of z in a stronger way, compared to their relativistic counterparts.

TI Dissipation-assisted preparation of steady spin-squeezed states of SiV
   centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an efficient scheme for generating spin-squeezed states at steady state in a spin-mechanical hybrid system, where an ensemble of SiV centers is coupled to a strongly damped nanomechanical resonator. We show that there exists a collective steady state in the system, which is exactly formed by the collective spin states plus the zero excitation state of the mechanical mode. The generation of the steady spin-squeezed state is based on a dissipative quantum dynamical process in which the mechanical dissipation plays a positive role but without destroying the target state. We demonstrate that the spin-squeezed steady state can be deterministically prepared via dissipative means, with the optimal spin squeezing up to 4/N in the ideal case, where N is the number of spins. This work provides a promising platform for quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

TI Demonstration of a squeezed light source on thin-film lithium niobate
   with modal phase matching
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Squeezed states are essential for continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing, with wide-ranging applications in computing, sensing, and communications. Integrated photonic circuits provide a scalable, convenient platform for building large CV circuits. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is particularly promising due to its low propagation loss, efficient parametric down conversion, and fast electro-optical modulation. In this work, we demonstrate a squeezed light source on an integrated TFLN platform, achieving a measured shot noise reduction of 0.46 dB (1.5 dB on-chip) using modal phase matching and grating couplers with an efficiency of up to-2.2 dB. The achieved squeezing is comparable to what has been observed using more complex circuitry based on periodic poling. The simpler design allows for compact, efficient, and reproducible sources of squeezed light. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Dynamical N-photon bundle emission
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Engineering multiphoton resources is of importance in quantum metrology, quantum lithography, and biological sensing. Here we propose a concept of dynamical emission of N strongly-correlated photons. This is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamical system driven by two Gaussian-pulse sequences. The underlying physical mechanism relies on the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage that allows efficient and selective preparation of target multiphoton states. Assisted by the photon decay, a highly pure N-photon bundle emission takes place in this system. In particular, the dynamical N-photon bundle emission can be tuned by controlling the time interval between consecutive pulses so that the device behaves as an N-photon gun, which can be triggered on demand. Our work opens up a route to achieve multiphoton source devices, which have wide potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

TI Atomic optical spatial mode extractor for vector beams based on
   polarization-dependent absorption
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Vector beams with spiral phase and spatially varying polarization profiles have many applications from optical micromanipulation to materials processing. Here, we propose and demonstrate an atomic spatial mode extracting scheme for the vector beam based on polarization-dependent absorption in the atom vapor. By employing the linear polarization pump beam which induces polarization sensitive absorption in the atomic ensemble, a counter-propagated weak probe vector beam is extracted by spatial absorption, and extracted part still maintains the original polarization and the vortex phase. The topological charges of the extracted mode are verified by interfering with the Gaussian beam, and it can be found that the orbital angular momentum is conserved in the extracting process. Our work will have potential applications in non-destructive spatial mode identification, and is also useful for studying higher-dimensional quantum information based on atomic ensembles.

   nitride-on-silicon waveguide photodetectors in a visible-light
   integrated photonics platform
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Visible and near-infrared spectrum photonic integrated circuits are quickly becoming a key technology to address the scaling challenges in quantum information and biosensing. Thus far, integrated photonic platforms in this spectral range have lacked integrated photodetectors. Here, we report silicon nitride-on-silicon waveguide photodetectors that are monolithically integrated in a visible light photonic platform on silicon. Owing to a leaky-wave silicon nitride-on-silicon design, the devices achieved a high external quantum efficiency of >60% across a record wavelength span from lambda similar to 400 nm to > 640 nm, an opto-electronic bandwidth up to 9 GHz, and an avalanche gain-bandwidth product up to 173 +/- 30 GHz. As an example, a photodetector was integrated with a wavelength-tunable microring in a single chip for on-chip power monitoring.

TI Emerging Trend in Unconventional Metasurfaces: From Nonlinear,

SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Metasurfaces, benefiting from the flexibility in engineering the resonance, near-field, symmetry, and scattering properties of individual building blocks, are promising not only for a wide range of practical applications in the classical linear optical regime, but also facilitate research into new unconventional areas. Very recently, we have been witnessing the second quantum revolution in which quantum information processing and computation are becoming a reality. In this review, we will focus on some of the emerging developments of metasurfaces that work in the nonlinear, non-Hermitian, nonclassical, or quantum regime. We review some of the common principles shared by the development of these metasurfaces, including local field enhancement and the consideration of structure, lattice, and time-reversal symmetries.

TI Complete population inversion of maximally entangled states in
   22N-level systems via Pythagorean-triple coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Maximally entangled states play a central role in quantum information processing. Despite much progress throughout the years, robust protocols for manipulations of such states in many-level systems are still scarce. Here we present a control scheme that allows efficient manipulation of complete population inversion between two maximally entangled states. Exploiting the self-duality of SU(2), we present in this work a family of 2(2N)-level systems with couplings related to Pythagorean triples that make a complete population inversion from one state to another (orthogonal) state, using very few couplings and generators. We relate our method to the recently developed retrograde-canon scheme and derive a more general complete transfer recipe. We also discuss the cases of (2n)(2)-level systems, (2n + 1)(2)-level systems, and other unitary groups, and give a geometrical description of the inversion via the Majorana sphere.

TI Experimental verification of threshold quantum state tomography on a
   fully-reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Reconstructing the state of a quantum system represents a pivotal task for quantum information applications. The standard approach based on quantum state tomography requires a number of measurements that scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Other methods have been proposed and tested to reduce the number of measurements, or to focus on specific properties of the output state rather than on its complete reconstruction. Here, we show experimentally the application of an approach, called threshold quantum state tomography, in an advanced hybrid photonic platform with states up to n = 4 qubits. This method does not require prior knowledge and selects only the informative projectors starting from the measurement of the density matrix diagonal. We demonstrate its effectiveness by showing that a consistent reduction in the number of measurements is obtained for relevant states, with only very limited loss of information. These results open perspective for its application in larger systems.

TI Revealing localized excitons in
   WSe2/β-Ga2O3
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We have investigated the optical and magneto-optical properties of monolayer (ML) WSe2 on flakes of beta-Ga2O3 under high magnetic fields. Remarkably, sharp emission peaks were observed and associated with localized excitons related to point defects. A detailed study of low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magneto-PL under high perpendicular magnetic field up to 9 T was carried out. Several sharp emission peaks have shown valley g-factors values close to -4, which is an unusual result for localized excitons in WSe2. Furthermore, some PL peaks have shown higher g-factor values of approximate to-7 and approximate to-12, which were associated with the hybridization of strain localized dark excitons and defects. The reported results suggest that beta-Ga2O3 is, indeed, a promising dielectric substrate for ML WSe2 and also to explore fundamental physics in view of possible applications in quantum information technology.

TI Fast reconstruction of programmable integrated interferometers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Programmable linear optical interferometers are important for classical and quantum information technologies, as well as for building hardware-accelerated artificial neural networks. Recent results showed the possibility of constructing optical interferometers that could implement arbitrary transformations of input fields even in the case of high manufacturing errors. The building of detailed models of such devices drastically increases the efficiency of their practical use. The integral design of interferometers complicates its reconstruction since the internal elements are hard to address. This problem can be approached by using optimization algorithms [Opt. Express 29, 38429 (2021)]. In this paper, we present what we believe to be a novel efficient algorithm based on linear algebra only, which does not use computationally expensive optimization procedures. We show that this approach makes it possible to perform fast and accurate characterization of high-dimensional programmable integrated interferometers. Moreover, the method provides access to the physical characteristics of individual interferometer layers.

TI Optimally Controlled Non-Adiabatic Quantum State Transmission in the
   Presence of Quantum Noise
SO PHOTONICS
AB Pulse-controlled non-adiabatic quantum state transmission (QST) was proposed many years ago. However, in practice environmental noise inevitably damages communication quality in the proposal. In this paper, we study the optimally controlled non-adiabatic QST in the presence of quantum noise. By using the Adam algorithm, we find that the optimal pulse sequence can dramatically enhance the transmission fidelity of such an open system. In comparison with the idealized pulse sequence in a closed system, it is interesting to note that the improvement of the fidelity obtained by the Adam algorithm can even be better for a bath strongly coupled to the system. Furthermore, we find that the Adam algorithm remains powerful for different numbers of sites and different types of Lindblad operators, showing its universality in performing optimal control of quantum information processing tasks.

TI Imaging dark charge emitters in diamond via carrier-to-photon conversion
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The application of color centers in wide-bandgap semiconductors to nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing largely rests on our knowledge of the surrounding crystalline lattice, often obscured by the countless classes of point defects the material can host. Here, we monitor the fluorescence from a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center in diamond as we illuminate its vicinity. Cyclic charge state conversion of neighboring point defects sensitive to the excitation beam leads to a position-dependent stream of photo-generated carriers whose capture by the probe NV- leads to a fluorescence change. This "charge-to-photon" conversion scheme allows us to image other individual point defects surrounding the probe NV, including nonfluorescent "single-charge emitters" that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Given the ubiquity of color center photochromism, this strategy may likely find extensions to material systems other than diamond.

TI Rydberg Series Excitation of a Single Trapped
   40Ca+ Ion for Precision Measurements and Principal
   Quantum Number Scalings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A complete set of spectroscopic data is indispensable when using Rydberg states of trapped ions for quantum information processing. We carried out Rydberg series spectroscopy for nS(1/2) states with 38 <= n <= 65 and for nD(5/2) states with 37 <= n <= 50 on a single trapped Ca-40(+) ion. We determined the ionization energy of 2 870 575.582(15) GHz, 60 times more accurately as compared to the accepted value and contradicting it by 7.5 standard deviations. We confirm quantum defect values of delta S-1/2 = 1.802 995(5) and delta D-5/2 = 0.626 888(9) for nS(1/2) and nD(5/2) states, respectively, which allow for unambiguous addressing of Rydberg levels of Ca+ ions. Our measurements confirm Rydberg ion scaling properties, e.g., for blackbody induced ionization, linewidths and excitation strengths.

TI Single collective excitation of an atomic array trapped along a
   waveguide: A study of cooperative emission for different atomic chain
   configurations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ordered atomic arrays trapped in the vicinity of nanoscale waveguides offer original light-matter interfaces, with applications to quantum information and quantum nonlinear optics. Here, we study the decay dynamics of a single collective atomic excitation coupled to a waveguide in different configurations. The atoms are arranged as a linear array and only a segment of them is excited to a superradiant mode and emits light into the waveguide. Additional atomic chains placed on one or both sides play a passive role, either reflecting or absorbing this emission. We show that when varying the geometry, such a one-dimensional atomic system could be able to redirect the emitted light, to directionally reduce or enhance it, and in some cases to localize it in a cavity formed by the atomic mirrors bounding the system.

TI Operating a passive on-chip superconducting circulator: Device control
   and quasiparticle effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Microwave circulators play an important role in quantum technology based on superconducting circuits. The conventional circulator design, which employs ferrite materials, is bulky and involves strong magnetic fields, rendering it unsuitable for integration on superconducting chips. One promising design for an on-chip superconducting circulator is based on a passive Josephson-junction ring. In this paper, we consider two operational issues for such a device: circuit tuning and the effects of quasiparticle tunneling. We compute the scattering matrix using adiabatic elimination and derive the parameter constraints to achieve optimal circulation. We then numerically optimize the circulator performance over the full set of external control parameters, including gate voltages and flux bias, to demonstrate that this multidimensional optimization converges quickly to find optimal working points. We also consider the possibility of quasiparticle tunneling in the circulator ring and how it affects signal circulation. Our results form the basis for practical operation of a passive on-chip superconducting circulator made from a ring of Josephson junctions.

TI Composable Framework for Device-Independent State Certification
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Certifying a quantum state in a device-independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state-certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information-theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self-test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet state in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.

TI Detection of single-mode thermal microwave photons using an underdamped
   Josephson junction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency f, the most sensitive detector counts single quanta of energy hf. Single photon detectors have been demonstrated from gamma-rays to infrared wavelengths, with ongoing efforts to extend their range to microwaves. Here we show that an underdamped Josephson junction can detect 14 GHz thermal photons, with energy 10 yJ or 50 mu eV, stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and the detector, we vary the cavity temperature and measure the photon rate. The device achieves 45% efficiency and a dark count rate of 0.1 Hz over several GHz. Demonstrated super-Poissonian photon statistics is a signature of thermal light and a hallmark of quantum chaos. We discuss applications in dark matter axion searches and note its relevance to quantum information and fundamental physics.

TI Medical image edge detection in the framework of quantum representations
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The utilization of automated techniques for processing and analyzing medical images can offer significant support to doctors in their diagnostic and therapeutic practices. This study focuses on the complex task of detecting edges in medical images. To this end, we propose novel multilevel approaches based on quantum image representations of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional histograms of the gray-level distributions. The quantum Re ' nyi entropy is employed to quantify the quantum information present in the two histogram types. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to identify the optimal threshold values. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated by comparing them to benchmark methods using a set of medical images. The numerical results substantiate the efficacy of the introduced approaches.

TI Deterministic and complete hyperentangled Bell states analysis assisted
   by frequency and time interval degrees of freedom
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Hyperentangled Bell states analysis (HBSA) is an essential building block for certain hyper-parallel quantum information processing. We propose a complete and deterministic HBSA scheme encoded m spatial and polarization degrees of freedom (DOFs) of two-photon system assisted by a fixed frequency-based entanglement and a time interval DOE The parity information the spatial-based and polarization-based hyper-entanglement can be distinguished by the distinct time intervals of the photon pairs, and the phase information can be distinguished by the detection signature. Compared with previous schemes, the number of the auxiliary entanglements is reduced from two to one by introducing time interval DOF. Moreover, the additional frequency and time interval DOFs suffer less from the collective channel noise.

TI Critical behavior of quantum Fisher information in finite-size open
   Dicke model
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We explore the steady-state critical behavior of the finite-size open Dicke model-a model that incorporates spontaneous emission decay of the collective atomic spin states and decay of the cavity field. From the perspective of quantum information theory, we can often better characterize the quantum phase transition. In this paper, we characterize the super-radiant phase transition of the steady state of the open Dicke model by numerically calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We calculate the QFI for the atomic state and the cavity field state, as well as their derivatives. We find that the QFI of the cavity field state is more sensitive to atomic decay, and is suppressed more severely in the presence of atomic decay. In contrast, the QFI of the atomic state is less sensitive to the photon loss of the cavity field. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Centimeter-Scale Propagation of Optical Surface Waves at Visible
   Wavelengths
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Guiding and confining light at interfaces is crucial for applications involving light-matter interactions, such as surface spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and quantum information technology. While dielectric surface waves offer promising perspectives for strong light confinement at non-absorbing interfaces, their capacity has not yet been widely explored. This article focuses on the propagation properties of optical modes supported at the free surface of a 1D photonic crystal. The contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic loss mechanisms are investigated. Structures optimized to support long propagating optical surface waves are designed and fabricated. This work experimentally demonstrates, for the first time, the existence of optical surface waves capable of propagating over centimeter-scale distances in the visible spectral range. The results open new perspectives for the use of optical surface waves in integrated optics and enhanced light-matter interactions.

TI Experimental implementation of precisely tailored light-matter
   interaction via inverse engineering
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Accurate and efficient quantum control in the presence of constraints and decoherence is a requirement and a challenge in quantum information processing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity, originally proposed to speed up the slow adiabatic process, have nowadays become versatile toolboxes for preparing states or controlling the quantum dynamics. Unique shortcut designs are required for each quantum system with intrinsic physical constraints, imperfections, and noise. Here, we implement fast and robust control for the state preparation and state engineering in a rare-earth ions system. Specifically, the interacting pulses are inversely engineered and further optimized with respect to inhomogeneities of the ensemble and the unwanted interaction with other qubits. We demonstrate that our protocols surpass the conventional adiabatic schemes, by reducing the decoherence from the excited-state decay and inhomogeneous broadening. The results presented here are applicable to other noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems.

TI Quantum operations in an information theory for fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A reasonable quantum information theory for fermions must respect the parity superselection rule to comply with the special theory of relativity and the no-signaling principle. This rule restricts the possibility of any quantum state to have a superposition between even- and odd-parity fermionic states. thereby characterizing the set of physically allowed fermionic quantum states. Here we introduce the physically allowed quantum operations, in congruence with the parity superselection rule, that map the set of allowed fermionic states onto itself. We first introduce unitary and projective measurement operations of the fermionic states. We further extend the formalism to general quantum operations in the forms of Stinespring dilation, operator-sum representation, and axiomatic completely positive and trace-preserving maps. We explicitly show the equivalence between these three representations of fermionic quantum operations. We discuss the possible implications of our results in characterization of correlations in fermionic systems.

   of multipartite quantum states
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Identifying the k-partite entanglement and k-nonseparability of general N-partite quantum states is a fundamental issue in quantum information theory. By use of computable inequalities of nonlinear operators, we present some simple and powerful k-partite entanglement and k-nonseparability criteria that work very well and allow for a simple and inexpensive test for the whole hierarchy of k-partite entanglement and k-nonseparability of N-partite systems with k running from N down to 2. We illustrate their strengths by considering several examples in which our criteria perform better than other known detection criteria. We are able to detect k-partite entanglement and k-nonseparability of multipartite systems which have previously not been identified. In addition, our results can be implemented in today's experiments. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Controlling photoluminescence spectra of hBN color centers by selective
   phonon-assisted excitation: a theoretical proposal
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride show stable single photon emission even at room temperature, making these systems a promising candidate for quantum information applications. Besides this remarkable property, also their interaction with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons is quite unique because they lead to dominant phonon sidebands, well separated from the zero phonon line. In this work we utilize this clear spectral separation to theoretically investigate the influence of phonon decay dynamics on time-dependent photoluminescence (PL) signals. Our simulations show, that by using tailored optical excitation schemes it is possible to create a superposition between the two LO modes, leading to a phonon quantum beat that manifests in the time-dependent PL signal.

TI Electronic structures and Zeeman splitting in GaAs1-xBix nanowires under
   axial magnetic fields
SO ISCIENCE
AB Combining the effective-mass theory with valence-band anticrossing model, we investigate the electronic structures and Zeeman splitting characteristics of dilute bismuth GaAs nanowires under axial magnetic fields. Calculated results demonstrate that absorption spectra of GaAs1-xBix nanowires exhibit a linear relationship of Zeeman splitting energy with magnetic field regardless of the diameter and Bi composition, due to lifting of degeneracy in both electron and hole states. Importantly, we find that enhanced Zeeman splitting energies and effective g factors of GaAs1-xBix nanowires with larger diameters and lower Bi concentrations can be obtained, which principally arises from splitting energy of the hole states involved in first peaks of 6+ and 6-spectra. Further, normalized magnetic circular dichroism spectra corroborate the Zeeman splitting features observed in the absorption spectra. Our research manifests that GaAs1-xBix nanowires exhibit promising potential for quantum information processing applications because of their large and tunable effective g factors.

SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB The effect of electron-phonon interaction on the first excited state of a three-dimensional polar semiconductor quantum dot with Gaussian confinement is studied using the second-order Rayleigh-Schro<spacing diaeresis>dinger perturbation theory. An analytical expression for the first excited state polaronic correction is obtained under a plausible approximation. It is shown that this energy depends both on the strength and range of the Gaussian potential. Finally our theory is applied to a GaAs quantum dot and it is shown that the polaronic effect to the first excited level can be significantly large if the size of the dot is small. Since the information of the excited states is important for the study of decoherence phenomena, our results could be useful for quantum information processing.

TI A CFT dual for evaporating black holes: boundary continuous matrix
   product states
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Tensor network states, especially Matrix Product States (MPS), are crucial tools for studying how particles in large quantum systems are entangled with each other. MPS are particularly effective for modeling systems in one-dimensional space. Their continuous version, known as continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS), extends this approach to more complex quantum field theories that describe systems with an infinite number of interacting particles. This paper introduces a novel extension, boundary continuous Matrix Product States (BCMPS), which incorporate boundary states from conformal field theory (TFD state of two CFTs, let). We construct BCMPS and explore their potential holographic duals, linking them to black hole microstates with end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT. This connection hints at a deeper relationship between tensor networks and spacetime geometry, potentially offering new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravity.

TI Conditional quantum thermometry-enhancing precision by measuring less
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Taking accurate measurements of the temperature of quantum systems is a challenging task. The mathematical peculiarities of quantum information make it virtually impossible to measure with infinite precision. In the present paper, we introduce a generalize thermal state, which is conditioned on the pointer states of the available measurement apparatus. We show that this conditional thermal state outperforms the Gibbs state in quantum thermometry. The origin for the enhanced precision can be sought in its asymmetry quantified by the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. This additional resource is further clarified in a fully resource-theoretic analysis, and we show that there is a Gibbs-preserving map to convert a target state into the conditional thermal state. We relate the quantum J-divergence between the conditional thermal state and the same target state to quantum heat.

TI Nonlinear time-reversal interferometry with arbitrary quadratic
   collective-spin interaction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Atomic nonlinear interferometry has wide applications in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Here we propose a nonlinear time-reversal interferometry scheme with high robustness and metrological gain based on the spin squeezing generated by arbitrary quadratic collective-spin interaction, which could be described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. We optimize the squeezing process, encoding process, and anti-squeezing process, finding that the two particular cases of the LMG model, one-axis twisting and two-axis twisting outperform in robustness and precision, respectively. Moreover, we propose a Floquet driving method to realize equivalent time reverse in the atomic system, which leads to high performance in precision, robustness, and operability. Our study sets a benchmark for achieving high precision and high robustness in atomic nonlinear interferometry.

TI Spectroscopy of flux-driven Kerr parametric oscillators by reflection
   coefficient measurement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report the spectroscopic characterization of a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) based on the measurement of its reflection coefficient under a two-photon drive induced by flux modulation. The measured reflection spectra show good agreement with numerical simulations in terms of their dependence on the two-photon drive amplitude. The spectra can be interpreted as changes in system's eigenenergies, transition matrix elements, and the population of the eigenstates, although the linewidth of the resonance structure is not fully explained. We also show that the drive-amplitude dependence of the spectra can be explained analytically by using the concepts of Rabi splitting and the Stark shift. By comparing the experimentally obtained spectra with theory, we show that the two-photon drive amplitude at the device can be precisely determined, which is important for the application of KPOs in quantum information processing.

TI Single-photon generation from a neodymium ion in optical fiber at room
   temperature
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The realization of single-photon generation is important for implementing various quantum information technologies. The use of rare-earth ions in an optical fiber is a promising single-photon generation method due to its ability to operate at room temperature as well as the low cost involved. Neodymium ions are especially interesting because the ions are one of the most commercially affordable rare-earth materials in the current industry. The neodymium ion also has the advantage of having a rich energy level structure, which offers several possible wavelengths for emitted single photons from visible to near-telecommunication wavelengths. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrated single-photon generation using an isolated single neodymium ion in tapered silica fiber at room temperature. Our results have significant implications as a platform for low-cost wavelength-selectable single-photon sources and photonic quantum applications.

TI An Optical Parametric Amplifier via χ(2) in AlGaAs Waveguides
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We report parametric gain by utilizing chi((2)) non-linearities in a semiconductor Bragg Reflection Waveguide (BRW) waveguide chip. Under the two-mode degenerate type II phase matching, it can be shown that more than 18 dBs of parametric gain for both TE and TM modes is tenable in 100 s of micrometers of device length. Polarization insensitive parametric gain can be attained within the 1550 nm region of the spectrum. These AlGaAs BRW waveguides exhibit sub-photon per pulse sensitivity. This is in sharp contrast to other types of parametric gain devices which utilize chi((3)), where the pump wavelength is in the vicinity of the signal wavelength. This sensitivity, which reached 0.1 photon/pulse, can usher a new era for on-chip quantum information processing using compact, micrometer-scale devices.

TI Unidirectional amplification in optomechanical system coupling with a
   structured bath
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nonreciprocity plays an indispensable role in quantum information transmission. We theoretically study the unidirectional amplification in the non-Markovian regime, in which a nanosphere surrounded by a structured bath is trapped in a single (dual)-mode cavity. The global mechanical response function of the nanosphere is markedly altered by the non-Markovian structured bath through shifting the effective frequency and magnifying the response function. Consequently, when there is a small difference in the transmission rate within the regime of Markovian, the unidirectional amplification is achieved in the super-Ohmic spectral environment. In the double-optomechanical coupling system, the phase difference between two optomechanical couplings can reverse the transmission direction. Meanwhile, the non-Markovian bath still can amplify the signal because of the XX-type coupling between nanosphere and its bath.

TI Uhlmann phase in composite systems with entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the geometric Uhlmann phase of entangled mixed states in a composite system made of two coupled spin-1/2 particles with a magnetic field acting on one of them. Within a uniform noisy quantum channel setup, an exact analytical expression for this geometric phase in each subsystem is derived. We find an explicit connection to the concurrence of the density matrix of such a channel, which allows us to characterize the features of the Uhlmann phase in terms of the degree of entanglement in the system. In the space of field direction and coupling parameter, it exhibits a phase singularity revealing a topological transition between orders characterized by different winding numbers. The transition occurs for fields lying in the equator of the sphere of directions and at critical values of the coupling which can be controlled by tuning the depolarization strength. Notably, under these conditions the concurrence of the composite system is bounded to the range [0, 1/2]. We also compare the calculated Uhlmann phase to an interferometric phase, which has been formulated as an alternative for density matrices. The latter does not present a phase vortex, although they coincide in the weak entanglement regime for vanishing depolarization (pure states). Otherwise, they behave clearly different in the strong-entanglement regime.

In fact, the collective optical behavior of the atomic ensemble by analyzing the quantum information extracted from one of its elements. Moreover, we introduce Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS), an easily computable theoretical tool, to monitor the variations of linear as well as nonlinear refractive indices and evaluate the strength of the nonlinear response of optical materials. Furthermore, we illustrate that quantum Fisher information and HSS can efficiently detect negative permittivity and refractive index, which is of great importance from a practical point of view.

TI Adiabatically controlled motional states of a CaO plus and Ca plus
   trapped-ion chain cooled to the ground state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Control of the external degree of freedom of trapped molecular ions is essential for their promising applica-tions to spectroscopy, precision measurements of fundamental constants, and quantum information technology. Here, we demonstrate near ground-state cooling of the axial motional modes of a calcium mono-oxide ion via sympathetic sideband cooling with a cotrapped calcium ion. We also show that the phonon state of the axial out-of-phase mode of the ion chain is maintained while the mode frequency is adiabatically ramped up and/or down. The adiabatic ramping of the motional mode frequency is a prerequisite for searching for the proposed molecular dipole-phonon interaction [W. C. Campbell and E. R. Hudson, Phys. Rev.

In this study, we theoretically analyze a hybrid system which consists of Fabry Perot cavity containing two-level N- Number of atoms. The cavity having two mirrors one is fixed, and other is oscillating. The oscillating mirror has a position dependent mass, considered as effective mass. The mechanical resonator generates a nonlinear effect because it is position dependent. Dynamics of the system's operators, steady-state solutions, and optical response of the hybrid optomechanical system are analytically calculated. Optical response in the regime of position dependent effective mass (PDEM) are the main result in this article. We deduced that position dependent parameter of the resonator not only effect the dynamics but also the optical response of the optomechanical system.

TI A geometrical framework for quantum incompatibility resources
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Quantum incompatibility is a fundamental property in quantum physics and is considered as a resource in quantum information processing tasks. Here, we construct a framework based on the incompatibility witness originated from quantum state discrimination. In this framework, we discuss the geometrical properties of the witnesses with noisy mutually unbiased bases and construct a quantifier of quantum incompatibility associated with geometrical information. Furthermore, we explore the incompatibility of a pair of positive operator valued measurements, which only depends on the information of measurements, and discuss the incompatibility of measurements which can be discriminated by mutually unbiased bases. Finally, if we take a resource-theory perspective, the new-defined quantifier can characterize the resource of incompatibility. This geometrical framework gives the evidence that vectors can be utilized to describe resourceful incompatibility and make a step to explore geometrical features of quantum resources.

TI Multi-order phononic frequency comb generation within a MoS2
   electromechanical resonator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this work, we measure and tune simultaneously the vibration of a 1-nm thick MoS2 suspended monolayer with standard electrical excitation and optical techniques. At ambient temperature, we first investigate the strong parametric coupling between two different mechanical modes (omega(1) and omega(2)). We demonstrate a high and quasi-linear tunability of the mode frequencies with the parametric pump voltage. Then, we couple the highly tunable main vibration (omega(1)) to a parametric pump frequency (omega(p)) to obtain a high number of sidebands at frequencies omega(1) +/- m omega(p), driving the mechanical mode with a large external electrical force. This oscillating force, applied via the gate voltage, acts as a stress onto the MoS2 sheet. The obtained frequency comb has a large spectral band and contains up to 100 harmonics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and heat or sound transport.

By varying the parity deformation parameter and incorporating the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, we examine the time evolution of key quantum phenomena. These include atomic population inversion, von Neumann entropy, concurrence, quantum Fisher information, and the Mandel parameter, where each serves as a critical indicator. Our analysis reveals how the interplay between the deformation parameter and coupling effects governs the quantum dynamics, influencing entanglement, parameter estimation, and statistical properties of the field. These insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how to control and optimize quantum phenomena, highlighting the model's relevance for quantum information processing technologies.

AB Optomechanical microresonators have received considerable attention in recent years because of their ability to realize strong light-matter interactions in both classical and quantum regimes and support various applications, e.g., sensing and constructing optical devices. Light-matter interactions in optomechanical microresonators enable a variety of nonlinear phenomena, which can significantly enhance the precision of sensing, the efficiency of communication, and the capabilities of quantum information processing, such as quantum state reconstruction. In this perspective, we first summarize optomechanical nonlinear phenomena in classical regimes (e.g., bistability, chaos, solitons) and quantum regimes (e.g., phonon lasing, optomechanically induced transparency). In addition, the application progress of nonlinear optomechanical effects in classical and quantum systems is reviewed, including high-sensitivity measurement, quantum state reconstruction, photon blockade, and microwave-optical conversion, etc. Finally, we provide new insights into future developments.

TI Chiral Bell-State Transfer via Dissipative Liouvillian Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Chiral state transfer along closed loops in the vicinity of an exceptional point is one of the many counterintuitive observations in non-Hermitian physics. The application of this property beyond proof-of- principle in quantum physics, is an open question. In this work, we demonstrate chiral state conversion between singlet and triplet Bell states through fully quantum Liouvillian dynamics. Crucially, we demonstrate that this property can be used for the chiral production of Bell states from separable states with a high fidelity and for a large range of parameters. Additionally, we show that the removal of quantum jumps from the dynamics through postselection can result in near-perfect Bell states from initially separable states. Our work presents the first application of chiral state transfer in quantum information processing and demonstrates a novel way to control entangled states by means of dissipation engineering.

TI Modulation of Second-Order Sideband Efficiency in an Atom-Assisted
   Optomechanical System
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose an efficient scheme to enhance the generation of optical second-order sidebands (OSSs) in an atom-assisted optomechanical system. The cavity field is coupled with a strong driving field and a weak probe field, and a control field is applied to the atom. We use the steady-state method to analyze the nonlinear interaction in the system, which is different from the traditional linear analysis method. The existence of an auxiliary three-level atom driven by the control field significantly enhances the generation of an OSS. It is found that the efficiency of the OSS can be effectively modulated by adjusting the Rabi frequency of the control field, optomechanical cooperativity and atomic coupling strength. Our scheme provides a promising solution for controlling light propagation and has potential application in quantum optical devices and quantum information networks.

AB Calculating the von Neumann entanglement entropy from experimental data is challenging due to its dependence on the complete wavefunction, forcing reliance on approximations such as classical mutual information (MI). We propose a machine learning approach using a graph neural network to predict the von Neumann entropy directly from experimentally accessible bitstrings. We test this approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieve a mean absolute error of 3.6x10-3 when evaluating within the training range on a dataset with entropy values ranging from 0 to 1.9. The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.44% and outperforms MI-based bounds. When tested beyond the training range, the model maintains reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the model with small datasets significantly improves performance on data outside the original training range.

   interpretation
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We suggest a quantum circuit model which simulates the black-hole evaporation process. In particular, Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS) paradox and the ER=EPR correspondence are reconsidered regarding our proposed model, which assumes a Maxwell's demon operating within a black hole interior. In other words, we form a quantum circuit, mimicking the behavior of the entanglement structure of the near-horizon region and the early Hawking radiation located far from the black hole. Furthermore, we indicate how the demon, by applying nonlocal correlations, can mediate via Einstein-Rosen bridges for the purpose of simulating the transfer of quantum information across the horizon without violating the monogamy of entanglement. Finally, the thermodynamic cost of the demon's operations regarding Landauer's principle is analyzed. This indicates that the information erasure has an energy comparable to the black hole entropy.

TI Flexible generation of structured terahertz fields via programmable
   exchange-biased spintronic emitters
SO ELIGHT
AB Structured light, particularly in the terahertz frequency range, holds considerable potential for a diverse range of applications. However, the generation and control of structured terahertz radiation pose major challenges. In this work, we demonstrate a novel programmable spintronic emitter that can flexibly generate a variety of structured terahertz waves. This is achieved through the precise and high-resolution programming of the magnetization pattern on the emitter's surface, utilizing laser-assisted local field cooling of an exchange-biased ferromagnetic heterostructure. Moreover, we outline a generic design strategy for realizing specific complex structured terahertz fields in the far field. Our device successfully demonstrates the generation of terahertz waves with diverse structured polarization states, including spatially separated circular polarizations, azimuthal or radial polarization states, and a full Poincar & eacute; beam. This innovation opens a new avenue for designing and generating structured terahertz radiations, with potential applications in terahertz microscopy, communication, quantum information, and light-matter interactions.

TI Highly efficient second-harmonic generation in a double-layer thin-film
   lithium niobate waveguide
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (LN) has emerged as an ideal platform for efficient nonlinear wave-mixing processes due to its strong quadratic nonlinearity and high optical confinement. We demonstrate unprecedentedly efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a double-layer thin-film LN waveguide. The modal overlap between fundamental and second-harmonic waves is significantly enhanced by the polarization-reversed double layers, leading to a normalized conversion efficiency higher than 10,000% W-1 cm(-2) in theory. Under the low- and high-power pumping conditions, the measured normalized and absolute conversion efficiencies are 9600% W-1 cm(-2) and 85%, respectively, substantially higher than state-of-the-art values among the reported SHGs in thin-film LN waveguides. Our results hold great promise for the development of efficient and scalable nonlinear photonic devices, with applications including metrology and quantum information processing.

TI The phonon-modulated Jahn-Teller distortion of the nitrogen vacancy
   center in diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an optically accessible material defect with a unique combination of spin and optical properties that has attracted interest in quantum-information sciences and as a design candidate for nanoscale quantum sensors. Here, we present time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy measurements, conducted with ultrabroadband laser pulses, that reveal strong modulation of the excited-state by the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon of the diamond lattice. The LO phonon and its overtones geometrically distort neighboring NV centers, driving long lived (3.5 ps) excited state relaxation of coupled NV centers after the initial excitation and ultrafast (<150 fs) decay of the Jahn-Teller distortion. These observations elevate the LO phonon to an important tuning mode of the Jahn-Teller conical intersection and help resolve previous spectroscopy experiments that noted longer-lived excited-state dynamics.

TI Modulations of the work function and morphology of a single
   MoS2 nanotube by charge injection
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Both the miniaturization of transistor components and the ongoing investigation of material systems with potential for quantum information processing have significantly increased current interest of researchers in semiconducting inorganic nanotubes. Here we report on an additional outstanding aspect of these nanostructures, namely the intrinsic coupling of electronic and mechanical properties. We observe electronic and morphology changes in a single MoS2 nanotube, exposed to charge injections by means of an atomic-force-microscopy tip. An elliptic deformation of the nanotube and helical twisting of the nanotube are visible, consistent with the reverse piezoelectric effect. Work-function changes are found to be dependent on the polarity of the injected carriers. An unexpected long-term persistence of the shape deformations is observed and explained with accumulation of structural defects and the resultant strain, which could cause a memory-like charge confinement and a long lasting modulation of the work function.

TI Topological phase transitions captured in the set of reduced density
   matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological phase transitions fall outside of the symmetry-breaking paradigm and therefore elude many traditional analytical methods. In particular, significant geometric features found in the set of reduced density matrices (RDMs) disappear in symmetry-preserving topological systems. By returning to the fundamental properties of phase transitions, such as the divergence of correlation length and energy surface discontinuities, we demonstrate that the set of RDMs captures the critical behavior of systems with topological order. We find signatures of the gapless transition in the discontinuous movement of the ground-state RDMs. Additionally, the correlation length divergence near critical points appears in the off-diagonal character of RDMs, which is quantified through spectral and linear fitting analyses. This framework generalizes the quantum information approach to RDM critical theory, allowing for classification and visualization of all of the phases of the system-both topological and trivial-in the convex set of RDMs.

TI Attaining the maximum Bose-Einstein condensation in a finite-size
   hard-core boson model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We propose a model for hard-core bosons in a lattice which allows to achieve the optimal occupation number predicted by Tennie et al (2017 Phys. Rev. B 96 064502) for a finite number of sites. The model is based on an extension of the Hamiltonian of the so-called Hubbard star, whose quantum properties are studied by means of quantum information descriptors such as the von Neumann entropy and the mutual information. These metrics are analyzed as a function of the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices, allowing to explore the relationship between condensation and entanglement by means of a control parameter that, under a given limit, connects our findings with previous results. All developments comprised in this article have been derived by analytical methods.

TI Krylov complexity and spectral form factor for noisy random matrix
   models
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the spectral properties of two classes of random matrix models: non-Gaussian RMT with quartic and sextic potentials, and RMT with Gaussian noise. We compute and analyze the quantum Krylov complexity and the spectral form factor for both of these models. We find that both models show suppression of the spectral form factor at short times due to decoherence effects, but they differ in their long-time behavior. In particular, we show that the Krylov complexity for the non-Gaussian RMT and RMT with noise deviates from that of a Gaussian RMT. We discuss the implications and limitations of our results for quantum chaos and quantum information in open quantum systems. Our study reveals the distinct sensitivities of the spectral form factor and complexity to non-Gaussianity and noise, which contribute to the observed differences in the different time domains.

TI Resonance fluorescence of noisy systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Light scattering from resonantly or nearly resonantly excited systems, known as resonance fluorescence (RF), has been gaining importance as a versatile tool for investigating quantum states of matter and readout of quantum information, recently including also the inherently noisy solid state systems. In this work we develop a general theory of RF in the low excitation limit on systems in which the transition energy is subject to noise for two important classes of noise processes: white noise fluctuations that lead to phase diffusion and an arbitrary stationary Markovian noise process on a finite set of states. We apply the latter to the case of random telegraph noise (TN) and a sum of an arbitrary number of identical random TN contributions. We show that different classes of noise influence the RF spectrum in a characteristic way. Hence, the spectrum carries information on the characteristics of noise present in the physical system.

SO MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures have recently attracted interest as candidate materials for classical optoelectronics and in quantum information technology. Despite significant research, realizing deterministic, in-plane quantum confinement in synthetic 2D heterostructures at the nanoscale remains challenging. In this brief overview, we summarize recent advances in approaches for the growth of spatially controllable 2D quantum heterostructures. These growth methods enable the achievement of various 2D lateral/vertical heterostructures with controlled positions and dimensions while minimizing defects across the heterointerfaces. In addition, we provide an outlook on the future direction of developments and applications of 2D quantum-confined heterostructures.

TI Detection of gravitational waves using parametric resonance in
   Bose-Einstein condensates
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB An interesting proposal for detecting gravitational waves involves quantum metrology of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We consider a forced modulation of the speed of sound of a BEC, whose modulation frequency matches that of an incoming continuous gravitational wave. The speed of sound modulation induces parametric resonance in the BEC, which in turn enhances sensitivity of the BEC to gravitational waves. We find that such a BEC detector could potentially be used to detect gravitational waves across several orders of magnitude in frequency, with the sensitivity depending on the speed of sound, size of the condensate, and frequency of the phonons. We discuss the sensitivity of a possible BEC experiment and comment on the current technological limitations. We also comment on the noise sources as well as what is necessary for such a detector to become feasible.

TI Two-cavity-mediated photon-pair emission by one atom
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Photon-pair sources are widely used in quantum optics and quantum information experiments. Despite their broad deployment, there has not yet been an on-demand implementation with efficient into-fiber photon generation and high single-photon purity. Here we report on such a source based on a single atom with three energy levels in ladder configuration and coupled to two optical fiber cavities. We efficiently generate photon pairs with an in-fiber emission efficiency of eta pair = 16(1)% and study their temporal correlation properties. We simulate theoretically a regime with strong atom-cavity coupling and find that photons are directly emitted from the ground state, i.e., without atomic population in any intermediate state. We propose a scenario to observe such a double-vacuum-stimulated effect experimentally. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Formation and Controlling of Optical Hopfions in High Harmonic
   Generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Toroidal vortex is a kind of novel and exotic structured light with potential applications in photonic topology and quantum information. Here, we present the study on high harmonic generation from the interaction of the intense toroidal vortices with atoms. We show that the spatial distribution of harmonic spectra reveal unique structures, which are kinds of high-order topological toroidal vortex because of the rotating of the driving fields with transverse orbital angular momentum. Then we show that, by synthesizing the toroidal vortices and optical vortices with longitudinal orbital angular momentum, it is able to generate the optical hopfions in the extreme ultraviolet range, which exhibit a completely different topological property compared with both the driving fields. Harnessing the spin angular momentum selection rules, we further show that one can control the topological texture and channel each harmonic into a single mode of controllable Hopf invariant.

TI Electrically Controlled Photonic Circuits of Field-Induced Dipolaritons
   with Huge Nonlinearities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Electrically controlled photonic circuits hold promise for information technologies with greatly improved energy efficiency and quantum information processing capabilities. However, weak nonlinearity and electrical response of typical photonic materials have been two critical challenges. Therefore, hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically gated waveguide architecture for field induced dipolar polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and antiblockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are explained using a simple density-dependent dipolar polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.

TI Latched detection of zeptojoule spin echoes with a kinetic inductance
   parametric oscillator
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB When strongly pumped at twice their resonant frequency, nonlinear resonators develop a high-amplitude intracavity field, a phenomenon known as parametric self-oscillations. The boundary over which this instability occurs can be extremely sharp and thereby presents an opportunity for realizing a detector. Here, we operate such a device based on a superconducting microwave resonator whose nonlinearity is engineered from kinetic inductance. The device indicates the absorption of low-power microwave wavepackets by transitioning to a self-oscillating state. Using calibrated pulses, we measure the detection efficiency to zeptojoule energy wavepackets. We then apply it to measurements of electron spin resonance, using an ensemble of 209Bi donors in silicon that are inductively coupled to the resonator. We achieve a latched readout of the spin signal with an amplitude that is five hundred times greater than the underlying spin echoes.

In this work, we observed giant broadband asymmetric transmission of circularly polarized waves and spin-preserving reflection, together with near-unity transmission circular dichroism, in a planar chiral metasurface composed of high-index transition-metal-dichalcogenide nanoantennas with large material anisotropy. The perpendicular and parallel electric and magnetic dipole moments excited in the nanoantennas under circularly polarized waves are explored to account for the asymmetric transmission and optical chirality. Combined with the Pancharatnam-Berry phase, we achieved the wavefront manipulation for transmitted circularly polarized waves with an efficiency approaching 91.5% and spin-selective focusing of an incident light via a metasurface metalens. Our work will pave the way for studying the multidimensional manipulation of optical spins through engineering transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based metasurfaces.

TI Some Integrals Involving Meijer's and Hypergeometric Functions Using the
   Coherent State Technique
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, we have examined a particular case of coherent states, defined so that their structure constants depend only on the products of the energy eigenvalues of the examined systems. In this manner, we have built all three kinds of coherent states (Barut-Girardello, Klauder-Perelomov, and Gazeau-Klauder). From the equation of the unitary operator decomposition, we have highlighted and used a so-called fundamental integral, to obtain some new integrals involving Meijer's and hypergeometric functions. All calculations are made using the properties of the diagonal operator ordering technique. This is implicitly proved that the coherent state technique can be useful not only in different branches of physics (quantum mechanics, quantum optics, quantum information theory, and so on) but also in the deduction of new integrals involving generalized Meijer's and hypergeometric functions. This approach can be considered as suitable "feedback" from physics to mathematics.

TI Novel constructions of mutually unbiased tripartite absolutely maximally
   entangled bases
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We develop a new technique to construct mutually unbiased tripartite absolutely maximally entangled bases. We first explore the tripartite absolutely maximally entangled bases and mutually unbiased bases in C-d circle times C-d circle times C-d based on mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Then we generalize the approach to the case of C-d1 circle times C-d2 circle times C(d1d2 )by mutually weak orthogonal Latin squares. The concise direct constructions of mutually unbiased tripartite absolutely maximally entangled bases are remarkably presented with generality. Detailed examples in C-3 circle times C-3 circle times C-3, C-2 circle times C-2 circle times C-4 and C-2 circle times C-5 circle times C-10 are provided to illustrate the advantages of our approach.

TI Operator and entanglement growth in nonthermalizing systems: Many-body
   localization and the random singlet phase
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We characterize the growth and spreading of operators and entanglement in two paradigmatic nonthermalizing phases-the many-body localized (MBL) phase and the random singlet phase (RSP)-using the entanglement contour and multipartite operator entanglement measures. The entanglement contour characterizes the spacetime spreading of entanglement and reveals logarithmically growing entanglement light cones in the MBL and RSP phases, sharply contrasting the linear light cones of clean, thermalizing systems. The operator entanglement characterizes scrambling, i.e., the delocalization of information. We find slow scrambling behavior in the MBL phase; the late-time value of the tripartite mutual information scales linearly with system size, but is submaximal. The tripartite logarithmic negativity is also negative and nonzero, but smaller in magnitude, revealing an intriguing distinction between classical and quantum information scrambling in the MBL phase. This is in contrast with the RSP, which, as a noninteracting model, is nonscrambling.

TI Goos-Hänchen shift and photonic spin Hall effect in semi-Dirac material
   heterostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) and the Goos-H & auml;nchen shift (GH shift) in semi-Dirac materials. Through theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the anisotropic dielectric function in semi-Dirac materials plays a critical role in determining the magnitude and polarity of these optical displacements. Furthermore, by utilizing the unidirectional drift of massless Dirac electrons in semi-Dirac materials, we systematically reveal how the drift velocity and direction modulate the behavior of optical displacements. The results indicate that the unique electronic properties of semi-Dirac materials-particularly their anisotropic dielectric response and carrier drift dynamics-establish mechanisms for controlling optical displacements and polarization-dependent phenomena. This work opens a new avenue for designing advanced photonic devices with tunable optical responses, particularly with significant application potential in quantum information processing and topological photonics.

TI Improving metrology with quantum scrambling in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
   condensate coupled to a cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spinor Bose-Einstein condensate is an ideal candidate for implementing the many- body entanglement, quantum measurement and quantum information processing owing to its inherent spin-mixing dynamics. Here we present a system of an 87 Rb atomic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical ring cavity, in which cavity-mediated nonlinear interactions give rise to saddle points in the semiclassical phase space, providing a general mechanism for exponential fast scrambling and metrological gain augment. We theoretically study metrological gain and fidelity out-of-time-ordered cor relator based on time-reversal protocols and demonstrate that exponential rapid scrambling dynamics can enhance quantum metrology. In addition, we use the out-of-time-ordered cor relator to probe dynamical phase transitions. This work is useful to understand the intrinsic relation between the concepts from different subfields of quantum science.

TI Optical spin-orbit interaction in spontaneous parametric downconversion
SO OPTICA
AB Optical spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which can be used to simultaneously control the spin and orbital angular momen-tum of light, is important for both classical and quantum information applications. In linear and nonlinear optics, the SOI of light has been extensively explored in both artificial structures and conventional optical crystals. However, optical SOI in quantum nonlinear optical processes, such as spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), has not been studied before. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that optical SOI in the SPDC process can be realized through a nonlinear crystal with threefold rotational symmetry. Two-photon quantum states with controlled angular momen-tum can be generated through the symmetry selection rules in nonlinear optics and the SOI of the pump wave. The proposed methodology may facilitate the generation and control of spin and orbital angular momentum of entangled photons.

TI Sympathetic electromagnetically induced transparency ground state
   cooling of a 40Ca+-27Al+
   pair in an 27Al+ clock
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We report on electromagnetically induced transparency cooling of Ca-40(+) to sympathetically cool the three-dimensional secular modes of motion in a Ca-40(+)-Al-27(+) two-ion pair near the ground state. We observe simultaneous ground state cooling across all radial modes and axial modes of a Ca-40(+)-Al-27(+) ion pair, occupying a broader cooling range in frequency space over 3 MHz. The cooling time is observed to be less than 1 ms. The mean phonon number and heating rates of all motional modes are measured. This study is not only an important step for reducing the secular motion time-dilation shift uncertainty and uptime ratio of Al-27(+) optical clock, but also essential for high-fidelity quantum simulations and quantum information processors using trapped ions.

TI Origin of metallic-like behavior in disordered carbon nano-onions
SO CARBON
AB Carbon nano-onions are a class of nanomaterials that can exhibit long electron spin relaxation times at room temperature and thus hold promise as potential building blocks for spintronics and quantum information processing devices. Despite first being synthesized 30 years ago, there exists a gap in understanding electronic and magnetic properties of these nanostructures. Here we investigate the origin of the metallic-like behavior that has been observed experimentally in disordered nano-onions. Employing a density functional tight-binding approach and starting from ordered multi-shell fullerenes, we develop realistic models of highly disordered nano-onions comprised of nanometer-scale graphitic flakes. We find that multiple parameters such as flake size, edge structure and substituent groups can give rise to in-gap metallic states, effectively closing the HOMO-LUMO gap.

TI Considerations on the Relativity of Quantum Irrealism
SO ENTROPY
AB The study of quantum resources in the relativistic limit has attracted attention over the last couple of decades, mostly due to the observation that the spin-momentum entanglement is not Lorentz covariant. In this work, we take the investigations of relativistic quantum information a step further, bringing the foundational question of realism to the discussion. In particular, we examine whether Lorentz boosts can affect quantum irrealism-an instance related to the violations imposed by quantum mechanics onto a certain notion of realism. To this end, we adopt as a theoretical platform a model of a relativistic particle traveling through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We then compare the quantum irrealism assessed from two different inertial frames in relative motion. In consonance with recent findings in the context of quantum reference frames, our results suggest that the notion of physical realism is not absolute.

TI Multicopy observables for the detection of optically nonclassical states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Distinguishing quantum states that admit a classical counterpart from those that exhibit nonclassicality has long been a central issue in quantum optics. Finding an implementable criterion certifying optical nonclassicality (i.e., the incompatibility with a statistical mixture of coherent states) is of major importance as it often is a prerequisite to quantum information processes. A hierarchy of conditions for detecting whether a quantum state exhibits optical nonclassicality can be written based on matrices of moments of the optical field [E. V. Shchukin and W. Vogel, Phys. Rev. A 72, 043808 (2005)]. Here, we design optical nonclassicality observables that act on several replicas of a quantum state and whose expectation value coincides with the determinant of these matrices, hence providing witnesses of optical nonclassicality that overcome the need for state tomography. These multicopy observables are used to construct a family of physically implementable schemes involving linear optical operations and photon number detectors.

TI The quantum de Sitter root of quasi de Sitter observables
SO PHYSICS OF THE DARK UNIVERSE
AB In inflationary cosmology the quasi de Sitter graceful exit allows us to measure the quantum features of the primordial dS phase, in particular, the lack of scale invariance parametrized by the spectral index ns. In this article we summarize previous work on how the underlying primordial scaling law is implemented in the dS quantum Fisher information of the dS planar ground state (dSQFI). At large scales the dSQFI unequivocally sets, without any qdS input, the value of ns to be 0.9672. This value is independent of the tensor to scalar ratio whose value requires model dependent input. In addition the dSQFI predicts, at large scales, a small running compatible with the current experimental results. Other phenomenological consequences of the dSQFI for small scales, will be discussed in a future publication.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terahertz (THz) vector beams with spatially textured polarization are proposed to steer the spin and spatial distributions of two interacting electrons in a quantum dot. We study theoretically the spatiotemporal evolution of the spin and the charge-current densities and quantify the behavior of entanglement by calculating the concurrence. Both aspects are shown to be controllable efficiently and on the picosecond (ps) time scale by the parameters of the driving fields. Analyzing two different materials, GaAs and InGaAs, with different electron g-factors, we study the relationship between the g-factor and type of spin-orbit coupling required to produce efficient interlevel transitions. The results are useful for applications of quantum dots as basic nanoscale hardware elements in quantum information technology and for producing swiftly the appropriate spin and charge currents on demand.

TI Ultra-fast Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry via temporal filtering
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Heralded single photons (HSPs) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are useful resource to achieve various photonic quantum information processing. Given a large-scale experiment which needs multiple HSPs, increasing the generation rate with suppressing higher-order pair creation is desirable. One of the promising ways is to use a pump laser with a GHz-order repetition rate. In such a high repetition rate regime, however, single-photon detectors can only partially identify the pulses. Hence, we develop a simple model to consider that effect on the spectral purity, and experimentally demonstrate a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two independent HSPs generated by SPDC with 3.2 GHz-repetition-rate mode-locked pump pulses. The observed visibility of 0.88(3) is in good agreement with our theoretical model. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Persistent current noise in narrow Josephson junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Josephson junctions have broad applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and remote sensing. For these applications, the electronic noise is a limiting factor. In this work we study the thermal noise in narrow Josephson junctions using a tight-binding Hamiltonian. For a junction longer than the superconducting coherence length, several self-consistent gap profiles appear close to a phase difference pi. They correspond to two stable solutions with an approximately constant phase gradient over the thin superconductor connected by a 2 pi phase slip, and a solitonic branch. The current noise power spectrum has pronounced peaks at the transition frequencies between the different states in each branch. We find that the noise is reduced in the gradient branches in comparison to the zero-length junction limit. In contrast, the solitonic branch exhibits an enhanced noise and a reduced current due to the pinning of the lowest excitation energy to close to zero energy.

TI Minimizing the Discrimination Time for Quantum States of an Artificial
   Atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fast discrimination between quantum states of superconducting artificial atoms is an important ingredient for quantum information processing. In circuit quantum electrodynamics, increasing the signal-field amplitude in the readout resonator, dispersively coupled to the artificial atom, improves the signal-to-noise ratio and increases the measurement strength. Here, we employ this effect over 2 orders of magnitude in readout power, made possible by the unique combination of a dimer-Josephson-junction-array amplifier with a large dynamic range and the fact that the readout of our granular aluminum fluxonium artificial atom remains quantum nondemolition (QND) at relatively large photon numbers in the readout resonator, up to n = 110. Using Bayesian inference, this allows us to detect quantum jumps faster than the readout-resonator response time 2/kappa, where kappa is the bandwidth of the readout resonator.

TI Angular spectrum influence and entanglement characterization of
   Gaussian-path encoded photonic qudits
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Entangled quantum states play an important role in quantum information science and also in quantum mechanics fundamental investigations. Implementation and characterization of techniques allowing for easy preparation of entangled states are important steps in such fields. Here we generated entangled quantum states encoded in photons' transverse paths, obtained by pumping a nonlinear crystal with multiple transversal Gaussian beams. This approach allows us to generate entangled states of two qubits and two qutrits encoded in a Gaussian transversal path of twin photons. We make a theoretical analysis of this source, considering the influence of the pump angular spectrum on the generated states, further characterizing those by their purity and entanglement degree. Our experimental results reveal that the generated states present both high purity and entanglement, and the theoretical analysis elucidates how the pump beams profile can be used to manipulate such photonic states.

TI Phonon-limited valley lifetimes in single-particle bilayer graphene
   quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times T1 exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of T1 on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which T1 is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.

TI Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Spectra of 6Li
   Rydberg Atoms
SO PHOTONICS
AB Rydberg atoms possess highly excited valence electrons that are far away from atomic cations. Compared with ground states, Rydberg states are excited states with a high principal quantum number n that exhibit large electric dipole moments and have a variety of applications in quantum information processing. In this communication, we report the measurement of the 6Li Rydberg excitation spectrum by ladder-type electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a vapor cell. The 2p -> ns/nd EIT spectra were recorded by sweeping the frequency of an ultraviolet Rydberg pumping laser while keeping the probing laser resonant to the 2s -> 2p transition. All lasers were locked on an ultrastable optical Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity and measured by an optical frequency comb. Our results provide valuable information to precisely determine quantum defects and enable novel experiments with Rydberg-dressed ultracold Fermi gases.

TI Hole-Spin Driving by Strain-Induced Spin-Orbit Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Hole spins in semiconductor quantum dots can be efficiently manipulated with radio-frequency electric fields owing to the strong spin-orbit interactions in the valence bands. Here we show that the motion of the dot in inhomogeneous strain fields gives rise to linear Rashba spin-orbit interactions (with spatially dependent spin-orbit lengths) and g-factor modulations that allow for fast Rabi oscillations. Such inhomogeneous strains build up spontaneously in the devices due to process and cool down stress. We discuss spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures as an illustration. We highlight that Rabi frequencies can be enhanced by 1 order of magnitude by shear strain gradients as small as 3 x 10(-6) nm(-1) within the dots. This underlines that spins in solids can be very sensitive to strains and opens the way for strain engineering in hole spin devices for quantum information and spintronics.

TI Higher-order topological and nodal superconducting transition-metal
   sulfides MS (M = Nb and Ta)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Intrinsic topological superconducting materials are exotic and vital to develop the next-generation topological superconducting devices, topological quantum calculations, and quantum information technologies. Here, we predict the topological and nodal superconductivity of NiAs-type MS (M = Nb and Ta) transition-metal sulfides. We reveal their higher-order topology nature with an index of Z(4) = 2. These materials have a higher T-c than the Nb or Ta metal superconductors due to their flat band and strong electron-phonon coupling nature. Electron doping and lighter isotopes can effectively enhance the T-c. Our findings show that the MS (M = Nb and Ta) systems can be platforms to study exotic physics in the higher-order topological superconductors, and provide a theoretical support to utilize them as the topological superconducting devices in the field of advanced topological quantum calculations and information technologies.

TI Coherence-preserving cooling of nuclear-spin qubits in a weak magnetic
   field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nuclear-spin memories of divalent neutral atoms can allow spin-preserving resolved-sideband cooling in a strong magnetic field [I. Reichenbach and I. H. Deutsch, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 123001 (2007)]. We present a theory for cooling 87Sr nuclear-spin qubits in a weak magnetic field. The theory depends on laser excitation of 5s5p 3P1 to a nearby state which results in mJ-dependent AC Stark shifts large compared to the hyperfine interaction. This effectively suppresses the nuclear-spin mixing due to the hyperfine interaction. Sideband cooling via the clock state quenched by the AC Stark-shifted 3P1 state leads to nuclear-spin-preserving spontaneous emission back to the ground state. More than being compatible with low magnetic fields, the theory is applicable when the nuclear-spin qubits are defined by the two lowest Zeeman substates.

TI Maximal Gap Between Local and Global Distinguishability of Bipartite
   Quantum States
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We prove a tight and close-to-optimal lower bound on the effectiveness of local quantum measurements (without classical communication) at discriminating any two bipartite quantum states. Our result implies, for example, that any two orthogonal quantum states of a n(A) x n(B) bipartite quantum system can be discriminated via local measurements with an error probability no larger than 1/2 (1 - 1/c min{nA,nB}), where 1 <= c <= 2 root 2 is a universal constant, and our bound scales provably optimally with the local dimensions n(A), n(B). Mathematically, this is achieved by showing that the distinguishability norm parallel to . parallel to LO associated with local measurements satisfies that parallel to . parallel to <= 2 root 2 min{n(A), n(B)} parallel to.parallel to LO, where parallel to . parallel to LO, where parallel to.parallel to(1) is the trace norm.

TI Pathway toward Optical Cycling and Laser Cooling of Functionalized
   Arenes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Rapid and repeated photon cycling has enabled precision metrology and the development of quantum information systems using atoms and simple molecules. Extending optical cycling to structurally complex molecules would provide new capabilities in these areas, as well as in ultracold chemistry. Increased molecular complexity, however, makes realizing closed optical transitions more difficult. Building on already established strong optical cycling of diatomic, linear triatomic, and symmetric top molecules, recent work has pointed the way to cycling of larger molecules, including phenoxides. The paradigm for these systems is an optical cycling center bonded to a molecular ligand. Theory has suggested that cycling may be extended to even larger ligands, like naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene. Herein, we study optical excitation and fluorescent vibrational branching of CaO-, SrO-, and CaO-and find only weak decay to excited vibrational states, indicating a promising path to full quantum control and laser cooling of large arene-based molecules.

TI Trapped Electrons and Ions as Particle Detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electrons and ions trapped with electromagnetic fields have long served as important high-precision metrological instruments, and more recently have also been proposed as a platform for quantum information processing. Here we point out that these systems can also be used as highly sensitive detectors of passing charged particles, due to the combination of their extreme charge-to-mass ratio and low-noise quantum readout and control. In particular, these systems can be used to detect energy depositions many orders of magnitude below typical ionization scales. As illustrations, we suggest some applications in particle physics. We outline a nondestructive time-of-flight measurement capable of sub-eV energy resolution for slowly moving, collimated particles. We also show that current devices can be used to provide competitive sensitivity to models where ambient dark matter particles carry small electric millicharges << e. Our calculations may also be useful in the characterization of noise in quantum computers coming from backgrounds of charged particles.

TI Quantum Phases in a Quantum Rabi Triangle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The interplay of interactions, symmetries, and gauge fields usually leads to intriguing quantum many-body phases. To explore the nature of emerging phases, we study a quantum Rabi triangle system as an elementary building block for synthesizing an artificial magnetic field. We develop an analytical approach to study the rich phase diagram and the associated quantum criticality. Of particular interest is the emergence of a chiral-coherent phase, which breaks both the Z, and the chiral symmetry. In this chiral phase, photons flow unidirectionally and the chirality can be tuned by the artificial gauge field, exhibiting a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. The finite-frequency scaling analysis further confirms the associated phase transition to be in the universality class of the Dicke model. This model can simulate a broad range of physical phenomena of light-matter coupling systems, and may have an application in future developments of various quantum information technologies.

TI Metrics induced by Jensen-Shannon and related divergences on positive
   definite matrices
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We study metric properties of symmetric divergences on Hermitian positive definite matrices. In particular, we prove that the square root of these divergences is a distance metric. As a corollary we obtain a proof of the metric property for Quantum Jensen-Shannon-(Tsallis) divergences (parameterized by alpha is an element of [0, 2]). When specialized to alpha = 1, we obtain as a corollary a proof of the metric property of the Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence that was conjectured by Lamberti et al. (2008) [13], and recently also proved by Virosztek (2019) [28]. A more intricate argument also establishes metric properties of Jensen-Renyi divergences (for alpha is an element of (0, 1)); this argument develops a technique that may be of independent interest.

TI Errors in PDH offset locking due to spurious spectral features
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is widely used to stabilize the frequency of lasers. Here we report on a routinely underestimated source of error in PDH offset-locking: a shift in the lock point due to the unintended interaction between residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in misaligned Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavities. Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude. Our findings draw attention to a systematic effect of importance to precision optical spectroscopy, optical clocks, and quantum information science.

SO ACS NANO
AB Engineering chiral optical and electronic properties of materials is interesting for applications in sensing and quantum information. State-of-the-art chiral optoelectronic devices are mostly based on three-dimensional (3D) and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we demonstrate chiral 2D MoS2 with sub-nanometer thickness via chirality transfer from l-/d-penicillamine (l-/d-PEN). We report a giant molar ellipticity of 10(8) deg<middle dot>cm(2)/dmol in monolayer solid-state films, up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than 3D chiral materials. Phototransistors with chiral 2D MoS2 channels exhibit gate-tunable circularly polarized light detection with responsivity of >10(2) A/W and anisotropy g-factor of 1.98, close to the theoretical maximum of 2.0. The reduced dimensionality magnifies the chirality transfer efficiency, allowing realization of ultrasensitive detectors for circularly polarized photons.

TI Bounding the rotating wave approximation for coupled harmonic
   oscillators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work we study the validity of the rotating wave approximation of an ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators evolving with a quadratic Hamiltonian and arbitrarily strong interaction. We prove its validity for arbitrary states by bounding the error introduced. We then restrict ourselves to the dynamics of Gaussian states and are able to fully quantify the deviation of arbitrary pure Gaussian states that evolve through different dynamics from a common quantum state. We show that this distance is fully determined by the first and second moments of the statistical distribution of the number of excitations created from the vacuum during an appropriate effective time-evolution. We use these results to completely control the dynamics for this class of states, therefore providing a toolbox to be used in quantum optics and quantum information. Applications and potential physical implementations are also discussed.

TI Quantum Liquids: Emergent Higher-Rank Gauge Theory and Fractons
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Fractons emerge from many-body systems, featuring subdimensional particles with restricted mobility. These particles have attracted interest for their roles across disciplines, including topological quantum codes, quantum field theory, emergent gravity, and quantum information. They display unique nonequilibrium behaviors such as nonergodicity and glassy dynamics. This review offers a structured overview of fracton phenomena, especially those of gapless fracton liquids, which enable collective modes similar to gauge fluctuations in Maxwell's electromagnetic framework, yet their phenomena are distinguished by a unique conservation law that restricts the mobility of individual charges and monopoles. We delve into the theoretical basis of three-dimensional (3D) fracton liquids, exploring emergent symmetric tensor gauge theories and their properties. We also discuss the material realization of fracton liquids in Yb-based pyrochlore lattices and other synthetic quantum matter platforms.

TI Experimental post-selection loophole-free time-bin and energy-time
   nonlocality with integrated photonics
SO OPTICA
AB Time-bin (TB) and energy-time (ET) entanglements are crucial resources for long-distance quantum information processing. However, their standard implementations suffer from the so-called post-selection loophole that allows for classical simulation and thus prevents quantum advantage. The post-selection loophole has been addressed in proof-of-principle experiments. An open problem though is to close it in real-life applications based on integrated technologies. This is especially important since, so far, all integrated sources of TB and ET entanglements suffer from the post-selection loophole. Here, we report post-selection loophole-free certification of TB or ET entanglement in integrated technologies, by implementing in a silicon nitride chip the "hug" scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 040401 (2009)] and certifying genuine TB entanglement through the violation of a Bell inequality.

TI High-dimensional single photon based quantum secure direct communication
   using time and phase mode degrees
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) can guarantee security using the characteristics of quantum mechanics even when a message is directly transmitted through a quantum channel without using a secret key. However, the transmission rate of the QSDC is limited by the dead time of a single photon detector (SPD) as well as channel loss over the distance. To overcome this limited transmission rate, we propose a high-dimensional single photon-based QSDC protocol that applies two optical degrees of freedom: time and phase state. First, an N-dimensional time and phase state generation method that considers the dead time is proposed to minimize the measurement loss of a transmitted message. Second, among the two types of quantum states, the phase state with relatively low measurement efficiency is used only for eavesdropping detection, and the time state is used for sending messages with differential delay time bin-based encoding techniques. Lastly, we propose an efficient method for measuring N-dimensional time and phase-based quantum states and recovering classical bit information. This study performs security analysis against various attacks, and verifies the transmission rate improvement effect through simulation. The result indicates that our proposal can guarantee higher security and transmission rates compared to the conventional DL04 QSDC.

TI Advances on quantum speed limit
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB As one of the fundamental questions, quantum speed limit (QSL) is of vital role in the community of quantum physics, which sets the ultimate, maximal speed with which a quantum system can evolve. QSL originated from the understanding of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In 1945, Mandelstam and Tamm found the time Delta t in the celebrated relation Delta E Delta t >= (h) over bar could be thought as the minimum time that a quantum system needs to evolve from an initial state to the orthogonal state for unitary evolution. QSL sets the lower bound of the evolution. They established the relationship between the minimum evolution time (tau(QSL)) and the energy uncertainty of the system (Delta E), namely tau(QSL) = pi(h) over bar/(2 Delta E), the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound. Later, Margolus and Levitin derived another different bound for a closed system which connected the tau(QSL) with the average energy of the system (< E >), i.e., tau(QSL) = pi(h) over bar (2 < E >), the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound. Combining the MT and ML bounds together, we can have a unified bound for a unitary system and orthogonal states.
   In the case of open system dynamics, because there is energy and/or coherence exchange between the system and the environment, the orthogonal final state of the initial state can hardly be reached any longer. An investigation of the QSL on non-unitary quantum evolution needs to be considered. The generalized QSLs are established by employing the distance between the distinguishable states. Different metrics define different distances, leading to different QSL bounds. We show a few typical generalized QSL bounds based on different metrics. And the unified QSL bound for non-unitary evolution is obtained by combining the generalized MT and ML bounds under the same metric. The generations and developments of QSL have successfully generalized the MT bounds. Even the ML bounds have been attempted to generalize, the current studies of ML bound are thought as the significantly harder task, and keep as the open questions.
   The influences of external environment and quantum system dynamics which include the role of entanglement in QSL for open dynamics and many-body systems, the relation between the maximum interaction speed and QSL in quantum spin systems, the non-Markovianity effect of the environment on accelerating the speed of evolution have been investigated.
   Furthermore, by employing the gauge invariant distance in the Riemannian metric, we establish a distinct QSL bound, which relates the quantum speed limit time to the geometry - phase, and presents the geometric and gauge invariant properties of it. The bound shows the impacts of the transmission modes of the state vectors on the evolution path in the manifold. Different from the established MT and ML bounds, our bound establishes the relation between the QSL and the Pancharatnam connection 1-form, and our results show that the QSL can be controlled via manipulating the generalized Pahcharatnam connection. Also, our results of QSL am holonomy via the generalized Pahcharatnam connection, which show us a possible technique to speed up the holonomic quantum computation. The bound is also interesting to the metrology and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, etc.
   QSL has also been studied in the quantum representation of Wigner function. In the future research of quantum speed limit, there am many issues that need to be considered, such as the generalized ML bound, the unified QSL bound under different metrics, the application of maximum rate of quantum information derived from the QSL, and the relation between the quantum speed limit and the quantum heat engine, etc.

TI Impurity states in altermagnetic superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose nonmagnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether or not the impurity respects the bulk symmetries, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N & eacute;el vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling another approach for in situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements such as scanning tunneling microscopy and open unexplored pathways for designing tunable quantum devices.

TI Quantum transport in InSb quantum well devices: progress and perspective
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB InSb, a narrow-band III-V semiconductor, is known for its small bandgap, small electron effective mass, high electron mobility, large effective g-factor, and strong spin-orbit interactions. These unique properties make InSb interesting for both industrial applications and quantum information processing. In this paper, we provide a review of recent progress in quantum transport research on InSb quantum well devices. With advancements in the growth of high-quality heterostructures and micro/nano fabrication, quantum transport experiments have been conducted on low-dimensional systems based on InSb quantum wells. Furthermore, ambipolar operations have been achieved in undoped InSb quantum wells, allowing for a systematic study of the band structure and quantum properties of p-type narrow-band semiconductors. Additionally, we introduce the latest research on InAsSb quantum wells as a continuation of exploring physics in semiconductors with even narrower bandgaps.

TI Nonpositive-transpose entanglement and bound entanglement: From
   distillability sets to inequalities and multivariable insights
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Equivalence between positive partial transpose (PPT) entanglement and bound entanglement is a longstanding open problem in quantum information theory. Limited progress has been made so far, even on the seemingly simple case of the bound entanglement of Werner states. The primary challenge is to give a concise mathematical representation of undistillability. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the N-undistillability verification into log(N) repeated steps of 1-undistillability verification. For Werner states' N-undistillability verification, a parameter interval for N-undistillability is given, which is independent of the dimensionality of Werner states. Equivalent forms of inequalities for both rank 1 and 2 matrices are presented, before transforming the 2-undistillability case into a matrix analysis problem. A new perspective is also attempted by seeing it as a nonconvex multivariable function, proving its critical points and conjecturing Hessian positivity, which would make them local minimums.

TI Anomalous coherent and dissipative coupling in dual photon-magnon hybrid
   resonators
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We explored the distinctive behavior of coherent and dissipative photon-magnon coupling (PMC) in dual hybrid resonators, each incorporating an Inverted Split-Ring Resonator (ISRR) paired with a Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film, positioned in close proximity but with varying relative split-gap orientations. These orientations led to notable shifts in the dispersion spectra, characterized by level repulsion and attraction, signaling coherent and dissipative coupling, respectively, in single ISRR/YIG hybrids at certain orientations. Through analytical modeling, we determined that the observed shifts in coupling types are primarily due to the effect of photon-photon (ISRR-ISRR) interactions altering the phase difference between the coupled ISRR and magnon modes. Our findings highlight that precise manipulation of the relative split-gap orientations in the ISRR resonators enables controlled coherent and dissipative coupling within planar PMC systems. This capability opens new avenues for applications in quantum information technologies and quantum materials.

TI Estimating many properties of a quantum state via quantum reservoir
   processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Estimating properties of a quantum state is an indispensable task in various applications of quantum information processing. To predict properties in the postprocessing stage, it is inherent to first perceive the quantum state with a measurement protocol and store the information acquired. In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing classical approximations of arbitrary quantum states with quantum reservoirs. A key advantage of our method is that only a single local measurement setting is required for estimating arbitrary properties, while most of the previous methods need an exponentially increasing number of measurement settings. To estimate M properties simultaneously, the size of the classical approximation scales as ln M. Moreover, this estimation scheme is extendable to higher-dimensional systems and hybrid systems with nonidentical local dimensions, which makes it exceptionally generic. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations.

TI Quasiperiodic circuit quantum electrodynamics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting circuits are an extremely versatile platform to realize quantum information hardware and to emulate topological materials. We here show how a simple arrangement of capacitors and conventional superconductor-insulator-superconductor junctions can realize an even broader class of systems, in the form of a nonlinear capacitive element which is quasiperiodic with respect to the quantized Cooper-pair charge. Our setup allows to create protected Dirac points defined in the transport degrees of freedom, whose presence leads to a suppression of the classical finite-frequency current noise. Furthermore, the quasiperiodicity can emulate Anderson localization in charge space, measurable via vanishing charge quantum fluctuations. The realization by means of the macroscopic transport degrees of freedom allows for a straightforward generalization to arbitrary dimensions and implements truly non-interacting versions of the considered models. As an outlook, we discuss potential ideas to simulate a transport version of the magic-angle effect known from twisted bilayer graphene.

TI Enhancement of magnon-photon-phonon entanglement in a cavity
   magnomechanics with coherent feedback loop
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we present a coherent feedback loop scheme to enhance the magnon-photon-phonon entanglement in cavity magnomechanics. We provide a proof that the steady state and dynamical state of the system form a genuine tripartite entanglement state. To quantify the entanglement in the bipartite subsystem and the genuine tripartite entanglement, we use the logarithmic negativity and the minimum residual contangle, respectively, in both the steady and dynamical regimes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal by implementing it with experimentally realizable parameters to achieve the tripartite entanglement. We also show that the entanglement can be significantly improved with coherent feedback by appropriately tuning the reflective parameter of the beam splitter and that it is resistant to environmental thermalization. Our findings pave the way for enhancing entanglement in magnon-photon-phonon systems and may have potential applications in quantum information.

AB We examine how the weak excitation regime of a quantum well confined in a semiconductor microcavity (SM) influences the dynamics of quantum coherence and the total phase. We analyze the impact of the physical parameters on different quantumness measures, and illustrate their numerical results. We show that the amount of the coherence and total phase in the SMs for multi-photon excitation can be improved and controlled by the strength of the field, exciton-photon coupling, cavity dissipation rate, and excitonic spontaneous emission rate. We illustrate how the fidelity varies depending on the physical parameters. These results might have far-reaching ramifications not just in quantum information processing and optics, but also in physics at large.

TI A classical model correspondence for G-symmetric random tensor networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We consider the scaling of entanglement entropy in random Projected Entangled Pairs States (PEPS) with an internal symmetry given by a finite group G. We systematically demonstrate a correspondence between this entanglement entropy and the difference of free energies of a classical Ising model with an addition non-local term. This non-local term counts the number of domain walls in a particular configuration of the classical spin model. We then make use of this correspondence to argue for an area law scaling with well-defined topological entanglement entropy when the bond dimensions are sufficiently large. The topological entanglement entropy is shown to be log vertical bar G vertical bar for a simply connected region and results from a difference in the number of domain walls of ground state energies for the two spin models.

TI Non-Gaussianity detection of single-mode rotationally symmetric quantum
   states via cumulant method
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The non-Gaussianity of quantum states incarnates an important resource for improving the performance of continuous-variable quantum information protocols. We propose a novel criterion of non-Gaussianity for single-mode rotationally symmetric quantum states via the squared Frobenius norm of higher-order cumulant matrix for the quadrature distribution function. As an application, we study the non-Gaussianities of three classes of single-mode symmetric non-Gaussian states: a mixture of vacuum and Fock states, single-photon added thermal states, and even/odd Schr & ouml;dinger cat states. It is shown that such a criterion is faithful and effective for revealing non-Gaussianity. We further extend this criterion to two cases of symmetric multi-mode non-Gaussian states and non-symmetric single-mode non-Gaussian states.

TI Complexity growth in Gubser-Rocha models with momentum relaxation
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The Einstein-Maxwell-Axion-Dilaton (EMAD) theories, based on the Gubser-Rocha (GR) model, are very interesting in holographic calculations of strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics. Due to the presence of spatially dependent massless axionic scalar fields, the momentum is relaxed, and we have no translational invariance at finite charge density. It would be of interest to study some aspects of quantum information theory for such systems in the context of AdS/CFT where EMAD theory is a holographic dual theory. For instance, in this paper we investigate the complexity and its time dependence for charged AdS black holes of EMAD theories in diverse dimensions via the complexity equals action (CA) conjecture. We will show that the growth rate of the holographic complexity violates Lloyd's bound at finite times. However, as shown at late times, it depends on the strength of the momentum relaxation and saturates the bound for these black holes.

TI Supercurrent parity meter in a nanowire Cooper pair transistor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We study a Cooper pair transistor realized by two Josephson weak links that enclose a superconducting island in an InSb-Al hybrid nanowire. When the nanowire is subject to a magnetic field, isolated subgap levels arise in the superconducting island and, because of the Coulomb blockade, mediate a supercurrent by coherent cotunneling of Cooper pairs. We show that the supercurrent resulting from such cotunneling events exhibits, for low to moderate magnetic fields, a phase offset that discriminates even and odd charge ground states on the superconducting island. Notably, this phase offset persists when a subgap state approaches zero energy and, based on theoretical considerations, permits parity measurements of subgap states by supercurrent interferometry. Such supercurrent parity measurements could, in a series of experiments, provide an alternative approach for manipulating and protecting quantum information stored in the isolated subgap levels of superconducting islands.

TI Fast laser cooling using optimal quantum control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Cooling down a trapped ion into its motional ground state is a central step for trapped-ion-based quantum information processing. State-of-the-art cooling schemes often work under a set of optimal cooling conditions derived analytically using a perturbative approach, in which the sideband coupling is assumed to be the weakest of all the relevant transitions. As a result, the cooling rate is severely limited. Here we propose to use a quantum control technique powered with automatic differentiation to speed up the classical cooling schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to find the optimal cooling conditions for classical sideband cooling and electromagnetically induced transparency cooling schemes, which are in general beyond the weak-sideband-coupling regime. Based on those numerically found optimal cooling conditions, we show that faster cooling can be achieved while at the same time a low average phonon occupation can be retained.

For this, we construct canonical identifications between bosonic and fermionic subsystems. Our derivation relies on a unified framework to describe both bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states in terms of so-called linear complex structures J. The resulting dualities apply to the full entanglement spectrum between the bosonic and the fermionic systems, such that the von Neumann entropy and arbitrary Renyi entropies can be related. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional systems, including the paradigmatic Kitaev honeycomb model. While typically supersymmetry preserves features like area law scaling of the entanglement entropies on either side, we find a peculiar phenomenon, namely, an amplified scaling of the entanglement entropy ("super area law") in bosonic subsystems when the dual fermionic subsystems develop almost maximally entangled modes.

TI Automated design of superconducting circuits and its application to
   4-local couplers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting circuits have emerged as a promising platform to build quantum processors. The challenge of designing a circuit is to compromise between realizing a set of performance metrics and reducing circuit complexity and noise sensitivity. At the same time, one needs to explore a large design space, and computational approaches often yield long simulation times. Here, we automate the circuit design task using SCILLA. The software SCILLA performs a parallelized, closed-loop optimization to design superconducting circuit diagrams that match predefined properties, such as spectral features and noise sensitivities. We employ it to design 4-local couplers for superconducting flux qubits and identify a circuit that outperforms an existing proposal with a similar circuit structure in terms of coupling strength and noise resilience for experimentally accessible parameters. This work demonstrates how automated design can facilitate the development of complex circuit architectures for quantum information processing.

TI Evolving Probability Representations of Entangled Cat States in the
   Potentials of Harmonic and Inverted Oscillators
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We determine the evolving probability representation of entangled cat states in the potential of either the harmonic oscillator or the inverted oscillator, assuming that the states are initially prepared in the potential of the harmonic oscillator. Such states have several applications in quantum information processing. The inverted quantum harmonic oscillator, where the potential energy corresponds to imaginary frequencies of the oscillator, can be applied in relation to cosmological problems. We also determine the evolving probability representation of cat states of an oscillating spin-1/2 particle of the inverted oscillator, in which the time evolution of the spin state is described by an arbitrary unitary operator. The properties of the determined entangled probability distributions are discussed.

TI Fermionic steering in multi-event horizon spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We investigate quantum steering of Dirac field for different types of Bell states in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime that has a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We find that fermionic steerability from Bob to Alice is greater than fermionic steerability from Alice to Bob, while bosonic steerability exhibits the opposite behavior in SdS spacetime. These different properties between fermionic and bosonic steering arise from the differences between Fermi-Dirac statistics and Bose-Einstein statistics. We also find that the Hawking effect of the black hole decreases fermionic steerability. However, the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance fermionic steerability, which differs from the properties of quantum steering in single-event horizon spacetime. Interestingly, we can indirectly protect quantum steering by using appropriate types of Bell states in multi-event horizon spacetime. These conclusions are helpful to guide the task of processing relativistic quantum information for quantum steering in SdS spacetime.

TI High Purcell Enhancement in Quantum-Dot Hybrid Circular Bragg Grating
   Cavities for GHz Clock Rate Generation of Indistinguishable Photons
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We present Purcell-enhanced (F P > 25) semiconductor InAs quantum dot decay times of T 1 < 30 ps, enabled by deterministic hybrid circular Bragg gratings (hCBGs). We investigate the benefits of these short T 1-times on the two-photon indistinguishability for quasi-resonant and strictly resonant excitation and observe visibilities of >= 96% at 12.5 ns time delay of consecutively emitted photons. The strongly Purcell-enhanced decay times enable a high degree of indistinguishability for elevated temperatures of up to 30 K and, moreover, allow for excitation of up to 1.28 GHz repetition rate. Our work highlights the prospects of highly Purcell-enhanced solid-state quantum emitters for applications in quantum information and technologies operating at GHz clock rates.

TI Shadow Distillation: Quantum Error Mitigation with Classical Shadows for
   Near-Term Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Mitigating errors in quantum information processing devices is especially important in the absence of fault tolerance. An effective method in suppressing state-preparation errors is using multiple copies to distill the ideal component from a noisy quantum state. Here, we use classical shadows and random-ized measurements to circumvent the need for coherent access to multiple copies at an exponential cost. We study the scaling of resources using numerical simulations and find that the overhead is still favor-able compared to full state tomography. We optimize measurement resources under realistic experimental constraints and apply our method to an experiment preparing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with trapped ions. In addition to improving stabilizer measurements, the analysis of the improved results reveals the nature of errors affecting the experiment. Hence, our results provide a directly applicable method for mitigating errors in near-term quantum computers.

TI Magneto-optical spectra of the split nickel-vacancy defect in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nickel is a common impurity in high-pressure high-temperature diamond and may contaminate chemical vapor deposited diamond used for high-power electronics or quantum technology applications. Magneto-optical fingerprints of nickel have been known since decades, however, no consensus has been reached about the microscopic origins of nickel-related electron paramagnetic resonance, photoluminescence, and optically detected magnetic resonance spectra. The unknown nickel-related defect structures in diamond make it difficult to control them or harness them for a given application. As a consequence, nickel is considered as an impurity in diamond that should be avoided or its concentration should be minimized Recent advances in the development of ab initio magneto-optical spectroscopy have significantly increased its accuracy and predictive power that can be employed for identification and in-depth characterization of paramagnetic color centers in diamond. In this study, we extend the accuracy of the ab initio magneto-optical spectroscopy tools towards self-consistent calculation of second-order spin-orbit coupling for paramagnetic color centers in solids. We apply the full arsenal of the ab initio magneto-optical spectroscopy tools to characterize the split nickel-vacancy defect in diamond which is one of the most stable nickel-related defect configurations. As a result, electron paramagnetic resonance and optical centers are positively identified in various charge states of the nickel-vacancy defect in diamond. In particular, the 1.40-eV optical center and the NIRIM-2 electron paramagnetic resonance center are identified as the single negative charge state of the split nickel-vacancy center. The defect possesses S = 1/2 spin state with an orbital doublet ground state. We find that the coherence time of the ground-state spin is about 0.1 ms at cryogenic temperatures which can be optically initialized and readout by a A-scheme protocol. Since the defect has inversion symmetry the optical signal is insensitive to the stray electric fields, which is an advantage for creating indistinguishable solid-state single-photon sources. We predict that the negatively charged nickel-vacancy defect has similar optical properties to those of the well-known silicon-vacancy defect in diamond but is superior in terms of electron spin coherence times. Our study resolves a few decades controversy about the nickel-related spectroscopy centers in diamond and turns nickel from an impurity to a resource in quantum technology applications.

TI Universal bound on the relaxation rates for quantum Markovian dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Relaxation rates provide important characteristics both for classical and quantum processes. Essentially they control how fast the system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and/or dissipates. Moreover, very often they are directly accessible to be measured in the laboratory and hence they define key physical properties of the system. Experimentally measured relaxation rates can be used to test validity of a particular theoretical model. Here we analyze a fundamental question: does quantum mechanics provide any nontrivial constraint for relaxation rates? We prove the conjecture formulated a few years ago that any quantum channel implies that a maximal rate is bounded from above by the sum of all the relaxation rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. It should be stressed that this constraint is universal (it is valid for all quantum systems with finite number of energy levels) and it is tight (cannot be improved). In addition, the constraint plays an analogous role to the seminal Bell inequalities and the well known Leggett-Garg inequalities (sometimes called temporal Bell inequalities). Violations of Bell inequalities rule out local hidden variable models, and violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities rule out macrorealism. Similarly, violations of the relaxation bound rule out Markovian (meaning CP-divisible) evolution.

TI On Quantum States with a Finite-Dimensional Approximation Property
SO LOBACHEVSKII JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB We consider a class (convex set) of quantum states containing all finite rank states and infinite rank states with the sufficient rate of decreasing of eigenvalues (in particular, all Gaussian states). Quantum states from this class are characterized by the property (called the FA-property) that allows to obtain several results concerning finite-dimensional approximation of basic entropic and information characteristics of quantum systems and channels. We obtain a simple sufficient condition of the FA-property. We show that all the states with the FA-property form a face of the convex set of all quantum states that is contained within the face of all states with finite von Neumann entropy (the non-coincidence of these two faces follows from the recent result of S. Becker, N. Datta and M.G. Jabbour). We obtain uniform approximation results for characteristics depending on a pair (channel, input state) and for characteristics depending on a pair (channel, input ensemble). We establish the uniform continuity of the above characteristics as functions of a channel w.r.t. the strong convergence provided that the FA-property holds either for the input state or for the average state of input ensemble.

TI Quantum inception score
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.

TI A framework for optimal quantum spatial search using alternating
   phase-walks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a novel methodological framework for quantum spatial search, generalising the Childs & Goldstone (CG) algorithm via alternating applications of marked-vertex phase shifts and continuous-time quantum walks. We determine closed form expressions for the optimal walk time and phase shift parameters for periodic graphs. These parameters are chosen to rotate the system about subsets of the graph Laplacian eigenstates, amplifying the probability of measuring the marked vertex. The state evolution is asymptotically optimal for any class of periodic graphs having a fixed number of unique eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by applying it to obtain O(root N) search on a variety of graphs. One important class is the n x n(3) rook graph, which has N = n(4) vertices. On this class of graphs the CG algorithm performs suboptimally, achieving only O(N-1/8) overlap after time O(N-5/8). Using the new alternating phase-walk framework, we show that O(1) overlap is obtained in O(root N) phase-walk iterations.

TI Asymptotic errors in adiabatic evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics implies that if a system is in a discrete eigenstate of a Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian evolves in time arbitrarily slowly, the system will remain in the corresponding eigenstate of the evolved Hamiltonian. Understanding corrections to the adiabatic result that arise when the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow, but not arbitrarily slow, has become increasingly important, especially since adiabatic evolution has been proposed as a method of state preparation in quantum computing. This paper identifies two regimes, an adiabatic regime in which corrections are generically small and can depend on details of the evolution throughout the path and a hyperadiabatic regime in which the error is given by a form similar to an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the evolution time with the coefficients depending principally on the behavior at the endpoints. However, the error in this hyperadiabatic regime is neither given by a true asymptotic series nor solely dependent on the endpoints: The coefficients combine the contributions from both endpoints, with relative phase factors that depend on the average spectral gaps along the trajectory, multiplied by the evolution time. The central result of this paper is to identify a quantity, referred to as the typical error, which is obtained by appropriately averaging the error over evolution times that are small compared to the evolution time itself. This typical error is characterized by an asymptotic series and depends solely on the endpoints of the evolution, remaining independent of the details of the intermediate evolution.

TI Efficient and Secure Post-Quantum Certificateless Signcryption With
   Linkability for IoMT
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has gained significant research focus in both academic and medical institutions. Nevertheless, the sensitive data involved in IoMT raises concerns regarding user validation and data privacy. To address these concerns, certificateless signcryption (CLSC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability. Unfortunately, most existing CLSC schemes are impractical for IoMT due to their heavy computational and storage requirements. Additionally, these schemes are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, research focusing on designing an efficient post-quantum CLSC scheme is still far-reaching. In this work, we propose PQ-CLSCL, a novel post-quantum CLSC scheme with linkability for IoMT. Our proposed design facilitates secure transmission of medical data between physicians and patients, effectively validating user legitimacy and minimizing the risk of private information leakage. To achieve this, we leverage lattice sampling algorithms and hash functions to generate the partial secret key, then employ the sign-then-encrypt method and design a link label. We also formalize and prove the security of our design, including indistinguishability against chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), existential unforgeability against chosen-message attacks (EU-CMA), and linkability. Finally, through comprehensive performance evaluation, our computation overhead is just 5% of other existing schemes. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution is practical and efficient.

TI Finding optimal pathways in chemical reaction networks using Ising
   machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Finding optimal pathways in chemical reaction networks is essential for elucidating and designing chemical processes, with significant applications such as synthesis planning and metabolic pathway analysis. Such a chemical pathway-finding problem can be formulated as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to find an optimal combination of chemical reactions connecting starting materials to target materials in a given network. Due to combinatorial explosion, the computation time required to find an optimal pathway increases exponentially with the network size. Ising machines, including quantum and simulated annealing devices, are promising novel computers dedicated to such hard combinatorial optimization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to apply Ising machines to chemical pathway-finding problems. In this article, we present the Ising/quantum computing application for chemical pathway-finding problems. The Ising model, translated from a chemical pathway-finding problem, involves several types of penalty terms for violating constraints. It is not obvious how to set appropriate penalty strengths of different types. To address this challenge, we employ Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a technique that enhances tuning performance by grouping penalty terms according to the underlying problem structure. The performance evaluation and analysis of the proposed algorithm were conducted using a D-Wave Advantage system and simulated annealing. The benchmark results reveal challenges in finding exact optimal pathways. Concurrently, the results indicate the feasibility of finding approximate optimal pathways, provided that a certain degree of relative error in cost value is acceptable.

AB Si1-xGex is a key material in modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor and bipolar devices. However, despite considerable efforts in metal-silicide and -germanide compound material systems, reliability concerns have so far hindered the implementation of metal-Si1-xGex junctions that are vital for diverse emerging "More than Moore" and quantum computing paradigms. In this respect, the systematic structural and electronic properties of Al-Si1-xGex heterostructures, obtained from a thermally induced exchange between ultra-thin Si1-xGex nanosheets and Al layers are reported. Remarkably, no intermetallic phases are found after the exchange process. Instead, abrupt, flat, and void-free junctions of high structural quality can be obtained. Interestingly, ultra-thin interfacial Si layers are formed between the metal and Si1-xGex segments, explaining the morphologic stability. Integrated into omega-gated Schottky barrier transistors with the channel length being defined by the selective transformation of Si1-xGex into single-elementary Al leads, a detailed analysis of the transport is conducted. In this respect, a report on a highly versatile platform with Si1-xGex composition-dependent properties ranging from highly transparent contacts to distinct Schottky barriers is provided. Most notably, the presented abrupt, robust, and reliable metal-Si1-xGex junctions can open up new device implementations for different types of emerging nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.

TI Bi12Rh3Cu2I5: A 3D Weak
   Topological Insulator with Monolayer Spacers and Independent Transport
   Channels
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Topological insulators (TIs) are semiconductors with protected electronic surface states that allow dissipation-free transport. TIs are envisioned as ideal materials for spintronics and quantum computing. In Bi14Rh3I9, the first weak 3D TI, topology presumably arises from stacking of the intermetallic [(Bi4Rh)(3)I](2+) layers, which are predicted to be 2D TIs and to possess protected edge-states, separated by topologically trivial [Bi2I8](2-) octahedra chains. In the new layered salt Bi12Rh3Cu2I5, the same intermetallic layers are separated by planar, i.e., only one atom thick, [Cu2I4](2-) anions. Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations show that the compound is a weak 3D TI, characterized by Z 2 = ( 0 ; 0001 ) , and that the topological gap is generated by strong spin-orbit coupling (E (g,calc.) similar to 10 meV). According to a bonding analysis, the copper cations prevent strong coupling between the TI layers. The calculated surface spectral function for a finite-slab geometry shows distinct characteristics for the two terminations of the main crystal faces ⟨001⟩, viz., [(Bi4Rh)(3)I](2+) and [Cu2I4](2-). Photoelectron spectroscopy data confirm the calculated band structure. In situ four-point probe measurements indicate a highly anisotropic bulk semiconductor (E (g,exp.) = 28 meV) with path-independent metallic conductivity restricted to the surface as well as temperature-independent conductivity below 60 K.

TI Adversarial learning in quantum artificial intelligence
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum artificial intelligence exploits the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum physics: on the one hand, a plethora of tools and ideas from artificial intelligence can be adopted to tackle intricate quantum problems; on the other hand, quantum computing could also bring unprecedented opportunities to enhance, speed up, or innovate artificial intelligence. Yet, quantum learning systems, similar to classical ones, may also suffer adversarial attacks: adding a tiny carefully-crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts and ideas of classical and quantum adversarial learning, as well as some recent advances along this line. First, we introduce the basics of both classical and quantum adversarial learning. Through concrete examples, involving classifications of phases of two-dimensional Ising model and three-dimensional chiral topological insulators, we reveal the vulnerability of classical machine learning phases of matter. In addition, we demonstrate the vulnerability of quantum classifiers with the example of classifying hand-written digit images. We theoretically elucidate the celebrated no free lunch theorem from the classical and quantum perspectives, and discuss the universality properties of adversarial attacks in quantum classifiers. Finally, we discuss the possible defense strategies. The study of adversarial learning in quantum artificial intelligence uncovers notable potential risks for quantum intelligence systems, which would have far-reaching consequences for the future interactions between the two areas.

TI Enhanced Photo-Cross-Linking of Thymines in DNA Holliday
   Junction-Templated Squaraine Dimers
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Programmable self-assembly of dyes using DNA templates to promote exciton delocalization in dye aggregates is gaining considerable interest. New methods to improve the rigidity of the DNA scaffold and thus the stability of the molecular dye aggregates to encourage exciton delocalization are desired. In these dye-DNA constructs, one potential way to increase the stability of the aggregates is to create an additional covalent bond via photo-cross-linking reactions between thymines in the DNA scaffold. Specifically, we report an approach to increase the yield of photo-cross-linking reaction between thymines in the core of a DNA Holliday junction while limiting the damage from UV irradiation to DNA. We investigated the effect of the distance between thymines on the photo-cross-linking reaction yields by using linkers with different lengths to tether the dyes to the DNA templates. By comprehensively evaluating the photo-cross-linking reaction yields of dye-DNA aggregates using linkers with different lengths, we conclude that interstrand thymines tend to photo-cross-link more efficiently with short linkers. A higher cross-linking yield was achieved due to the shorter intermolecular distance between thymines influenced by strong dye-dye interactions. Our method establishes the possibility of improving the stability of DNA-scaffolded dye aggregates, thereby expanding their use in exciton-based applications such as light harvesting, nanoscale computing, quantum computing, and optoelectronics.

TI Overlap-ADAPT-VQE: practical quantum chemistry on quantum computers via
   overlap-guided compact Ansatze
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB ADAPT-VQE is a robust algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical simulations of quantum chemical systems on near-term quantum computers. While its iterative process systematically reaches the ground state energy, practical implementations of ADAPT-VQE are sensitive to local energy minima, leading to over-parameterized ansatze. We introduce the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE to grow wave-functions by maximizing their overlap with any intermediate target wave-function that already captures some electronic correlation. By avoiding building the ansatz in the energy landscape strewn with local minima, the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE produces ultra-compact ansatze suitable for high-accuracy initialization of a new ADAPT procedure. Significant advantages over ADAPT-VQE are observed for strongly correlated systems including substantial savings in circuit depth. Since this compression strategy can also be initialized with accurate Selected-Configuration Interaction (SCI) classical target wave-functions, it paves the way for chemically accurate simulations of larger systems, and strengthens the promise of decisively surpassing classical quantum chemistry through the power of quantum computing.
   The paper explores the possibility of creating ansatz wave-functions for the variational quantum eigensolver that are much more compact than ADAPT-VQE while achieving chemical accuracy. The proposed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE combined with the classical selected-CI approach can reach chemical accuracy for a stretched linear H6 chain using an ansatz with only 40 operators compared to more than 150 for ADAPT-VQE.

TI Enhanced topological superconductivity in an asymmetrical planar
   Josephson junction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB As a platform for holding Majorana zero models (MZMs), the two-dimensional planar topological Josephson junction that can be used as carriers for topological quantum computing faces some challenges. One is a combination of mirror and time-reversal symmetries may make the system hold multiple pairs of MZMs. The other is that a soft gap dominated by a large momentum occurs in a clean system. To solve these problems, asymmetric junction can be introduced. Breaking this symmetry changes the symmetry class from class BDI to class D, and only a single pair of MZMs can be left at the boundary of the system. We numerically study four cases that create an asymmetric system and find out different superconducting pairing potential, different coupling coefficients between two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) and two superconducting bulks, different widths of two superconducting bulks make the gap of the system decrease at the optimal value, but make the gap at the minimum value increases. And the zigzag-shape quasi-one-dimensional junction eliminates the large momentum parallel to the junction and enhances the gap at the large momentum. However, the zigzag-shape junction cannot increase the gap at the region of multiple pairs of MZMs in a symmetric system. We show that by combining zigzag-shape junction with different coupling coefficients, the system can maintain a large gap (approximate to 0.2 Delta) in a wide region of the parameter space.

TI Enhanced Target Localization in the Internet of Underwater Things
   through Quantum-Behaved Metaheuristic Optimization with Multi-Strategy
   Integration
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Underwater localization is considered a critical technique in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs). However, acquiring accurate location information is challenging due to the heterogeneous underwater environment and the hostile propagation of acoustic signals, especially when using received signal strength (RSS)-based techniques. Additionally, most current solutions rely on strict mathematical expressions, which limits their effectiveness in certain scenarios. To address these challenges, this study develops a quantum-behaved meta-heuristic algorithm, called quantum enhanced Harris hawks optimization (QEHHO), to solve the localization problem without requiring strict mathematical assumptions. The algorithm builds on the original Harris hawks optimization (HHO) by integrating four strategies into various phases to avoid local minima. The initiation phase incorporates good point set theory and quantum computing to enhance the population quality, while a random nonlinear technique is introduced in the transition phase to expand the exploration region in the early stages. A correction mechanism and exploration enhancement combining the slime mold algorithm (SMA) and quasi-oppositional learning (QOL) are further developed to find an optimal solution. Furthermore, the RSS-based Cram & eacute;r-Raolower bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the effectiveness of QEHHO. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of QEHHO under various conditions compared to other state-of-the-art closed-form-expression- and meta-heuristic-based solutions.

TI Interface engineering of van der Waals heterostructures towards
   energy-efficient quantum devices operating at high temperatures
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Quantum devices, which rely on quantum mechanical effects for their operation, may offer advantages, such as reduced dimensions, increased speed, and energy efficiency, compared to conventional devices. However, quantum phenomena are typically observed only at cryogenic temperatures, which limits their practical applications. Two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provide a promising platform for high-temperature quantum devices owing to their strong Coulomb interactions and/or spin-orbit coupling. In this review, we summarise recent research on emergent quantum phenomena in vdW heterostructures based on interlayer tunnelling and the coupling of charged particles and spins, including negative differential resistance, Josephson tunnelling, exciton condensation, and topological superconductivity. These are the underlying mechanisms of energy-efficient devices, including tunnel field-effect transistors, topological/superconducting transistors, and quantum computers. The natural homojunction within vdW layered materials offers clean interfaces and perfectly aligned structures for enhanced interlayer coupling. Twisted bilayers with small angles may also give rise to novel quantum effects. In addition, we highlight several proposed structures for achieving high-temperature Majorana zero modes, which are critical elements of topological quantum computing. This review is helpful for researchers working on interface engineering of vdW heterostructures towards energy-efficient quantum devices operating above liquid nitrogen temperature.

TI The Power I Know: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Their Transformative Role in
   the Future of Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are public-key cryptosystem that enables to demonstrate that a statement which is known by them is correct without revealing the same to the verifier. ZKPs have moved in modern cryptographic systems, blockchain applications, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and identity authentication systems. This paper explores the evolution of ZKPs and their significance as in secure and privacy-preserving. We classify ZKPs into two groups, namely interactive and non-interactive, discussing prominent protocols such as zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, PLONK, and Halo2. Each approach has advantages such as efficiency, proof size, and computational overhead. The study further examines the multitude of applications of ZKPs, such as privacy-enhanced blockchain transactions, zero-knowledge rollups for scalability, decentralized identity management, secure voting mechanisms, and regulatory-compliant financial systems. With advantages, possible limitations in scalability, lack of standardization, and vulnerabilities to emerging quantum computing threats. Due to restrictions, hardware acceleration through GPUs and others presents promising solutions, while new protocols such as PLONK and Halo2 seek to optimize performance to earlier developed solutions. Finally, we discuss the future trajectory of ZKPs. This review aims to provide an understanding of the current state of ZKP research, its applications, and the key challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate broader adoption.

TI 2024 roadmap on 2D topological insulators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB 2D topological insulators promise novel approaches towards electronic, spintronic, and quantum device applications. This is owing to unique features of their electronic band structure, in which bulk-boundary correspondences enforces the existence of 1D spin-momentum locked metallic edge states-both helical and chiral-surrounding an electrically insulating bulk. Forty years since the first discoveries of topological phases in condensed matter, the abstract concept of band topology has sprung into realization with several materials now available in which sizable bulk energy gaps-up to a few hundred meV-promise to enable topology for applications even at room-temperature. Further, the possibility of combining 2D TIs in heterostructures with functional materials such as multiferroics, ferromagnets, and superconductors, vastly extends the range of applicability beyond their intrinsic properties. While 2D TIs remain a unique testbed for questions of fundamental condensed matter physics, proposals seek to control the topologically protected bulk or boundary states electrically, or even induce topological phase transitions to engender switching functionality. Induction of superconducting pairing in 2D TIs strives to realize non-Abelian quasiparticles, promising avenues towards fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. This roadmap aims to present a status update of the field, reviewing recent advances and remaining challenges in theoretical understanding, materials synthesis, physical characterization and, ultimately, device perspectives.

TI Transport and electrical properties of cryogenic thermoelectric
   FeSb2: the effect of isoelectronic and hole doping
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Thermoelectric materials operating at cryogenic temperatures are in high demand for efficient cooling and power generation in applications ranging from superconductors to quantum computing. The narrow band-gap semiconductor FeSb2, known for its colossal Seebeck coefficient, holds promise for such applications, provided its thermal conductivity value can be reduced. This study investigates the impact of isoelectronic substitution (Bi) and hole doping (Pb) at the Sb site on the transport properties of FeSb2, with a particular focus on thermal conductivity (kappa). Polycrystalline FeSb2 powder, along with Bi- and Pb-doped samples, were synthesized using a simple co-precipitation approach, followed by thermal treatment in an H-2 atmosphere. XRD and SEM analysis confirms the formation of the desired phase pre- and post-consolidation using spark plasma sintering. The consolidation process resulted in a high compaction density and the formation of submicrometer-sized grains, as substantiated by electron backscattered diffraction analysis. Substituting 1% of Bi and Pb at the Sb site successfully suppressed the thermal conductivity (kappa) from similar to 15 W (m<middle dot>K)(-1) in pure FeSb2 to similar to 10 and similar to 8.7 W (m<middle dot>K)(-1), respectively. Importantly, resistivity measurements revealed a metal-to-insulator transition at around 6.5 K in undoped FeSb2 and isoelectronically Bi-substituted FeSb2, suggesting the existence of metallic surface states and provides valuable evidence for the perplexing topological behavior exhibited by FeSb2.

TI Universal Metallic Surface States in Electrides
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Robust metallic surface states (MSS) of topological insulators (TIs) against imperfections and perturbations are important in broad applications such as chemical catalysis and quantum computing. Unfortunately, they suffer from the narrow band gap that can be accessed. Searching for MSS with a large bulk band gap beyond conventional TIs becomes a quest. In this work, inspired by the adiabatic connection principle in real space, we identify that all electrides, a new class of emerging materials, must host robust and universal MSS that resist any disturbances, in spite of the fact that some of them could be classified as trivial in standard topology theory. This counterintuitive property is traced to the specific charge localization-delocalization change intrinsic to the electride when approaching the crystalline surface or interface, which is a kind of interstice-centered to atom-centered transition in the real-space topology of the charge density distribution, and is sharply different from the band inversion in the standard topology theory. The new mechanism circumvents the obstacle that limits the band gap of TI. Robust and universal MSS in an electride conventionally determined as trivial but with a colossal band gap beyond 6.13 eV are demonstrated. This gap size is about 6-fold larger than the highest record of known "wide-gap" TIs, thus opening up new avenues to universal MSS with gigantic bulk gap.

TI Blockchain: A Crypto-Intensive Technology-A Comprehensive Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain has shifted the paradigm of computer-based commercial applications during the last decade. Initially developed as a public ledger for Bitcoin transactions, it has already shown that it has the potential to revolutionize the world, where trust, security, privacy, and anonymity are the assurances. The data stored within the blockchain remains unchangeable, resistant to tampering, and distributed across multiple locations within a decentralized network. The existence and reliability of blockchain rely heavily on robust cryptographic primitives, as these are fundamental to its operation. While blockchain faces significant challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of hardware and software technologies, it has retained its reputation for being secure due to its underlying cryptographic primitives. The architecture of blockchain, various consensus protocols, and the impacts of quantum computing are also discussed here. This study reviews the existing academic literature on cryptographic primitives used in blockchain and endeavours to bridge the gaps and provide a detailed understanding of their role in blockchain security. An exploratory qualitative research methodology is used in this study and is based on the latest literature on the topics. The findings of this study provide a valuable reference to the knowledge body and enhance the comprehension of blockchain, cryptography, and cryptographic primitives in blockchain for both new and experienced researchers, enabling them to identify new opportunities and challenges in the domain.

TI Engineering Epitaxial Interfaces for Topological Insulator -
   Superconductor Hybrid Devices with Al Electrodes
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Proximity-induced superconductivity in hybrid devices of topological insulators and superconductors offers a promising platform for the pursuit of elusive topological superconductivity and its anticipated applications, such as fault-tolerant quantum computing. To study and harness such hybrid devices, a key challenge is the realization of highly functional material interfaces with a suitable superconductor featuring 2e$e$-periodic parity-conserving transport to ensure a superconducting hard-gap free of unpaired electrons, which is important for Majorana physics. A superconductor well-known for this characteristic is Al, however, its direct integration into devices based on tetradymite topological insulators has so far been found to yield non-transparent interfaces. By focusing on Bi2Te3-Al heterostructures, this study identifies detrimental interdiffusion processes at the interface through atomically resolved structural and chemical analysis, and showcases their mitigation by leveraging different interlayers - namely Nb, Ti, Pd, and Pt - between Bi2Te3 and Al. Through structural transformation of the interlayer materials (X) into their respective tellurides (XTe2) atomically-sharp epitaxial interfaces are engineered and further characterized in low-temperature transport experiments on Al-X-Bi2Te3-X-Al Josephson junctions and in complementary density functional theory calculations. By demonstrating functional interfaces between Bi2Te3 and Al, this work provides key insights and paves the way for the next generation of sophisticated topological devices.

TI Searching for Majorana quasiparticles at vortex cores in iron-based
   superconductors
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB The unambiguous detection of the Majorana zero mode (MZM), which is essential for future topological quantum computing, has been a challenge in recent condensed matter experiments. The MZM is expected to emerge at the vortex core of topological superconductors as a zero-energy vortex bound state (ZVBS), amenable to detection using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). However, the typical energy resolution of STM/STS has made it challenging to distinguish the MZM from the low-lying trivial vortex bound states. Here, we review the recent high-energy-resolution STM/STS experiments on the vortex cores of Fe(Se,Te), where the MZM is expected to emerge, and the energy of the lowest trivial bound states is reasonably high. Tunneling spectra taken at the vortex cores exhibit a ZVBS well below any possible trivial state, suggesting its MZM origin. However, it should be noted that ZVBS is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the MZM; a qualitative feature unique to the MZM needs to be explored. We discuss the current status and issues in the pursuit of such Majorananess, namely the level sequence of the vortex bound states and the conductance plateau of the ZVBS. We also argue for future experiments to confirm the Majorananess, such as the detection of the doubling of the shot-noise intensity and spin polarization of the MZM.

TI Optimization of a Multi-Type PMSM Based on Pyramid Neural Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, a novel bat algorithm based on the quantum computing concept and pyramid neural network (PNN) is presented and applied to the electromagnetic motor optimization problem. Due to the problems of high loss, high temperature rise and threatening motor safety, it is necessary to optimize the design of high-speed permanent magnet synchronous motor (HPMSM) structure. In order to use less training data and avoid the problem of large computational costs due to repeated finite element simulation in the electromagnetic structure design, this paper adopted a performance-driven method to establish the PMSM model. This model could effectively reduce the dimensions of the parameter space and establish an effective high-quality model within a wide range of parameters. For the purpose of obtaining a reliable proxy model with less training data, this paper adopted a pyramid-shaped neural network, which could reduce the risk of overtraining and improve the utilization of specific problem knowledge embedded in the training data set. The quantum bat algorithm (QBA) was used to optimize the structure of the PMSM. Compared with the classical GA and PSO algorithms, the QBA has the characteristics of a rapid convergence speed, simple structure, strong searching ability and stronger local jumping mechanism. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed PNN-based QBA method were verified using simulation analysis and a prototype test.

TI Influence of sample momentum space features on scanning tunnelling
   microscope measurements
SO NANOSCALE
AB Theoretical understanding of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements involve electronic structure details of the STM tip and the sample being measured. Conventionally, the focus has been on the accuracy of the electronic state simulations of the sample, whereas the STM tip electronic state is typically approximated as a simple spherically symmetric s orbital. This widely used s orbital approximation has failed in recent STM studies where the measured STM images of subsurface impurity wave functions in silicon required a detailed description of the STM tip electronic state. In this work, we show that the failure of the s orbital approximation is due to the indirect band-gap of the sample material silicon (Si), which gives rise to complex valley interferences in the momentum space of impurity wave functions. Based on direct comparison of STM images computed from multi-million-atom electronic structure calculations of impurity wave functions in direct (GaAs) and indirect (Si) band-gap materials, our results establish that whilst the selection of STM tip orbital only plays a minor qualitative role for the direct band gap GaAs material, the STM measurements are dramatically modified by the momentum space features of the indirect band gap Si material, thereby requiring a quantitative representation of the STM tip orbital configuration. Our work provides new insights to understand future STM studies of semiconductor materials based on their momentum space features, which will be important for the design and implementation of emerging technologies in the areas of quantum computing, photonics, spintronics and valleytronics.

TI A Physics-Based Compact Model for Ferroelectric Capacitors Operating
   Down to Deep Cryogenic Temperatures for Applications in Analog Memory
   and Neuromorphic Architectures
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Binary oxide ferroelectrics like doped HfO2, compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platforms, have gained significant interest for energy efficient, scalable, high-performance non-volatile memory and neuromorphic technologies. However, there is no single model for doped hafnia systems that can explain physical properties of the system while being circuit simulation compatible and computationally efficient. It is presented physics-based compact modelling based on the Jiles-Atherton equations to reproduce experimentally measured polarization switching in ferroelectric thin film capacitors under different electric field and temperature conditions. Additionally, device-to-device variation effect on the model parameters is presented, which will enable large-scale integration of the FE components to complex functional circuits. Due to increasing interest in cryogenic electronics for quantum computing and space technologies, effect of temperatures on polarization switching is investigated down to 4 K. It is shown the model can reproduced the experimental polarization-voltage relation of Hafnium Zirconium Oxide capacitors with nearly 100% accuracy, for different electric fields and temperatures down to 4 K, including analog switching. It is find cooling the devices below 100 K increases polarization update linearity and symmetry significantly. This results represent an important advancement toward application of ferroelectric capacitors for large-scale memory and neuromorphic circuits operating down to deep cryogenic temperatures.

TI Ultra-Thin Strain-Relieving Si1-xGex Layers
   Enabling III-V Epitaxy on Si
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB The explosion of artificial intelligence, the possible end of Moore's law, dawn of quantum computing, and the continued exponential growth of data communications traffic have brought new urgency to the need for laser integration on the diversified Si platform. While diode lasers on group III-V platforms have long-powered internet data communications and other optoelectronic technologies, direct integration with Si remains problematic. A paradigm-shifting solution requires exploring new and unconventional materials and integration approaches. In this work, it is shown that a sub-10-nm ultra-thin Si1-xGex buffer layer fabricated by an oxidative solid-phase epitaxy process can facilitate extraordinarily efficient strain relaxation. The Si1-xGex layer is formed by ion implanting Ge into Si(111) and selectively oxidizing Si atoms in the resulting ion-damaged layer, precipitating a fully strain-relaxed Ge-rich layer between the Si substrate and surface oxide. The efficient strain relaxation results from the high oxidation temperature, producing a periodic network of dislocations at the substrate interface, coinciding with modulations of the Ge content in the Si1-xGex layer and indicating the presence of defect-mediated diffusion of Si through the layer. The epitaxial growth of high-quality GaAs is demonstrated on this ultra-thin Si1-xGex layer, demonstrating a promising new pathway for integrating III-V lasers directly on the Si platform.

TI The Intelligent Libraries: Innovation for a Sustainable Knowledge System
   in the Fifth (5th) Industrial Revolution
SO LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES
AB The Fifth Industrial Revolution is ushering in a profound era of technological advancement and societal transformation, prompting a critical examination of the evolving role of libraries in this digital landscape. Traditionally regarded as the custodians of knowledge, libraries must adapt to these changing dynamics of the digital world while preserving their core principles. This study looks into the strategic integration of advanced technologies, aiming to redefine the mission of libraries in the face of complex challenges. The Fifth Industrial Revolution encompasses a convergence of diverse technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and quantum computing, all underpinned by the currency of data. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a focal point, promising enhancements in user experiences and operational efficiency, however, it also raises critical ethical and privacy concerns that challenge fundamental library principles. This research employs an interpretive content/document analysis approach to examine the evolving roles of libraries, considering their pivotal function in bridging the digital divide, providing equitable access to technology and digital resources, advancing research and innovation, and fostering community engagement. The study underscores the imperative to address challenges related to data privacy, digital inclusion, resource allocation, intellectual property, and sustainability. However, despite these challenges, libraries are poised to remain indispensable pillars of education, research, and community interaction. To do so, they must embrace technology strategically to redefine their roles and expand their influence within evolving knowledge systems.

TI Search for large topological gaps in atomic spin chains on proximitized
   superconducting heavy-metal layers
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB One-dimensional systems comprising s-wave superconductivity with meticulously tuned magnetism realize topological superconductors hosting Majorana modes whose stability is determined by the gap size. However, for atomic spin chains on superconductors, the effect of the substrate's spin-orbit coupling on the topological gap is largely unexplored. Here, we introduce an atomic layer of the heavy metal gold on a niobium surface combining strong spin-orbit coupling and a large superconducting gap with a high crystallographic quality, enabling the assembly of defect-free iron chains using a scanning tunneling microscope tip. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal ungapped Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands in the ferromagnetic chain despite the heavy substrate. By artificially imposing a spin spiral state, the calculations indicate minigap opening and zero-energy edge state formation. The methodology enables a material screening of heavy-metal layers on elemental superconductors for ideal systems hosting Majorana edge modes protected by large topological gaps.
   Majorana bound states have possible application in future quantum computing devices but designing platforms where their signatures can be isolated and observed is challenging. Here, the authors report experimental and calculated data for the screening of proximitized superconducting and strongly spin-orbit-coupled heavy metal layers with atom-by-atom assembled chains of transition metal atoms with the aim of realizing large topological minigaps protecting Majorana edge modes.

TI Atomic Energy Optimization: A Novel Meta-Heuristic Inspired by Energy
   Dynamics and Dissipation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we present Atomic Energy Optimization (AEO), a novel meta-heuristic optimization technique inspired by atomic energy dynamics and the process of static electricity dissipation. AEO models optimization by mimicking the energy accumulation, transfer, and dissipation behaviors observed in atoms, particularly during processes involving electrostatic charge and discharge. Each solution in AEO is represented as an atom with electrons, where its energy state corresponds to solution quality. Solutions interact, exchanging and dissipating energy in a manner analogous to static electricity buildup and release-such as when a plastic rod is rubbed to accumulate charge, then gradually neutralized upon contact with another surface. This energy-driven model allows AEO to balance exploration and exploitation dynamically, enhancing its ability to navigate com-plex, multimodal landscapes. The paper delves into key AEO mechanisms, including energy transfer, dissipation, and parameter sensitivity, exploring their impact on the algorithm's performance across challenging benchmarks. Notable applications of AEO to problems like the Rastrigin function and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) showcase its effectiveness, with experimental results demonstrating superior convergence and robustness compared to traditional methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Through extensive experimentation, AEO achieved up to a 20% faster convergence rate and a 15% improvement in solution quality over peer methods, demonstrating its superiority in solving benchmark optimization problems.

TI AI-driven multi-omics integration in precision oncology: bridging the
   data deluge to clinical decisions
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Cancer's staggering molecular heterogeneity demands innovative approaches beyond traditional single-omics methods. The integration of multi-omics data, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics, can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when accompanied by rigorous preprocessing and external validation; for example, recent integrated classifiers report AUCs around 0.81-0.87 for difficult early-detection tasks. This review synthesizes how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, bridges this gap by enabling scalable, non-linear integration of disparate omics layers into clinically actionable insights. We explore cutting-edge AI methodologies, including graph neural networks for biological network modeling, transformers for cross-modal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparent clinical decision support. Critical applications are highlighted, such as AI-driven therapy selection (e.g., predicting targeted therapy resistance), proteogenomic early detection, and radiogenomic non-invasive diagnostics. We further address translational challenges: data harmonization, batch correction, missing data imputation, and computational scalability. Emerging trends, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, spatial/single-cell omics for microenvironment decoding, quantum computing, and patient-centric "N-of-1" models, signal a paradigm shift toward dynamic, personalized cancer management. Despite persistent hurdles in model generalizability, ethical equity, and regulatory alignment, AI-powered multi-omics integration promises to transform precision oncology from reactive population-based approaches to proactive, individualized care.

TI Resource-Constrained EXtended Reality Operated With Digital Twin in
   Industrial Internet of Things
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB EXtended Reality (XR) alongside the Digital Twin (DT) in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) emerges as a promising next-generation technology. Its diverse applications hod the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of Industry 4.0 and serve as a cornerstone for the rise of Industry 5.0. However, current systems are still not effective in providing a high-quality experience for users due to various factors, one of which is their limited resources for processing and transmitting complex data and big data. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of performance optimization techniques for resource-constrained Augmented Reality (AR) and/or Virtual Reality (VR) environments operating with DT, with a specific focus on Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), Edge-Cloud architectures and future research directions. Furthermore, this study delves into the intricate complex trade-off relationships involving optimization factors, including system quality, information quality, and QoE. In addition, it also explores potential solutions based on powerful emerging technological tools, including data compression, blockchain, cloud computing, quantum computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML), and cybersecurity in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The insights provided in this comprehensive survey can inspire and guide researchers and industrial practitioners in optimizing performance for XR with DT applications in resource-constrained Smart Manufacturing System (SMS).

TI Improved Metropolis-Hastings algorithms via landscape modification with
   applications to simulated annealing and the Curie-Weiss model
SO ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY
AB In this paper, we propose new Metropolis-Hastings and simulated annealing algorithms on a finite state space via modifying the energy landscape. The core idea of landscape modification rests on introducing a parameter c, such that the landscape is modified once the algorithm is above this threshold parameter to encourage exploration, while the original landscape is utilized when the algorithm is below the threshold for exploitation purposes. We illustrate the power and benefits of landscape modification by investigating its effect on the classical Curie-Weiss model with Glauber dynamics and external magnetic field in the subcritical regime. This leads to a landscape-modified mean-field equation, and with appropriate choice of c the free energy landscape can be transformed from a double-well into a single-well landscape, while the location of the global minimum is preserved on the modified landscape. Consequently, running algorithms on the modified landscape can improve the convergence to the ground state in the Curie-Weiss model. In the setting of simulated annealing, we demonstrate that landscape modification can yield improved or even subexponential mean tunnelling time between global minima in the low-temperature regime by appropriate choice of c, and we give a convergence guarantee using an improved logarithmic cooling schedule with reduced critical height. We also discuss connections between landscape modification and other acceleration techniques, such as Catoni's energy transformation algorithm, preconditioning, importance sampling, and quantum annealing. The technique developed in this paper is not limited to simulated annealing, but is broadly applicable to any difference-based discrete optimization algorithm by a change of landscape.

TI Identification of driver genes for critical forms of COVID-19 in a
   deeply phenotyped young patient cohort
SO SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB The drivers of critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. Given major confounding factors such as age and comorbidities, true mediators of this condition have remained elusive. We used a multi-omics analysis combined with artificial intelligence in a young patient cohort where major comorbidities were excluded at the onset. The cohort included 47 "critical" (in the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation) and 25 "non-critical" (in a non-critical care ward) patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cell proteomics, cytokine profiling, and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing, and structural causal modeling were used. Patients with critical COVID-19 were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid and myeloid compartments, increased coagulation, and viral cell biology. Among differentially expressed genes, we observed up-regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM9. This gene signature was validated in a second independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered patients with COVID-19 and was further confirmed at the transcriptional and protein level and by proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, cohort of individuals with COVID-19, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients. We further identified ADAM9 as a driver of disease severity and a candidate therapeutic target.

TI Improvement of Electrical Transport Performance of BiSbTeSe2
   by Elemental Doping
SO MATERIALS
AB A topological insulator with large bulk-insulating behavior and high electron mobility of the surface state is needed urgently, not only because it would be a good platform for studying topological surface states but also because it is a prerequisite for potential future applications. In this work, we demonstrated that tin (Sn) or indium (In) dopants could be introduced into a BiSbTeSe2 single crystal. The impacts of the dopants on the bulk-insulating property and electron mobility of the surface state were systematically investigated by electrical transport measurements. The doped single crystals had the same crystal structure as the pristine BiSbTeSe2, no impure phase was observed, and all elements were distributed homogeneously. The electrical transport measurements illustrated that slight Sn doping could improve the performance of BiSbTeSe2 a lot, as the longitudinal resistivity (rho(xx)), bulk carrier density (n(b)), and electron mobility of the surface state (mu(s)) reached about 11 Omega cm, 7.40 x 10(14) cm(-3), and 6930 cm(2)/(Vs), respectively. By comparison, indium doping could also improve the performance of BiSbTeSe2 with rho(xx), n(b), and mu(s) up to about 13 Omega cm, 1.29 x 10(15) cm(-3), and 4500 cm(2)/(Vs), respectively. Our findings suggest that Sn- or indium-doped BiSbTeSe2 crystals should be good platforms for studying novel topological properties, as well as promising candidates for low-dissipation electron transport, spin electronics, and quantum computing.

TI Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems-A Review of Optimization Approaches and
   Future Challenges
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The growing need for sustainable energy solutions has propelled the development of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs), which integrate diverse renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower and tidal. This review paper focuses on balancing economic, environmental, social and technical criteria to enhance system performance and resilience. Using comprehensive methodologies, the review examines state-of-the-art algorithms such as Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), alongside Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Levy Flight-Salp Swarm Algorithm (LF-SSA), Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and tools like HOMER Pro 3.12-3.16 and MATLAB 9.1-9.13, which have been instrumental in optimizing HRESs. Key findings highlight the growing role of advanced, multi-energy storage technologies in stabilizing HRESs and addressing the intermittency of renewable sources. Moreover, the integration of metaheuristic algorithms with machine learning has enabled dynamic adaptability and predictive optimization, paving the way for real-time energy management. HRES configurations for cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and operational reliability while also emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging technologies such as quantum computing are underscored. This review provides critical insights into the evolving landscape of HRES optimization, offering actionable recommendations for future research and practical applications in achieving global energy sustainability goals.

TI Graph representation learning for parameter transferability in quantum
   approximate optimization algorithm
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage through quantum-enhanced combinatorial optimization. Optimal QAOA parameter concentration effects for special MaxCut problem instances have been observed, but a rigorous study of the subject is still lacking. Due to clustering of optimal QAOA parameters for MaxCut, successful parameter transferability between different MaxCut instances can be explained and predicted based on local properties of the graphs, including the type of subgraphs (lightcones) from which graphs are composed as well as the overall degree of nodes in the graph (parity). In this work, we apply five different graph embedding techniques to determine good donor candidates for parameter transferability, including parameter transferability between different classes of MaxCut instances. Using this technique, we effectively reduce the number of iterations required for parameter optimization, obtaining an approximate solution to the target problem with an order of magnitude speedup. This procedure also effectively removes the problem of encountering barren plateaus during the variational optimization of parameters. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the transferred parameters maintain effectiveness when subjected to noise, supporting their use in real-world quantum applications. This work presents a framework for identifying classes of combinatorial optimization instances for which optimal donor candidates can be predicted such that QAOA can be substantially accelerated under both ideal and noisy conditions.

TI Safe reinforcement learning under temporal logic with reward design and
   quantum action selection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper proposes an advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, incorporating reward shaping, safety value functions, and a quantum action selection algorithm. The method is model free and can synthesize a finite policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a complex task. Although RL is a promising approach, it suffers from unsafe traps and sparse rewards and becomes impractical when applied to real-world problems. To improve safety during training, we introduce a concept of safety values, which results in a model-based adaptive scenario due to online updates of transition probabilities. On the other hand, a high-level complex task is usually formulated via formal languages, including Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Another novelty of this work is using an Embedded Limit-Deterministic Generalized Buchi Automaton (E-LDGBA) to represent an LTL formula. The obtained deterministic policy can generalize the tasks over infinite and finite horizons. We design an automaton-based reward, and the theoretical analysis shows that an agent can accomplish task specifications with the maximum probability by following the optimal policy. Furthermore, a reward shaping process is developed to avoid sparse rewards and enforce the RL convergence while keeping the optimal policies invariant. In addition, inspired by quantum computing, we propose a quantum action selection algorithm to replace the existing e-greedy algorithm for the balance of exploration and exploitation during learning. Simulations demonstrate how the proposed framework can achieve good performance by dramatically reducing the times to visit unsafe states while converging optimal policies.

TI Enhanced Differential Crossover and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization
   for IoT Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB An optimized design with real-time and multiple realistic constraints in complex engineering systems is a crucial challenge for designers. In the non-uniform Internet of Things (IoT) node deployments, the approximation accuracy is directly affected by the parameters like node density and coverage. We propose a novel enhanced differential crossover quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear numerical problems. The algorithm is based on hybrid optimization using quantum PSO. Differential evolution operator is used to circumvent group moves in small ranges and falling into the local optima and improves global searchability. The cross operator is employed to promote information interchange among individuals in a group, and exceptional genes can be continued moderately, accompanying the evolutionary process's continuance and adding proactive and reactive features. The proposed algorithm's performance is verified as well as compared with the other algorithms through 30 classic benchmark functions in IEEE CEC2017, with a basic PSO algorithm and improved versions. The results show the smaller values of fitness function and computational efficiency for the benchmark functions of IEEE CEC2019. The proposed algorithm outperforms the existing optimization algorithms and different PSO versions, and has a high precision and faster convergence speed. The average location error is substantially reduced for the smart parking IoT application.

TI Post-Quantum Weighted Anonymous Authentication for Hybrid VANET MAC
   Protocol
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB Efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are crucial for time-sensitive transmissions of safety and non-safety messages. The IEEE 802.11p standard requires enhancements for varying channel conditions, including error-prone environments. This paper proposes HVMAC, a hybrid VANET MAC protocol that enhances Quality of Service (QoS) for time-sensitive data traffic applications. It categorizes service channels into contention and scheduled channels. The HVMAC protocol is modeled with Markov chains and evaluated against IEEE 802.11p on offered load, average delay, throughput, reliability, and energy consumption (upto 90%). To improve HVMAC security during safety messages (SM) and service advertisement messages (SAM) transmission, a Post-Quantum Weighted Anonymous Authentication (PQWAA) is proposed. The weighted certificate authority (WCA) assigns priority weights to vehicles, for effective traffic management and resource distribution.

TI Continuous variable quantum reinforcement learning for HVAC control and
   power management in residential building
SO ENERGY AND AI
AB The use of occupancy information for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control in smart buildings has become increasingly important for enhancing energy efficiency and occupant comfort. However, residential HVAC control presents significant challenges due to the complex dynamic nature of buildings and the uncertainties associated with heat loads and weather conditions. This study addresses this gap in adaptive and energy efficient HVAC control by introducing a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) based approach. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning techniques, the QRL leverages quantum computing principles to efficiently handle high dimensional state and action spaces, enabling more precise HVAC control in multi-zone residential buildings. The proposed framework integrates real-time occupancy detection using deep learning with operational data, including power consumption patterns, air conditioner control data, and external temperature variations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations were conducted using real world data from 26 residential households over a three month period. The results demonstrate that the QRL based HVAC control significantly reduces energy consumption and electricity costs while maintaining thermal comfort. Compared to the deep deterministic policy gradient method, the QRL approach achieved a 63% reduction in power consumption and a 64.4% decrease in electricity costs. Similarly, it outperformed the proximal policy optimization algorithm, leading to an average reduction of 62.5% in electricity costs and 62.4% in power consumption.

TI Quantum gate control pulse optimization based on the Adam algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The efficient implementation of quantum computing is contingent upon high-fidelity quantum operations. Nevertheless, the fidelity of these operations is constrained by the precision of quantum system evolution control. The optimization of quantum control pulses is essential for improving the manipulation accuracy of superconducting qubits. Traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm, frequently encounter challenges such as slow convergence and susceptibility to local optima in pulse optimization problems. This study introduces an adaptive open-loop optimization algorithm based on the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer, capitalizing on the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rate adjustments inherent in Adam. We conduct experimental analysis on the algorithm's hyperparameters to achieve optimal solutions with a higher fidelity range at a faster convergence speed, effectively improving the fidelity and optimization efficiency of quantum gate operations. Through numerical simulations on the QuTiP platform, we validate the excellent performance of the Adam algorithm in quantum gate optimization. In optimizing the X and SWAP gates, its fidelity improved by 0.03% and 0.0016%, respectively, compared to the GRAPE algorithm. Compared to the CRAB method, the initial convergence speed of the Adam method increased fivefold, enabling it to achieve the target fidelity more rapidly. Future research will investigate closed-loop optimization strategies, utilizing feedback derived from the fidelity results of actual quantum computers to further augment quantum control performance

TI Ultra-high-precision detection of single microwave photons based on a
   hybrid system between a Majorana zero mode and a quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability to detect single photons has become increasingly essential due to the rise of photon-based quantum computing. In this theoretical work, we propose a system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) side-coupled to a superconducting nanowire. The coupling opens a gap in both the QD mode and the Majorana zero mode (MZM) at the nanowire edge, enabling photon absorption in the system. We show that the absorbed photoelectron decays via rapid (subnanosecond to nanosecond) nonradiative heat transfer to the nanowire phonon modes rather than by spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we calculate the temperature increase and associated resistance increase induced by the absorption of a photon for a given appropriate set of material and environmental parameters, yielding a temperature increase in the millikelvin range and a resistance increase in the kiloohm range, vastly exceeding the photon-absorption-induced temperature and resistance increases for competing 2D-3D hybrid systems by 5 and 9 orders of magnitude, respectively. Last, we determine the detector efficiency and discuss the system density required for deterministic photon number measurement, demonstrating that a photon absorption probability of over 99.9 percent can be achieved for an integrated system consisting of an array of nanowire-QD complexes on-chip inside a cavity. Our results thus provide a basis for a deterministic microwave photon number detector with an unprecedented photon-number-detection resolution.

TI Synthesis and anisotropic magnetism in quantum spin liquid candidates
   AYbSe2 (A = K and Rb)
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The quantum spin liquid (QSL) state in rare-earth triangular lattices has attracted much attention recently due to its potential application in quantum computing and communication. Here, we report the single-crystal growth synthesis, crystal structure characterizations, and magnetic properties of AYbSe(2) (A = K and Rb) compounds. The x-ray diffraction analysis shows that AYbSe(2) (A = K and Rb) crystallizes in a trigonal space group, R-3m (No. 166) with Z = 3. AYbSe(2) possesses a two-dimensional (2D) Yb-Se-Yb layered structure formed by edged-shared YbSe6 octahedra. The magnetic properties are highly anisotropic for both title compounds, and no long-range order is found down to 0.4 K, revealing the possible QSL ground state in these compounds. The isothermal magnetization exhibits a one-third magnetization plateau when the magnetic fields are applied in the ab-plane. Heat capacity is performed along both ab-plane and c axis and features the characteristic dome for triangular magnetic lattice compounds as a function of magnetic fields. Due to the change in the interlayer and intralayer distance of Yb3+, the dome shifts to low fields from KYbSe2 to RbYbSe2. All these results indicate that the AYbSe(2) family presents unique frustrated magnetism close to the possible QSL and noncollinear spin states.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Integrating high dimensional quadratic regression with penalties based
   predictive modeling for hydro power plants accurate tariff prediction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In order to optimize the financial and operational cost of an hydropower plant in a micro-grid operation, it is required to accurately forecast the per unit generation cost and per unit selling price in a competitive energy trading market. This study presents a novel high dimensional quadratic regression with penalty based predictive model for forecasting generation cost and selling price per unit in hydroelectric energy systems. The proposed model addresses the limitations of conventional method such as SVR, SARIMA and LSTM by integrating polynomial interaction terms with L2 regularization to balance model complexity and generalization. A total of 12 features including operational variables and nonlinear combinations are pre-processed using outlier detection normalization and interpolation techniques. The model is benchmarked across multiple time intervals using a comprehensive set of key performance indicators. Compared to benchmarking models, the proposed approach consistently achieves the lowest forecast error. Computational complexity is minimized with 100 parameters and training time of 2 s. Graphical and numerical evaluations confirm the model's accuracy and suitability for spot market forecasting within hydro-DISCOM integration. The study concludes with recommendations for real time deployment and extension into hybrid intelligent forecasting framework. In future the work can also be integrated to different policy & weather dynamics and impact analysis in predicting the per unit selling price of the energy.

TI Suppressed electronic contribution in thermal conductivity of
   Ge2Sb2Se4Te
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated nanophotonics is an emerging research direction that has attracted great interests for technologies ranging from classical to quantum computing. One of the key-components in the development of nanophotonic circuits is the phase-change unit that undergoes a solid-state phase transformation upon thermal excitation. The quaternary alloy, Ge2Sb2Se4Te, is one of the most promising material candidates for application in photonic circuits due to its broadband transparency and large optical contrast in the infrared spectrum. Here, we investigate the thermal properties of Ge2Sb2Se4Te and show that upon substituting tellurium with selenium, the thermal transport transitions from an electron dominated to a phonon dominated regime. By implementing an ultrafast mid-infrared pump-probe spectroscopy technique that allows for direct monitoring of electronic and vibrational energy carrier lifetimes in these materials, we find that this reduction in thermal conductivity is a result of a drastic change in electronic lifetimes of Ge2Sb2Se4Te, leading to a transition from an electron-dominated to a phonon-dominated thermal transport mechanism upon selenium substitution. In addition to thermal conductivity measurements, we provide an extensive study on the thermophysical properties of Ge2Sb2Se4Te thin films such as thermal boundary conductance, specific heat, and sound speed from room temperature to 400 degrees C across varying thicknesses.
   Integrated nanophotonics is an emerging research direction that has attracted great interests. Here, the authors show upon substituting Te with Se, the thermal conductivity of ordered Ge2Sb2Te5 transitions from an electron to a phonon dominated regime.

TI Heavy tails and pruning in programmable photonic circuits for universal
   unitaries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Authors model programmable photonic circuits targeting universal unitaries and verify that a type of unit rotation operator has a heavy-tailed distribution. They suggest hardware pruning for random unitary and present design strategies for high fidelity and energy efficiency in large-scale quantum computations and photonic deep learning accelerators.
   Developing hardware for high-dimensional unitary operators plays a vital role in implementing quantum computations and deep learning accelerations. Programmable photonic circuits are singularly promising candidates for universal unitaries owing to intrinsic unitarity, ultrafast tunability and energy efficiency of photonic platforms. Nonetheless, when the scale of a photonic circuit increases, the effects of noise on the fidelity of quantum operators and deep learning weight matrices become more severe. Here we demonstrate a nontrivial stochastic nature of large-scale programmable photonic circuits-heavy-tailed distributions of rotation operators-that enables the development of high-fidelity universal unitaries through designed pruning of superfluous rotations. The power law and the Pareto principle for the conventional architecture of programmable photonic circuits are revealed with the presence of hub phase shifters, allowing for the application of network pruning to the design of photonic hardware. For the Clements design of programmable photonic circuits, we extract a universal architecture for pruning random unitary matrices and prove that "the bad is sometimes better to be removed" to achieve high fidelity and energy efficiency. This result lowers the hurdle for high fidelity in large-scale quantum computing and photonic deep learning accelerators.

TI HORSIC plus : An Efficient Post-Quantum Few-Time Signature Scheme
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB It is well known that conventional digital signature algorithms such as RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Hash-based signature schemes are attractive as post-quantum signature schemes in that it is possible to calculate the quantitative security level and the security is proven. SPHINCS is a stateless hash-based signature scheme and introduces HORST few-time signature scheme which is an improvement of HORS. However, HORST as well as HORS suffers from pretty large signature sizes. HORSIC is proposed to reduce the signature size, yet does not provide in-depth security analysis. In this paper, we propose HORSIC+, which is an improvement of HORSIC. HORSIC+ differs from HORSIC in that HORSIC+ does not apply f as a plain function to the signature key, but uses a member of a function family. In addition, HORSIC+ uses the chaining function similar to W-OTS+. These enable the strict security proof without the need for the used function family to be a permutation or collision resistant. HORSIC+ is existentially unforgeable under chosen message attacks, assuming a second-preimage resistant family of undetectable one-way functions and cryptographic hash functions in the random oracle model. HORSIC+ reduces the signature size by as much as 37.5% or 18.75% compared to HORS and by as much as 61.5% or 45.8% compared to HORST for the same security level.

TI Sub-megahertz laser stabilization by harnessing orthogonality between
   the acousto-optic modulator dither and atomic spectroscopy
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB A sub-MHz frequency stability of the laser is crucial in the quantum-atom experiment where precise atomic transition is required for control and manipulation of atom like in the atom quantum computing. In this work, we have built the frequency stabilization system for the lasers used in our cold Rubidium atom experiment in the magneto-optical trap (MOT) and the optical tweezers. We utilized a Rubidium vapour glass cell as a frequency reference, which provides atomically absolute reference point with low complexity setup. By mean of the absorption of the laser beam by the Rubidium vapour, the saturated absorption spectroscopy (SAS) experiment was setup to produce the D2 line spectra. The acousto-optic modulator (AOM) was used to sinusoidally dither the laser frequency and consequently the resonance peaks in the spectra. Detailing in this work, the AOM sinusoidal dithering and the dithered SAS signal had orthogonality and were processed together to produce the error signal used to stabilize the laser frequency to the resonant peak. This frequency stabilization system achieved the frequency standard deviation below 0.80 MHz over up to 800 minutes period. The system also allowed for stabilized frequency tunability over a range of 55 -60 MHz about the target resonance peak. This performance is significant for stabilizing the lasers in the MOT experiment and related quantum-atom research.

TI Goppa Codes Arising From Quasihermitian Curves
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Code-based cryptography is particularly relevant in contemporary research, as it offers the potential to resist attacks from future quantum computers, which could easily compromise many current cryptographic algorithms. Motivated by this critical need for quantum-resistant cryptography, this study proposes the design of robust Goppa codes utilizing the unique properties of quasihermitian curves, which provide a powerful tool for their design due to their distinct arithmetic and efficient genus computation. These curves are an active area of investigation in coding theory and cryptography, and their defining equations and genus set them apart from other algebraic curves. Our study demonstrates the construction of numerous Goppa codes whose parameters can be extended, providing enhanced flexibility for diverse cryptographic applications, including the development of secure post-quantum systems. In this study, we construct 36 different Goppa codes using two specific quasihermitian curves: $Y<^>{4}+YZ<^>{3}+X<^>{3}Z=0$ , and $Y<^>{2}Z<^>{3}+YZ<^>{4}+X<^>{5}=0$ . Both curves are defined over $\mathbb {F}_{2<^>{4}}$ , with respective genera 3 and 2. Curve $C_{2,5}$ is also maximal over $\mathbb {F}_{2<^>{4}}$ . Furthermore, the parameters of the 36 Goppa codes can be readily extended to the entire family of quasihermitian curves, a property that is formally guaranteed by their shared algebraic structure (genus and number of points).

TI Self-injection-locked optical parametric oscillator based on microcombs
SO OPTICA
AB Narrow-linewidth yet tunable laser oscillators are one of the most important tools for precision metrology, optical atomic clocks, sensing, and quantum computing. Commonly used tunable coherent oscillators are based on stimulated emission or stimulated Brillouin scattering; as a result, the operating wavelength band is limited by the gain media. Based on nonlinear optical gain, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) enable coherent signal generation within the whole transparency window of the medium used. However, the demonstration of OPO-based Hertz-level linewidth and tunable oscillators has remained elusive. Here, we present a tunable coherent oscillator based on a multimode coherent OPO in a high-Q microresonator, i.e., a microcomb. Single-mode coherent oscillation is realized through self-injection locking (SIL) of one selected comb line. We achieve coarse tuning up to 20 nm and an intrinsic linewidth down to subHertz level, which is three orders of magnitude lower than the pump. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this scheme results in the repetition rate stabilization of the microcomb. These results open exciting possibilities for generating tunable coherent radiation where stimulated emission materials are difficult to obtain, and the stabilization of microcomb sources beyond the limits imposed by the thermorefractive noise in the cavity.

TI Is the time right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the
   lower urinary tract? ICI-RS 2023
SO NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS
AB IntroductionA session at the 2023 International Consultation on Incontinence - Research Society (ICI-RS) held in Bristol, UK, focused on the question: Is the time right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the lower urinary tract (LUT)? The LUT is a complex system, comprising various synergetic components (i.e., bladder, urethra, neural control), each with its own dynamic functioning and high interindividual variability. This has led to a variety of different types of models for different purposes, each with advantages and disadvantages.MethodsWhen addressing the LUT, the modeling approach should be selected and sized according to the specific purpose, the targeted level of detail, and the available computational resources. Four areas were selected as examples to discuss: utility of nomograms in clinical use, value of fluid mechanical modeling, applications of models to simplify urodynamics, and utility of statistical models.ResultsA brief literature review is provided along with discussion of the merits of different types of models for different applications. Remaining research questions are provided.ConclusionsInadequacies in current (outdated) models of the LUT as well as recent advances in computing power (e.g., quantum computing) and methods (e.g., artificial intelligence/machine learning), would dictate that the answer is an emphatic "Yes, the time is right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the LUT."

TI Resource Allocation Techniques in Aerial-Assisted Vehicular Edge
   Computing: A Review of Recent Progress
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Aerial-assisted vehicular edge computing (AVEC) has emerged as a transformative approach to addressing the limitations of traditional vehicular edge computing (VEC) in dynamic vehicular environments. By integrating platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites, AVEC systems offer enhanced scalability, flexibility, and responsiveness, enabling efficient resource allocation and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of resource allocation techniques in AVEC, addressing both traditional and reinforcement learning-based approaches.

TI Superconducting microwave oscillators as detectors for ESR spectroscopy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Microwave superconducting resonators are extensively studied in fields such as quantum computing and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. However, the integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to create ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the application of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application of microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR spectroscopy, illustrating an alternative way for the improvement of the performance of oscillator based ESR sensors. Specifically, ESR spectra are obtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR effect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are composed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor or high electron mobility transistor coupled with NbTi or YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) superconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies of 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K (for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9 mHz/Hz(1/2) (-139 dBc/Hz), the best spin sensitivity is about 1x10(10) spins/Hz(1/2), and the best concentration sensitivity is about 3x10(18) spins/Hz(1/2)m(3). The approach proposed in this work should allow for significantly better spin and concentration sensitivities compared to those achievable with normal conductors, up to operating frequencies, magnetic fields, and temperatures, where superconductors exhibit substantially lower effective microwave resistance than normal conductors.

TI Photo-enhanced output in memdiode devices based on hybrid materials
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The discovery of photo-enhanced outputs in the fabricated memdiodes based on metal halide-embedded polymeric hybrid composites has meaningful and practical implications. The two-terminal devices exhibit typical rectifying characteristics, similar to a standard pn junction diode, with unusual photo-enhanced charge transportation and hysteresis behaviors. The MDs consist of an active layer of blended organic-inorganic hybrid material [a mixture of CuCl2 and polyethylene glycol (PEG)] deposited on a layer of pure polymer (polymethyl methacrylate) and, in turn, on a rigid substrate (ITO glass or Si wafer). It is found that the photoinduced current increases hundreds of times in magnitude on the ITO glass-substrate sample, much higher than that of the Si-substrate sample. The substrate-dependent photocurrent can be attributed to charge carrier generation by optical absorption correlated with transport paths at different interfaces and variations of working areas by different substrates. The energy bandgaps extrapolated from the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy are at 1.50 and 3.1 eV, consistent with two applied voltages at which the currents jump abruptly under light-on and light-off statuses, respectively. The study of time-dependent resistances displays an exponential decay, a memristive feature, and a long relaxation time between high-resistance and low-resistance. The memdiodes are stable with repeatable working values in a bio-applicable range, assuring that the hybrid materials are excellent candidates for potential applications in biomedical electronic circuits, artificial neuromorphic synapses, and brain-inspired quantum computing.

TI Hyperdoping of Ge/Si and SiGe/Si epitaxial layers by UV-nanosecond laser
   processing
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB Hyperdoping group-IV semiconductors beyond equilibrium solubilities is crucial for advanced applications including nanoelectronics, photonics, plasmonics, and quantum computing. However, this process presents significant challenges due to solubility limits and dopant-defect interaction issues. In this study, we demonstrate that using UV nanosecond pulsed laser melting significantly enhances the phosphorus active concentration in insitu doped Ge/Si and Si0.15Ge0.85/Si layers. In Ge/Si layers we show that, by properly tuning the laser energy density, flat electron concentration depth profiles up to the record value of 2.5 x 1020 cm(-3) over considerable thicknesses of 300 nm are achieved, with 80 % active fraction, excellent surface morphology and optical properties with plasma wavelength down to 3 mu m. Notably, in this extreme hyperdoped regime, electron mobility deviates from previously reported trends and further decreases when the active P fraction drops below 30 %, due to carrier scattering from inactive P clusters. In Si0.15Ge0.85/Si layers, the maximum active concentration is 5 x 1019 cm(-3), with a 40 % active fraction and lower mobilities, consistent with literature data at lower doping levels. These results provide new insight into the electrical and optical properties of Ge and SiGe under hyperdoping conditions and support their potential integration in advanced mid-infrared photonic platforms, where flat, hyperdoped thick layers are essential.

TI First principles study of the electronic structure of the
   Ni2MnIn/InAs and Ti2MnIn/InSb interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB We present a first principles study of the electronic and magnetic properties of epitaxial interfaces between the Heusler compounds, Ti2MnIn and Ni2MnIn, and the III-V semiconductors, InSb and InAs, respectively. We use density functional theory (DFT) with a machine-learned Hubbard U correction determined by Bayesian optimization. We evaluate these interfaces for prospective applications in Majorana-based quantum computing and spintronics. In both interfaces, states from the Heusler penetrate into the gap of the semiconductor, decaying within a few atomic layers. The magnetic interactions at the interface are weak and local in space and energy. Magnetic moments of less than 0.1 mu(B) are induced in the two atomic layers closest to the interface. The induced spin polarization around the Fermi level of the semiconductor decays within a few atomic layers. The decisive factor for the induced spin polarization around the Fermi level of the semiconductor is the spin polarization around the Fermi level in the Heusler, rather than the overall magnetic moment. As a result, the ferrimagnetic narrow-gap semiconductor Ti2MnIn induces a more significant spin polarization in the InSb than the ferromagnetic metal Ni2MnIn induces in the InAs. This is explained by the position of the transition metal d states in the Heusler with respect to the Fermi level. Based on our results, these interfaces are unlikely to be useful for Majorana devices but could be of interest for spintronics.

TI Mathematical Modelling of Quantum Kernel Method for Biomedical Data
   Analysis
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB This study presents a novel method to detect the medical application based on Quantum Computing (QC) and a few Machine Learning (ML) systems. QC has a primary advantage i.e., it uses the impact of quantum parallelism to provide the consequences of prime factorization issue in a matter of seconds. So, this model is suggested for medical application only by recent researchers. A novel strategy i.e., Quantum Kernel Method (QKM) is proposed in this paper for data prediction. In this QKM process, Linear Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (LTSA), the optimization technique is used to calculate the loss function initially and is aimed at medical data. The output of optimization is either 0 or 1 i.e., odd or even in QC. From this output value, the data is identified according to the class. Meanwhile, the method also reduces time, saves cost and improves the efficiency by feature selection process i.e., Filter method. After the features are extracted, QKM is deployed as a classification model, while the loss function is minimized by LTSA. The motivation of the minimal objective is to remain faster. However, some computations can be performed more efficiently by the proposed model. In testing, the test data was evaluated by minimal loss function. The outcomes were assessed in terms of accuracy, computational time, and so on. For this, databases like Lymphography, Dermatology, and Arrhythmia were used.

TI Faceting of Si and Ge crystals grown on deeply patterned Si substrates
   in the kinetic regime: phase-field modelling and experiments
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The development of three-dimensional architectures in semiconductor technology is paving the way to new device concepts for various applications, from quantum computing to single photon avalanche detectors. In most cases, such structures are achievable only under far-from-equilibrium growth conditions. Controlling the shape and morphology of the growing structures, to meet the strict requirements for an application, is far more complex than in close-to-equilibrium cases. The development of predictive simulation tools can be essential to guide the experiments. A versatile phase-field model for kinetic crystal growth is presented and applied to the prototypical case of Ge/Si vertical microcrystals grown on deeply patterned Si substrates. These structures, under development for innovative optoelectronic applications, are characterized by a complex three-dimensional set of facets essentially driven by facet competition. First, the parameters describing the kinetics on the surface of Si and Ge are fitted on a small set of experimental results. To this goal, Si vertical microcrystals have been grown, while for Ge the fitting parameters have been obtained from data from the literature. Once calibrated, the predictive capabilities of the model are demonstrated and exploited for investigating new pattern geometries and crystal morphologies, offering a guideline for the design of new 3D heterostructures. The reported methodology is intended to be a general approach for investigating faceted growth under far-from-equilibrium conditions.

TI Cryogenic Storage Memory with High-Speed, Low-Power, and Long-Retention
   Performance
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Cryogenic-computing draws attention due to its variety of applications such as cloud-computing, aerospace electronics, and quantum computing. Low temperature (e.g., 77 K) enables higher switching speed, improved reliability, and suppressed noise. Although cryogenic dynamic random-access memory is studied, the cryogenic NAND flash is not explored intensively. Herein, a cryogenic storage memory based on the charge-trap mechanism is reported. By removing the tunneling oxide from the conventional silicon/oxide/nitride/oxide/silicon (SONOS)-type flash memory (therefore becoming silicon/oxide/nitride/silicon (SONS)), high-speed and low-power operation is aimed to be achieved while relieved from poor retention issue thanks to the cryogenic environment. The FinFET-structured SONS memory device is demonstrated experimentally with gate length of 20-30 nm, which can achieve the retention issue (>10 years) with low voltage (approximate to 6.5 V) and high speed (approximate to 5 mu s) operation at 77 K. To have a holistic system-level evaluation, benchmark simulation of an interface between a host microprocessor and solid-state-drive is conducted, considering the refrigerator cooling cost and the heat loss via cables across two temperatures (300 and 77 K). The results show that the SONS-type cryogenic storage system shows over 81% improvement in both latency and power, compared to the SONOS counterpart located at cryogenics.

TI Challenges in making blockchain privacy compliant for the digital world:
   some measures
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Due to the pandemic, most of the personal transactions relating to finance, commerce and healthcare services have gone online making privacy preservation a critical requirement. Consequently, privacy has been made a critical parameter in Data Protection Regulations leading to the search for such a privacy compliant system which is also resilient to attacks. A detailed analysis of the Blockchain technology, which is becoming popular for secure applications in the finance sector, indicates that there are several challenges relating to user identity, transaction linkability, crypto-keys management, data privacy, usability, interoperability, and post- quantum compliance of privacy regulations which need to be resolved before its widespread adoption. Being a decentralised system, there is a need to analyse the vulnerability to attacks of each layer in the Blockchain architecture. This paper discusses the development flow of some of the privacy enhancement mechanisms like ZKPs, SMPC, Ring signatures, Mixing, Homomorphic Encryption and quantum resilient computing, bringing out their features and lacunae. There is a detailed discussion of the privacy mechanisms adopted by blockchain platforms like ZCash, Zerocoin, Hyperledger, Wanchain, Coin Party, Monero, Cryptomate, MixCoin, Coinshuffle, PICNIC and New Hope. Every platform has some limitation or the other and it is essential that researchers come out with mitigation steps for the existing mechanisms and come up with improved new Privacy Enhancement Techniques. One such architecture using PET has been proposed.

TI LWE Based Quantum-Resistant Pseudo-Random Number Generator
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In the realm of cryptography, computational statistics, gaming, simulation processes, gambling, and other related fields, the design of Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs) poses a significant challenge. With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, the imminent "quantum-threat" looms closer, posing a risk to our current cryptographically secure PRNGs. Consequently, it becomes crucial to address these threats seriously and develop diverse tools and techniques to ensure that cryptographically secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) remain unbreakable by both classical and quantum computers. this paper presents a novel approach to constructing an effective Quantum-Resistant Pseudo- Random Number Generator (QRPRNG) using the principles of lattice-based Learning with Errors (LWE). LWE is considered quantum- resistant due to its reliance on the hardness of problems like the Shortest Vector Problem and Closest Vector Problem. Our work focuses on developing a QRPRNG that utilizes a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate a stream of pseudo-random bits. To construct a secure seed for the QRPRNG, LWE is employed. The proposed QRPRNG incorporates a secure seed input to the LFSR, and employs a Homomorphic function to protect the security of the finite states within the LFSR. NIST statistical tests are conducted to evaluate the randomness of the generated output by the constructed QRPRNG. The proposed QRPRNG achieves a throughput of 35.172 Mbit/s.

TI Towards Quantum Noise Squeezing for 2-Micron Light with Tellurite and
   Chalcogenide Fibers with Large Kerr Nonlinearity
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Squeezed light-nonclassical multiphoton states with fluctuations in one of the quadrature field components below the vacuum level-has found applications in quantum light spectroscopy, quantum telecommunications, quantum computing, precision quantum metrology, detecting gravitational waves, and biological measurements. At present, quantum noise squeezing with optical fiber systems operating in the range near 1.5 mu m has been mastered relatively well, but there are no fiber sources of nonclassical squeezed light beyond this range. Silica fibers are not suitable for strong noise suppression for 2 mu m continuous-wave (CW) light since their losses dramatically deteriorate the squeezed state of required lengths longer than 100 m. We propose the generation multiphoton states of 2-micron 10-W class CW light with squeezed quantum fluctuations stronger than -15 dB in chalcogenide and tellurite soft glass fibers with large Kerr nonlinearities. Using a realistic theoretical model, we numerically study squeezing for 2-micron light in step-index soft glass fibers by taking into account Kerr nonlinearity, distributed losses, and inelastic light scattering processes. Quantum noise squeezing stronger than -20 dB is numerically attained for a customized As2Se3 fibers with realistic parameters for the optimal fiber lengths shorter than 1 m. For commercial As2S3 and customized tellurite glass fibers, the expected squeezing in the -20--15 dB range can be reached for fiber lengths of the order of 1 m.

TI Experimental demonstration of quantum advantage for NP verification with
   limited information
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In recent years, many computational tasks have been proposed as candidates for showing a quantum computational advantage, that is an advantage in the time needed to perform the task using a quantum instead of a classical machine. Nevertheless, practical demonstrations of such an advantage remain particularly challenging because of the difficulty in bringing together all necessary theoretical and experimental ingredients. Here, we show an experimental demonstration of a quantum computational advantage in a prover-verifier interactive setting, where the computational task consists in the verification of an NP-complete problem by a verifier who only gets limited information about the proof sent by an untrusted prover in the form of a series of unentangled quantum states. We provide a simple linear optical implementation that can perform this verification task efficiently (within a few seconds), while we also provide strong evidence that, fixing the size of the proof, a classical computer would take much longer time (assuming only that it takes exponential time to solve an NP-complete problem). While our computational advantage concerns a specific task in a scenario of mostly theoretical interest, it brings us a step closer to potential useful applications, such as server-client quantum computing. Most demonstrations of quantum advantages with optics rely on single photons, and are thus difficult to scale up. Here, the authors use coherent states to demonstrate a quantum advantage for the task of verifying the solution to a NP-complete problem when only partial information on the solution is available.

TI Quantum-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Spectral Energy Optimization
   in Massive MIMO Hybrid Beamforming for 6G
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB The evolution of 6G wireless networks demands highly efficient beamforming strategies to optimize spectral and energy efficiency in massive MIMO systems. This study introduces a Quantum-Driven Reinforcement Learning (QDRL) framework for Spectral Energy Optimization in Massive MIMO Hybrid Beamforming for 6G, leveraging Quantum Deep Q-Networks (Q-DQN), Quantum Policy Gradient (QPG), and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The framework integrates mruby-based lightweight scripting for efficient deployment in edge-AI environments, enhancing computational flexibility and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the Hybrid Quantum Model achieves 11.21 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, 97% resource utilization efficiency, and reduces energy consumption to 0.50 Joules/bit, outperforming classical models. The Bit Error Rate (BER) is minimized to 0.0025, and the convergence time is 48.7 s, significantly improving computational efficiency. Comparative analysis with conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques shows that the proposed quantum-enhanced model provides a 32% improvement in energy efficiency and a 21% reduction in computational complexity. The integration of mruby enhances the adaptability of the system in low-power and embedded environments, making it a viable solution for real-time 6G hybrid beamforming. This research highlights the transformative potential of quantum-assisted AI frameworks for scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient wireless communication.

TI HIGH TIMING RESOLUTION PULSE WAVEFORM SYNTHESIS BASED ON FEATURE-FITTING
SO METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
AB With the widespread demand for high-precision controllable pulse signals in electronic systems such as communications, radar, and quantum computing, the timing resolution and waveform flexibility adjustment capability of excitation signal sources are more demanding. However, direct digital synthesis (DDS) techniques are limited by timing resolution, while computational synthesis methods are computationally complex and resource-consuming despite higher accuracy. In this paper, an improved DDS pulse waveform synthesis method is proposed, which effectively reduces the storage requirement by storing only the pulse waveform edge samples as feature samples instead of all the samples in the complete waveform period. Meanwhile, combining with the adaptive phase adjustment algorithm, the phase offset value is calculated based on the overflow result of the phase accumulator, and the edge position is adjusted to realize the waveform fitting with higher timing resolution. The feature-fitting scheme streamlines the data storage content while avoiding the complexity of real-time computation, achieving a balance between computational resources and memory usage. The method uses 1 GSPS sampling rate and 1 BRAM to successfully synthesize pulse waveforms with timing resolutions of 100 ps and 10 ps, realizes edge time and amplitude adjustments, and achieves an rms jitter of 10.04 ps. The method provides a feasible solution for high-precision pulse signal synthesis with low storage occupation and provides theoretical and practical support for the realization of high-performance electronic test equipment.

TI Kelvin Probe Characterization of Nanocrystalline Diamond Films with SiV
   Centers as Function of Thickness
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Optically active color centers in diamonds have been intensively studied due to their potential in photonics, energy harvesting, biosensing, and quantum computing. Silicon vacancy (SiV) center offers an advantage of suitable emission wavelength and narrow zero-phonon line at room temperature. Measurement of surface potential and photovoltage can provide better understanding of the physics and control of SiV light emission, such as charge states and charging effects. Herein, optoelectronic properties of nanocrystalline diamond films with SiV centers at different layer thicknesses (10-200 nm, controlled by the growth time) under ambient conditions are studied. Time-dependent measurements are performed in the light-dark-light cycle. Positive photovoltage arises on samples with SiV layer thicknesses below 55 nm on both H- and O-terminated surfaces. Above 55 nm the photovoltage switches to negative. This layer thickness thus represents a halfway boundary between surface-controllable and bulk SiV centers dominant contribution. A band diagram scheme explaining the photovoltage switching mechanism is provided.
   Nanocrystalline diamond films with silicon vacancy (SiV) centers exhibit a change in work function and surface photovoltage including a switch of polarity with the increasing growth thicknesses (5-175 nm) for both H- and O-terminated surfaces. The SiV layer thickness of 32 or 20 nm, respectively, represents a halfway boundary between surface-controllable SiV centers and dominant bulk SiV contribution.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Towards low loss non-volatile phase change materials in mid index
   waveguides
SO NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING
AB Photonic integrated circuits currently use platform intrinsic thermo-optic and electro-optic effects to implement dynamic functions such as switching, modulation and other processing. Currently, there is a drive to implement field programmable photonic circuits, a need which is only magnified by new neuromorphic and quantum computing applications. The most promising non-volatile photonic components employ phase change materials such as GST and GSST, which had their origin in electronic memory. However, in the optical domain, these compounds introduce significant losses potentially preventing a large number of applications. Here, we evaluate the use of two newly introduced low loss phase change materials, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, on a silicon nitride photonic platform for future implementation in neuromorphic computing. We focus the study on Mach-Zehnder interferometers that operate at the O and C bands to demonstrate the performance of the system. Our measurements show an insertion loss below 0.04 dB & mu;m-1 for Sb2S3 and lower than 0.09 dB & mu;m-1 for Sb2Se3 cladded devices for both amorphous and crystalline phases. The effective refractive index contrast for Sb2S3 on SiNx was measured to be 0.05 at 1310 nm and 0.02 at 1550 nm, whereas for Sb2Se3, it was 0.03 at 1310 nm and 0.05 at 1550 nm highlighting the performance of the integrated device.

TI Quantum Security of a Compact Multi-Signature
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB With the rapid advances in quantum computing, quantum security is now an indispensable property for any cryptographic system. In this paper, we study how to prove the security of a complex cryptographic system in the quantum random oracle model. We first give a variant of Zhandry's compressed random oracle (CStO), called a compressed quantum random oracle with adaptive special points (CStOs). Then, we extend the on-line extraction technique of Don et al. (EUROCRYPT'22) from CStO to CStOs. We also extend the random experiment technique of Liu and Zhandry (CRYPTO'19) for extracting the CStO query that witnesses the future adversarial output. With these preparations, a systematic security proof in the quantum random oracle model can start with a random CStO experiment (that extracts the witness for the future adversarial output) and then converts this game to one involving CStOs. Next, the online extraction technique for CStOs can be applied to extract the witness for any online commitment. With this strategy, we give a security proof of our recent compact multi-signature framework that is converted from any weakly secure linear ID scheme. We also prove the quantum security of our recent lattice realization of this linear ID scheme by iteratively applying the weakly collapsing protocol technique of Liu and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019). Combining these two results, we obtain the first quantum security proof for a compact multi-signature.

TI Three Strategies for Improving Shortest Vector Enumeration Using GPUs
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB Hard Lattice problems are assumed to be one of the most promising problems for generating cryptosystems that are secure in quantum computing. The shortest vector problem (SVP) is one of the most famous lattice problems. In this paper, we present three improvements on GPU-based parallel algorithms for solving SVP using the classical enumeration and pruned enumeration. There are two improvements for preprocessing: we use a combination of randomization and the Gaussian heuristic to expect a better basis that leads rapidly to a shortest vector and we expect the level on which the exchanging data between CPU and GPU is optimized. In the third improvement, we improve GPU-based implementation by generating some points in GPU rather than in CPU. We used NVIDIA GeForce GPUs of type GTX 1060 6G. We achieved a significant improvement upon Hermans's improvement. The improvements speed up the pruned enumeration by a factor of almost 2.5 using a single GPU. Additionally, we provided an implementation for multi-GPUs by using two GPUs. The results showed that our algorithm of enumeration is scalable since the speedups achieved using two GPUs are almost faster than Hermans's improvement by a factor of almost 5. The improvements also provided a high speedup for the classical enumeration. The speedup achieved using our improvements and two GPUs on a challenge of dimension 60 is almost faster by factor 2 than Correia's parallel implementation using a dual-socket machine with 16 physical cores and simultaneous multithreading technology.

TI Localized creation of yellow single photon emitting carbon complexes in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Single photon emitters in solid-state crystals have received a lot of attention as building blocks for numerous quantum technology applications. Fluorescent defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) stand out due to their high luminosity and robust operation at room temperature. The identical emitter fabrication at pre-defined sites is still challenging, which hampers the integration of these defects in optical systems and electro-optical devices. Here, we demonstrate the localized fabrication of hBN emitter arrays by electron beam irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope with deep sub-micron lateral precision. The emitters are created with a high yield and a reproducible spectrum peaking at 575 nm. Our measurements of optically detected magnetic resonance have not revealed any addressable spin states. Using density functional theory, we attribute the experimentally observed emission lines to carbon-related defects, which are activated by the electron beam. Our scalable approach provides a promising pathway for fabricating room temperature single photon emitters in integrated quantum devices.

TI Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 for Analog
   Memory and In-Memory Computing Applications Down to Deep Cryogenic
   Temperatures
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Low-power nonvolatile memories operating down to deep cryogenic temperatures are important for a large spectrum of applications from high-performance computing, electronics interfacing quantum computing hardware to space-based electronics. Despite the potential of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO), thanks to its compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line processing, only few studies of HZO-based memory devices down to cryogenic operation temperatures exist. Here, analog ferroelectric memory stack fabrication with 10 nm HZO and their detailed characterization under wide range of pulse amplitudes and frequencies down to 4 K are reported. When operated at temperatures below 100 K, HZO devices can support high amplitude voltage pulses, yielding record high P-r of up to 75 mu C cm(-2) at +/- 7 V-p (14 V-pp) pulse amplitudes accompanied with frequency-dependent memory window between 6 and 8 V. Devices show excellent endurance exceeding 10(9) cycles of +/- 5 V-p (10 V-pp) and P-r of 30 mu C cm(-2) without significant degradation of coercive voltages or loss of polarization at cryogenic temperatures. At least 20 reproducible analog states for temperatures below 100 K with almost ideal linearity of intermediate polarization states in both pulse directions is observed, demonstrating the high potential of analog cryogenic ferroelectric memories, essential for on-line training in in-memory-computing architecture.

TI Interplay between microstructure, defect states, and mobile charge
   generation in transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunctions
SO NANOSCALE
AB Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDCs) have gained attention for their promise in next-generation energy-harvesting and quantum computing technologies, but realizing these technologies requires a greater understanding of TMDC properties that influence their photophysics. To this end, we discuss here the interplay between TMDC microstructure and defects with the charge generation yield, lifetime, and mobility. As a model system, we compare monolayer-only and monolayer-rich MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition, and we employ the TMDCs in Type-II charge-separating heterojunctions with semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs). Our results suggest longer lifetimes and higher yields of mobile carriers in samples containing a small fraction of defect-rich multilayer islands on predominately monolayer MoS2. Compared to the monolayer-only heterojunctions, the carrier lifetimes increase from 0.73 mu s to 4.71 mu s, the hole transfer yield increases from 23% to 34%, and the electron transfer yield increases from 39% to 59%. We reach these conclusions using a unique combination of microwave photoconductivity (which probes only mobile carriers) along with transient absorption spectroscopy (which identifies spectral signatures unique to each material and type of photoexcited quasiparticle, but does not probe mobility). Our results highlight the substantial changes in photophysics that can occur from small changes in TMDC microstructure and defect density, where the presence of defects does not necessarily preclude improvements in charge generation.

TI Atomic Line Defects and Topological Superconductivity in Unconventional
   Superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Topological superconductors (TSCs) are correlated quantum states with simultaneous off-diagonal longrange order and nontrivial topological invariants. They produce gapless or zero-energy boundary excitations, including Majorana zero modes and chiral Majorana edge states with topologically protected phase coherence essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Candidate TSCs are very rare in nature. Here, we propose a novel route toward emergent quasi-one-dimensional (1D) TSCs in naturally embedded quantum structures such as atomic line defects in unconventional spin-singlet s-wave and d-wave superconductors. We show that inversion symmetry breaking and charge transfer due to the missing atoms lead to the occupation of incipient impurity bands and mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet Cooper pairing of neighboring electrons traversing the line defect. Nontrivial topological invariants arise and occupy a large part of the parameter space, including the time-reversal symmetry-breaking Zeeman coupling due to applied magnetic field or defect-induced magnetism, creating TSCs in different topological classes with robust Majorana zero modes at both ends of the line defect. Beyond providing a novel mechanism for the recent discovery of zero-energy bound states at both ends of an atomic line defect in monolayer Fe(Te,Se) superconductors, the findings pave the way for new material realizations of the simplest and most robust 1D TSCs using embedded quantum structures in unconventional superconductors with large pairing energy gaps and high transition temperatures.

TI Influence of phonon harmonicity on spectrally pure resonant Stokes
   fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB (Received 2022; accepted July 2022; published August 2022) Due to their highly coherent emission, tunability, and compactness, integrated single-frequency diamond Raman lasers are interesting tools for applications in integrated quantum technology, high-resolution spec-troscopy, or coherent optical communications. While the fundamental emission linewidth of these lasers can be Fourier limited, their thermo-optic characteristics lead to drifts in their carrier frequency, posing important challenges for applications requiring ultrastable emission. We propose here a method for measuring accurately the temperature-dependent index of refraction of diamond by employing standing Stokes waves produced in a monolithic Fabry-P??rot diamond Raman resonator. Our approach takes into account the influence of temperature on the first-order phonon line and the average lattice phonon frequency under intense stimulated Raman scattering conditions. We further utilize this model to calculate the value of the average phonon frequency and then the temperature-dependent thermo-optic coefficient. The theory is accompanied by the demonstration of tunable Fourier-limited Stokes nanosecond pulses with a stabilized center frequency deviation of less than 4 MHz.

TI Capturing the spectrotemporal structure of a biphoton wave packet with
   delay-line-anode single-photon imagers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Distinguishing photon arrival time and position is crucial for advancing quantum technology. However, capturing spatial and temporal information efficiently remains challenging. Here, we present a novel photon detection technique to achieve a significantly more efficient measurement of frequency-entangled biphoton than conventional photon detectors. We utilize a delay-line-anode single-photon detector (DLD), which consists of a position-sensitive delay-line anode sensor behind a microchannel plate. Biphotons are obtained from the decay of biexcitons in the copper chloride semiconductor crystal. Two DLDs are coupled with a grating spectrometer exit to measure the joint spectral distributions of the biphoton. The resulting non-scanning process requires only a few minutes to obtain a temporally and spectrally resolved image, much quicker than the scanning biphoton frequency measurements such as monochromator or Fourier spectroscopy. Our technique paves the way for all experiments in multi-mode quantum science requiring coincidence measurement.

TI Ultra-High Vacuum Cells Realized by Miniature Ion Pump Using
   High-Efficiency Plasma Source
SO SENSORS
AB In recent years, there has been significant interest in quantum technology, characterized by the emergence of quantum computers boasting immense processing power, ultra-sensitive quantum sensors, and ultra-precise atomic clocks. Miniaturization of quantum devices using cold atoms necessitates the employment of an ultra-high vacuum miniature cell with a pressure of approximately 10-6 Pa or even lower. In this study, we developed an ultra-high vacuum cell realized by a miniature ion pump using a high-efficiency plasma source. Initially, an unsealed miniature ion pump was introduced into a vacuum chamber, after which the ion pump's discharge current, depending on vacuum pressures, was evaluated. Subsequently, a miniature vacuum cell was fabricated by hermetically sealing the miniature vacuum pump. The cell was successfully evacuated by a miniature ion pump down to an ultra-high vacuum region, which was derived by the measured discharge current. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving an ultra-high vacuum cell necessary for the operation of miniature quantum devices.

TI Schrödinger Cat States in Giant Negative Magnetoresistance of 2D
   Electron Systems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We investigate the effect of giant negative magnetoresistance in ultrahigh-mobility (mu >> 107cm2V-1s-1) two-dimensional electron systems. These systems present a dramatic drop in the mangetoresistance at low magnetic fields (B similar to 0.1 T) and temperatures (T similar to 0.1 K). This effect is reversed by increasing the temperature or the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. The motivation for the present work is to develop a microscopical model to explain the experimental evidence, based on coherent states and Schr & oacute;dinger cat states of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Thus, we approach the giant negative magnetoresistance effect based on the description of ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron systems in terms of Schr & ouml;dinger cat states (superposition of coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator). We explain the experimental results in terms of the increasing disorder in the sample due to the rising temperature or the in-plane magnetic field, breaking up the Schr & ouml;dinger cat states and giving rise to mere coherent states, which hold magnetoresistance in lower-mobility samples. The latter, jointly with the description of ultrahigh-mobility samples with Schr & ouml;dinger cat states, accounts for the main contribution. The most interesting application of this novel description of such systems would be in the implementation of qubits for quantum computing based on bosonic models.

TI Multistate Density Functional Theory: Theory, Methods, and Applications
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE
AB A quantum theory of density functionals and its applications is presented. By introducing a matrix density D(r) of rank N as the fundamental variable, a one-to-one correspondence has been established between D(r) and the Hamiltonian matrix representing N electronic states-that is, a matrix density functional H[D]. Moreover, no more than N-2 Slater determinants are sufficient to represent D(r) exactly, giving rise to the concept of minimal active space (MAS). The use of a MAS naturally leads to the defini-tion of correlation matrix functional epsilon(c)[D], the multi-state extension of the exchange-correlation functional in Kohn-Sham DFT. Variational minimization of the multistate energy, which is defined as the trace of the Hamiltonian matrix functional, yields the exact energies and densities of the lowest N eigenstates. A nonorthogonal state interaction (NOSI) algorithm has been developed to optimize the orbitals associated with D(r) and to approximate the correlation matrix functional. The MSDFT-NOSI method is demonstrated across a range of applications, particularly in cases where KS-DFT and linear-response time-dependent DFT fail, with its accuracy validated through comparison with high-level multiconfigurational wave function theory.

TI A new approach for efficient nonequilibrium quantum transport
   computation in electroluminescent quantum dots
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION
AB The investigation of quantum dots, semiconductor structures renowned for their unique electronic and optical properties, has attracted considerable interest due to their diverse applications, spanning photovoltaics, optical communication, and quantum computing. However, the complex nature of multi-layered quantum dots, combined with their non-equilibrium behavior, presents a significant challenge in accurately describing their electronic properties. In response to this challenge, the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function method (NEGF) has emerged as a leading theoretical framework for studying electronic behavior in quantum devices, providing a robust approach to understanding non-equilibrium transport phenomena. While the NEGF method offers powerful insights into electronic transport in nanostructures, its computational requirements can be formidable, especially for large three-dimensional and complex geometries. This paper explores the application of the three-dimensional NEGF method to analyze multi-layered quantum dots, focusing on the complexities involved in simulating their electronic behavior. We propose a novel approach using low-rank approximation and pseudoinverse techniques to efficiently compute the nonequilibrium electron density matrix. This method relies on the block structure of the self-energy matrices and reduces the calculation time by a factor of 60 or more, while maintaining similar accuracy, as confirmed by the numerical results. We further discuss several strategies for handling these computational challenges, offering valuable insights into speeding up three-dimensional NEGF calculations.

TI DEVELOP A HYBRID IMPROVED WEIGHTED QUANTUM WOLF OPTIMIZATION AND FAST
   MASK RECURRENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TOENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF
   PHISHING MALICIOUS VIDEO DETECTION
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB Phishing attacks have evolved to exploit video content, presenting new challenges for detection systems. A hybrid improved weighted quantum wolf optimization (IWQWO) algorithm with fast mask recurrent convolution neural network (FMRCNN) is proposed, enhancing the detection performance of malicious phishing videos. The IWQWO optimizes feature selection and model parameters, leveraging the principles of quantum computing and the hunting behavior of wolves to effectively explore the search space and avoid local optima. It improves the quality of the features used by the neural network, enhancing its detection capabilities. The FMRCNN is designed to process video data, integrating spatial and temporal feature extraction. Recurrent layers capture temporal dependencies, convolutional layers extract spatial features, and mask layers focus on the most relevant parts of the data, reducing noise and irrelevant information. The proposed IWQWO-FMRCNN model is capable of accurately identifying malicious phishing videos with high detection rates and low false positives. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to new phishing techniques. This hybrid model offers a significant advancement in cybersecurity, providing an effective tool for early detection and prevention of phishing attacks, thereby safeguarding users and digital infrastructure.

TI Role of a capping layer on the crystalline structure of Sn thin films
   grown at cryogenic temperatures on InSb substrates
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Metal deposition with cryogenic cooling is a common technique in the condensed matter community for producing ultra-thin epitaxial superconducting layers on semiconductors. However, a significant challenge arises when these films return to room temperature, as they tend to undergo dewetting. This issue can be mitigated by capping the films with an amorphous layer. In this study, we investigate the influence of different in situ fabricated caps on the structural characteristics of Sn thin films deposited at 80 K on InSb substrates. Regardless of the type of capping, we consistently observe that the films remain smooth upon returning to room temperature and exhibit epitaxy on InSb in the cubic Sn (alpha-Sn) phase. Notably, we identify a correlation between alumina capping using an electron beam evaporator and an increased presence of tetragonal Sn (beta-Sn) grains. This suggests that heating from the alumina source may induce a partial phase transition in the Sn layer. The existence of the beta-Sn phase induces superconducting behavior of the films by percolation effect. This study highlights the potential for tailoring the structural properties of cryogenic Sn thin films through in situ capping. This development opens avenues for precise control in the production of superconducting Sn films, facilitating their integration into quantum computing platforms.

TI Deciding finiteness of bosonic dynamics with tunable interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We are motivated by factorization of bosonic quantum dynamics and we study the corresponding Lie algebras, which can potentially be infinite dimensional. To characterize such factorization, we identify conditions for these Lie algebras to be finite dimensional. We consider cases where each free Hamiltonian term is itself an element of the generated Lie algebra. In our approach, we develop new tools to systematically divide skew-hermitian bosonic operators into appropriate subspaces, and construct specific sequences of skew-hermitian operators that are used to gauge the dimensionality of the Lie algebras themselves. The significance of our result relies on conditions that constrain only the independently controlled generators in a particular Hamiltonian, thereby providing an effective algorithm for verifying the finiteness of the generated Lie algebra. In addition, our results are tightly connected to mathematical work where the polynomials of creation and annihilation operators are known as the Weyl algebra. Our work paves the way for better understanding factorization of bosonic dynamics relevant to quantum control and quantum technology.

TI Selection rules in the excitation of the divacancy and the
   nitrogen-vacancy pair in 4 H- and 6 H-SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this study, we address selection rules with respect to the polarization of the optical excitation of two color centers in 4 H -SiC and 6 H -SiC with potential for applications in quantum technology, the divacancy and the nitrogen -vacancy pair. We show that the photoluminescence of the axial configurations of higher symmetry ( C 3 v ) than the basal ones ( C 1 h ) can be canceled using any excitation (resonant or nonresonant) with polarization parallel to the crystal axis ( E L || c ). The polarization selection rules are determined using group -theoretical analysis and simple physical arguments showing that phonon -assisted absorption with E L || c is prohibited despite being formally allowed by group theory. A comparison with the selection rules for the silicon vacancy, another defect with C 3 v symmetry, is also carried out. Using the selection rules, we demonstrate selective excitation of only one basal divacancy configuration in 4 H -SiC, the PL3 line, and discuss the higher contrast and increased Debye-Waller factor in the selectively excited spectrum.

TI Harnessing micro-Fabry-Pérot reference cavities in photonic integrated
   circuits
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Compact photonic systems that offer high frequency stability and low noise are of increasing importance to applications in precision metrology, quantum computing, communication and advanced sensing technologies. However, on-chip resonators comprising dielectrics cannot match the frequency stability and noise characteristics of Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavities, whose electromagnetic modes live almost entirely in vacuum. Here we present a novel strategy to interface microfabricated Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavities with photonic integrated circuits to realize compact, high-performance integrated systems. Using this new integration approach, we demonstrate the self-injection locking of an on-chip laser to a millimetre-scale vacuum-gap Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity using a circuit interface that transforms the reflected cavity response to enable efficient feedback to the laser. This system achieves a phase noise of -97 dBc Hz-1 at 10-kHz offset frequency, a fractional frequency stability of 5 x 10-13 at 10 ms, a 150-Hz 1/pi integral linewidth and a 35-mHz fundamental linewidth. We also present a complementary integration strategy that utilizes a vertical-emission grating coupler and a back-reflection cancellation circuit to realize a fully co-integrated module that effectively redirects the reflected signals and isolates back-reflections with a 10-dB suppression ratio, serving as a key for on-chip Pound-Drever-Hall locking. Together, these results highlight how vacuum-gap Fabry-P & eacute;rot reference cavities can be harnessed for ultrastable, low-noise photonic systems.

TI Cybersecurity threats and mitigation measures in agriculture 4.0 and 5.0
SO SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
AB The primary aim of this study was to explore cybersecurity threats in agriculture 4.0 and 5.0, as well as possible mitigation strategies. A secondary method was employed involving narrative review in which many studies on cybersecurity were sampled and analyzed. The study showed that the main risks that increase cybersecurity threats to agricultural organizations include poor cybersecurity practices, lack of regulations and policies on cybersecurity, and outdated IT software. Moreover, the review indicated that the main cybersecurity threat in agriculture 4.0 and 5.0 involves denial of service attacks that target servers and disrupt the functioning of relevant smart technologies, including equipment for livestock tracking, climate monitoring, logistics and warehousing, and crop monitoring. The analysis also revealed that malware attacks occur when hackers change the code of a system application to access sensitive farm-related data and may alter the operations of the digitized systems. Some of the impacts of cybersecurity breaches were noted to include data loss, reduced efficiency of digitized systems, and reduced food security. A crucial mitigation strategy against cybersecurity threats includes using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing to improve malware detection in Internet of Things (IoT) digital equipment and ensure faster response to any threats. The other mitigation measures include training employees on best cybersecurity practices and creating guidelines and regulatory standards on best cybersecurity practices.

TI QASMBench: A Low-LevelQuantum Benchmark Suite for NISQ Evaluation and
   Simulation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The rapid development of quantum computing (QC) in the NISQ era urgently demands a low-level benchmark suite and insightful evaluation metrics for characterizing the properties of prototype NISQ devices, the efficiency of QC programming compilers, schedulers and assemblers, and the capability of quantum system simulators in a classical computer. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a low-level, easy-to-use benchmark suite called QASMBench based on the OpenQASM assembly representation. It consolidates commonly used quantum routines and kernels from a variety of domains including chemistry, simulation, linear algebra, searching, optimization, arithmetic, machine learning, fault tolerance, cryptography, and so on, trading-off between generality and usability. To analyze these kernels in terms of NISQ device execution, in addition to circuit width and depth, we propose four circuit metrics including gate density, retention lifespan, measurement density, and entanglement variance, to extract more insights about the execution efficiency, the susceptibility to NISQ error, and the potential gain from machine-specific optimizations. Applications in QASMBench can be launched and verified on several NISQ platforms, including IBM-Q, Rigetti, IonQ and Quantinuum. For evaluation, we measure the execution fidelity of a subset of QASMBench applications on 12 IBM-Q machines through density matrix state tomography, comprising 25K circuit evaluations. We also compare the fidelity of executions among the IBM-Q machines, the IonQ QPU and the Rigetti Aspen M-1 system. QASMBench is released at: http://github.com/pnnl/QASMBench.

AB Digital signature is an essential primitive in cryptography, which can be used as the digital analogue of handwritten signatures but also as a building block for more complex systems. In the latter case, signatures with specific features are needed, so as to smoothly interact with the other components of the systems, such as zero-knowledge proofs. This has given rise to so-called signatures with efficient protocols, a versatile tool that has been used in countless applications. Designing such signatures is however quite difficult, in particular if one wishes to withstand quantum computing. We are indeed aware of only one post-quantum construction, proposed by Libert et al. at Asiacrypt'16, yielding very large signatures and proofs.
   In this paper, we propose a new construction that can be instantiated in both standard lattices and structured ones, resulting in each case in dramatic performance improvements. In particular, the size of a proof of message-signature possession, which is one of the main metrics for such schemes, can be brought down to less than 650 KB. As our construction retains all the features expected from signatures with efficient protocols, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in all systems using them, which mechanically improves their own performance, and has thus a direct impact on many applications. It can also be used to easily design new privacy-preserving mechanisms. As an example, we provide the first lattice-based anonymous credentials system.

TI Spin Pumping in Epitaxial Ge1-xSnx Alloys
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The use of Ge1-xSnx semiconductor alloys is generating significant interest in the scientific community due to their precisely tunable Sn content. This tunability makes them particularly attractive for applications in photonics, electronics, and, more recently, spintronics. Room-temperature emission and detection of spin currents are observed in Ge1-xSnx/Co hybrids through spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance. Experiments conducted over a wide range of compositions and strains show that spin current injection is enhanced in Ge1-xSnx solid solutions compared to elemental Ge. The magnetization dynamics reveal an intriguing scenario where the Gilbert damping constant and the spin mixing conductance display a non-monotonic behavior. The maximum spin-pumping efficiency occurs at a Sn molar fraction of approximate to 10 at.% and remains unaffected by the elastic strain built up in Ge1-xSnx films through epitaxial growth on Ge-buffered Si substrates. These findings highlight the non-trivial dependence of alloy scattering in defining spin accumulation and relaxation mechanisms, providing insightful information on phenomena at the forefront of spintronics and quantum technology research.

TI Tuning the Mode Splitting of a Semiconductor Microcavity with Uniaxial
   Stress
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A splitting of the fundamental optical modes in micro- and nanocavities comprising semiconductor heterostructures is commonly observed. Given that this splitting plays a role in light-matter interaction and hence quantum technology applications, a method for controlling the mode splitting is useful. In this work we use an open microcavity composed of a "bottom" semiconductor distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) incorporating a n-i-p heterostructure, paired with a "top" curved dielectric DBR. We measure the mode splitting as a function of wavelength across the stopband. We demonstrate a reversible in situ technique to tune the mode splitting by applying uniaxial stress to the semiconductor DBR. The method exploits the photoelastic effect of the semiconductor materials. We achieve a maximum tuning of approximately 11 GHz. The stress applied to the heterostructure is determined by observing the photoluminescence of quantum dots embedded in the sample, converting a spectral shift to a stress via deformation potentials. A thorough study of the mode splitting and its tuning across the stopband leads to a quantitative understanding of the mechanism behind the results.

TI Tunable magnetless optical isolation with twisted Weyl semimetals
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Weyl semimetals hold great promise in revolutionizing nonreciprocal optical components due to their unique topological properties. By exhibiting nonreciprocal magneto-optical effects without necessitating an external magnetic field, these materials offer remarkable miniaturization opportunities and reduced energy consumption. However, their intrinsic topological robustness poses a challenge for applications demanding tunability. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance the tunability of their response, utilizing multilayered configurations of twisted anisotropic Weyl semimetals. Our design enables controlled and reversible isolation by adjusting the twist angle between the anisotropic layers. When implemented in the Faraday geometry within the mid-IR frequency range, our design delivers impressive isolation, exceeding 50 dB, while maintaining a minimal insertion loss of just 0.33 dB. Moreover, the in-plane anisotropy of Weyl semimetals eliminates one or both polarizers of conventional isolator geometry, significantly reducing the overall dimensions. These results set the stage for creating highly adaptable, ultra-compact optical isolators that can propel the fields of integrated photonics and quantum technology applications to new heights.

TI Few-mode field quantization for multiple emitters
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The control of the interaction between quantum emitters using nanophotonic structures holds great promise for quantum technology applications, while its theoretical description for complex nanostructures is a highly demanding task as the electromagnetic (EM) modes form a high-dimensional continuum. We here introduce an approach that permits a quantized description of the full EM field through a small number of discrete modes. This extends the previous work in ref. (I. Medina, F. J. Garcia-Vidal, A. I. Fernandez-Dominguez, and J. Feist, "Few-mode field quantization of arbitrary electromagnetic spectral densities," Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 126, p. 093601, 2021) to the case of an arbitrary number of emitters, without any restrictions on the emitter level structure or dipole operators. The low computational demand of this method makes it suitable for studying dynamics for a wide range of parameters. We illustrate the power of our approach for a system of three emitters placed within a hybrid metallodielectric photonic structure and show that excitation transfer is highly sensitive to the properties of the hybrid photonic-plasmonic modes.

TI Stroboscopic high-order nonlinearity for quantum optomechanics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-order quantum nonlinearity is an important prerequisite for the advanced quantum technology leading to universal quantum processing with large information capacity of continuous variables. Levitated optomechanics, a field where motion of dielectric particles is driven by precisely controlled tweezer beams, is capable of attaining the required nonlinearity via engineered potential landscapes of mechanical motion. Importantly, to achieve nonlinear quantum effects, the evolution caused by the free motion of mechanics and thermal decoherence have to be suppressed. For this purpose, we devise a method of stroboscopic application of a highly nonlinear potential to a mechanical oscillator that leads to the motional quantum non-Gaussian states exhibiting nonclassical negative Wigner function and squeezing of a nonlinear combination of mechanical quadratures. We test the method numerically by analyzing highly instable cubic potential with relevant experimental parameters of the levitated optomechanics, prove its feasibility within reach, and propose an experimental test. The method paves a road for experiments instantaneously transforming a ground state of mechanical oscillators to applicable nonclassical states by nonlinear optical force.

TI Optimizing Motion in Nanoscale Robotics: A Hybrid WQPSO-Fuzzy Logic
   Approach for Dynamic Path Planning
SO STUDIES IN INFORMATICS AND CONTROL
AB Path planning is crucial for robotics, particularly in navigating dynamic environments with moving obstacles, a challenge that remains only partially addressed in the existing literature. This study aims to improve the movement of nanorobots by tackling the challenges related to the planning of the optimal routes for navigating the common paths used in factory settings. The analyzed model sets important control settings and employs advanced control systems, like an optimal linear quadratic regulator and a well-damped lead-lag controller, to ensure the nanorobot's precise positioning. The proposed system integrates a unique kind of particle swarm optimization, specifically the hybrid weighted quantum particle swarm optimization (WQPSO) with fuzzy logic to enhance the nanorobot motion control and optimize the route planning in uncertain conditions. By leveraging the principles of quantum computing, particle swarm optimization, and fuzzy logic, the aim of this paper is to boost the efficiency and adaptability of path planning algorithms. The results of the rigorous experiments which were carried out demonstrate the hybrid method's effectiveness in enabling nanoscale robots to navigate in environments with complex and randomly occurring obstacles. This paper shows that using the hybrid WQPSO and fuzzy logic can help control the movement of nanorobots accurately, which leads to an important progress in their ability to move autonomously at the nanoscale.

TI Post-Quantum Secure Identity-Based Signature Scheme with Lattice
   Assumption for Internet of Things Networks
SO SENSORS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) plays an essential role in people's daily lives, such as healthcare, home, traffic, industry, and so on. With the increase in IoT devices, there emerge many security issues of data loss, privacy leakage, and information temper in IoT network applications. Even with the development of quantum computing, most current information systems are weak to quantum attacks with traditional cryptographic algorithms. This paper first establishes a general security model for these IoT network applications, which comprises the blockchain and a post-quantum secure identity-based signature (PQ-IDS) scheme. This model divides these IoT networks into three layers: perceptual, network, and application, which can protect data security and user privacy in the whole data-sharing process. The proposed PQ-IDS scheme is based on lattice cryptography. Bimodal Gaussian distribution and the discrete Gaussian sample algorithm are applied to construct the fundamental difficulty problem of lattice assumption. This assumption can help resist the quantum attack for information exchange among IoT devices. Meanwhile, the signature mechanism with IoT devices' identity can guarantee non-repudiation of information signatures. Then, the security proof shows that the proposed PQ-IDS can obtain the security properties of unforgeability, non-repudiation, and non-transferability. The efficiency comparisons and performance evaluations show that the proposed PQ-IDS has good efficiency and practice in IoT network applications.

TI Error Correction and Adaptation in Conversational AI: A Review of
   Techniques and Applications in Chatbots
SO AI
AB This study explores the progress of chatbot technology, focusing on the aspect of error correction to enhance these smart conversational tools. Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly prevalent across industries such as customer service, healthcare, e-commerce, and education. Despite their use and increasing complexity, chatbots are prone to errors like misunderstandings, inappropriate responses, and factual inaccuracies. These issues can have an impact on user satisfaction and trust. This research provides an overview of chatbots, conducts an analysis of errors they encounter, and examines different approaches to rectifying these errors. These approaches include using data-driven feedback loops, involving humans in the learning process, and adjusting through learning methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning. Through real life examples and case studies in different fields, we explore how these strategies are implemented. Looking ahead, we explore the different challenges faced by AI-powered chatbots, including ethical considerations and biases during implementation. Furthermore, we explore the transformative potential of new technological advancements, such as explainable AI models, autonomous content generation algorithms (e.g., generative adversarial networks), and quantum computing to enhance chatbot training. Our research provides information for developers and researchers looking to improve chatbot capabilities, which can be applied in service and support industries to effectively address user requirements.

TI Probabilistic Interpolation of Quantum Rotation Angles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum computing requires a universal set of gate operations; regarding gates as rotations, any rotation angle must be possible. However a real device may only be capable of B bits of resolution, i.e., it might support only 2B possible variants of a given physical gate. Naive discretization of an algorithm's gates to the nearest available options causes coherent errors, while decomposing an impermissible gate into several allowed operations increases circuit depth. Conversely, demanding higher B can greatly complexify hardware. Here, we explore an alternative: probabilistic angle interpolation (PAI). This effectively implements any desired, continuously parametrized rotation by randomly choosing one of three discretized gate settings and postprocessing individual circuit outputs. The approach is particularly relevant for nearterm applications where one would in any case average over many runs of circuit executions to estimate expected values. While PAI increases that sampling cost, we prove that (a) the approach is optimal in the sense that PAI achieves the least possible overhead and (b) the overhead is remarkably modest even with thousands of parametrized gates and only seven bits of resolution available. This is a profound relaxation of engineering requirements for first generation quantum computers where even 5-6 bits of resolution may suffice and, as we demonstrate, the approach is many orders of magnitude more efficient than prior techniques. Moreover we conclude that, even for more mature late noisy intermediate-scale quantum era hardware, no more than nine bits will be necessary.

TI A Flexible and Parallel Hardware Accelerator for Forward and Inverse
   Number Theoretic Transform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper demonstrates an efficient and flexible hardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication using number theoretic transform (NTT). The proposed architecture considers flexibility and performance requirements at the same time. Flexibility is achieved by computing the following three operations: (i) computing only the forward NTT operation using a Cooley-Tukey butterfly unit (CT-BFU), (ii) computing only the inverse NTT operation using a Gentleman-Sande butterfly unit (GS-BFU), and (iii) computing both forward and inverse NTT operations simultaneously. The performance is enhanced by supporting parallelism between one CT-BFU unit, one GS-BFU unit, and four Block-RAMs. Moreover, a dedicated control unit is implemented to ensure a flexible and parallel FP-NTT design. A throughput/area metric is used for evaluation of performance for the proposed design. The implementation results are presented after post-placement and route on various Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. Specifically, on Virtex-7 FPGA, FP-NTT operates at a frequency of 250MHz, utilising 1026 slices, and requires 4.61 mu s and 5.12 mu s for forward and inverse NTT computations, respectively. The calculated throughput/area is 211.41 and 190.36 for forward and inverse computations, respectively. A comparison with state-of-the-art designs emphasises the suitability of the FP-NTT accelerator for high-speed cryptographic applications.

TI Secure Multifactor Remote Access User Authentication Framework for IoT
   Networks
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The term IoT refers to the interconnection and exchange of data among devices/sensors. IoT devices are often small, low cost, and have limited resources. The IoT issues and challenges are growing increasingly. Security and privacy issues are among the most important concerns in IoT applications, such as smart buildings. Remote cybersecurity attacks are the attacks which do not require physical access to the IoT networks, where the attacker can remotely access and communicate with the IoT devices through a wireless communication channel. Thus, remote cybersecurity attacks are a significant threat. Emerging applications in smart environments such as smart buildings require remote access for both users and resources. Since the user/building communication channel is insecure, a lightweight and secure authentication protocol is required. In this paper, we propose a new secure remote user mutual authentication protocol based on transitory identities and multi-factor authentication for IoT smart building environment. The protocol ensures that only legitimate users can authenticate with smart building controllers in an anonymous, unlinkable, and untraceable manner. The protocol also avoids clock synchronization problem and can resist quantum computing attacks. The security of the protocol is evaluated using two different methods: (1) informal analysis; (2) model check using the automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) toolkit. The communication overhead and computational cost of the proposed are analyzed. The security and performance analysis show that our protocol is secure and efficient.

TI Energy-Efficient and Area-Optimized Reversible Carry Select Adder
SO IET CIRCUITS DEVICES & SYSTEMS
AB The carry select adder (CSA) is a highly efficient arithmetic component commonly utilized in digital systems due to its superior speed performance. In the context of energy-efficient computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing, reversible logic emerges as a critical technology owing to its potential to reduce energy dissipation by retaining information. This article introduces an efficient design for a reversible carry select adder (ERCSA), constructed using fundamental lossless logic gates such as modified TSG (MTSG), Peres, and Fredkin Gate (FRG). The proposed design eliminates the need to compute the carry for the default carry input of "1." Additionally, an optimized architecture is proposed to reduce the quantum cost of the circuit. The design achieves significant improvements by minimizing quantum cost, unused outputs, and gate count, while ensuring scalability for higher bit-width additions. A comparative analysis with existing reversible adder highlights substantial performance enhancements, including reduction in the number of gates (35.4%), garbage outputs (18.9%), ancillary inputs (25%), quantum cost (22.7%), and delay (29.5%) compared to recent designs. The proposed architecture was modeled in Verilog and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado Design Suite targeting the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA family. The proposed 16-bit ERCA architecture achieves 10.86% lower power, 76.43% reduced delay, and 21.7% better area efficiency compared to existing methods. These improvements make it highly suitable for low-power and high-speed VLSI applications.

TI Growth of Sb 2 Te 3 thin films on Ge(111) sample by thermal deposition:
   Morphological and electronic properties
SO PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES
AB Sb 2 Te 3 is a well-known thermoelectric material and a topological insulator and its utilization is foreseen for many applications, such as quantum computing, mode-locking of laser systems, and cooling systems. Various methods have been used to grow thin Sb 2 Te 3 films on different substrates, such as molecular beam epitaxy or electrodeposition. Often, such methods require performing laborious and rigid steps in order to optimize film growth and reduce the amount of defects. For this reason, we investigate a simplified growth method: thermal deposition starting from Sb 2 Te 3 lumps followed by annealing. By means of various surface science techniques (LEED, STM, XPS), we show that it is possible to obtain a single crystalline Sb 2 Te 3 film on a Ge(111) substrate. The film, which is amorphous after deposition, undergoes a phase transition and becomes crystalline after annealing at 573 K. This is clearly shown by a 1x1 surface termination typical of a (0001) surface with hexagonal lattices. The presence of several quintuple -layer steps was observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Photoelectron spectroscopy characterization confirms that the grown chalcogenide film presents the expected stoichiometry (Te/Sb=1.5). The proposed method simplifies the growth phase and seems to reduce the number of defects induced by the growth technique, major advantages for many applications.

TI Study of dielectric polarization and electrical transport in
   Bi1.2Sb0.8Te0.4Se2.6 nanofilms
SO HELIYON
AB Studying the dielectric response of topological insulators (TIs) can unveil their unique physical mechanisms such as charge transport and spin-orbit coupling effects. However, due to the manifestation of material's topological nature and band structure primarily in nanofilm, such thickness poses challenges for dielectric testing. To date, research on TI dielectric aspects remains relatively unexplored. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesizes nanofilm of quaternary topological insulator Bi1.2Sb0.8Te0.4Se2.6 (BSTS) using laser molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE) technique. Utilizing a wide-frequency dielectric spectrometer and a comprehensive physical properties measurement system (PPMS), we measured and thoroughly analyzed the dielectric polarization and charge transport characteristics of BSTS. We observed various polarization responses in the frequency range of 101-103 Hz, with the dipole orientation gradually failing to keep pace with the frequency increase in the range of 103-105 Hz, and the relaxation polarization unable to establish itself in the range of 105-107 Hz, with polarization primarily contributed by displacement polarization. Subsequently, we further analyzed the dependence of BSTS dielectric polarization response on temperature and film thickness, which will help reveal the influence of external factors on TI dielectric response, providing crucial insights for controlling TI materials' dielectric response. This not only deepens our understanding of the fundamental physical properties of this novel material but also offers important scientific basis and technological support for its applications in quantum computing, photonics, spintronics, and other fields.

TI Voltage-controlled cryogenic Boolean logic gates based on ferroelectric
   SQUID and heater cryotron
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The recent progress in quantum computing and space exploration led to a surge in interest in cryogenic electronics. Superconducting devices such as Josephson junction, Josephson field effect transistor, cryotron, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) are traditionally used to build cryogenic logic gates. However, due to the superconducting nature, gate-voltage-based control of these devices is extremely difficult. Even more challenging is to cascade the logic gates because most of these devices require current bias for their operation. Therefore, these devices are not as convenient as the semiconducting transistors to design logic gates. Here, to overcome these challenges, we propose a ferroelectric SQUID (FeSQUID) based voltage-controlled logic gates. FeSQUID exhibits two different critical current levels for two different voltage-switchable polarization states of the ferroelectric. We utilize the polarization-dependent (hence, voltage-controllable) superconducting to resistive switching of FeSQUID to design Boolean logic gates such as Copy, NOT, AND, and OR gates. The operations of these gates are verified using a Verilog-A-based compact model of FeSQUID. Finally, to demonstrate the fanning out capability of FeSQUID-based logic family, we simulate a two-input XOR gate using FeSQUID-based NOT, AND, and OR gates. Together with the ongoing progress on FeSQUID-based non-volatile memory, our designed FeSQUID-based logic family will enable all FeSQUID-based cryogenic computer, ensuring minimum mismatch between logic and memory blocks in terms of speed, power consumption, and fabrication process.

TI NV-plasmonics: modifying optical emission of an NV- center
   via plasmonic metal nanoparticles
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is very sensitive to magnetic and electric fields, strain, and temperature. In addition, it is possible to optically interrogate individual defects, making it an ideal quantum-limited sensor with nanoscale resolution. A key limitation for the application of NV sensing is the optical brightness and collection efficiency of these defects. Plasmonic resonances of metal nanoparticles have been used in a variety of applications to increase the brightness and efficiency of quantum emitters, and therefore are a promising tool to improve NV sensing. However, the interaction between NV centers and plasmonic structures is largely unexplored. In particular, the back-action between NV and plasmonic nanoparticles is nonlinear and depends on optical wavelength, nanoparticle position, and metal type. Here we present the general theory of NV-plasmonic nanoparticle interactions. We detail how the interplay between NV response, including optical and vibrational signatures, and the plasmonic response of the metal nanoparticle results in modifications to the emission spectra. Our model is able to explain quantitatively the existing experimental measurements of NV centers near metal nanoparticles. In addition, it provides a pathway to developing new plasmonic structures to improve readout efficiencies in a range of applications for the NV center. This will enable higher precision sensors, with greater bandwidth as well as new readout modalities for quantum computing and communication.

TI Parametrization of emitter photoluminescence towards AI-based color
   center quantification
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum technology devices based on single photon emitters close to the surface or within photonic structures are affected by parasitic interface photoluminescence (PL) and interaction of the interfaces with the functional single photon emitters. However, a systematic surface emitter characterization for quantitative statistics is still missing. A recent approach to analyze color centers via deep learning techniques was limited to emitters generated deep in the bulk, since training data including a sophisticated model of the surface emitter statistics is missing. Our novel approach provides advanced statistical analysis of emitters in PL maps and a software framework with modules for such analysis and for the generation of model data on a large scale. We investigate the emitter statistics in pristine as well as He ion-irradiated 4H-SiC epitaxial layers and we statistically resolve distinct classes of surface-related and irradiation-related emitters. We show how to extract model parameters for training data generation and demonstrate the generation of accurate model data fitting the statistical characteristics of the experimental data.

TI Approximating quantum thermodynamic properties using DFT
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The fabrication, utilisation, and efficiency of quantum technology devices rely on a good understanding of quantum thermodynamic properties. Many-body systems are often used as hardware for these quantum devices, but interactions between particles make the complexity of related calculations grow exponentially with the system size. Here we explore and systematically compare 'simple' and 'hybrid' approximations to the average work and entropy variation built on static density functional theory concepts. These approximations are computationally cheap and could be applied to large systems. We exemplify them considering driven one-dimensional Hubbard chains and show that, for 'simple' approximations and low to medium temperatures, it pays to consider a good estimate of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian to approximate the driving Hamiltonian. Our results confirm that a 'hybrid' approach, requiring a very good approximation of the initial and, for the entropy, final states of the system, provides great improvements. This approach should be particularly efficient when many-body effects are not increased by the driving Hamiltonian.

TI Scalable Registration of Single Quantum Emitters within Solid Immersion
   Lenses through Femtosecond Laser Writing
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The precise registration of solid-state quantum emitters to photonic structures is a major technological challenge for fundamental research (e.g. in cavity quantum electrodynamics) and applications to quantum technology. Standard approaches include the complex multistep fabrication of photonic structures on pre-existing emitters, both registered within a grid of lithographically-defined markers. Here, we demonstrate a marker-free, femtosecond laser writing technique to generate individual quantum emitters within photonic structures. Characterization of 28 defect centers, laser-written at the centers of pre-existing solid immersion lens structures, showed offsets relative to the photonic structure's center of 260 nm in the x-direction and 60 nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of +/- 170 and +/- 90 nm, respectively, resulting in an average 4.5 times enhancement of the optical collection efficiency. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in silicon carbide and is easily extendable to other materials.

TI Exploring the stability and spatial correlations of two-electron bound
   States in quantum Dots under spin-orbit and magnetic influences
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study explores how Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions affect the ground state properties of a two-electron system confined within a two-dimensional GaAs quantum dot, particularly under a magnetic field and Gaussian confinement potential. Using a variational approach based on a Chandrasekhar-type wave function with three adjustable parameters and a modified Jastrow correlation factor, we compute the interaction energy of the electrons with high accuracy under strong confinement. Key ground-state physical quantities such as interaction energy, magnetic moment, magnetic susceptibility, and chemical potential are analyzed. To assess the stability of singlet bound states, we construct phase diagrams for various realistic quantum dot parameters, showing how confinement strength controls electron pairing. The electron pair density function reveals spatial correlations between electrons and their evolution under different magnetic fields, dot sizes, and spin-orbit strengths. By analyzing the peak positions of the pair density distribution, we gain insight into the effective pair size in different regimes. Additionally, we calculate the average inter-electronic distance to quantify how the quantum dot environment shapes electron pairing behavior. These findings provide a deeper understanding of spin-orbit-driven electron correlations and the tunability of quantum dot systems for spintronic and quantum computing applications.

TI LiteQSign: Lightweight and Quantum-Safe Signatures for Heterogeneous IoT
   Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid proliferation of resource-constrained IoT devices across sectors like healthcare, industrial automation, and finance introduces major security challenges. Traditional digital signatures, though foundational for authentication, are often infeasible for low-end devices with limited computational, memory, and energy resources. Also, the rise of quantum computing necessitates post-quantum (PQ) secure alternatives. However, NIST-standardized PQ signatures impose substantial overhead, limiting their practicality in energy-sensitive applications such as wearables, where signer-side efficiency is critical. To address these challenges, we present LightQSign ( LiteQS ), a novel lightweight PQ signature that achieves near-optimal signature generation efficiency with only a small, constant number of hash operations per signing. Its core innovation enables verifiers to obtain one-time hash-based public keys without interacting with signers or third parties through secure computation. We formally prove the security of LiteQS in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance on commodity hardware and a resource-constrained 8-bit AtMega128A1 microcontroller. Experimental results show that LiteQS outperforms NIST PQ standards with lower computational overhead, minimal memory usage, and compact signatures. On an 8-bit microcontroller, it achieves up to 1.5-24x higher energy efficiency and 1.7-22x shorter signatures than PQ counterparts, and 56-76x better energy efficiency than conventional standards-enabling longer device lifespans and scalable, quantum-resilient authentication.

TI Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure
   at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s-wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana-bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling to achieve spin-momentum-locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1-ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y = 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin-momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y = 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin-momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

TI Experimental graybox quantum system identification and control
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Understanding and controlling engineered quantum systems is key to developing practical quantum technology. However, given the current technological limitations, such as fabrication imperfections and environmental noise, this is not always possible. To address these issues, a great deal of theoretical and numerical methods for quantum system identification and control have been developed. These methods range from traditional curve fittings, which are limited by the accuracy of the model that describes the system, to machine learning (ML) methods, which provide efficient control solutions but no control beyond the output of the model, nor insights into the underlying physical process. Here we experimentally demonstrate a 'graybox' approach to construct a physical model of a quantum system and use it to design optimal control. We report superior performance over model fitting, while generating unitaries and Hamiltonians, which are quantities not available from the structure of standard supervised ML models. Our approach combines physics principles with high-accuracy ML and is effective with any problem where the required controlled quantities cannot be directly measured in experiments. This method naturally extends to time-dependent and open quantum systems, with applications in quantum noise spectroscopy and cancellation.

TI Observation of Robust Polarization Squeezing via the Kerr Nonlinearity
   in an Optical Fiber
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Squeezed light is one of the resources of photonic quantum technology. Among the various nonlinear interactions capable of generating squeezing, the optical Kerr effect is particularly easy-to-use. A popular venue is to generate polarization squeezing, which is a special self-referencing variant of two-mode squeezing. To date, polarization squeezing generation setups have been very sensitive to fluctuations of external factors and have required careful tuning. In this work, a development of a new all-fiber setup for polarization squeezing generation is reported. The setup consists of passive elements only and is simple, robust, and stable. More than 5 dB of directly measured squeezing is obtained over long periods of time without any need for adjustments. Thus, the new scheme provides a robust and easy-to-set-up way of obtaining squeezed light applicable to different applications. The impact of pulse duration and pulse power on the degree of squeezing is investigated.

TI Complexity is not enough for randomness
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian p-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality p. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to 1/p. We corroborate that when p is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly nonlocal time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.

TI Wave-particle duality in a quantum heat engine
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB According to the wave-particle duality (WPD), quantum systems show both particlelike and wavelike behavior and cannot be described using only one of these classical concepts. Identifying quantum features that cannot be reproduced by any classical means is key for quantum technology. This task is often pursued by comparing the quantum system of interest with a suitable classical counterpart. However, the WPD implies that a comparison with a single classical model is generally insufficient; at least one wave model and one particle model should be considered. Here we exploit this insight and contrast a bosonic quantum heat engine with two classical counterparts, one based on waves and one based on particles. While both classical models reproduce the average output power of the quantum engine, neither reproduces its fluctuations. The wave model fails to capture the vacuum fluctuations, while the particle model cannot reproduce bunching to its full extent. We find regimes where wave and particle descriptions agree with the quantum one, as well as a regime where neither classical model is adequate, revealing the role of the WPD in nonequilibrium bosonic transport.

TI Quantum spin-engineering in on-surface molecular ferrimagnets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The design and control of atomic-scale spin structures constitute major challenges for spin-based quantum technology platforms, including quantum dots, color centers, and molecular spins. Here, we showcase a strategy for designing the quantum properties of molecular spin qubits by combining tip-assisted on-surface assembly with electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM): We fabricate magnetic dimer complexes that consist of an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule and an organometallic half-sandwich complex formed by the FePc ligand and an attached iron atom, Fe(C6H6). The total complex forms a mixed-spin (1/2,1) quantum ferrimagnet with a well-separated correlated ground state doublet, which we utilize for coherent control. As a result of the correlation, the quantum ferrimagnet shows an improved spin lifetime ( > 1.5 mu s) as it is partially protected against inelastic electron scattering. Lastly, the ferrimagnet units also enable intermolecular coupling, that can be used to realize both ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic structures. Thus, quantum ferrimagnets provide a versatile platform to improve coherent control in general and to study complex magnetic interactions.

TI Floquet-Engineered Noise-Resilient Terahertz Receiver with Modular
   Phased Array Architecture for Scalable Chip-Scale Communication
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB The transition to multichip and accelerator-rich computing architectures has exposed the limitations of conventional wired interconnects, including bandwidth constraints, latency, and power inefficiencies. While wireless interconnects provide a scalable alternative, existing transceiver technologies often lack the interference resilience required for efficient multichip communication. To address these challenges, a terahertz (THz) modular phased array (MPA) transmitter and a 2D semiconductor quantum well (2DSQW)-based nanoreceiver are introduced, enabling noise-resilient signal demodulation without bulky processing hardware. The dual-carrier MPA model enhances beam focusing precision while suppressing grating lobes and mitigating polarization mismatch with the receiver. The receiver response is characterized using Floquet engineering, leveraging the quantum behavior of charge carriers in time-periodic radiation fields to achieve accurate polarization-dependent response tuning. The 2DSQW-based receiver's unique geometric design facilitates spatial modulation, ensuring robust noise suppression and interference detection. This architecture is particularly well-suited for vertical communication in multichip quantum processors, where high wiring density and thermal constraints hinder scalability. By operating the MPA transmitter at elevated temperatures while maintaining the receiver at lower temperatures, effective thermal isolation is achieved. The proposed THz dual-carrier MPA and 2DSQW-based receiver provide a high-bandwidth, low-power solution for scalable wireless multichip communication in both classical and quantum computing systems.

TI Efficient On-Chip Training of Optical Neural Networks Using Genetic
   Algorithm
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Recent advances in silicon photonic chips have made huge progress in optical computing owing to their flexibility in the reconfiguration of various tasks. Its deployment of neural networks serves as an alternative for mitigating the rapidly increased demand for computing resources in electronic platforms. However, it remains a formidable challenge to train the online programmable optical neural networks efficiently, being restricted by the difficulty in obtaining gradient information on a physical device when executing a gradient descent algorithm. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient, physics-agnostic, and closed-loop protocol for training optical neural networks on chip. A gradient-free algorithm, that is, the genetic algorithm, is adopted. The protocol is on-chip implementable, physical agnostic (no need to rely on characterization and offline modeling), and gradient-free. The protocol works for various types of chip structures and is especially helpful to those that cannot be analytically decomposed and characterized. We confirm its viability using several practical tasks, including the crossbar switch and the Iris classification. Finally, by comparing our physics-agonistic and gradient-free method to the off-chip and gradient-based training methods, we demonstrate the robustness of our system to perturbations such as imperfect phase implementation and photodetection noise. Optical processors with gradient-free genetic algorithms have broad application potentials in pattern recognition, reinforcement learning, quantum computing, and realistic applications (such as facial recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles).

TI Single-atom transport in optical conveyor belts: Enhanced
   shortcuts-to-adiabaticity approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Fast and nearly lossless atomic transport, enabled by moving the confining trap, is a prerequisite for many quantum-technology applications. While theoretical studies of this problem have heretofore focused almost exclusively on simplified scenarios (one-dimensional systems, purely harmonic confining potentials, etc.), we investigate it here in the experimentally relevant setting of a moving optical lattice (optical conveyor belt). We model single-atom transport in this system by taking fully into account its three-dimensional, anharmonic confining potential. We do so using the established method of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), i.e., an inverse engineering approach based on Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, as well as its recently proposed modification known as enhanced STA (eSTA). By combining well-controlled, advanced analytical techniques and the numerical propagation of a time-dependent Schrodinger equation using the Fourier split operator method, we evaluate atom-transport fidelities within both approaches. Being obtained for realistic choices of system parameters, our results are relevant for future experiments with optical conveyor belts. Moreover, they reveal that in the system at hand the eSTA method outperforms its STA counterpart for all but the lowest optical-lattice depths.

TI Point Defects in Two-Dimensional Indium Selenide as Tunable
   Single-Photon Sources
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB In the past few years remarkable interest has been kindled by the development of nonclassical light sources and, in particular, of single-photon emitters (SPE), which represent fundamental building blocks for optical quantum technology. In this Letter, we analyze the stability and electronic properties of an InSe monolayer with point defects with the aim of demonstrating its applicability as an SPE. The presence of deep defect states within the InSe band gap is verified when considering substitutional defects with atoms belonging to group IV, V, and VI. In particular, the optical properties of Ge as substitution impurity of Se predicted by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of the GW corrected electronic states show that transitions between the valence band maximum and the defect state are responsible for the absorption and spontaneous emission processes, so that the latter results in a strongly peaked spectrum in the near-infrared. These properties, together with a high localization of the involved electronic states, appear encouraging in the quest for novel SPE materials.

TI High speed imaging of spectral-temporal correlations in Hong-Ou-Mandel
   interference
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work we demonstrate spectral-temporal correlation measurements of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference effect with the use of a spectrometer based on a photon-counting camera. This setup allows us to take, within seconds, spectral temporal correlation measurements on entangled photon sources with sub-nanometer spectral resolution and nanosecond timing resolution. Through post processing, we can observe the HOM behaviour for any number of spectral filters of any shape and width at any wavelength over the observable spectral range. Our setup also offers great versatility in that it is capable of operating at a wide spectral range from the visible to the near infrared and does not require a pulsed pump laser for timing purposes. This work offers the ability to gain large amounts of spectral and temporal information from a HOM interferometer quickly and efficiently and will be a very useful tool for many quantum technology applications and fundamental quantum optics research.

TI Strong magnon-photon coupling with chip-integrated YIG in the
   zero-temperature limit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The cross-integration of spin-wave and superconducting technologies is a promising method for creating novel hybrid devices for future information processing technologies to store, manipulate, or convert data in both classical and quantum regimes. Hybrid magnon-polariton systems have been widely studied using bulk Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) and three-dimensional microwave photon cavities. However, limitations in YIG growth have, thus far, prevented its incorporation into CMOS compatible technologies, such as high-quality factor superconducting quantum technology. To overcome this impediment, we have used Plasma Focused Ion Beam (PFIB) technology-taking advantage of precision placement down to the micrometer scale-to integrate YIG with superconducting microwave devices. Ferromagnetic resonance has been measured at milliKelvin temperatures on PFIB-processed YIG samples using planar microwave circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong coupling between superconducting resonators and YIG ferromagnetic resonance modes by maintaining reasonably low loss while reducing the system down to the micrometer scale. This achievement of strong coupling on-chip is a crucial step toward fabrication of functional hybrid quantum devices from spin-wave and superconducting components.

TI Finite-time quantum Otto engine subject to control noise and enhancement
   techniques
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. While it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalization or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.

TI Optimal control of linear Gaussian quantum systems via quantum learning
   control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Efficiently controlling linear Gaussian quantum (LGQ) systems is a significant task in both the study of fundamental quantum theory and the development of modern quantum technology. Here, we propose a general quantum-learning-control method for optimally controlling LGQ systems based on the gradient-descent algorithm. Our approach flexibly designs the loss function for diverse tasks by utilizing first- and second-order moments that completely describe the quantum state of LGQ systems. We demonstrate both deep optomechanical cooling and large optomechanical entanglement using this approach. Our approach enables the fast and deep ground-state cooling of a mechanical resonator within a short time, surpassing the limitations of sideband cooling in the continuous-wave driven strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, optomechanical entanglement could be generated remarkably fast and surpass several times the corresponding steady-state entanglement, even when the thermal phonon occupation reaches one hundred. This work will not only broaden the application of quantum learning control, but also open an avenue for optimal control of LGQ systems.

TI Strong laser fields and their power to generate controllable
   high-photon-number coherent-state superpositions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently, intensely driven laser-matter interactions have been used to connect the fields of strong laser field physics with quantum optics by generating nonclassical states of light. Here, we take a further key step and show the potential of strong laser fields for generating controllable high-photon-number coherent-state superpositions. This has been achieved by using two of the most prominent strong-laser induced processes: high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization. We show how the obtained coherent-state superpositions change from an optical Schrodinger "cat" state to a "kitten" state by changing the atomic density in the laser-atom interaction region, and we demonstrate the generation of a nine-photon shifted optical "cat" state, which, to our knowledge, is the highest photon number optical "cat" state experimentally reported. Our findings anticipate the development of new methods that naturally lead to the creation of high-photon-number controllable coherent state superpositions, advancing investigations in quantum technology.

TI Missing odd-order Shapiro steps do not uniquely indicate fractional
   Josephson effect
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes-exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements, often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.

TI Elucidating the Role of Electron Transfer in the Photoluminescence of
   MoS2 Quantum Dots Synthesized by fs-Pulse Ablation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Herein, MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) with controlled optical, structural, and electronic properties are synthesized using the femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL) technique by varying the pulse width, ablation power, and ablation time to harness the potential for next-generation optoelectronics and quantum technology. Furthermore, this work elucidates key aspects of the mechanisms underlying the near-UV and blue emissions the accompanying large Stokes shift, and the consequent change in sample color with laser exposure parameters pertaining to MoS2 QDs. Through spectroscopic analysis, including UV-visible absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy, we successfully unraveled the mechanisms for the change in optoelectronic properties of MoS2 QDs with laser parameters. We realize that the occurrence of a secondary phase, specifically MoO3-x, is responsible for the significant Stokes shift and blue emission observed in this QD system. The primary factor influencing these activities is the electron transfer observed between these two phases, as validated by excitation-dependent photoluminescence and XPS and Raman spectroscopies.

TI Impact of the π-pulse shape on the contrast of thermal Atom
   Interferometers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The key role of pi- and pi/2-pulses in atom interferometry has been widely recognized as their efficiency affect the overall performance of atomic interferometers. The inefficiencies are evident when using thermal cloud atoms as the field interaction does not compensate for the atom velocity. Temporal pulse shaping offers a solution to this issue by balancing the effect of the temporal shape of the mirror pulse in thermal cold atom interferometry by testing pulse shapes beyond the standard rectangle including Gaussian-like, Sinc-like, optimized Band-selective Uniform Response Pure-phase family, and optimized Gaussian Cascade family. We unveiled a correlation between the pi-pulse fidelity and the overall interferometer contrast function. We also found robust pulse sequences with respect to initial atom velocities that offer contrast as high as 0.7 compared to standard rectangle sequences with values of 0.2. The investigated pulse sequences offer an efficient way to improve the performance of atom interferometers, increasing the potential of thermal cold atom interferometry.

TI Ultrahigh numerical aperture meta-fibre for flexible optical trapping
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Strong focusing on diffraction-limited spots is essential for many photonic applications and is particularly relevant for optical trapping; however, all currently used approaches fail to simultaneously provide flexible transportation of light, straightforward implementation, compatibility with waveguide circuitry, and strong focusing. Here, we demonstrate the design and 3D nanoprinting of an ultrahigh numerical aperture meta-fibre for highly flexible optical trapping. Taking into account the peculiarities of the fibre environment, we implemented an ultrathin meta-lens on the facet of a modified single-mode optical fibre via direct laser writing, leading to a diffraction-limited focal spot with a record-high numerical aperture of up to NA approximate to 0.9. The unique capabilities of this flexible, cost-effective, bio- and fibre-circuitry-compatible meta-fibre device were demonstrated by optically trapping microbeads and bacteria for the first time with only one single-mode fibre in combination with diffractive optics. Our study highlights the relevance of the unexplored but exciting field of meta-fibre optics to a multitude of fields, such as bioanalytics, quantum technology and life sciences.

TI Quantum limit cycles and the Rayleigh and van der Pol oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Self-oscillating systems, described in classical dynamics as limit cycles, are emerging as canonical models for driven dissipative nonequilibrium open quantum systems and as key elements in quantum technology. We consider a family of models that interpolates between the classical textbook examples of the Rayleigh and the van der Pol oscillators and follow their transition from the classical to the quantum domain, while properly formulating their corresponding quantum descriptions. We derive an exact analytical solution for the steady-state quantum dynamics of the simplest of these models, applicable to any bosonic system-whether mechanical, optical, or otherwise-that is coupled to its environment via single-boson and double-boson emission and absorption. Our solution is a generalization to arbitrary temperature of existing solutions for very-low, or zero, temperature, often misattributed to the quantum van der Pol oscillator. We closely explore the classical to quantum transition of the bifurcation to self-oscillations of this oscillator, while noting changes in the dynamics and identifying features that are uniquely quantum.

TI A Review on Passivation Strategies for Germanium-Based
   Thermophotovoltaic Devices
SO MATERIALS
AB Interest in germanium electronic devices is experiencing a comeback thanks to their suitability for a wide range of new applications, like CMOS transistors, quantum technology or infrared photonics. Among these applications, Ge-based thermophotovoltaic converters could become the backbone of thermo-electrical batteries. However, these devices are still far from the efficiency threshold needed for industrial deployment, with surface recombination as the main limiting factor for the material. In this work, we discuss the main passivation techniques developed for germanium photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic devices, summarizing their main advantages and disadvantages. The analysis reveals that surface recombination velocities as low as 2.7 cm/s and 1.3 cm/s have already been reported for p-type and n-type germanium, respectively, although improving surface recombination velocities below 100 cm/s would result in marginal efficiency gains. Therefore, the main challenge for the material is not reducing this parameter further but developing robust and reliable processes for integrating the current techniques into functional devices.

TI On Quantum Rainbows: Density Operator in the Frequency-Bin
   Representation for Entangled Twin-Photons Generated With Sub-Threshold
   Microcombs
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Kerr optical frequency combs are generated by pumping a high-Q integrated microresonator with a resonant laser. Below threshold, the pump laser field mediates the phenomenon of spontaneous four-wave mixing, where two pump photons are symmetrically up- and down-converted as twin photons that can be entangled across up to tens of eigenmodes in the spectral domain. While these room-temperature integrated photonic circuits are expected to play a central role in quantum technology, their high dimensionality and dissipative nature are a challenge for their theoretical description, therefore hindering the understanding of their properties and potential of performance. In this article, we develop a framework that permits to obtain an explicit solution for the density operator of quantum microcombs below threshold. This self-consistent theoretical description allows for their complete characterization, as well as for the analytical determination of various performance metrics such as fidelity, purity, and entropy.

TI Reconstructing charged particle track segments with a quantum-enhanced
   support vector machine
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles from the collection of hits they leave in the detectors of collider experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a challenging combinatorics problem and computationally intensive. The tenfold increase in the delivered luminosity at the upgraded High Luminosity LHC will result in a very densely populated detector environment. The time taken by conventional techniques for reconstructing particle tracks scales worse than quadratically with track density. Accurately and efficiently assigning the collection of hits left in the tracking detector to the correct particle will be a computational bottleneck and has motivated studying possible alternative approaches. This paper presents a quantum -enhanced machine learning algorithm that uses a support vector machine (SVM) with a quantum -estimated kernel to classify a set of three hits (triplets) as either belonging to or not belonging to the same particle track. The performance of the algorithm is then compared to a fully classical SVM. The quantum algorithm shows an improvement in accuracy versus the classical algorithm. Model complexity metrics are used to hint at an explanation for favorable performance of the quantum kernel.

TI Asymmetric Cryptosystem on Matrix Algebra over a Chain Ring
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The revolutionary idea of asymmetric cryptography brings a fundamental change to our modern communication system. However, advances in quantum computers endanger the security of many asymmetric cryptosystems based on the hardness of factoring and discrete logarithm, while the complexity of the quantum algorithm makes it hard to implement in many applications. In this respect, novel asymmetric cryptosystems based on matrices over residue rings are in practice. In this article, a novel approach is introduced. Despite the matrix algebra M(k,Z(n)), the matrix algebra M(k,R-n '), R-n ' = Z(2)[w]< w(n)-1 > as the chain ring is considered. In this technique, instead of exponentiation, the inner product automorphisms the use for key generation. The chain ring provides computational complexity to its algorithm, which improves the strength of the cryptosystem. However, the residue ring endangers the security of the original cryptosystem, while it is hard to break using R-n '. The structure of the chain ring deals with the binary field Z(2), which simplifies its calculation and makes it capable of efficient execution in various applications.

TI Semicoherent symmetric quantum processes: Theory and applications
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Discovering pragmatic and efficient approaches to construct epsilon-approximations of quantum operators such as real (imaginary) time-evolution propagators in terms of the basic quantum operations (gates) is challenging. Prior epsilon-approximations are invaluable, in that they enable the compilation of classical and quantum algorithm modeling of, e.g., dynamical and thermodynamic quantum properties. In parallel, symmetries are powerful tools concisely describing the fundamental laws of nature; the symmetric underpinnings of physical laws have consistently provided profound insights and substantially increased predictive power. In this work, we consider the interplay between the epsilon-approximate processes and the exact symmetries in a semicoherent context-where measurements occur at each logical clock cycle. We draw inspiration from Pascual Jordan's groundbreaking formulation of nonassociative, but commutative, symmetric algebraic form. Our symmetrized formalism is then applied in various domains such as quantum random walks, real-time evolutions, variational algorithm ansatzes, and efficient entanglement verification. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding and greater appreciation of how symmetries can be used to control quantum dynamics in settings where coherence is a limited resource.

TI Variational microcanonical estimator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a variational quantum algorithm for estimating microcanonical expectation values in models obeying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a relaxed criterion for convergence of the variational optimization loop, the algorithm generates weakly entangled superpositions of eigenstates at a given target energy density. An ensemble of these variational states is then used to estimate microcanonical averages of local operators, with an error whose dominant contribution decreases initially as a power law in the size of the ensemble and is ultimately limited by a small bias. We apply the algorithm to the one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model, where it converges for ansatz circuits of depth roughly linear in system size. The most accurate thermal estimates are produced for intermediate energy densities. In our error analysis, we find connections with recent works investigating the underpinnings of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. In particular, the failure of energy-basis matrix elements of local operators to behave as independent random variables is a potential source of error that the algorithm can overcome by averaging over an ensemble of variational states.

TI Noise-Assisted Quantum Autoencoder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum autoencoder is an efficient variational quantum algorithm for quantum data compression. However, previous quantum autoencoders fail to compress and recover high-rank mixed states. In this work, we discuss the fundamental properties and limitations of the standard quantum-autoencoder model in more depth, and provide an information-theoretic solution to its recovering fidelity. Based on this understanding, we present a noise-assisted quantum-autoencoder algorithm to go beyond the limitations, our model can achieve high recovering fidelity for general input states. Appropriate noise channels are used to make the input mixedness and output mixedness consistent, the noise setup is determined by measurement results of the trash system. Compared with the original quantum-autoencoder model, the measurement information is fully used in our algorithm. In addition to the circuit model, we design a (noise-assisted) adiabatic model of quantum autoencoder that can be implemented on quantum annealers. We verify the validity of our methods through compressing the thermal states of the transverse-field Ising model and Werner states. For pure-state ensemble compression, we also introduce a projected quantum-autoencoder algorithm.

TI Optimization by decoded quantum interferometry
SO NATURE
AB Achieving superpolynomial speed-ups for optimization has long been a central goal for quantum algorithms1. Here we introduce decoded quantum interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. When approximating optimal polynomial fits over finite fields, DQI achieves a superpolynomial speed-up over known classical algorithms. The speed-up arises because the algebraic structure of the problem is reflected in the decoding problem, which can be solved efficiently. We then investigate whether this approach can achieve a speed-up for optimization problems that lack an algebraic structure but have sparse clauses. These problems reduce to decoding low-density parity-check codes, for which powerful decoders are known2,3. To test this, we construct a max-XORSAT instance for which DQI finds an approximate optimum substantially faster than general-purpose classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing. Although a tailored classical solver can outperform DQI on this instance, our results establish that combining quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new path towards quantum speed-ups for hard optimization problems.

TI Anti-crossing of modes and singularity points in dielectric
   metasurface-on-mirror microcavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Over the past decade, single layer metasurfaces have been used to realize a variety of passive and active flat optical devices. In the pursuit of broadening the range of potential applications and exploring newer physical phenomena, metasurface-on-mirror configuration has been widely explored; but mostly in the plasmonic regime. Dielectric metasurfaces have emerged as a better alternative to their plasmonic counterparts owing to their low losses, capability to support electric and magnetic multipole resonance with associated scattering interference effects, and better compatibility with semiconductor fabrication technologies. In this work, we numerically study the coupling of modes of a resonant dielectric metasurface with the cavity modes obtained by placing the metasurface above a metallic mirror. We consider two case studies-(1) Huygens' (HM) metasurface, which has overlapped electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) resonances, and (2) non-Huygens' metasurface (n-HM), which has well-separated ED and MD modes. The cavity formed by the Huygens' metasurface-on-mirror leads to a strong coupling of modes and the signature of anti-crossing of modes in reflection. The avoided crossing gives rise to large phase modulation of 4 pi, with a great potential for tunable metadevices with continuous wavefront modulation beyond standard 2 pi. On the other hand, for a n-HM metasurface-on-mirror, we observe a pair of phase singularities around each metasurface resonance. These singularities are associated with reflectance zeros resulting in perfect absorption. We explain the properties of these photonic systems and support the obtained results with a semi-analytic approach employing the (scattering) S-matrix formalism. We believe this study will help in better understanding the far-field coupling of dielectric metasurface resonances and cavity modes while leveraging the best of both worlds in realizing multifunctional, high-Q, robust, and potentially tunable nano and quantum photonic devices.

TI Polynomial-time quantum Gibbs sampling for the weak and strong coupling
   regime of the Fermi-Hubbard model at any temperature
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers hold the potential to revolutionise the simulation of quantum many-body systems, with profound implications for fundamental physics and applications like molecular and material design. However, demonstrating quantum advantage in simulating quantum systems of practical relevance remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for preparing Gibbs states of interacting fermions on a lattice with provable polynomial resource requirements. Our approach builds on recent progress in theoretical computer science that extends classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to the quantum domain. We derive a bound on the mixing time for quantum Gibbs state preparation by showing that the generator of the quantum Markovian evolution is gapped at any temperature up to a maximal interaction strength. This enables the efficient preparation of low-temperature states of weakly interacting fermions and the calculation of their free energy. We present exact numerical simulations for small system sizes that support our results and identify well-suited algorithmic choices for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model beyond our rigorous guarantees.

TI Construction of Compact Lattice-Based IBE with Equality Test∗
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Identity-based encryption with equality test (IBE-ET) allows the detection of whether two different ciphertexts encrypt the same plaintext without decryption within the conventional identity-based encryption (IBE) model. This property ensures the confidentiality of communication and reduces the storage overhead of ciphertexts in cryptosystems. However, IBE-ET schemes based on traditional assumptions, such as discrete logarithm and integer factoring, are vulnerable to quantum algorithm attacks, highlighting the importance of designing lattice-based IBE-ET schemes. To address this, researchers have proposed several lattice-based IBE-ET schemes that utilize outdated lattice IBE paradigms and are inefficient in terms of parameter size. In this work, we construct a new lattice-based IBE-ET scheme using the most compact lattice IBE framework known to date. Our new proposal significantly improves the parameters compared to previous constructions. Furthermore, we provide a security reduction in the random oracle model, along with corresponding parameter selection and the comparison between our scheme and known constructions. The results imply that our scheme is efficient.

TI Exact Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics on the NISQ Device Using Kraus
   Operators
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The theory of open quantum systems has many applications ranging from simulating quantum dynamics in condensed phases to better understanding quantum-enabled technologies. At the center of theoretical chemistry are the developments of methodologies and computational tools for simulating charge and excitation energy transfer in solutions, biomolecules, and molecular aggregates. As a variety of these processes display non-Markovian behavior, classical computer simulation can be challenging due to exponential scaling with existing methods. With quantum computers holding the promise of efficient quantum simulations, in this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm based on Kraus operators that capture the exact non-Markovian effect at a finite temperature. The implementation of the Kraus operators on the quantum machine uses a combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) and optimal Walsh operators that result in shallow circuits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm by simulating the spin-boson dynamics and the exciton transfer in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. The NISQ results show very good agreement with the exact ones.

TI Quantum unary approach to option pricing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantum algorithm for European option pricing in finance, where the key idea is to work in the unary representation of the asset value. The algorithm needs novel circuitry and is divided in three parts: first, the amplitude distribution corresponding to the asset value at maturity is generated using a low-depth circuit; second, the computation of the expected return is computed with simple controlled gates; and third, standard amplitude estimation is used to gain quantum advantage. On the positive side, unary representation remarkably simplifies the structure and depth of the quantum circuit. Amplitude distributions use quantum superposition to bypass the role of classical Monte Carlo simulation. The unary representation also provides a postselection consistency check that allows for a substantial mitigation in the error of the computation. On the negative side, unary representation requires linearly many qubits to represent a target probability distribution, as compared to the logarithmic scaling of binary algorithms. We compare the performance of both unary vs binary option pricing algorithms using error maps, and find that unary representation may bring a relevant advantage in practice for near-term devices.

TI Computational Complexity of Unitary and State Design Properties
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate unitary and state t-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) t-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a #P oracle and is #P-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is BQP-complete, provided that the promise gap between the two values is inverse polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is PP-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is PP-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify implications of our results, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos, and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.

Similarly, it is possible to study the entangling features of a quantum operation using its operator- Schmidt or tensor-product decomposition. While quantum technological implementations of the former are thoroughly studied, entangling properties on the operator level are harder to extract in the quantum computational framework because of the exponential nature of sample complexity. Here, we present an algorithm for unbalanced partitions into a small subsystem and a large one (the environment) to compute the tensor-product decomposition of a unitary the effect of which on the small subsystem is captured in classical memory, while the effect on the environment is accessible as a quantum resource. This quantum algorithm may be used to make predictions about operator nonlocality and effective open quantum dynamics on a subsystem, as well as for finding low-rank approximations and low-depth compilations of quantum circuit unitaries. We demonstrate the method and its applications on a time-evolution unitary of an isotropic Heisenberg model in two dimensions.

TI Reducing the Runtime of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulations in Chemistry
   through Symmetry-Compressed Double Factorization
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum phase estimation based on qubitization is the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing ground-state energies in chemical applications. In this context, the 1-norm of the Hamiltonian plays a fundamental role in determining the total number of required iterations and also the overall computational cost. In this work, we introduce the symmetry-compressed double factorization (SCDF) approach, which combines a CDF of the Hamiltonian with the symmetry shift technique, significantly reducing the 1-norm value. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated numerically by considering various benchmark systems, including the FeMoco molecule, cytochrome P450, and hydrogen chains of different sizes. To compare the efficiency of SCDF to other methods in absolute terms, we estimate Toffoli gate requirements, which dominate the execution time on fault-tolerant quantum computers. For the systems considered here, SCDF leads to a sizable reduction of the Toffoli gate count in comparison to other variants of DF or even tensor hypercontraction, which is usually regarded as the most efficient approach for qubitization.

TI Weak versus Deterministic Macroscopic Realism, and
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's Elements of Reality
SO ENTROPY
AB The violation of a Leggett-Garg inequality confirms the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and the combined premises (called macro-realism) of macroscopic realism (MR) and noninvasive measurability (NIM). Arguments can be given that the incompatibility arises because MR fails for systems in a superposition of macroscopically distinct states-or else, that NIM fails. In this paper, we consider a strong negation of macro-realism, involving superpositions of coherent states, where the NIM premise is replaced by Bell's locality premise. We follow recent work and propose the validity of a subset of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and Leggett-Garg premises, referred to as weak macroscopic realism (wMR). In finding consistency with wMR, we identify that the Leggett-Garg inequalities are violated because of failure of both MR and NIM, but also that both are valid in a weaker (less restrictive) sense. Weak MR is distinguished from deterministic macroscopic realism (dMR) by recognizing that a measurement involves a reversible unitary interaction that establishes the measurement setting. Weak MR posits that a predetermined value for the outcome of a measurement can be attributed to the system after the interaction, when the measurement setting is experimentally specified. An extended definition of wMR considers the "element of reality" defined by EPR for system A, where one can predict with certainty the outcome of a measurement on A by performing a measurement on system B. Weak MR posits that this element of reality exists once the unitary interaction determining the measurement setting at B has occurred. We demonstrate compatibility of systems violating Leggett-Garg inequalities with wMR but point out that dMR has been shown to be falsifiable. Other tests of wMR are proposed, the predictions of wMR agreeing with quantum mechanics. Finally, we compare wMR with macro-realism models discussed elsewhere. An argument in favour of wMR is presented: wMR resolves a potential contradiction pointed out by Leggett and Garg between failure of macro-realism and assumptions intrinsic to quantum measurement theory.

TI Quantum diffusion map for nonlinear dimensionality reduction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Inspired by random walks on graphs, the diffusion map (DM) is a class of unsupervised machine learning that offers automatic identification of low-dimensional data structure hidden in a high-dimensional data set. In recent years, among its many applications, the DM has been successfully applied to discover relevant order parameters in many-body systems, enabling automatic classification of quantum phases of matter. However, a classical DM algorithm is computationally prohibitive for a large data set, and any reduction of the time complexity would be desirable. With a quantum computational speedup in mind, we propose a quantum algorithm for the DM, termed the quantum diffusion map (qDM). Our qDM takes as an input N classical data vectors, performs an eigendecomposition of the Markov transition matrix in time O(log3 N), and classically constructs the diffusion map via the readout (tomography) of the eigenvectors, giving a total expected runtime proportional to N2polylog N. Finally, quantum subroutines in the qDM for constructing a Markov transition matrix and for analyzing its spectral properties can also be useful for other random-walk-based algorithms.

TI Multiple-Access Channel Coding With Non-Signaling Correlations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We address the problem of coding for classical multiple-access channels (MACs) with the assistance of non-signaling correlations between parties. It is well-known that non-signaling assistance does not change the capacity of classical point-to-point channels. However, it was recently observed that one can construct MACs from two-player nonlocal games while relating the winning probability of the game to the capacity of the MAC. By considering games for which entanglement (a special kind of non-signaling correlation) increases the winning probability (e.g., the Magic Square game), this shows that for some specific kinds of channels, entanglement between the senders can increase the capacity. In this work, we make several contributions towards understanding the capacity region for MACs with the assistance of non-signaling correlations between the parties. We develop a linear program computing the optimal success probability for coding over n copies of a MAC W with size growing polynomially in n . Solving this linear program allows us to achieve inner bounds for MACs. Applying this method to the binary adder channel, we show that using non-signaling assistance, the sum-rate log(2 )(72)/4 similar or equal to 1.5425 can be reached even with zero error, which beats the maximum sum-rate capacity of 1.5 in the unassisted case. For noisy channels, where the zero-error non-signaling assisted capacity region is trivial, we can use concatenated codes to obtain achievable points in the capacity region. Applied to a noisy version of the binary adder channel, we show that non-signaling assistance still improves the sum-rate capacity. Complementing these achievability results, we give an outer bound on the non-signaling assisted capacity region that has the same expression as the unassisted region except that the channel inputs are not required to be independent. Finally, we show that the capacity region with non-signaling assistance shared only between each sender and the receiver independently is the same as without assistance.

TI Entanglement wedge cross-section for noncommutative Yang-Mills theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The signature of noncommutativity on various measures of entanglement has been observed by considering the holographic dual of noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. We have followed a systematic analytical approach in order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy corresponding to a strip like subsystem of length 1. The relationship between the subsystem size (in dimensionless form) l/alpha and the turning point (in dimensionless form) introduces a critical length scale l(c)/alpha which leads to three domains in the theory, namely, the deep UV domain (l < l(c) ; alpha u(t) >> 1, alpha u(t) similar to alpha u(b)), deep noncommutative domain (l > l(c), alpha u(b) > alpha u(t) >> 1) and deep IR domain (l > l(c), alpha u(t) << 1). This in turn means that the length scale l(c) distinctly points out the UV/IR mixing property of the non-local theory under consideration. We have carried out the holographic study of entanglement entropy for each of these domains by employing both analytical and numerical techniques. The broken Lorentz symmetry induced by noncommutativity has motivated us to redefine the entropic c-function. We have obtained the noncommutative correction to the c-function upto leading order in the noncommutative parameter. We have also looked at the behaviour of this quantity over all the domains of the theory. We then move on to compute the minimal cross-section area of the entanglement wedge by considering two disjoint subsystems A and B. On the basis of E-P = E-W duality, this leads to the holographic computation of the entanglement of purification. The correlation between two subsystems, namely, the holographic mutual information I(A : B) has also been computed. Moreover, the computations of E-W and I(A : B) has been done for each of the domains in the theory. We have then briefly discussed the effect of the UV cut-off on the IR behaviours of these quantities. Finally, we consider a black hole geometry with a noncommutative parameter and study the influence of both noncommutativity and finite temperature on the various measures of quantum entanglement.

TI Giant-Cavity-Based Quantum Sensors With Enhanced Performance
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Recent progress has revealed that quantum systems with multiple position-dependent couplings, e.g., giant atoms, can exhibit some unconventional phenomena, such as non-exponential decay. However, their potential applications are still open questions. In this paper, we propose a giant-cavity-based quantum sensor for the first time, whose performance can be greatly enhanced compared to traditional cavity-based sensors. In our proposal, two cavities are coupled to a dissipative reservoir at multiple points while they couple to a gain reservoir in a single-point way. To detect an unknown parameter entering the sensor, a waveguide is coupled to one of the cavities where detecting fields can pass through for homodyne detection. We find that multiple position-dependent couplings can induce an inherent non-reciprocal coupling between the cavities, which can enhance the performance of sensors. Compared to the results in the work of Lau and Clerk, (Nat Commun, 2018, 9: 4,320), our output noise can remain at the shot noise level, which is about one order of magnitude lower. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio per photon is also enhanced by about one order of magnitude. These results showed that the multiple-point coupling structure is beneficial to existing quantum devices.

TI Quantum search degeneration under amplitude noise in queries to the
   oracle
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We examine how amplitude noise in queries to the oracle degrades a performance of quantum search algorithm. The Grover search and similar techniques are widely used in various quantum algorithms, including cases where rival parties are fighting over confidential data. Hence, the oracle-box wires become the subject of competing activity with an alteration of their normal functioning. Of course, many kinds of errors could arise in this way. Possible influence of dephasing on quantum search was already addressed in the literature. Amplitude damping is another type of errors that should be analyzed first. To study the problem, we introduce a simple model of collective distortions with the use of amplitude damping channel. All the quantities of interest should be considered as functions of the number of Grover's iterations. In particular, we investigate the success probability with respect to the parameter that characterizes the level of amplitude errors. The success probability degrades significantly even if the error amount is not essential. Namely, this probability soon enough reduces to a value close to one half. We also study trade-off relations between quantum coherence and the success probability in the presence of amplitude noise.

TI Many-body quantum chaos in stroboscopically-driven cold atoms
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In quantum chaotic systems, the spectral form factor (SFF), defined as the Fourier transform of two-level spectral correlation function, is known to follow random matrix theory (RMT), namely a 'ramp' followed by a 'plateau' in late times. Recently, a generic early-time deviation from RMT, so-called the 'bump', was shown to exist in random quantum circuits as toy models for many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the existence of 'bump-ramp-plateau' behavior in the SFF for a number of paradigmatic and stroboscopically-driven 1D cold-atom models: spinless and spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard models, and nonintegrable spin-1 condensate with contact or dipolar interactions. We find that the scaling of the many-body Thouless time t(Th) -the onset of RMT-, and the bump amplitude are more sensitive to variations in atom number than the lattice size regardless of the hyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of driving protocol. Moreover, t(Th) scaling and the increase of the bump amplitude in atom number are significantly slower in spinor gases than interacting bosons in 1D optical lattices, demonstrating the role of locality. We obtain universal scaling functions of SFF which suggest power-law behavior for the bump regime in quantum chaotic cold-atom systems, and propose an interference measurement protocol.
   Characterization of quantum chaotic systems involves a detailed understanding of their spectral properties. This work analyses such features in ultracold driven one-dimensional atomic gases, with emphasis on emerging universal scaling in early time deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix theory predictions, outlining a potential experimental observational protocol.

TI Local Variational Quantum Compilation of Large-Scale Hamiltonian
   Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The implementation of time-evolution operators on quantum circuits is important for quantum simula-tion. However, the standard method, Trotterization, requires a huge number of gates to achieve desirable accuracy. Here, we propose a local variational quantum compilation (LVQC) algorithm, which allows us to accurately and efficiently compile time-evolution operators on a large-scale quantum system by optimiza-tion with smaller-size quantum systems. LVQC utilizes a subsystem cost function, which approximates the fidelity of the whole circuit, defined for each subsystem that is as large as the approximate causal cones generated by the Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound. We rigorously derive its scaling property with respect to the subsystem size and show that the optimization conducted on the subsystem size leads to the compilation of whole-system time-evolution operators. As a result, LVQC runs with limited-size quantum comput-ers or classical simulators that can handle such smaller quantum systems. For instance, finite-ranged and short-ranged interacting L-size systems can be compiled with symbolscript or symbolscript symbolscript-size quantum systems depending on the observables of interest. Furthermore, since this formalism relies only on the LR bound, it can efficiently construct time-evolution operators of various systems in generic dimensions involving finite-, short-, and long-ranged interactions. We also numerically demonstrate the LVQC algorithm for one-dimensional systems. Through the employment of classical simulation by time-evolving block dec-imation, we succeed in compressing the depth of the time-evolution operators up to 40 qubits by the compilation for 20 qubits. LVQC not only provides classical protocols for designing large-scale quan-tum circuits but also sheds light on applications of intermediate-scale quantum devices in implementing algorithms in larger-scale quantum devices.

TI Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation Proportional-Derivative Control for
   Trajectory Tracking of a Car-like Mobile Robot
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The goal of this research is to formulate and compare two algorithms, classical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and quantum PSO (QPSO), for optimising the motion of a car-like mobile robot. Both algorithms are evaluated on the basis of their reduction and stabilisation of the root mean square error (RMSE) between the robot's desired and actual trajectories. An implementation of the robot's dynamic motion is provided. The robot's mass and inertia are considered. The robot's settings and the viscosity of the surroundings present a few obstacles to following the specified path. For each algorithm, the proportional (Kp) and derivative (Kd) parameters of the controller are optimised, and the convergence speeds and stabilities of the controllers are compared. The results show that both algorithms perform comparably. However, the QPSO method converges faster and is more stable at optimal Kp and Kd values. The ramifications of this research extend beyond trajectory tracking. Enhanced optimisation approaches can lead to higher performance in a variety of robotic systems, including autonomous cars, drones, and automation systems, by employing advanced quantum algorithms, such as QPSO.

AB We study two important families of problems in isogeny-based cryptography and how they relate to each other: computing the endomorphism ring of supersingular elliptic curves, and inverting the action of class groups on oriented supersingular curves. We prove that these two families of problems are closely related through polynomial-time reductions, assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis.
   We identify two classes of essentially equivalent problems. The first class corresponds to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of oriented curves. The security of a large family of cryptosystems (such as CSIDH) reduces to (and sometimes from) this class, for which there are heuristic quantum algorithms running in subexponential time. The second class corresponds to computing the endomorphism ring of orientable curves. The security of essentially all isogeny-based cryptosystems reduces to (and sometimes from) this second class, for which the best known algorithms are still exponential.
   Some of our reductions not only generalise, but also strengthen previously known results. For instance, it was known that in the particular case of curves defined over F-p, the security of CSIDH reduces to the endomorphism ring problem in subexponential time. Our reductions imply that the security of CSIDH is actually equivalent to the endomorphism ring problem, under polynomial time reductions (circumventing arguments that proved such reductions unlikely).

TI Quantum Spatial Search with Electric Potential: Long-Time Dynamics and
   Robustness to Noise
SO ENTROPY
AB We present various results on the scheme introduced in a previous work, which is a quantum spatial-search algorithm on a two-dimensional (2D) square spatial grid, realized with a 2D Dirac discrete-time quantum walk (DQW) coupled to a Coulomb electric field centered on the the node to be found. In such a walk, the electric term acts as the oracle of the algorithm, and the free walk (i.e., without electric term) acts as the "diffusion " part, as it is called in Grover's algorithm. The results are the following. First, we run long time simulations of this electric Dirac DQW, and observe that there is a second localization peak around the node marked by the oracle, reached in a time O(root N), where N is the number of nodes of the 2D grid, with a localization probability scaling as O(1/lnN). This matches the state-of-the-art 2D-DQW search algorithms before amplitude amplification We then study the effect of adding noise on the Coulomb potential, and observe that the walk, especially the second localization peak, is highly robust to spatial noise, more modestly robust to spatiotemporal noise, and that the first localization peak is even highly robust to spatiotemporal noise.

TI Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy for quantum error
   mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE, we obtain an average reduction of the error by (18.2 +/- 0.5)% and (52.8 +/- 6.3)% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.

TI Quadratic Speedup for Spatial Search by Continuous-Time Quantum Walk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Continuous-time quantum walks provide a natural framework to tackle the fundamental problem of finding a node among a set of marked nodes in a graph, known as spatial search. Whether spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk provides a quadratic advantage over classical random walks has been an outstanding problem. Thus far, this advantage is obtained only for specific graphs or when a single node of the underlying graph is marked. In this Letter, we provide a new continuous-time quantum walk search algorithm that completely resolves this: our algorithm can find a marked node in any graph with any number of marked nodes, in a time that is quadratically faster than classical random walks. The overall algorithm is quite simple, requiring time evolution of the quantum walk Hamiltonian followed by a projective measurement. A key component of our algorithm is a purely analogue procedure to perform operations on a state of the form e-tH2jvi, which, for a given Hamiltonian H, only requires evolving H for time scaling as p. This allows us to quadratically fast-forward the dynamics of a continuous-time classical random walk. ffi t The applications of our Letter thus go beyond the realm of quantum walks and can lead to new analog quantum algorithms for preparing ground states of Hamiltonians or solving optimization problems.

TI BLS-QLSTM: a novel hybrid quantum neural network for stock index
   forecasting
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB With the rapid development of investment markets and the diversification of investment products, accurate prediction of stock price trends is particularly important for investors and researchers. The complexity of the stock market and the nonlinear characteristics of the data make it difficult for traditional prediction models to meet the demand for high-precision predictions. Although some existing machine learning methods and deep learning models perform well in certain cases, they still face limitations in handling high-dimensional data and time dependencies. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel hybrid quantum neural network model, BLS-QLSTM, which combines broad learning system (BLS) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) network for chaotic time series prediction. Initially, the Cao method and mutual information approach are employed to determine the embedding dimensions and time delays, facilitating the reconstruction of the phase space of the original time series. Subsequently, BLS is introduced to enhance the feature representation of the data, while the gating structures within the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are replaced by variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to form QLSTM, thereby further improving prediction accuracy. BLS-QLSTM is a generalized prediction framework, which can be used to predict the price fluctuations of stocks based on historical data. Extensive experiments on three real stock indices-CSI 300, SSEC, and CSI 500-demonstrate that the BLS-QLSTM model outperforms traditional LSTM and QLSTM models in six performance evaluation metrics: the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), precision, and accuracy. The results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the BLS-QLSTM model in handling chaotic financial time series data and predicting stock index price trends.

TI Many-body quantum chaos and dual-unitarity round-a-face
SO CHAOS
AB We propose a new type of locally interacting quantum circuits-quantum cellular automata-that are generated by unitary interactions round-a-face (IRF). Specifically, we discuss a set (or manifold) of dual-unitary IRFs with local Hilbert space dimension d [DUIRF(d)], which generate unitary evolutions both in space and time directions of an extended 1+1 dimensional lattice. We show how arbitrary dynamical correlation functions of local observables can be evaluated in terms of finite-dimensional completely positive trace preserving unital maps in complete analogy to recently studied circuits made of dual-unitary brick gates (DUBGs). The simplest non-vanishing local correlation functions in dual-unitary IRF circuits are shown to involve observables non-trivially supported on two neighboring sites. We completely characterize the ten-dimensional manifold of DUIRF(2) for qubits (d = 2) and provide, for d = 3, 4, ... , 7, empirical estimates of its dimensionality based on numerically determined dimensions of tangent spaces at an ensemble of random instances of dual-unitary IRF gates. In parallel, we apply the same algorithm to determine dimDUBG(d) and show that they are of similar order though systematically larger than dim DUIRF(d) for d = 2, 3, ... , 7. It is remarkable that both sets have a rather complex topology for d >= 3 in the sense that the dimension of the tangent space varies among different randomly generated points of the set. Finally, we provide additional data on dimensionality of the chiral extension of DUBG circuits with distinct local Hilbert spaces of dimensions d not equal d' residing at even/odd lattice sites.

TI Quantum dynamics simulation of the advection-diffusion equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The advection-diffusion equation is simulated via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and a superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The actual hardware implementation experiences significant noise. The results of the quantum simulator are compared with data from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with infidelities of the order 10-5. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelmingly large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed at the hardware level. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.

TI A Comparative Study of the Genetic Deep Learning Image Segmentation
   Algorithms
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Medical optical imaging, with the aid of the "terahertz tomography", is a novel medical imaging technique based on the electromagnetic waves. Such advanced imaging techniques strive for the detailed theoretical and computational analysis for better verification and validation. Two important aspects, the analytic approach for the understanding of the Schrodinger transforms and machine learning approaches for the understanding of the medical images segmentation, are presented in this manuscript. While developing an AI algorithm for complex datasets, the computational speed and accuracy cannot be overlooked. With the passage of time, machine learning approaches have been further modified using the Bayesian, genetic and quantum approaches. These strategies have boosted the efficiency of the machine learning, and specifically the deep learning tools, by taking into account the probabilistic, evolutionary and quantum qubits hypothesis and operations, respectively. The current research encompasses the detailed analysis of image segmentation algorithms based on the evolutionary approach. The image segmentation algorithm that converts the color model from RGB to HSI and the image segmentation algorithm that uses the clustering technique are discussed in detail, and further extensions of these genetic algorithms to quantum algorithms are proposed. Based on the genetic algorithm, the optimal selection of parameters is realized so as to achieve a better segmentation effect.

TI Quantum algorithmic measurement
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB There has been recent promising experimental and theoretical evidence that quantum computational tools might enhance the precision and efficiency of physical experiments. However, a systematic treatment and comprehensive framework are missing. Here we initiate the systematic study of experimental quantum physics from the perspective of computational complexity. To this end, we define the framework of quantum algorithmic measurements (QUALMs), a hybrid of black box quantum algorithms and interactive protocols. We use the QUALM framework to study two important experimental problems in quantum many-body physics: determining whether a system's Hamiltonian is time-independent or time-dependent, and determining the symmetry class of the dynamics of the system. We study abstractions of these problems and show for both cases that if the experimentalist can use her experimental samples coherently (in both space and time), a provable exponential speedup is achieved compared to the standard situation in which each experimental sample is accessed separately. Our work suggests that quantum computers can provide a new type of exponential advantage: exponential savings in resources in quantum experiments.
   Applying the language of computational complexity to study real-world experiments requires a rigorous framework. Here, the authors provide such a framework and establish that there can be an exponential savings in resources if an experimentalist can entangle apparatuses with experimental samples.

TI SU(2) hyper-clocks: Quantum engineering of spinor interferences for time
   and frequency metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In 1949, Ramsey's method [Phys. Rev. 76, 996 (1949)] of separated oscillating fields was elaborated boosting over many decades metrological performances of atomic clocks and becoming the standard technique for very high-precision spectroscopic measurements. A generalization of this interferometric method is presented replacing the two single coherent excitations by arbitrary composite laser pulses. The rotation of the state vector of a two-level system under the effect of a single pulse is described using the Pauli matrices basis of the SU(2) group. It is then generalized to multiple excitation pulses by a recursive Euler-Rodrigues-Gibbs algorithm describing a composition of rotations with different rotation axes. A general analytical formula for the phase shift associated with the clock's interferometric signal is derived. As illustrations, hyper-clocks based on three-pulse and five-pulse interrogation protocols are studied and shown to exhibit nonlinear cubic and quintic sensitivities to residual probe-induced light shifts. The presented formalism is well suited to optimize composite phase shifts produced by tailored quantum algorithms in order to design a new generation of optical frequency standards and robust engineering control of atomic interferences in atomic, molecular, and optical physics with cold matter and antimatter.

TI Circuit implementation and analysis of a quantum-walk based search
   complement algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a modified version of the quantum walk-based search algorithm created by Shenvi, Kempe and Whaley, also known as the SKW algorithm. In our version of the algorithm, we modified the evolution operator of the system so that it is composed by the product of the shift operator associated to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>n$$\end{document}-complete graph with self-loops and a perturbed coin operator based on the Hadamard operator that works as an oracle for the search. The modified evolution operator leads the opposite behavior as in the original algorithm, that is, the probability to measure the target state is reduced. We call this new behavior the search complement. Furthermore, we extend the functioning of the algorithm so that it targets at multiple nodes at the same time, which makes it suitable to be used as an initialization routine for the QAOA algorithm to solve restricted QUBO problems. Taking a multigraph and matrix approach, we were able to explain that the new algorithm decreases the probability of the target states given that there are less paths that lead towards the nodes that are associated to the target states in a Unitary Coined Discrete-Time Quantum Walk. The search complement algorithm was executed experimentally on IBM quantum processor ibmq_manila obtaining statistical distances \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\ell _1\le 0.0895$$\end{document} when decreasing the probability of one state out of four.

TI Classification of quantum correlation using deep learning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum correlation, as an intrinsic property of quantum mechanics, has been widely employed to test the fundamental physical principles and explore the quantum-enhanced technologies. However, such correlation would be drowned and even destroyed in the conditions of high levels of loss and noise, which drops into the classical realm and renders quantum advantage ineffective. Especially in low light conditions, conventional linear classifiers are unable to extract and distinguish quantum and classical correlations with high accuracy. Here we experimentally demonstrate the classification of quantum correlation using deep learning to meet the challenge in the quantum imaging scheme. We design the convolutional neural network to learn and classify the correlated photons efficiently with only 0.1 signal photons per pixel. We show that decreasing signal intensity further weakens the correlation and makes an accurate linear classification impossible, while the deep learning method has a strong robustness of such task with the accuracy of 99.99%. These results open up a new perspective to optimize the quantum correlation in low light conditions, representing a step towards diverse applications in quantum-enhanced measurement scenarios, such as super-resolution microscope, quantum illumination, etc.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Superconducting V3Si for quantum circuit applications
SO MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB V3Si thin films are known to be superconducting with transition temperatures up to 15 K, depending on the annealing temperature and the properties of the substrate underneath. Here we investigate the film structural properties with the prospect of further integration in silicon technology for quantum circuits. Two challenges have been identified: (i) the large difference in thermal expansion coefficient between V3Si and the Si substrate leads to large thermal strains after thermal processing, and (ii) the undesired silicide phase VSi2 forms when V3Si is deposited on silicon. The first of these is studied by depositing layers of 200 nm V3Si on wafers of sapphire and oxidized silicon, neither of which react with the silicide. These samples are then heated and cooled between room temperature and 860 degrees C, during which in-situ XRD measurements are performed. Analysis reveals a highly nonlinear stress development during heating with contributions from crystallization and subsequent grain growth, as well as the thermal expansion mismatch between silicide and substrate, while the film behaves thermoelastically during cooling. The second challenge is explored by depositing films of 20, 50, 100 and 200 nm of V3Si on bulk silicon. For each thickness, six samples are prepared, which are then annealed at temperatures between 500 and 750 degrees C, followed by measurements of their resistivity, residual resistance ratio and superconducting critical temperature. A process window is identified for silicide thicknesses of at least 100 nm, within which a trade-off needs to be made between the quality of the V3Si film and its consumption by the formation of VSi2.

TI Statistical evaluation of 571 GaAs quantum point contact transistors
   showing the 0.7 anomaly in quantized conductance using cryogenic on-chip
   multiplexing
SO CHIP
AB The mass production and the practical number of cryogenic quantum devices producible in a single chip are limited to the number of electrical contact pads and wiring of the cryostat or dilution refrigerator. It is, therefore, beneficial fi cial to contrast the measurements of hundreds of devices fabricated in a single chip in one cooldown process to promote the scalability, integrability, reliability, and reproducibility of quantum devices and to save evaluation time, cost and energy. Here, we used a cryogenic on-chip multiplexer architecture and investigated the statistics of the 0.7 anomaly observed on the fi rst three plateaus of the quantized conductance of semiconductor quantum point contact (QPC) transistors. Our single chips contain 256 split gate fi eld-effect QPC transistors (QFET) each, with two 16-branch multiplexed source-drain and gate pads, allowing individual transistors to be selected, addressed and controlled through an electrostatic gate voltage process. A total of 1280 quantum transistors with nano-scale dimensions are patterned in 5 different chips of GaAs heterostructures. From the measurements of 571 functioning QFETs taken at temperatures T = 1.4 K and T = 40 mK, it is found that the spontaneous polarisation model and Kondo effect do not fi t our results. Furthermore, some of the features in our data largely agreed with van Hove model with short-range interactions. Our approach provides further insight into the quantum mechanical properties and microscopic origin of the 0.7 anomaly in QFETs, paving the way for the development of semiconducting quantum circuits and integrated cryogenic electronics, for scalable quantum logic control, readout, synthesis, and processing applications.

TI Generalized Zeno Effect and Entanglement Dynamics Induced by Fermion
   Counting
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of a nonlinear sigma model. The physical requirements underlying this universal emergent behavior are conservation of the total number of particles in the system and its environment, and conservation of the purity of the state of the system by keeping a full record of all measurement outcomes. For both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance. Instead, we identify a finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible. Our finding that these properties do not rely on particle-number conservation has far-reaching implications for measurement-induced phenomena beyond noninteracting fermions, such as charge sharpening in random quantum circuits or generic interacting systems.

TI Higher-Order Spatially Squeezed Beam for Enhanced Spatial Measurements
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A scheme is proposed to realize high-precision spatial measurement of laser beams beyond quantum limit using a novel quantum state called the mth$m{\text{th}}$ order spatially squeezed state, which is the combination of a bright HGm,0$\text{HG}_{m,0}$ mode coherent state and squeezed vacuum HGm+1,0$\text{HG}_{m+1,0}$ mode state. An effective technique for the generation of a rectangular shape higher-order mode squeezed light with a maximum mode order of 5 is experimentally demonstrated using a doubling resonated optical parametric amplifier. Furthermore, the fourth order tilt- and displacement-squeezed beams are constructed and used to perform spatial tilt and displacement measurements, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio by 10 and 8.6 dB compared to the HG0,0$\text{HG}_{0,0}$ mode. The results indicate that high-order spatially squeezed states enhance measurement precision beyond the shot noise limit and are more prominent in back-action noise reduction. High-precision spatial measurement has potential practical applications in high-sensitivity atomic force microscope and super-resolution quantum imaging.

TI Label-free quantum super-resolution imaging using entangled multi-mode
   squeezed light
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this study, we explore the theoretical application of entangled multi-mode squeezed light for label-free optical super-resolution imaging. By generating massively entangled multi-mode squeezed light through an array of balanced beam splitters, using a single-mode squeezed light input, we create a multi-mode quantum light state with exceptional entanglement and noise suppression below the shot noise level. This significantly reduces imaging measurement errors compared to classical coherent state light imaging when the same number of photons are used on the imaging sample. We demonstrate how to optimize the imaging system's parameters to achieve the Heisenberg imaging error limit, taking into account the number of entangled modes and photons used. We also examine the effects of optical losses in the imaging system, necessitating adjustments to the optimized parameters based on the degree of optical loss. In practical applications, this new quantum imaging approach reduces the number of photons needed to achieve the same image quality by two orders of magnitude compared to classical imaging methods that use non-entangled, non-squeezed coherent state light.

TI Demonstration of a tunable non-Hermitian nonlinear microwave dimer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the phase locking synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.

TI Single-photon switches, beam splitters, and circulators based on the
   photonic Aharonov-Bohm effect
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single-photon devices such as switches, beam splitters, and circulators are funda-mental components to construct photonic integrated quantum networks. In this paper, two V-type three-level atoms coupled to a waveguide are proposed to simultaneously realize these functions as a multifunctional and reconfigurable single-photon device. When both the two atoms are driven by the external coherent fields, the difference in the phases of the coherent driving induces the photonic Aharonov-Bohm effect. Based on the photonic Aharonov-Bohm effect and setting the two-atom distance to match the constructive or destructive interference conditions among photons travelling along different paths, a single-photon switch is achieved since the incident single photon can be controlled from complete transmission to complete reflection by adjusting the amplitudes and phases of the driving fields. When properly changing the amplitudes and phases of the driving fields, the incident photons are split equally into multiple components as a beam splitter operated with different frequencies. Meanwhile, the single-photon circulator with reconfigurable circulation directions can also be obtained.

TI Accelerating fermionic system simulation on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A potential approach for demonstrating quantum advantage is using quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems. Quantum algorithms for fermionic system simulation usually involve the Hamiltonian evolution and measurements. However, in the second quantization representation, the number of terms in many fermion system Hamiltonians, such as molecular Hamiltonians, is substantial, approximately O(N4), where N is the number of molecular orbitals. Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these O(N4) Hamiltonian terms into O(N2) groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of N. Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to O(N2), whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require O(N3) measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions. Our approach saves a factor of N3 in the overall time for Hamiltonian evolution and measurements, significantly decreasing the time required for quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.

TI Circuit complexity and functionality: A statistical thermodynamics
   perspective
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge ("wormhole") connecting the two sides of an anti-de Sitter "eternal" black hole. Here, we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides an alternative perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length-an important problem in cryptography-as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with "gases of gates." This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.

TI Simulation-Based Design of a Silicon SPAD with Dead-Space-Aware
   Avalanche Region for Picosecond-Resolved Detection
SO SENSORS
AB This study presents a simulation-based design of a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) optimized for picosecond-resolved photon detection. Utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics, we implement a dead-space-aware impact ionization model to accurately capture history-dependent avalanche behavior. A guard ring structure and tailored doping profiles are introduced to improve electric field confinement and suppress edge breakdown. Simulation results show that the optimized device achieves a peak electric field of 7 x 10(7) V/m, a stable gain slope of -0.414, and consistent avalanche triggering across bias voltages. Transient analysis further confirms sub-20 ps response time under -6.5 V bias, validated by a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of similar to 17.8 ps. Compared to conventional structures without guard rings, the proposed design exhibits enhanced breakdown localization, reduced gain sensitivity, and improved timing response. These results highlight the potential of the proposed SPAD for integration into next-generation quantum imaging, time-of-flight LiDAR, and high-speed optical communication systems.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Photovoltaic Fault Identification and
   Diagnosis: A Systematic Review
SO ENERGIES
AB Photovoltaic (PV) fault detection is crucial because undetected PV faults can lead to significant energy losses, with some cases experiencing losses of up to 10%. The efficiency of PV systems depends upon the reliable detection and diagnosis of faults. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has been a growing trend in addressing these issues. The goal of this systematic review is to offer a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in AI-based methodologies for PV fault detection, consolidating the key findings from 31 research papers. An initial pool of 142 papers were identified, from which 31 were selected for in-depth review following the PRISMA guidelines. The title, objective, methods, and findings of each paper were analyzed, with a focus on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. ML and DL are particularly suitable for PV fault detection because of their capacity to process and analyze large amounts of data to identify complex patterns and anomalies. This study identified several AI techniques used for fault detection in PV systems, ranging from classical ML methods like k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest to more advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Quantum circuits and infrared imagery were also explored as potential solutions. The analysis found that DL models, in general, outperformed traditional ML models in accuracy and efficiency. This study shows that AI methodologies have evolved and been increasingly applied in PV fault detection. The integration of AI in PV fault detection offers high accuracy and effectiveness. After reviewing these studies, we proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based method for PV fault detection and classification.

TI String Diagram Rewrite Theory I: Rewriting with Frobenius Structure
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB String diagrams are a powerful and intuitive graphical syntax, originating in theoretical physics and later formalised in the context of symmetric monoidal categories. In recent years, they have found application in the modelling of various computational structures, in fields as diverse as Computer Science, Physics, Control Theory, Linguistics, and Biology.
   In several of these proposals, transformations of systems are modelled as rewrite rules of diagrams. These developments require a mathematical foundation for string diagram rewriting: whereas rewrite theory for terms is well-understood, the two-dimensional nature of string diagrams poses quite a few additional challenges.
   This work systematises and expands a series of recent conference papers, laying down such a foundation. As a first step, we focus on the case of rewrite systems for string diagrammatic theories that feature a Frobenius algebra. This common structure provides a more permissive notion of composition than the usual one available in monoidal categories, and has found many applications in areas such as concurrency, quantum theory, and electrical circuits. Notably, this structure provides an exact correspondence between the syntactic notion of string diagrams modulo Frobenius structure and the combinatorial structure of hypergraphs.
   Our work introduces a combinatorial interpretation of string diagram rewriting modulo Frobenius structures in terms of double-pushout hypergraph rewriting. We prove this interpretation to be sound and complete and we also show that the approach can be generalised to rewriting modulo multiple Frobenius structures. As a proof of concept, we show how to derive from these results a termination strategy for Interacting Bialgebras, an important rewrite theory in the study of quantum circuits and signal flow graphs.

TI Achieving spatial superresolution with engineered spatial modes
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Rayleigh's criterion sets a limit on the minimum separation between two incoherent point sources to be resolved into distinct objects. However, superresolution techniques have been developed to circumvent Rayleigh's criterion. These techniques mainly deal with single parameter estimation and require prior information about the centroid. Here, we use multi-parameter estimation tools to simultaneously and optimally retrieve information about the centroid and object separation. Collective measurements on photons using two-photon interference followed by spatially resolved detection have significantly improved over direct detection schemes. Following the same approach, we extend the analysis of the two-photon interference protocol to spatially engineered photons having a Pearson type VII profile with arbitrary positive excess kurtosis. We calculate the precision limits in the current measurement scheme as well as the ultimate precision limits based on the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for different spatial modes. We theoretically show that such engineered pulses show enhanced precision with increasing kurtosis in simultaneous estimation of the centroid and object separation compared to a Gaussian amplitude profile. Furthermore, we discuss an experimental setup to realize the proposed superresolution scheme.

TI Quantum correlated image recording through noisy and turbulent channels
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Various quantum imaging techniques have been shown to be effective at imaging through some aspects of traditionally difficult free-space channels, including ghost imaging through turbulent channels or quantum illumination through channels with noisy backgrounds. While effective, these techniques have only ever been shown to work independently, whereas real-world free-space channels are often both turbulent and noisy. This work experimentally demonstrates that quantum correlated imaging using a spontaneous parametric downconversion source and a time-tagging camera can be made robust against both turbulent media and a noisy background in free-space channels by implementing filtering based on the temporal and spatial correlations of paired photons. Furthermore, the filtering reduces accidental coincidence counts between uncorrelated photons, allowing the pair source to operate at high brightness which, in turn, leads to video-rate integration times. These quantum correlated recordings allow for improved object tracking, while the longer integration time images improve image fidelity over turbulent and noisy channels. This demonstration could allow for new improvements in communication, measurement, and sensing through turbulent and noisy free-space channels.

TI Quantum enhanced multiple-phase estimation with multi-mode
   N00N states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB N00N states are a key resource in quantum metrology, but the use of their multi-mode extension for multiparameter estimation has been elusive so far. Here, the authors use multi-mode N00N states - with N=2 photons in 4 modes - for multiple-phase estimation saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.
   Quantum metrology can achieve enhanced sensitivity for estimating unknown parameters beyond the standard quantum limit. Recently, multiple-phase estimation exploiting quantum resources has attracted intensive interest for its applications in quantum imaging and sensor networks. For multiple-phase estimation, the amount of enhanced sensitivity is dependent on quantum probe states, and multi-mode N00N states are known to be a key resource for this. However, its experimental demonstration has been missing so far since generating such states is highly challenging. Here, we report generation of multi-mode N00N states and experimental demonstration of quantum enhanced multiple-phase estimation using the multi-mode N00N states. In particular, we show that the quantum Cramer-Rao bound can be saturated using our two-photon four-mode N00N state and measurement scheme using a 4 x 4 multi-mode beam splitter. Our multiple-phase estimation strategy provides a faithful platform to investigate multiple parameter estimation scenarios.

TI Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics study on effect of Ge/Sn alloy on hot
   carrier relaxation of CsPbBr3 perovskite
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Perovskite solar cells have been a prominent focus in the field of photovoltaics in recent decades, owing to their exceptional performance: easy synthesis, and cost-effectiveness. The all -inorganic cesium -based perovskite CsPbBr3, known for its remarkable thermal stability, has become a star material in the field of optoelectronics due to its outstanding luminescent properties. Despite the high efficiency of lead -based perovskite solar cells, the toxicity associated with lead and the poor long-term stability of these devices remain significant barriers to their large-scale commercialization. As is well known, non -radiative electron -hole recombination significantly shortens the carrier lifetime, acting as a primary pathway for excited state charge to loss energy. This phenomenon directly affects the photovoltaic conversion efficiency and charge transfer performance of perovskite materials. Therefore, maximizing the reduction of non -radiative recombination energy loss in perovskite solar cells has become a crucial research focus. In this study, a systematic exploration is conducted by using a non -adiabatic molecular dynamics approach combined with time -dependent density functional theory to investigate the excited -state carrier dynamics of CsPbBr3 and its alloyed structures, CsPb0.75Ge0.25Br3 and CsPb0.5Ge0.25Sn0.25Br3. The study comprehensively analyzes the non -radiative electron -hole recombination scenarios and the mechanisms for reducing charge energy loss based on crystal structure, electronic properties, and excited -state properties. The research findings reveal that alloying with Sn/Ge can reduce the bandgap, increase nonadiabatic coupling, and shorten the decoherence time. The interplay of reduced quantum decoherence, smaller bandgap, and larger non -adiabatic coupling effectively decelerates the electron -hole recombination process. Consequently, the carrier lifetime of the CsPb0.75Ge0.25Br3 system extends by 1.6 times. Moreover, under the joint influence of Sn/Ge, the carrier lifetime of the CsPb0.5Ge0.25Sn0.25Br3 system extends by 4.2 times compared with those of the original system. The overall sequence follows CsPb0.5Ge0.25Sn0.25Br3 > CsPb0.75Ge0.25Br3 > CsPbBr3. This study underscores the significant influence of binary alloying of B -site metal cations (in the perovskite structure ABX3, where B -site refers to the metal cation) on the non -radiative electron -hole recombination of CsPbBr3.This research presents an effective alloying scheme that substantially prolongs the carrier lifetime of perovskites, offering a rational approach to optimizing solar cell performance. It lays the groundwork for the future design of perovskite solar cell materials.

TI Tuning microwave losses in superconducting resonators
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of superconducting resonators, particularly cavities for particle accelerators and micro cavities and thin film resonators for quantum computations and photon detectors, has been improved substantially by recent material treatments and technological advances. As a result, the niobium cavities have reached the quality factors Q similar to 10(11) at 1-2 GHz and 1.5 K and the breakdown radio-frequency (rf) fields H close to the dc superheating field of the Meissner state. These advances raise the questions of whether the state-of-the-art cavities are close to the fundamental limits, what these limits actually are, and to what extent the Q and H limits can be pushed by the materials nano structuring and impurity management. These issues are also relevant for many applications using high-Q thin film resonators, including single-photon detectors and quantum circuits. This topical review outlines basic physical mechanisms of the rf nonlinear surface impedance controlled by quasiparticles, dielectric losses and trapped vortices, as well as the dynamic field limit of the Meissner state. Sections cover methods of engineering an optimum quasiparticle density of states and superfluid density to reduce rf losses and kinetic inductance by pairbreaking mechanisms related to magnetic impurities, rf currents, and proximity-coupled metallic layers at the surface. A section focuses on mechanisms of residual surface resistance, which dominates rf losses at ultra low temperatures. Microwave losses of trapped vortices and their reduction by optimizing the concentration of impurities and pinning potential are also discussed.

TI Unification of finite symmetries in the simulation of many-body systems
   on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Symmetry is fundamental in the description and simulation of quantum systems. Leveraging symmetries in classical simulations of many-body quantum systems can result in significant overhead due to the exponentially growing size of some symmetry groups as the number of particles increases. Quantum computers hold the promise of achieving exponential speedup in simulating quantum many-body systems; however, a general method for utilizing symmetries in quantum simulations has not yet been established. In this work, we present a unified framework for incorporating symmetry group transforms on quantum computers to simulate many-body systems. The core of our approach lies in the development of efficient quantum circuits for symmetry-adapted projection onto irreducible representations of a group or pairs of commuting groups. We provide resource estimations for common groups, including the cyclic and permutation groups. Our algorithms demonstrate the capability to prepare coherent superpositions of symmetry-adapted states and to perform quantum evolution across a wide range of models in condensed-matter physics and ab initio electronic structure in quantum chemistry. Specifically, we execute a symmetry-adapted quantum subroutine for small molecules in first-quantization on noisy hardware and demonstrate the emulation of symmetry-adapted quantum phase estimation for preparing coherent superpositions of quantum states in various irreducible representations of a symmetry group. In addition, we present a discussion of open problems regarding treating symmetries in digital quantum simulations of many-body systems, paving the way for future systematic investigations into leveraging symmetries quantumly for practical quantum advantage. The broad applicability and rigorous resource estimation for symmetry transformations make our framework appealing for achieving provable quantum advantage on fault-tolerant quantum computers, especially for symmetry-related properties.

TI Relating interfacial Rossby wave interaction in shear flows with
   Feynman's two-state coupled quantum system model for the Josephson
   junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS
AB Here we show how Feynman's simplified model for the Josephson junction, as a macroscopic two -state coupled quantum system, has a one-to-one correspondence with the stable dynamics of two interfacial Rossby waves in piecewise linear shear flows. The conservation of electric charge and energy of the superconducting electron gas layers become, respectively, equivalent to the conservation of wave action and pseudoenergy of the Rossby waves. Quantumlike tunneling is enabled via action at a distance between the two Rossby waves. Furthermore, the quantumlike phenomena of avoided crossing between eigenstates, described by the Klein -Gordon equation, is obtained as well in the classical shear flow system. In the latter, it results from the inherent difference in pseudoenergy between the in -phase and antiphased normal modes of the interfacial waves. This provides an intuitive physical meaning to the role of the wave function's phase in the quantum system. A partial analog to the quantum collapse of the wave function is also obtained due to the existence of a separatrix between normal mode regions of influence on the phase plane, describing the system's dynamics. As for two -state quantum bits (qubits), the two-Rossby wave system solutions can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where the Hadamard gate transforms the two normal modes and eigenstates into an intuitive computational basis in which only one interface is occupied by a Rossby wave. Yet, it is a classical system which lacks exact analogs to collapse and entanglement, and thus cannot be used for quantum computation, even in principle.

TI Insight into neofunctionalization of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases in
   B,C-ring-opened triterpene biosynthesis in quinoa
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Bioactive triterpenes feature complex fused-ring structures, primarily shaped by the first-committed enzyme, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) in plant triterpene biosynthesis. Triterpenes with B,C-ring-opened skeletons are extremely rare with unknown formation mechanisms, harbouring unchartered chemistry and biology.Here, through mining the genome of Chenopodium quinoa followed by functional characterization, we identified a stress-responsive and neofunctionalized OSC capable of generating B,C-ring-opened triterpenes, including camelliol A and B and the novel (-)-quinoxide A as wax components of the specialized epidermal bladder cells, namely the quinoxide synthase (CqQS).Protein structure analysis followed by site-directed mutagenesis identified key variable amino acid sites underlying functional interconversion between pentacyclic beta-amyrin synthase (CqbAS1) and B,C-ring-opened triterpene synthase CqQS. Mutation of one key residue (N612K) in even evolutionarily distant Arabidopsis beta-amyrin synthase could generate quinoxides, indicating a conserved mechanism for B,C-ring-opened triterpene formation in plants. Quantum computation combined with docking experiments further suggests that conformations of conserved W613 and F413 of CqQS might be key to selectively stabilizing intermediate carbocations towards B,C-ring-opened triterpene formation.Our findings shed light on quinoa triterpene skeletal diversity and mechanisms underlying B,C-ring-opened triterpene biosynthesis, opening avenues towards accessing their chemistry and biology and paving the way for quinoa trait engineering and quality improvement.

TI Density function theory (DFT), spectroscopic, and molecular docking
   studies of an antidepressant drug
SO ADVANCEMENTS IN LIFE SCIENCES
AB Background: Amitriptyline is specifically recommended for the treatment of anxiety that is associated with depression. Since 1950, authorities have authorized its use for the treatment of severe mood disorders. One of amitriptyline's main antidepressant properties is its ability to block the central nervous system's serotonin and norepinephrine absorption.
   Methods: In this study, we computed the quantum computation data for amitriptyline (AMT) using density function theory (DFT) and molecular docking techniques. We evaluated the shifts in H-NMR and 13C-NMR using the GIAO approach and compared the obtained results with the experimental spectra. We conducted molecular docking, using two receptors to identify the most optimal interactions between ligands and proteins.
   Results: The study showed that the geometrical parameters (bond lengths, angles, and torsion angles) from DFT were very close to the experimental data, with an average discrepancy of 0.01 angstrom to 0.03 angstrom. We obtained comparable experimental and theoretical spectroscopic data. We performed molecular docking investigations on the 4IB4 and 8IRV proteins.
   Conclusion: This study investigates the properties of AMT at the quantum mechanical level. This paper meticulously investigates several significant parameters, comparing calculated spectroscopic results (UV, FTIR, HNMR, and CNMR) to experimental data. This study demonstrates the specified molecule's nonlinear optical properties. When docking the molecule with the two proteins, we calculate the binding energy to be -8.9 and -9.6 kcal/mol, indicating that the compound merits further investigation for its medicinal applications.

TI Decomposing all multipartite non-signalling channels via
   quasiprobabilistic mixtures of local channels in generalised
   probabilistic theories
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Non-signalling quantum channels-relevant in, e.g., the study of Bell and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scenarios-may be decomposed as an affine combinations of local operations in bipartite scenarios. Moreover, when these channels correspond to stochastic maps between classical variables, such a decomposition is possible even in multipartite scenarios. These two results have proven useful when studying the properties of these channels, such as their communication and information processing power, and even when defining measures of the non-classicality of physical phenomena (such as Bell non-classicality and steering). In this paper we show that such useful quasi-stochastic characterizations of channels may be unified and applied to the broader class of multipartite non-signalling channels. Moreover, we show that this holds for non-signalling channels in quantum theory, as well as in a larger family of generalised probabilistic theories. More precisely, we prove that channels are non-signalling if and only if they can be decomposed as an affine combinations of corresponding local operations, provided that the underlying physical theory is locally tomographic-a property that quantum theory satisfies. Our results then can be viewed as a generalisation of references (Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 170403) and (2013 Phys. Rev. A 88 022318) to the multipartite scenario for arbitrary tomographically local generalised probabilistic theories (including quantum theory). Our proof technique leverages Hardy's duotensor formalism, highlighting its utility in this line of research.

TI A surrogate model of sigma profile and COSMOSAC activity coefficient
   predictions of using transformer with SMILES input
SO DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB COSMOSAC is a model that allows apriori predictions of activity coefficients for characterizing solute-solvent interactions. The method requires the input of sigma profile, the charge distribution on the surface of the molecules, which can be obtained through quantum mechanics calculation. Since Sigma profile is a unique function of molecular structure, it is desirable that they can be obtained using a surrogate model of the quantum computation with a molecular description as input. Previously, a model, the Universal Digital Chemical Space (UDCS), that was developed that allowed us to calculate the Sigma profiles used Simplified Molecular-Input-Line-Entry system (SMILES) as input. In this work, an improved version of this approach was developed using a Transformer model to encode the SMILES text string. Successive input elements in the text string, known as K-mers was also encoded and errors of predicted moments of Sigma profiles and prediction of activity coefficient of reference solvents were also considered as in the loss function. Results showed that while the prediction accuracy of Sigma profile (coefficient of determination R 2 ) were not significantly improved, prediction accuracy of the first and second moment, especially the poorer ranked results; as well as the activity coefficients can be significantly improved with the inclusion of higher K-mers. Further improvement can be achieved with the inclusion of activity loss which substantially improved the accuracy of the 5th and 25th percentile of the moment loss and the activity coefficient of the species in n-hexane.

TI Training adaptations in magnetomyography
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY
AB Muscle strength training leads to neuromuscular adaptations that can be monitored by electromyography (EMG). In view of new technical possibilities to measure the neuromuscular system via contactless magnetomyography (MMG) using miniaturized quantum sensors (optically pumped magnetometer, OPM), the question arises whether MMG detects similar neuromuscular adaptations compared to EMG. Therefore, we developed an experimental design and a multimodal setup for the simultaneous measurement of EMG, triaxial OPM-MMG, and vigorimetry. As a proof of concept, right biceps brachii muscle activity was recorded during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and a 40 % MVC muscle fatigue paradigm over 3 min in 12 healthy, untrained subjects. Measurements were taken before and after a 30-day strength training program, with six subjects undergoing training and six serving as controls. EMG and MMG showed a similar increase in RMS during MVC and fatigue after training (r > 0.9). However, the MMG increase varied by vector component, with the magnetic flux signal along the muscle fibers showing the highest RMS increase. Furthermore, these MMG findings can be visualized three-dimensionally using one OPM, which is not possible with bipolar EMG. This is the first longitudinal MMG study to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring strength training-induced adaptations over 4 weeks, which highlights the opportunities and challenges of OPM-MMG for contactless neuromuscular monitoring.

TI Understanding mathematics of Grover's algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We analyze the mathematical structure of the classical Grover's algorithm and put it within the framework of linear algebra over the complex numbers. We also generalize it in the sense, that we are seeking not the one 'chosen' element (sometimes called a 'solution') of the dataset, but a set of m such 'chosen' elements (out of n>m). Besides, we do not assume that the so-called initial superposition is uniform. We assume also that we have at our disposal an oracle that 'marks,' by a suitable phase change phi, all these 'chosen' elements. In the first part of the paper, we construct a unique unitary operator that selects all 'chosen' elements in one step. The constructed operator is uniquely defined by the numbers phi and alpha which is a certain function of the coefficients of the initial superposition. Moreover, it is in the form of a composition of two so-called reflections. The result is purely theoretical since the phase change required to reach this heavily depends on alpha. In the second part, we construct unitary operators having a form of composition of two or more reflections (generalizing the constructed operator) given the set of orthogonal versors. We find properties of these operations, in particular, their compositions. Further, by considering a fixed, 'convenient' phase change phi, and by sequentially applying the so-constructed operator, we find the number of steps to find these 'chosen' elements with great probability. We apply this knowledge to study the generalizations of Grover's algorithm (m=1,phi=pi), which are of the form, the found previously, unitary operators.

TI Stress-energy tensor correlations across regular black holes horizons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Hawking radiation can be regarded as a spontaneous and continuous creation of virtual particleantiparticle pairs outside the event horizon of a black hole where strong tidal forces prevent the annihilation; the particle escapes to infinity contributing to the Hawking flux, while its corresponding antiparticle partner enters the event horizon and ultimately reaches the singularity. The aim of this paper is to investigate the energy density correlations between the Hawking particles and their partners across the event horizon of two models of nonsingular black holes by calculating the two-point correlation function of the density operator of a massless scalar field. This analysis is motivated by the fact that in acoustic black holes particle-partner correlations are signaled by the presence of a peak in the equal-time density-density correlator. Performing the calculation in a Schwarzschild black hole it was shown in Balbinot and Fabbri, [Quantum correlations across the horizon in acoustic and gravitational black holes, Phys. Rev. D 105, 045010 (2022).] that the peak does not appear, mainly because of the singularity. It is then interesting to consider what happens when the singularity is not present. In the Hayward and Simpson-Visser nonsingular black holes we show that the density-density correlator remains finite when the partner particle approaches the hypersurface that replaces the singularity, opening the possibility that partner-particle correlations can propagate towards other regions of spacetime instead of being lost in a singularity.

TI In Situ Studies of Stress Environment in Amorphous Solids Using
   Negatively Charged Nitrogen Vacancy (NV-) Centers in
   Nanodiamond
SO ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS
AB Amorphous solids, which show characteristic differences from crystals, are common in daily usage. Glasses, gels, and polymers are familiar examples, and polymers are particularly important in terms of their role in construction and crafting. Previous studies have mainly focused on the bulk properties of polymeric products, and the local properties are less discussed. Here, we designed a distinctive protocol using the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) center in nanodiamond to study properties inside polymeric products in situ. Choosing the curing of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and the polymerization of cyanoacrylate as subjects of investigation, we measured the time dependence of local pressure and strain in the materials during the chemical processes. From the measurements, we were able to probe the local shear stress inside the two polymeric substances in situ. By regarding the surprisingly large shear stress as the internal tension, we attempted to provide a microscopic explanation for the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of a bulk solid. Our current methodology is applicable to any kind of transparent amorphous solids with the stress in the order of MPa and to the study of in situ properties in nanoscale. With better apparatus, we expect the limit can be pushed to sub-MPa scale.

TI Dynamics and uncertainty for maximally entangled bipartite system
   constrained on a helicoid
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The classical and quantum dynamics of particles constrained on a right helicoid is discussed via Dirac approach. We show how the uncertainty in measurement for observables of maximally entangled system is affected by the total number of constrained particles sigma, external magnetic field (B) over right arrow; as well as by geometric parameters like the pitch. and the radial position of particles. In doing so we also highlight numeric bounds on the external field strengths to tune both intraparticle and bipartite entanglement and we remark that the bipartite entanglement is more robust to changes in the fields than the intraparticle entanglement, in this framework. We also highlight specific parameter regimes which lead the uncertainty (in measurement) to achieve respective parameter independence and, for a particular subset of commutation relations, the system remains confined in the quantum regime even in the limit sigma -> infinity. It is observed that the uncertainties are strongly influenced by the geometric parameters e.g., rho, and the strength of bipartite as well as intraparticle entanglement might be controllable through.. The energy equation for this setup is obtained and the additional terms are discussed which arise due to quantum correlations, orbit-orbit interaction and the normal Zeeman effect, which leads to the splitting of the energy level into 11 non-degenerate levels. Finally we comment that, a linkage of this phenomenology with Aharonov-Bohm like effect might be possible by strictly confining (B) over right arrow along the central axis of the helicoid.

TI InAs-Al hybrid devices passing the topological gap protocol
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and nonlocal transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations to ensure robustness against nonuniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin et al. (arXiv:2103.12217). This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and nonlocal transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred microelectronvolts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and reopening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at both ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20-60 & mu;eV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.

TI In-plane magnetic field-driven symmetry breaking in topological
   insulator-based three-terminal junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Topological surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators exhibit distinct magnetotransport properties. Here, a steering effect is demonstrated for three-terminal junctions, which is driven by an in-plane magnetic field and makes the junction act as a topoelectric current switch.
   Topological surface states of three-dimensional topological insulator nanoribbons and their distinct magnetoconductance properties are promising for topoelectronic applications and topological quantum computation. A crucial building block for nanoribbon-based circuits are three-terminal junctions. While the transport of topological surface states on a planar boundary is not directly affected by an in-plane magnetic field, the orbital effect cannot be neglected when the surface states are confined to the boundary of a nanoribbon geometry. Here, we report on the magnetotransport properties of such three-terminal junctions. We observe a dependence of the current on the in-plane magnetic field, with a distinct steering pattern of the surface state current towards a preferred output terminal for different magnetic field orientations. We demonstrate that this steering effect originates from the orbital effect, trapping the phase-coherent surface states in the different legs of the junction on opposite sides of the nanoribbon and breaking the left-right symmetry of the transmission across the junction. The reported magnetotransport properties demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field is not only relevant but also very useful for the characterization and manipulation of transport in three-dimensional topological insulator nanoribbon-based junctions and circuits, acting as a topoelectric current switch.

TI Beyond automation: Unveiling the potential of agentic intelligence
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Agentic intelligence encompasses artificial intelligence systems imbued with autonomous capacity, facilitating independent decision-making beyond conventional automation frameworks. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol across three authoritative databases and others, examining peer-reviewed literature from 2020 to 2025 (March). From 1800 identified publications, 191 studies met inclusion criteria, revealing research concentrations: 35.1 % (64 studies) address computational scalability, privacy/security vulnerabilities, ethical/legal ramifications, and interpretability constraints; 24.0 % (44) each examine Industry 4.0 transformation and healthcare intervention systems; 9.8 % (18) investigate autonomous cybersecurity architectures; 16.4 % (30) each focus on personalized digital assistance and theoretical foundations; while 14.7 % (27) each explore intelligent energy distribution networks, quantum computational integration with robotics, and sustainability imperatives. The analysis juxtaposes agentic intelligence against traditional automation, elucidating distinctive characteristics within variable environments. Foundational technological enablers, large language models, reinforcement learning algorithms, multi-agent system frameworks, cognitive architectures, and edge-cloud computing integration propel advancements in capabilities. Implementations spanning energy distribution networks, cybersecurity mechanisms, manufacturing ecosystems, healthcare platforms, and digital assistance technologies demonstrate transformative potential. The investigation identifies computational limitations, ethical challenges, and trust-related impediments, providing a comparative assessment of advantages and constraints. Future research trajectories, including quantum computation, are proposed to advance theoretical and practical dimensions. This synthesis provides researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an authoritative examination of agentic intelligence foundations and implications for advanced autonomous system development.

TI Anomalous thermodynamic cost of clock synchronization
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Clock synchronization is critically important in positioning, navigation and timing systems. While its performance has been intensively studied in a wide range of disciplines, much less is known for the fundamental thermodynamics of clock synchronization-what limits the precision and how to optimize the energy cost for clock synchronization. Here, we report the first experimental investigation of two stochastic autonomous clocks synchronization, unveiling the thermodynamic relation between the entropy cost and clock synchronization in an open cavity optomechanical system. Two interacting clocks are synchronized spontaneously owing to the disparate decay rates of hybrid modes by engineering the controllable cavity-mediated dissipative coupling. The measured dependence of the degree of synchronization on the overall entropy cost exhibits an unexpected non-monotonic characteristic, while the relation between the degree of synchronization and the entropy cost for the synchronization is monotonically decreasing. The investigation of transient dynamics of clock synchronization exposes a trade-off between energy and time consumption. Our results demonstrate the possibility of clock synchronization in an effective linear system, reveal the fundamental relation between clock synchronization and thermodynamics, and have a great potential for precision measurements, distributed quantum networks, and biological science.

TI A Truck-Borne System Based on Cold Atom Gravimeter for Measuring the
   Absolute Gravity in the Field
SO SENSORS
AB The cold atom gravimeter (CAG) has proven to be a powerful quantum sensor for the high-precision measurement of gravity field, which can work stably for a long time in the laboratory. However, most CAGs cannot operate in the field due to their complex structure, large volume and poor environmental adaptability. In this paper, a home-made, miniaturized CAG is developed and a truck-borne system based on it is integrated to measure the absolute gravity in the field. The measurement performance of this system is evaluated by applying it to measurements of the gravity field around the Xianlin reservoir in Hangzhou City of China. The internal and external coincidence accuracies of this measurement system were demonstrated to be 35.4 mu Gal and 76.7 mu Gal, respectively. Furthermore, the theoretical values of the measured eight points are calculated by using a forward modeling of a local high-resolution digital elevation model, and the calculated values are found to be in good agreement with the measured values. The results of this paper show that this home-made, truck-borne CAG system is reliable, and it is expected to improve the efficiency of gravity surveying in the field.

   Chamaecostus cuspidatus (Nees & Mart.) C. Specht & D.W. Stev.
   against peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) protein
   of type 2 diabetes mellitus
SO PLANT SCIENCE TODAY
AB Abnormalities in the body's propensity to control and take advantage of sugar as fuel result in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Targeting the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) protein, which controls the expression of proteins critical to the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is an intriguing approach for treating T2DM. Therefore, the current study focuses on predicting more effective natural compounds for better treatment. Chamaecostus cuspidatus (Nees & Mart.) C. Specht & D. W. Stev. belonging to the family Costaceae, traditionally acknowledged as an insulin herb, has been taken for the study. Phytocompounds were collected from the published literature, followed by insilicoADMETtoxicity checking and molecular docking study against the PPARG protein at its specific binding sites. A quantum computation study was performed to check the reactivity of the ligands and normal mode analysis (NMA) was employed to study and characterize the selected protein's flexibility and stability with network analysis. Anti-diabetic drug Biguanide (Metformin) was taken as a standard drug. From this study, Kaempferol resulted with a premier imperative affinity of-7.1 kcal/Mol, with the lowest band gap energy that forms one conventional hydro bond with His466, which is suggested as a new drug molecule for T2DM treatment. In molecular dynamics simulation, the natural compound Kaempferol reflected better stability with the target protein PPARG.

TI Transmission Spectrum and Four-Wave Mixing in Three-Cavity Hybrid
   Optomechanical System
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective The rapid development of cavity optomechanical systems has attracted extensive attention, and these systems are widely used in quantum information and precision measurement. In recent years, three -cavity optomechanical systems have attracted considerable attention. Compared with the single -mode optomechanical system, the multiple -mode system provides significantly higher flexible controllability. Furthermore, optomechanically induced transparency and four -wave mixing have been research hotspots in different optomechanical systems. For example, the four -wave mixing in a hybrid optomechanical system is theoretically investigated, which has important implications for the nonlinear optical properties. It is of great significance for theoretically exploring the transmission spectrum and four -wave mixing in a three -cavity optomechanical system.Methods The hybrid optomechanical system consists of a microwave cavity a with resonance frequency omega a and an optical cavity c1 with resonance frequency omega c1, which are coupled to a common mechanical resonator b, while an optical cavity c2 with resonance frequency omega c2 is coupled to the optical cavity c1. A strong pump laser beam Ee with frequency omega e is applied to the microwave cavity a. A weak probe laser beam Ep with frequency omega p and a strong pump laser beam Eo with frequency omega o are applied to the optical cavity c1 simultaneously. In the rotating frame of the pump fields with frequency omega e and omega o, the whole Hamiltonian of the system is obtained. According to the Heisenberg equation and making the ansatz, we finally obtain the transmission spectrum and the four -wave mixing spectrum intensity. Then, we investigate how the evolutions of the transmission spectrum and the four -wave mixing spectrum are affected by the coupling strength and the frequency of the mechanical resonator.Results and Discussions When the optical cavity c2 is absent in the hybrid optomechanical system (J=0), the transmission spectrum of the probe field shows a Lorentzian line shape. However, when J not equal 0, the Lorentzian peak splits into two symmetrical peaks and a transparent window occurs (Fig. 2). It is clear that with the increase in the coupling strength from J=0.5 kappa o to J=2 kappa o, the distance between the peaks increases, and the peak value of the transmission spectrum of the probe field also increases (Fig. 3). We depict the variation of the four -wave mixing spectrum with the detuning of the probe field -cavity field Delta p for J=0, 0.5 kappa o, kappa o, 2 kappa o when omega m=27c x 5.6 MHz. In the case of Delta c1=Delta c2=Delta a=0, when J=0, the four -wave mixing spectrum has three peaks. A Lorentzian peak locates at Delta p=0 and two splitting peaks locate on both sides of the Lorentzian peak [Fig. 4(a)]. With the choice of J not equal 0, a significant change in the four -wave mixing spectrum can be observed. The Lorentzian peak splits into two peaks. As the coupling strength J increases, the peak value decreases greatly and the distance between the peaks gradually increases [Figs. 4(b)-(d)]. Next, we study how the evolution of the four -wave mixing spectrum is affected by the frequency of the mechanical resonator while the optical cavity c2 is not in the hybrid optomechanical system (J=0). It can be seen that as the frequency of the mechanical resonator increases, the peak value of the four -wave mixing spectrum gradually decreases.
   Further, the peaks on both sides of the four -wave mixing spectrum located at +/-Delta p just correspond to the frequency omega m of the mechanical resonator (Fig. 5). Moreover, we investigate the four wave mixing spectrum as a function of the detuning Delta p for the frequencies of mechanical resonator of omega m=2 7c x4.6 MHz, omega m=2 7c x 5.6 MHz, and omega m=27c x6.6 MHz when J= kappa o. As the frequency of the mechanical resonator increases, the peak value and the distance between the two symmetrical splitting peaks in the middle decrease. The positions of the peaks on both sides exactly correspond to the three different frequencies of the mechanical resonator. The results show that the four -wave mixing can be tuned by the frequency of the mechanical resonator (Fig. 6).Conclusions We investigate the optomechanically induced transparency and four -wave mixing in a hybrid optomechanical system composed of two optical cavities, a microwave cavity, and a mechanical resonator. When the microwave cavity is driven to the red sideband and the two optical cavities are driven to the blue sideband, the optomechanically induced transparency can be changed by changing the coupling strength between the two optical cavities. Furthermore, the four -wave mixing spectrum can be modulated by controlling the coupling strength between the two optical cavities and by changing the frequency of the mechanical resonator during resonant detuning Delta p = 0. At the same time, a nonlinear optical method for measuring the frequency of a mechanical resonator is provided. The positions of the peaks on both sides of the four -wave mixing spectrum correspond exactly to the frequency of the mechanical resonator. These results have important significance and application prospects in quantum sensing and quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement spectrum in general free fermionic systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The statistical mechanics characterization of finite subsystems embedded in an infinite system is a fundamental question of quantum physics. Nevertheless, a full closed form for all required entropic measures does not exist in the general case, even for free systems, when the finite system in question is composed of several disjoint intervals. Here we develop a mathematical framework based on the Riemann-Hilbert approach to treat this problem in the one-dimensional case where the finite system is composed of two disjoint intervals and in the thermodynamic limit (both intervals and the space between them contains an infinite number of lattice sites and the result is given as a thermodynamic expansion). To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we compute the change in the entanglement and negativity spectra namely the spectrum of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix with or without time reversal of one of the intervals. We do this in the case that the distance between the intervals is much larger than their size. The method we use can be easily applied to compute any power in an expansion in the ratio of the distance between the intervals to their size. We expect these results to provide the necessary mathematical apparatus to address relevant questions in concrete physical scenarios, namely the structure and extent of quantum correlations in fermionic systems subject to local environments.

TI Quantum point-contact sensors: State of the art and prospects
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB We present generalized information on the new type of universal quantum detectors operating on the basis of Yanson point contacts. The properties and capabilities of quantum point-contact detectors are totally different from those of conventional sensors based on the principle of changing electric conductance. To give an idea of the nature of these differences, we examine the spectral properties of Yanson point contacts, which are fundamental for understanding the operation mechanisms of quantum point-contact sensors. One of the most important features that determine the functioning of point-contact sensing elements is the quantum detection mechanisms discovered during the study of the point-contact gas-sensitive effect. The detection mechanisms based on the energy principles of analysis and conductance quantization are considered. The innovative methods developed using breath analysis with quantum point-contact sensors made it possible for the first time to detect in real time carcinogenic strains of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and the hormonal background of the human body. The future work will be focused on universalizing the technology of quantum point-contact sensors, addressing various problems including evaluation of the general state of the human body and solutions to global ecological problems.

TI How advances in theoretical chemistry meet industrial expectations in
   electrocatalysts for water splitting
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Fundamental knowledge about heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced in the last few years due to the awareness of the role of non-weakly correlated electrons in open-shell magnetic catalysts, and their degrees of freedom (charge, spin, orbital and structure). Such recognition represents a paradigm shift, because it proves the existence of non-linear oscillations with orbital filling, and also feasible deviations from the Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) principle. By including all the relevant quantum interactions, orbital engineering seeks to identify potentially successful catalysts aprioristically by first principles. The approach does not include nor admit shortcuts. Two steps are needed to narrow down the synthetic quest for optimal catalysts (via orbital configurations), to boost and, concomitantly, fully understand catalytic activities: 1) obtaining the electronic properties, bond topology, populations, magnetic (spin-orbital ordering) structure to infer stability and reactivity, and 2) achieving complete mechanistic insights. Thus, quantum chemistry can be a powerful tool to reinforce traditional industrial developments in water electrolysis and accelerate catalytic designs by implementing physical rationality, while reducing considerably time and waste. This perspective intends to clarify the electrocatalytic challenges in using water electrolysers (WEL), and the advanced computational approaches to tackle them from the perspective of industrial needs.
   In electrolysers about 10-15% of CAPEX per kg_H2 h-1 is possible via optimizing spin-potentials: a seed from quantum correlations.

TI Experimental indications of non-classical brain functions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach maybe applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history. Proton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as an entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that today's NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) where we minimized the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetization were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.

TI Mutual Information and Quantum Coherence in Minimum Error Discrimination
   of N Pure Equidistant Quantum States
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the quantum state discrimination problem under the minimum error (ME) strategy for a set of N pure equidistant states. These states are characterized by the property that the inner product between any pair of states is given by a unique complex number S. We provide the explicit form of the states and analyze their main structural properties. The optimal success probability for ME discrimination is evaluated as a function of the number of states, as well as the modulus and phase of the inner product S. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme for implementing the ME discrimination of equidistant states. We also investigate the quantum coherence consumed in the implementation of the minimum error discrimination of the equidistant states, which has an established operational interpretation as cryptographic randomness gain. As an application, we propose a quantum communication protocol in which Alice prepares and sends one of the equidistant states, while Bob applies the minimum error discrimination to extract the classical information encoded in the state. Finally, we discuss the optimal conditions under which the protocol achieves an optimal balance of classical correlations and quantum coherence, thereby ensuring effective information transfer and cryptographic security.

TI Spatiotemporal coupling induced controllable orientation of photonic
   orbital angular momentum at subwavelength scale
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Recently, the emergence of transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) as a novel characteristic of light has captured substantial attention, and the significance of adjustable OAM orientation has been underscored due to its pivotal role in the interaction between light and matter. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to manipulate the orientation of photonic OAM at subwavelength scales, leveraging spatiotemporal coupling. By tightly focusing a wavepacket containing dual spatiotemporal vortices and a spatial vortex through a high numerical aperture lens, the emergence of intricate coupling phenomena leads to entangled and intricately twisted vortex tunnels. As a consequence, the orientation of spatial OAM deviates from the conventional light axis. Through theoretical scrutiny, we unveil that the orientation of photonic OAM within the focal field is contingent upon the signs of the topological charges in both spatiotemporal and spatial domains. Additionally, the absolute values of these charges govern the precise orientation of OAM within their respective quadrants. Moreover, augmenting the pulse width of the incident light engenders a more pronounced deflection angle of photonic OAM. By astutely manipulating these physical parameters, unparalleled control over the spatial orientation of OAM becomes achievable. The augmented optical degrees of freedom introduced by this study hold considerable potential across diverse domains, including optical tweezers, spin-orbit angular momentum coupling, and quantum communication.

TI Potts model solver based on hybrid physical and digital architecture
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The Potts model describes Ising-model-like interacting spin systems with multivalued spin components, and ground-state search problems of the Potts model can be efficiently mapped onto various integer optimization problems thanks to the rich expression of the multivalued spins. Here, we demonstrate a solver of this model based on hybrid computation using physical and digital architectures, wherein a digital computer updates the interaction matrices in the iterative calculations of the physical Ising-model solvers. This update of interactions corresponds to learning from the Ising solutions, which allows us to save resources when embedding a problem in a physical system. We experimentally solved integer optimization problems (graph coloring and graph clustering) with this hybrid architecture in which the physical solver consisted of coupled degenerate optical parametric oscillators.
   Hybrid computing seeks to divide operations based on the strengths of digital, analogue or physical architectures. Here, approximate solutions to the multi-state Potts model are found using a physical Ising solver, networked degenerate optical parametric oscillators, repeatedly with learning processes.

TI Network quantum steering enables randomness certification without seed
   randomness
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum networks with multiple sources allow the observation of quantum nonlocality without inputs. Consequently, the incompatibility of measurements is not a necessity for observing quantum nonlocality when one has access to multiple quantum sources. Here we investigate the minimal scenario without inputs where one can observe any form of quantum nonlocality. We show that even two parties with two sources that might be classically correlated can witness a form of quantum nonlocality, in particular quantum steering, in networks without inputs if one of the parties is trusted, that is, performs a fixed known measurement. We term this effect as swap-steering. The scenario presented in this work is minimal to observe such an effect. Consequently, a scenario exists where one can observe quantum steering but not Bell non-locality. We further construct a linear witness to observe swap-steering. Interestingly, this witness enables self-testing of the quantum states generated by the sources and the local measurement of the untrusted party. This in turn allows certifying two bits of randomness that can be obtained from the measurement outcomes of the untrusted device without the requirement of initially feeding the device with randomness.

TI Empowering high-dimensional optical fiber communications with integrated
   photonic processors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mode-division multiplexing (MDM) in optical fibers enables multichannel capabilities for various applications, including data transmission, quantum networks, imaging, and sensing. However, high-dimensional optical fiber systems, usually necessity bulk-optics approaches for launching different orthogonal fiber modes into the optical fiber, and multiple-input multiple-output digital electronic signal processing at the receiver to undo the arbitrary mode scrambling introduced by coupling and transmission in a multi-mode fiber. Here we show that a high-dimensional optical fiber communication system can be implemented by a reconfigurable integrated photonic processor, featuring kernels of multichannel mode multiplexing transmitter and all-optical descrambling receiver. Effective mode management can be achieved through the configuration of the integrated optical mesh. Inter-chip MDM optical communications involving six spatial- and polarization modes was realized, despite the presence of unknown mode mixing and polarization rotation in the circular-core optical fiber. The proposed photonic integration approach holds promising prospects for future space-division multiplexing applications.
   Leveraging photonic integration and photonic computing acceleration, Lu et al. proposed and demonstrated a scalable integrated silicon photonic processor that enables high-capacity optical fiber communications using various fiber spatial modes.

TI Quantum and Classical Contributions to Entropy Production in Fermionic
   and Bosonic Gaussian Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB As previously demonstrated, the entropy production-a key quantity characterizing the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes-is related to generation of correlations between degrees of freedom of the system and its thermal environment. This raises the question of whether such correlations are of a classical or quantum nature, namely, whether they are accessible through local measurements on the correlated degrees of freedom. We address this problem by considering fermionic and bosonic Gaussian systems. We show that, for fermions, the entropy production is mostly quantum due to the parity superselection rule that restricts the set of physically allowed measurements to projections on the Fock states, thus significantly limiting the amount of classically accessible correlations. In contrast, in bosonic systems a much larger amount of correlations can be accessed through Gaussian measurements. Specifically, while the quantum contribution may be important at low temperatures, in the high-temperature limit the entropy production corresponds to purely classical position-momentum correlations. Our results demonstrate an important difference between fermionic and bosonic systems regarding the existence of a quantum-to-classical transition in the microscopic formulation of the entropy production. They also show that entropy production can be mainly caused by quantum correlations even in the weak coupling limit, which admits a description in terms of classical rate equations for state populations, as well as in the low particle density limit, where the transport properties of both bosons and fermions converge to those of classical particles.

TI Enhanced microwave-optical conversion via ancillary electro-mechanical
   coupling
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Converting signals from the microwave to the optical domain has attracted great attention due to its potential applications in the field of quantum networks. Achieving efficient transduction is a significant yet challenging task, where a high efficiency at single photon level and low added noise are required. Electro-opto-mechanics have been proven to be efficient to convert microwave and optical photons bidirectionally. In this work, we propose and demonstrate an enhanced microwave-optical conversion in an electro-opto-mechanical system by introducing a mechanical ancilla attached the microwave resonator. Based on the ancillary electromechanical coupling, the damping rate of the microwave resonator is controlled and further leads to significant enhancement in conversion, such as the increase of conversion efficiency, broadening of conversion bandwidth and reduction of added noise. It provides a feasible approach to realize a broadband microwave-optical conversion with high efficiency. Moreover, the reduced added noise may break the limitation of quantum transduction due to the ancillary electromechanical coupling. Our scheme is also applicable and feasible for opto-mechanics and other systems to achieve practical quantum interface.

TI Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based
   Fabry-Perot microcavity
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin with spin-resolved optical transitions. This makes them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface, an important building block of quantum networks. However, the fraction of coherently scattered photons is intrinsically low, limiting the achievable communication rates. To address this problem, we integrate V2 centers within a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Perot microcavity. We find that SiC is uniquely suited for this approach, offering extremely low losses as we evidence by a high cavity finesse F approximate to 40 000 and naturally available maximal cavity-emitter coupling due to the perfect alignment of polarization modes and the dipole orientation. We observe a 13.3-fold Purcell enhancement of the zero phonon line of a single emitter, constituting an efficient source of coherent photons for this novel material platform, and opening the path toward a deterministic spin-photon interface.

TI A reinforcement learning approach to the design of quantum chains for
   optimal energy and state transfer
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a bottom-up approach, based on reinforcement learning, to the design of a chain achieving efficient excitation-transfer performances. We assume distance-dependent interactions among particles arranged in a chain under tight-binding conditions. Starting from two particles and a localised excitation, we gradually increase the number of constitutents of the system so as to improve the transfer probability. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal locations and numbers of particles as a Markov decision process: we use proximal policy optimization to find the optimal chain-building policies and the optimal chain configurations under different scenarios. We consider both the case in which the target is a sink connected to the end of the chain and the case in which the target is the right-most particle in the chain. We address the problem of disorder in the chain induced by particle positioning errors. We apply our methodology to a simplified model of a relevant physical platform, consisting of trapped ions. We are able to achieve extremely high excitation transfer in all cases, with different chain configurations and properties depending on the specific conditions.

TI Proposal to Test a Transient Deviation from Quantum Mechanics'
   Predictions for Bell's Experiment
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum mechanics predicts correlations between measurements performed in distant regions of a spatially spread entangled state to be higher than allowed by intuitive concepts of Locality and Realism. These high correlations forbid the use of nonlinear operators of evolution (which would be desirable for several reasons), for they may allow faster-than-light signaling. As a way out of this situation, it has been hypothesized that the high quantum correlations develop only after a time longer than L/c has elapsed (where L is the spread of the entangled state and c is the velocity of light). In shorter times, correlations compatible with Locality and Realism would be observed instead. A simple hidden variables model following this hypothesis is described. It is based on a modified Wheeler-Feynman theory of radiation. This hypothesis has not been disproved by any of the experiments performed to date. A test achievable with accessible means is proposed and described. It involves a pulsed source of entangled states and stroboscopic record of particle detection during the pulses. Data recorded in similar but incomplete optical experiments are analyzed, and found consistent with the proposed model. However, it is not claimed, in any sense, that the hypothesis has been validated. On the contrary, it is stressed that a complete, specific test is absolutely needed.

TI Experimental demonstration of multiparty quantum secret sharing and
   conference key agreement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) and conference key agreement (CKA) provide efficient encryption approaches for realizing multi-party secure communication, which are essential components of quantum networks. In this work, a practical, scalable, verifiable (k, n) threshold continuous variable QSS protocol secure against eavesdroppers and dishonest players are proposed and demonstrated. The protocol does not require preparing the laser source by each player and phase locking of independent lasers. The parameter evaluation and key extraction can be accomplished by only the dealer and the corresponding player. By using the multiple sideband modulation, a single heterodyne detector can extract the information of multiple players. The practical security of the system is considered. The system is versatile, it can support the CKA protocol by only modifying the classic post-processing and requiring no changes to the underlying hardware architecture. By implementing the QSS and CKA protocols with five parties over 25 km (55 km) single-mode fibers, a key rate of 0.0061 (7.14 x 10(-4)) bits per pulse is observed. The results significantly reduces the system complexity and paves the way for the practical applications of QSS and CKA with efficient utilization of resources and telecom technologies.

TI Chiral quantum optics with giant atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In quantum optics, it is common to assume that atoms are pointlike objects compared to the wavelength of the electromagnetic field they interact with. However, this dipole approximation is not always valid, e.g., if atoms couple to the field at multiple discrete points. Previous work has shown that superconducting qubits coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide can behave as such "giant atoms" and then can interact through the waveguide without decohering, a phenomenon that is not possible with small atoms. Here, we show that this decoherence-free interaction is also possible when the coupling to the waveguide is chiral, i.e., when the coupling depends on the propagation direction of the light. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which the giant atoms in such chiral architectures exhibit dark states. In particular, we show that unlike small atoms, giant atoms in a chiral waveguide can reach a dark state even without being excited by a coherent drive. We also show that in the driven-dissipative regime, dark states can be populated faster in giant atoms. The results presented here lay a foundation for applications based on giant atoms in quantum simulations and quantum networks with chiral settings.

TI Measuring, processing, and generating partially coherent light with
   self-configuring optics
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Optical phenomena always display some degree of partial coherence between their respective degrees of freedom. Partial coherence is of particular interest in multimodal systems, where classical and quantum correlations between spatial, polarization, and spectral degrees of freedom can lead to fascinating phenomena (e.g., entanglement) and be leveraged for advanced imaging and sensing modalities (e.g., in hyperspectral, polarization, and ghost imaging). Here, we present a universal method to analyze, process, and generate spatially partially coherent light in multimode systems by using self-configuring optical networks. Our method relies on cascaded self-configuring layers whose average power outputs are sequentially optimized. Once optimized, the network separates the input light into its mutually incoherent components, which is formally equivalent to a diagonalization of the input density matrix. We illustrate our method with numerical simulations of Mach-Zehnder interferometer arrays and show how this method can be used to perform partially coherent environmental light sensing, generation of multimode partially coherent light with arbitrary coherency matrices, and unscrambling of quantum optical mixtures. We provide guidelines for the experimental realization of this method, including the influence of losses, paving the way for self-configuring photonic devices that can automatically learn optimal modal representations of partially coherent light fields.
   The PCLA analyzes partially coherent light by optimizing output power through a series of self-configuring Mach-Zehnder interferometers, effectively decomposing the input light field into its incoherent components.

Such processes are well known to occur also in light emission from free electrons, known as coherent cathodoluminescence. Unlike atomic systems, free electrons have an unbounded energy spectrum, and, thus, all their emission mechanisms rely on electron recoil, in addition to the classical properties of the dielectric medium. To date, all experimental and theoretical studies of super- and subradiance from free electrons assumed only classical correlations between particles. However, dependence on quantum correlations, such as entanglement between free electrons, has not been studied. Recent advances in coherent shaping of free-electron wave functions motivate the investigation of such quantum regimes of super- and subradiance. In this Letter, we show how a pair of coincident path-entangled electrons can demonstrate either super- or subradiant light emission, depending on the two-particle wave function. By choosing different free-electron Bell states, the spectrum and emission pattern of the light can be reshaped, in a manner that cannot be accounted for by a classical mixed state. We show these results for light emission in any optical medium and discuss their generalization to many-body quantum states. Our findings suggest that light emission can be sensitive to the explicit quantum state of the emitting matter wave and possibly serve as a nondestructive measurement scheme for measuring the quantum state of many-body systems.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF COMPLEX STRUCTURES WITH CHAOTIC PHENOMENA AND
   DETERMINATION OF CHAOS IN STOCHASTIC COMPLEX SYSTEMS
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we investigate the consequences of chaotic peculiarities through multiple scattering and collective flows within the multi-particle quantum correlations observations by intensity interferometry. We determine the initially computed systems concentration aspects for the optimum source distribution in multi-particle interferences which are analyzed under the presence of an integrated flowing distribution. This study probed that the overall collective flow phase functions contained the specific terms that possess the propensity to cancel one another in the specified regimes. The observed multiplicities are examined to exhibit various scattering amplitudes with intermediate multiplicities whenever they contained the traverse activity from their source point to the freeze-out regimes. We demonstrate the intrinsic characteristics of multiple dispersion influences within the interferometry and also manifest the simultaneous scattering consequences in the absorption spectra. The efficient density distributions are dependent on the initial source dispersion employing the various meaningful approaches involving several scattering at different energy and an optical paradigm with moderate temperatures-momenta regimes. The results underscore the significance of cogitating correlations in deciphering the nonlinear system peculiarities and bestowing extraordinary perceptiveness into the convoluted essence of complex systems. The findings of this research probe the new specific perceptiveness which is commensurable to the system performance of incoherent material with peculiar aspects and such contemplation divulges the remunerative significance in engineering fields.

TI Approaching the scaling limit of transport through lattices with
   dephasing
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We examine the stationary-state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single-particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super-diffusive-to-diffusive transition in a lattice with long-range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to 10(4) sites, representing an increase of 10 to 40 times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine-learning-based classification and extended reservoir approaches for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.

TI Frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber using
   continuous-wave fields
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB In large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers, photons are the fundamental carriers of information as so-called flying qubits. They may also serve as the interconnect between different components of a hybrid architecture, which might comprise atomic and solid-state platforms operating at visible or near-infrared wavelengths, as well as optical links in the telecom band. Quantum frequency conversion is the pathway to change the color of a single photon while preserving its quantum state. Currently, nonlinear crystals are utilized for this process. However, their performance is limited by their acceptance bandwidth, tunability, polarization sensitivity, and undesired background emission. A promising alternative is based on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in gases. Here, we demonstrate polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen- filled antiresonant hollow-core fiber. This approach holds promises for seamless integration into optical fiber networks and interfaces to single emitters. Disparate from related experiments that employ a pulsed pump field, we here take advantage of two coherent continuous-wave pump fields. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Continuous Coherent Quantum Feedback with Time Delays: Tensor Network
   Solution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB In this paper, we develop a novel method to solve problems involving quantum optical systems coupled to coherent quantum feedback loops featuring time delays. Our method is based on exact mappings of such non-Markovian problems to equivalent Markovian driven dissipative quantum many-body problems. In this work, we show that the resulting Markovian quantum many-body problems can be solved (numerically) exactly and efficiently using tensor network methods for a series of paradigmatic examples, consisting of driven quantum systems coupled to waveguides at several distant points. In particular, we show that our method allows solving problems in so far inaccessible regimes, including problems with arbitrary long time delays and arbitrary numbers of excitations in the delay lines. We obtain solutions for the full real-time dynamics as well as the steady state in all these regimes. Finally, motivated by our results, we develop a novel mean-field approach, which allows us to find the solution semianalytically, and we identify parameter regimes where this approximation is in excellent agreement with our tensor network results.

TI High frequency magnetometry with an ensemble of spin qubits in hexagonal
   boron nitride
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Sensors based on spin qubits in 2D crystals offer the prospect of nanoscale proximities between sensor and source, which could provide access to otherwise inaccessible signals. For AC magnetometry, the sensitivity and frequency range are typically limited by the noise spectrum, which determines the qubit coherence time. We address this using phase modulated continuous concatenated dynamic decoupling, which extends the coherence time towards the T-1 limit at room temperature and enables tuneable narrowband AC magnetometry. Using an ensemble of negatively charged boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride, we detect out-of-plane AC fields in the range of similar to 10 - 150 MHz, and in-plane fields within +/- 150 MHz of the electron spin resonance. We measure an AC magnetic field sensitivity of similar to 1 root T/Hz at similar to 2.5 GHz, for a sensor volume of similar to 0.1 mu m(3). This work establishes the viability of spin defects in 2D materials for high frequency magnetometry, with wide-ranging applications across science and technology.

TI Weak and Ultrastrong Coupling Limits of the Quantum Mean Force Gibbs
   State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Gibbs state is widely taken to be the equilibrium state of a system in contact with an environment at temperature T. However, non-negligible interactions between system and environment can give rise to an altered state. Here, we derive general expressions for this mean force Gibbs state, valid for any system that interacts with a bosonic reservoir. First, we derive the state in the weak coupling limit and find that, in general, it maintains coherences with respect to the bare system Hamiltonian. Second, we develop a new expansion method suited to investigate the ultrastrong coupling regime. This allows us to derive the explicit form for the mean force Gibbs state, and we find that it becomes diagonal in the basis set by the system-reservoir interaction instead of the system Hamiltonian. Several examples are discussed including a single qubit, a three-level V-system, and two coupled qubits all interacting with bosonic reservoirs. The results shed light on the presence of coherences in the strong coupling regime, and provide key tools for nanoscale thermodynamics investigations.

TI Construction of propagators for divisible dynamical maps
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Divisible dynamical maps play an important role in characterizing Markovianity on the level of quantum evolution. Divisible maps provide an important generalization of Markovian semigroups. Usually one analyzes either completely positive or just positive divisibility meaning that the corresponding propagators are defined in terms of completely positive or positive maps, respectively. For maps which are invertible at any moment of time the very existence of propagator is already guaranteed and hence the only issue is (complete) positivity and trace-preservation. However, for maps which are not invertible the problem is much more involved since even the existence of a propagator is not guaranteed. In this paper we propose a simple method to construct propagators of dynamical maps using the concept of generalized inverse. We analyze both time-continuous and time-discrete maps. Since the generalized inverse is not uniquely defined the same applies for the corresponding propagator. In simple examples of qubit evolution we analyze it turns out that the additional requirement of complete positivity possibly makes the propagator unique.

TI Generalized n-Locality Inequalities in Linear-Chain Network for
   Arbitrary Inputs Scenario and Their Quantum Violations
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Multipartite nonlocality in a network is conceptually different from standard multipartite Bell nonlocality. In recent times, network nonlocality has been studied for various topologies. A linear-chain topology of the network is considered and the quantum nonlocality (the non-n-locality) is demonstrated. Such a network scenario involves n number of independent sources and n+1$n+1$ parties, two edge parties (Alice and Charlie), and n-1$n-1$ central parties (Bobs). It is commonly assumed that each party receives only two inputs. In this work, a generalized scenario where the edge parties receive an arbitrary n number of inputs (equals to a number of independent sources) is considered and each of the central parties receives two inputs. A family of generalized n-locality inequalities for a linear-chain network for arbitrary n is derived and the optimal quantum violation of the inequalities is demonstrated. An elegant sum-of-squares approach enabling the derivation of the optimal quantum violation of aforesaid inequalities without assuming the dimension of the system is introduced. It is shown that the optimal quantum violation requires the observables of edge parties to be mutually anticommuting.

TI Measurement-feedback control of the chiral photon emission from an atom
   chain into a nanofiber
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We theoretically investigate measurement-based feedback control of a laser-driven one-dimensional atomic chain interfaced with a nanofiber. The interfacing leads to all-to-all interactions among the atomic emitters and induces chirality (i.e., the directional emission of photons into a preferred guided mode of the nanofiber). In the setting we consider, the measurement of guided light-conducted either by photon counting or through homodyne detection of the photocurrent quadratures-is fed back into the system through modulation of the driving laser field. We investigate how this feedback scheme allows control of the statistics of the photon counting and the quadratures of the light, as well as the many-body state of the atom chain. In particular, we identify regimes where both the photon counting rate and its fluctuations are dramatically enhanced. Moreover, we find that the action of homodyne detection feedback allows the alteration of the stationary state of the chain from a pure, dimer state, to a fully mixed one. Our results provide insights on how to control and engineer dynamics in light-matter networks realizable with state-of-the-art experimental setups. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Spontaneous decay-induced quantum dynamics in Rydberg-blockaded ?-type
   atoms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Strongly Rydberg-blockaded two-level atoms form a Rydberg superatom which is excited only to a collective symmetrical Dicke state. However, emerging often in the alkali-earth atoms, spontaneous decay from the Rydberg state to an additional pooling state renders the ensemble no longer a closed superatom. Herein we present a computationally efficient model to characterize the interaction between a fully Rydberg-blockaded ensemble of N ?-type three-level atoms and a strong probe light field in a coherent state. The model enables us to achieve a decomposition of the coupled dynamics in the strong field limit, which significantly reduces the complexity of computing the N-body system evolution and paves the way for practical analysis in experiments. A quasi-steady-state power spectrum with multiple sidebands is found in the scattered field. The relative heights of the sidebands show a time-dependence determined by the atomic relaxation, which illuminates potential applications of using the system in information transfer of quantum networks. With negligible dissipative flipping to the unsymmetrical states, the atomic relaxation time, indicating a linearly increasing pooling state fraction, is derived analytically as a function of the number of atoms.

TI Wave function collapse equation maintains conservation laws with no new
   constants
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Modified versions of the Schrodinger equation have been proposed in order to incorporate the description of measurement processes into the mathematical structure of quantum theory. Typically, these proposals introduce new physical constants, and imply small violations of momentum and energy conservation. These problematic features can be eliminated by assuming that wave function collapse is induced by the individual interactions that establish correlations between systems. The generation of a sufficient number of small, random shifts of amplitude between interacting and noninteracting branches of the wave function can bring about collapse on a scale consistent with our macroscopic experience. Two-particle interaction potential energies can be used as the basis for a collapse term added to the Schrodinger equation. The range of the interactions sets the distance scale of the collapse effects; the ratio of potential energies to the total relativistic energies of the particles determines the magnitude of the amplitude shifts, and the rate at which the interactions proceed fixes the timing parameters. Consistency with conservation laws in individual experiments is maintained because the collapse operator automatically takes into account the small, residual entanglement between the measured system and systems with which it has previously exchanged conserved quantities during interactions. Conservation is exact for momentum and orbital angular momentum, and it holds for energy within the accuracy allowed by the limited forms of energy describable in nonrelativistic theory.

TI Quantum two-way time transfer over a 250 km direct fiber-optic link
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Utilizing energy-time entangled biphotons as the resource, quantum two-way time transfer (Q-TWTT) has shown superior transfer stability far below 1 picosecond level in numerous experimental demonstrations. In this article, we provide further insights into comparing this method with the classical time transfer method based on intensity modulation-direct detection (IM-DD) regarding their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance against backscattering noise in long-distance fiber transmission. The exceptional SNR of Q-TWTT indicates its potential to pioneer new avenues for overcoming the transmission distance limitation in single-span fiber. In light of this, a groundbreaking achievement of Q-TWTT is demonstrated over a remarkable 250 km-long direct fiber-optic link. Despite a total transmission loss of 55 dB, time transfer stability of 4.9 ps at an averaging time of 40 s and 0.6 ps at 10240 s is achieved. This marks a significant advancement in the experimental demonstration of long-haul fiber quantum time transfer, which also offers a highly compatible and potentially quantum secure solution for constructing large-scale quantum networks.

TI Learning to Predict Arbitrary Quantum Processes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present an efficient machine-learning (ML) algorithm for predicting any unknown quantum process E over n qubits. For a wide range of distributions D on arbitrary n-qubit states, we show that this ML algorithm can learn to predict any local property of the output from the unknown process E, with a small average error over input states drawn from D. The ML algorithm is computationally efficient even when the unknown process is a quantum circuit with exponentially many gates. Our algorithm combines efficient procedures for learning properties of an unknown state and for learning a low-degree approximation to an unknown observable. The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Numerical experiments on predicting quantum dynamics with evolu-tion time up to 106 and system size up to 50 qubits corroborate our proof. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.

TI Efficient tensor network simulation of IBM's largest quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show how quantum-inspired 2D tensor networks can be used to efficiently and accurately simulate the largest quantum processors from IBM, namely Eagle (127 qubits), Osprey (433 qubits), and Condor (1121 qubits). We simulate the dynamics of a complex quantum many-body system-specifically, the kicked Ising experiment considered recently by IBM in Y. Kim et al., Nature (London) 618, 500 (2023)-using graph-based projected entangled pair states (gPEPS), which was proposed by some of us in Phys. Rev. B 99, 195105 (2019). Our results show that simple tensor updates are already sufficient to achieve very large unprecedented accuracy with remarkably low computational resources for this model. Apart from simulating the original experiment for 127 qubits, we also extend our results to 433 and 1121 qubits, and for evolution times around eight times longer, thus setting a benchmark for the newest IBM quantum machines. We also report accurate simulations for infinitely many qubits. Our results show that gPEPS are a natural tool to efficiently simulate quantum computers with an underlying lattice-based qubit connectivity, such as all quantum processors based on superconducting qubits.

TI Slow Magnetic Relaxation of Ni(III) Complexes toward Molecular Spin
   Qubits
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Molecule-based magnetic materials are promising candidates for molecular spin qubits, which utilize spin relaxation behavior. Various kinds of transition metal complexes with S=1/2 have been reported to act as spin qubits with long spin-spin relaxation times (T-2). However, the spin qubit properties of low-spin Ni(III) complexes are not as well known since Ni(III) compounds are often unstable. We report here the slow magnetic relaxation behavior and T-2 values for three kinds of low-spin Ni(III) based complexes with S=1/2 under magnetically diluted conditions. [Ni(cyclam)X-2]Y (cyclam=1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) with octahedral structures and [Ni(mnt)(2)](-) (mnt=maleonitriledithiolate) with a square-planar structure underwent slow magnetic relaxations in the presence of a dc magnetic bias field. From electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, the Ni(III) complexes exhibited observable T-2, indicating that Ni(III) complexes are promising candidates for use as molecule-based spin qubits.

TI Electrostatically Interacting Wannier Qubits in Curved Space
SO MATERIALS
AB A derivation of a tight-binding model from Schr & ouml;dinger formalism for various topologies of position-based semiconductor qubits is presented in the case of static and time-dependent electric fields. The simplistic tight-binding model enables the description of single-electron devices at a large integration scale. The case of two electrostatically Wannier qubits (also known as position-based qubits) in a Schr & ouml;dinger model is presented with omission of spin degrees of freedom. The concept of programmable quantum matter can be implemented in the chain of coupled semiconductor quantum dots. Highly integrated and developed cryogenic CMOS nanostructures can be mapped to coupled quantum dots, the connectivity of which can be controlled by a voltage applied across the transistor gates as well as using an external magnetic field. Using the anti-correlation principle arising from the Coulomb repulsion interaction between electrons, one can implement classical and quantum inverters (Classical/Quantum Swap Gate) and many other logical gates. The anti-correlation will be weakened due to the fact that the quantumness of the physical process brings about the coexistence of correlation and anti-correlation at the same time. One of the central results presented in this work relies on the appearance of dissipation-like processes and effective potential renormalization building effective barriers in both semiconductors and in superconductors between not bended nanowire regions both in classical and in quantum regimes. The presence of non-straight wire regions is also expressed by the geometrical dissipative quantum Aharonov-Bohm effect in superconductors/semiconductors when one obtains a complex value vector potential-like field. The existence of a Coulomb interaction provides a base for the physical description of an electrostatic Q-Swap gate with any topology using open-loop nanowires, with programmable functionality. We observe strong localization of the wavepacket due to nanowire bending. Therefore, it is not always necessary to build a barrier between two nanowires to obtain two quantum dot systems. On the other hand, the results can be mapped to the problem of an electron in curved space, so they can be expressed with a programmable position-dependent metric embedded in Schr & ouml;dinger's equation. The semiconductor quantum dot system is capable of mimicking curved space, providing a bridge between fundamental and applied science in the implementation of single-electron devices.

TI Express barcoding with NextGenPCR and MinION for species-level sorting
   of ecological samples
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB The use of DNA barcoding is well established for specimen identification and large-scale biodiversity discovery, but remains underutilized for time-sensitive applications such as rapid species discovery in field stations, identifying pests, citizen science projects, and authenticating food. The main reason is that existing express barcoding workflows are either too expensive or can only be used in very well-equipped laboratories by highly-trained staff. We here show an alternative workflow combining rapid DNA extraction with HotSHOT, amplicon production with NextGenPCR thermocyclers, and sequencing with low-cost MinION sequencers. We demonstrate the power of the approach by generating 250 barcodes for 285 specimens within 6 h including specimen identification through BLAST. The workflow required only the following major equipment that easily fits onto a lab bench: Thermocycler, NextGenPCR, microplate sealer, Qubit, and MinION. Based on our results, we argue that simplified barcoding workflows for species-level sorting are now faster, more accurate, and sufficiently cost-effective to replace traditional morpho-species sorting in many projects.

TI Phase shifter based on an ultrathin superconducting bilayer with a
   through-hole for a superconducting device
SO PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Applying a radian phase shift other than 2 pi is a key issue for superconducting circuits, such as flux qubits. Magnetic flux is useful when generating a phase shift. However, to apply a quantized magnetic flux to a phase shifter, a fine geometrical design is required. The magnetic flux generated by an external field generates noise. In this study, we propose a compact phase bias system that does not require an external field during operation. We confirm the phase shift of a direct current superconducting interference device (SQUID) placed on an ultrathin superconducting Nb bilayer with a through-hole by cooling it to a temperature below the superconducting transition temperature with an external field. Although the cause of the phase shift in our system is unclear, we believe that it may be caused by a fractional quantum in the bilayer. When the SQUID is replaced by a qubit, the phase shift can be applied to a phase bias.

TI Variability of Electron and Hole Spin Qubits Due to Interface Roughness
   and Charge Traps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Semiconductor spin qubits may show significant device-to-device variability in the presence of spinorbit coupling mechanisms. Interface roughness, charge traps, layout, or process inhomogeneities indeed shape the real-space wave functions, and hence the spin properties. It is, therefore, necessary to understand how reproducible the qubits can be, in order to assess strategies to cope with variability, and to set constraints on the quality of materials and fabrication. Here we model the variability of single-qubit properties (Larmor and Rabi frequencies) due to disorder at the Si/SiO2 interface (roughness, charge traps) in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. We consider both electron qubits (with synthetic spin-orbit coupling fields created by micromagnets) and hole qubits (with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling). We show that charge traps are much more limiting than interface roughness, and can scatter Rabi frequencies over one order of magnitude. We discuss the implications for the design of spin qubits and for the choice of materials.

TI Prime factorization using quantum variational imaginary time evolution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The road to computing on quantum devices has been accelerated by the promises that come from using Shor's algorithm to reduce the complexity of prime factorization. However, this promise hast not yet been realized due to noisy qubits and lack of robust error correction schemes. Here we explore a promising, alternative method for prime factorization that uses well-established techniques from variational imaginary time evolution. We create a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the solution to the problem and use variational techniques to evolve a state iteratively towards these prime factors. We show that the number of circuits evaluated in each iteration scales as O(n(5)d), where n is the bit-length of the number to be factorized and d is the depth of the circuit. We use a single layer of entangling gates to factorize 36 numbers represented using 7, 8, and 9-qubit Hamiltonians. We also verify the method's performance by implementing it on the IBMQ Lima hardware to factorize 55, 65, 77 and 91 which are greater than the largest number (21) to have been factorized on IBMQ hardware.

TI Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are many-body quantum states that are topologically nontrivial as long as the relevant symmetries are unbroken. In this work we show that SPT phases are also well defined for average symmetries, where quenched disorders locally break the symmetries, but restore the symmetries upon disorder averaging. An example would be crystalline SPT phases with imperfect lattices. Specifically, we define the notion of average SPT phase for disordered ensembles of quantum states. We then classify and characterize a large class of average SPT phases using a decorated domain wall approach, in which domain walls (and more general defects) of the average symmetries are decorated with lower-dimensional topological states. We then show that if the decorated domain walls have dimension higher than o0 thorn 1 thorn D, then the boundary states of such average SPT phases will almost certainly be long-range entangled, with probability approaching 1 as the system size approaches infinity. This generalizes the notion of t'Hooft anomaly to average symmetries, which we dub "average anomaly." The average anomaly can also manifest as constraints on lattice systems similar to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems, but with only average lattice symmetries. We also generalize our problem to "quantum disorders" that can admit short-range entanglement on their own, and develop a theory of such generalized average SPT phases purely based on density matrices and quantum channels. Our results indicate that topological quantum phenomena associated with average symmetries can be at least as rich as those with ordinary exact symmetries.

TI Generation of a bright four-photon entangled state from a warm atomic
   ensemble via inherent polarization entanglement
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report the stable generation of a bright four-photon polarization-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state obtained by the spatial multiplexing of inherently polarization-entangled photons from a warm atomic ensemble of Rb-87. Owing to the total angular momentum conservation of the atomic state in the spontaneous four-wave mixing process of a cascade-type atomic system, the polarizations of the signal and idler photons in the two-photon decay are entangled. With a Rb vapor cell, we realize the generation of robust and bright four-photon GHZ states using two symmetrical spatial modes of inherently polarization-entangled photon pairs without applying an interferometric configuration. The four-photon average coincidence rate of the GHZ state with a fidelity of 0.88(2) is measured as 1.69(7) Hz under a weak pump power of 10 mu W. The minimum Allan variance for the stability of the four-photon GHZ state is estimated as 0.92 & DEG; for an average time of 10 h. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, nonequilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multiparameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.

TI A Stable Hash Function Based on Parity-Dependent Quantum Walks With

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we develop a generic controlled alternate quantum walk model by combining parity-dependent quantum walks with distinct arbitrary memory lengths and propose a hash function (called QHFM-P) based on this model. The statistical properties of the proposed scheme are stable with respect to the coin parameters of the underlying controlled quantum walks, and with certain parameter values, the collision resistance property of QHFM-P is better than that of the state-of-the-art hash functions based on discrete quantum walks. Moreover, the proposed hash function can also maintain near-ideal statistical performance when the input message is of small length. In addition, we derive a type of inappropriate initial states of hash functions based on 1-D one-particle quantum walks (with ordinary shift operator) on cycles, with which all messages will be mapped to the same hash value, regardless of the angles adopted by the coin parameters.

TI Securing Synchrophasors Using Data Provenance in the Quantum Era
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Trust in the fidelity of synchrophasor measurements is crucial for the correct operation of modern power grids. While most of the existing research on data provenance focuses on the Internet of Things, there is a significant need for effective malicious data detection in power systems. Current methods either fail to detect malicious data modifications or require certain Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) to be physically secured. To solve these issues, this paper presents a new protocol to establish data provenance in synchrophasor networks. The proposed protocol is based on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and harnesses the principles of quantum unreality and uncertainty. It aims not only to verify the source of data but also to provide robust protection against data tampering. The proposed protocol serves the purpose of devising new protocols to protect our critical infrastructure sectors in the quantum era. Security and performance analyses, along with experiments conducted on IBM's Qiskit platform, demonstrate that the protocol offers a strong defense against cyberattacks while maintaining a lightweight profile. In particular, the proposed protocol has a worst-case computational complexity of O(1) , an execution time per packet bounded by the time required to compute a cryptographically secure hash, and an upper bound for the per packet communication overhead of 256-bits. In terms of storage overhead, the proposed protocol requires each PMU to store the output of a cryptographically secure hash function, while the PDC needs to store one challenge-response pair (CRP) for each PMU.

TI Higher-order photon antibunching of phase-variable squeezed coherent
   state
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Squeezed state has important applications in quantum communication, quantum computing, and precision measurement. It has been used to improve the sensitivity and measurement accuracy of gravitational wave detectors. Currently, squeezed state can be prepared by optical parametric oscillators, four-wave mixing, and atom-optomechanical coupling. As a typical non-classical light, the photon statistics of squeezed state usually shows obvious bunching effect, but it can also present photon antibunching effect through interference or photon subtraction operation. More importantly, squeezed coherent state is prepared by performing displacement operation on the squeezed state. In the case of certain displacement and squeezing operations, squeezed coherent state with obvious antibunching effect can be produced. The squeezed coherent state with photon antibunching effect can be employed to achieve super-resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit, and the state exhibits good particle features which can suppress the multiphoton emission. Then it has become a focus for studying the antibunching effect and quantum statistical properties of squeezed coherent state at a single-photon level.
   The photon antibunching effect can be characterized by the second-order photon correlation g((2))(tau), which is introduced by Glauber to determine the non-classical properties of the light field. Namely, the second-order photon correlation g((2)) can be used as a metric to distinguish different lights. Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) scheme is used to measure the second-order photon correlation experimentally. However, the second-order photon correlation g((2)) can reflect only the variance of the photon-number statistical distribution. In order to obtain more information about the photon statistical distribution and non-classical features, it is necessary to measure higher-order photon correlations. Then the higher-order photon correlations for different light fields are studied by extending the traditional HBT scheme and combining with multiplex single-photon detection technology. This method can be applied to ghost imaging, characterization of single-photon detectors, research of exciton dynamics, and analysis of NV center fluorescence emission. However, the research on photon statistics of the squeezed state focuses mainly on the second-order photon correlation and the effect of displacement amplitude on the statistical properties. The effect of squeezed phase on photon antibunching and higher-order photon correlation of squeezed coherent states, with background noise and detection efficiency taken into consideration, have not been investigated. "In this paper, we study high-order photon correlations and antibunching effect of phase-variable squeezed coherent state based on an extended HBT scheme. The photon statistics of the squeezed coherent state manifests prominent antibunching effect by adjusting the squeezing parameter r, displacement amplitude alpha and squeezing phase theta. The antibunching effect of the state can be obtained in a wide range of alpha-r parameter space when squeezing phase theta is an element of[0,pi/2].
   In an ideal case, the minimum antibunching values of the squeezed coherent state are g((2)) = 4.006 x 10(-4), g((3)) = 1.3594 x 10(-4) and g((4)) = 6.6352 x 10(-5). When the detection efficiency h = 0.1 and background noise gamma = 10(-6), the strong antibunching effect can still be observed, specifically, g((2)) = 0.1740, g((3)) = 0.0432, g((4)) = 0.0149. The results indicate that the antibunching effect of higher-order photon correlation has strong robustness against the experimental environment. In addition, the antibunching effect of the phase-variable squeezed coherent state is studied as a function of the measured mean photon number < n > and the squeezing degree S. When the measured mean photon number is much less than 1 and the squeezing parameter is less than 10(-4), a prominent photon anti-bunching effect of g((n)) << 0.5 can still be obtained. The results show that the control of the squeezing phase q can be used to prepare the squeezed coherent state with obvious antibunching effect, which has potentially important applications in quantum metrology and secure communication.

TI Superluminal propagation of surface plasmon polaritons via hybrid chiral
   quantum dots system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a novel methodology for enhancing superluminal surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagations within a hybrid nanostructure configuration consisting of gold (Au) metal and chiral quantum dots (CQDs) medium. The arrangement of CQDs and metal hybrid nanostructures enables the production of SPPs when exposed to incident light. The resonances of SPPs within a hybrid nanostructure are determined through analytical calculations using Maxwell's equations under specified boundary conditions, while the dynamics of the CQDs system are calculated using the density matrix approach. It is demonstrated that the propagation of SPPs is significantly influenced by both right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) SPPs. Additionally, we investigate the enhancement of superluminal SPPs propagation by varying the electron tunneling strength and the intensity of the control field within the hybrid system. The characteristics of RCP and LCP SPPs have been investigated, indicating a large negative group index and advancement in time. The observation of a large negative group index and advancement in time provides strong evidence for enhanced superluminal SPPs propagation within the proposed hybrid nanostructure. The results have potential applications in the fields of optical information processing, temporal cloaking, quantum communication, and the advancement of computer chip speed.

TI Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function, the strong-to-weak SSB (SWSSB) is measured by the fidelity correlator. We prove that SWSSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SWSSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken ing to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SWSSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric-code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SWSSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SWSSB, through correlation functions with higher R & eacute;nyi indices.

TI Halide Perovskite Artificial Solids as a New Platform to Simulate
   Collective Phenomena in Doped Mott Insulators
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The development of quantum simulators, artificial platforms where the predictions of many-body theories of correlated quantum materials can be tested in a controllable and tunable way, is one of the main challenges of condensed matter physics. Here we introduce artificial lattices made of lead halide perovskite nanocubes as a new platform to simulate and investigate the physics of correlated quantum materials. We demonstrate that optical injection of quantum confined excitons in this system realizes the two main features that ubiquitously pervade the phase diagram of many quantum materials: collective phenomena, in which long-range orders emerge from incoherent fluctuations, and the excitonic Mott transition, which has one-to-one correspondence with the insulator-to-metal transition described by the repulsive Hubbard model in a magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that time-resolved experiments provide a quantum simulator that is able to span a parameter range relevant for a broad class of phenomena, such as superconductivity and charge-density waves.

TI β-Scission by Direct Electrochemical Oxidation: Proton-coupled Electron
   Transfer Mechanism Dictated by Synthetic Study and Computations
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB 13-Scission from alkoxy radical enables selective Csp3-Csp3 bond cleavage under ambient conditions, offering a useful method for organic synthesis. Various photocatalytic systems for 13-scission have been reported, where proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism plays a key role in the generation of alkoxy radical and thus 13-scission. Electrochemical 13-scission has been mainly pioneered in the presence of mediator, and a direct electrochemical system has rarely been investigated. Here, we investigated the 13 scission via direct electrochemical oxidation using a model compound with 13-O-4 linkage. Synthetic experiments suggested smooth progress of 13-scission in the presence of collidine as a base. Cyclic voltammetry measurement, voltammetric simulation, and quantum simulation suggested the PCET mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical reaction, which is followed by 13-scission process. This report provides fundamental insights into the electrochemical 13-scission via direct electron transfer on the electrode, which contribute to future applications such as biomass valorization.

TI Experimental Joint Estimation of Phase and Phase Diffusion Via
   Deterministic Bell Measurements
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Accurate phase estimation plays a pivotal role in quantum metrology, yet its precision is significantly affected by noise, particularly phase-diffusive noise caused by phase drift. To address this challenge, the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion has emerged as an effective approach, transforming the problem into a multi-parameter estimation task. However, the incompatibility between optimal measurements for different parameters prevents single-copy measurements from reaching the fundamental precision limits defined by the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. Meanwhile, collective measurements performed on multiple identical copies can mitigate this incompatibility and thus enhance the precision of joint parameter estimation. This work experimentally demonstrates joint phase and phase-diffusion estimation using deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system. A linear optical network is employed to implement both parameter encoding and deterministic Bell measurements, achieving improved estimation precision compared to any separable measurement strategy. This work proposes a new framework for phase estimation under phase-diffusive noise and underscores the substantial advantages of collective measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.

TI The Surface Code beyond Pauli Channels: Logical Noise Coherence,
   Information-Theoretic Measures, and Errorfield-Double Phenomenology
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and developing a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; for this they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.

TI SiGe quantum wells with oscillating Ge concentrations for quantum dot
   qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Large-scale arrays of quantum-dot spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantumwells require large or tunable energy splittings of the valley states associated with degenerate conduction band minima. Existing proposals to deterministically enhance the valley splitting rely on sharp interfaces or modifications in the quantum well barriers that can be difficult to grow. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new heterostructure, the "Wiggle Well", whosekey feature isGe concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Experimentally, we show that placing Ge in the quantum well does not significantly impact our ability to form and manipulate single-electron quantum dots. We further observe large and widely tunable valley splittings, from 54 to 239 mu eV. Tight-binding calculations, and the tunability of the valley splitting, indicate that these results can mainly be attributed to random concentration fluctuations that are amplified by the presence of Ge alloy in the heterostructure, as opposed to a deterministic enhancement due to the concentration oscillations. Quantitative predictions for several other heterostructures point to theWiggleWell as a robust method for reliably enhancing the valley splitting in future qubit devices.

TI Pauli error estimation via Population Recovery
SO QUANTUM
AB Motivated by estimation of quantum noise models, we study the problem of learning a Pauli channel, or more generally the Pauli error rates of an arbitrary channel. By employing a novel reduction to the "Population Recovery" problem, we give an extremely simple algorithm that learns the Pauli error rates of an n-qubit channel to precision epsilon in l(infinity) using just O(1/epsilon(2)) log(n/epsilon) applications of the channel. This is optimal up to the logarithmic factors. Our algorithm uses only unentangled state preparation and measurements, and the post-measurement classical runtime is just an O(1/epsilon) factor larger than the measurement data size. It is also impervious to a limited model of measurement noise where heralded measurement failures occur independently with probability < 1/4.
   We then consider the case where the noise channel is close to the identity, meaning that the no-error outcome occurs with probability 1 - eta. In the regime of small eta we extend our algorithm to achieve multiplicative precision 1 +/- epsilon (i.e., additive precision eta) using just O(1/epsilon(2)eta ) log(n/epsilon) applications of the channel.

TI All-Fiber Broadband Photon Pair Generation in Dispersion Flattened
   Highly Non-Linear Fibers
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We demonstrate an all-fiber broadband photon pair source based on four wave mixing (FWM) process in dispersion flattened highly non-linear fiber (DF-HNLF). The fiber exhibits a zero dispersion slope near 1550 nm, allowing phase-matched FWM over entire S, C, and L bands and thus efficient generation of signal and idler photons. A comparative theoretical study between conventional dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) and DF-HNLF highlights the spectral range differences in the generation of photon pairs. We measure coincidence counts at three different sets of wavelengths. To study the effects of Raman scattering, which acts as noise source in these types of fibers, we calculate the correlation g((2))(tau) at different pump powers. We use stimulated emission tomography to characterize the generation of photon pairs across the S, C, and L bands. We show that DF-HNLF is an ideal medium for generating correlated photons over a broad spectral range (>100nm), making it suitable for frequency-multiplexed quantum communication systems. We estimate the photon pair generation efficiency to be 0.05 W-2/pulse.

TI Matrix hypercontractivity, streaming algorithms and LDCs: the large
   alphabet case
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATION THEORY
AB We prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets. In order to do so, we prove a generalization of the powerful 2-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). Using our hypercontractive inequality, we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem defined over large alphabets. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a hypergraph with t-size hyperedges. By using our communication lower bound, we show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving an (r -  pound )-approximation of this value requires Omega( n 1-2 / t ) quantum space, where r is the alphabet size. We next present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) Z n r -> Z N r over large alphabets with recoverability probability at least 1/r +  pound . Using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound N = 2 Omega(epsilon 4 n/r 4 ) for 2-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over Z r and using the non-commutative Khintchine inequality we prove an improved lower bound of N = 2 Omega(epsilon 2 n/r 2 ) .

TI Universal Counterdiabatic Driving in Krylov Space
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g., phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high-frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low-frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity. We make this connection concrete by showing how, for a representative integrable model, we may extract long-time universal behavior of the correlation functions from a short-time expansion of the dynamics using a system-independent universal protocol.

TI Dressed basis sets for the modeling of exchange interactions in double
   quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We discuss the microscopic modeling of exchange interactions between double semiconductor quantum dots used as spin qubits. Starting from a reference full configuration interaction (CI) calculation for the two-particle wave functions, we build a reduced basis set of dressed states that can describe the ground-state singlets and triplets over the whole operational range with as few as 100 basis functions (as compared to a few thousands for the full CI). This enables fast explorations of the exchange interactions landscape as well as efficient timedependent simulations. We apply this methodology to a double hole quantum dot in germanium and discuss the physics of exchange interactions in this system. We show that the net exchange splitting results from a complex interplay among interdot tunneling, Coulomb exchange, and correlations. We analyze, moreover, the effects of confinement, strains, and Rashba interactions on the anisotropic exchange and singlet-triplet mixings at finite magnetic field. We finally illustrate the relevance of this methodology for time-dependent calculations on a singlet-triplet qubit.

TI Scaled local gate controller for optically addressed qubits
SO OPTICA
AB Scalable classical controllers are a key component of future fault -tolerant quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers leverage commercially available optoelectronic devices for generating large-scale tweezer arrays and performing parallel readout, but implementing massively parallel, locally addressed gate operations is an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate an optical modulator system based on off -the -shelf components, which can generate a two-dimensional array of over 10,000 focused spots with uniform frequency and amplitude, and switching them on and off individually in arbitrary configurations at rates of up to 43 kHz. Through careful control of aberrations, the modulator achieves an extinction ratio of 46 dB, and nearest -neighbor crosstalk of -44 dB with a beam spacing of 4.6 waists. The underlying components can operate at wavelengths from the UV to the NIR, and sustain high laser intensities. This approach is suitable for local addressing of gates with low cross -talk error rates in any optically addressed qubit platform, including neutral atoms, trapped ions, or solid-state atomic defects.

TI Superdiffusive quantum work and adiabatic quantum evolution in finite
   temperature chaotic Fermi systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the full distribution of quantum work in generic, noninteracting, disordered fermionic nanosystems at finite temperature. We derive an analytical determinant formula for the characteristic function of work statistics for quantum quenches starting from a thermal initial state. For work small compared to the thermal energy of the Fermi gas, work distribution is Gaussian, and the variance of work is proportional to the average work, while in the low-temperature or large-work limit, a non-Gaussian distribution with superdiffusive work fluctuations is observed. Similarly, the time dependence of the probability of adiabaticity crosses over from an exponential to a stretched exponential behavior. For large enough average work, the work distribution becomes universal, and depends only on the temperature and the mean work. Apart from initial low-temperature transients, work statistics are well captured by a Markovian energy-space diffusion process of hardcore particles, starting from a thermal initial state. Our findings can be verified by measurements on nanoscale circuits or via single qubit interferometry.

TI Confident entanglement detection via the separable numerical range
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the joint (separable) numerical range of multiple measurements, i.e., the regions of expectation values accessible with (separable) quantum states for given observables. This not only enables efficient entanglement detection, but also sheds light on the geometry of the set of quantum states. More precisely, in an experiment, if the confidence region for the obtained data and the separable numerical range are disjoint, entanglement is reliably detected. Generically, the success of such an experiment is more likely the smaller the separable numerical range is, compared to the standard numerical range of the observables measured. We quantify this relation using the ratio between these two volumes and show that it cannot be arbitrarily small, giving analytical bounds for any number of particles, local dimensions, as well as number of measurements. Moreover, we explicitly compute the volume of separable and standard numerical range for two locally traceless two-qubit product observables, which are of particular interest as they are easier to measure in practice. Furthermore, we consider typical volume ratios for generic observables and extreme instances.

TI Convex geometry of Markovian Lindblad dynamics and witnessing
   non-Markovianity
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We develop a theory of linear witnesses for detecting non-Markovianity, based on the geometric structure of the set of Choi states for all Markovian evolutions having Lindblad-type generators. We show that the set of all such Markovian Choi states form a convex and compact set under the small time interval approximation. Invoking geometric Hahn-Banach theorem, we construct linear witnesses to separate a given non-Markovian Choi state from the set of Markovian Choi states. We present examples of such witnesses for dephasing channel and Pauli channel in case of qubits. Furthermore, we have devised another method of detection NM of various qubit channels, by using projective measurements in the Bell basis. This can be done without the knowledge of what specific kind of channel we are dealing with. This gives us a huge operational advantage for NM detection. We further investigate the geometric structure of the Markovian Choi states to find that they do not form a polytope. This presents a platform to consider nonlinear improvement of non-Markovianity witnesses.

TI A Low-Noise Hybrid-Integrated Balanced Homodyne Receiver with 2.5 GHz
   Bandwidth and 15 dB Quantum Shot Noise Clearance
SO MICROMACHINES
AB The rapid development of continuous-variable quantum communication has driven an increasing demand for high-performance quantum signal processing modules. Among these, the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) has emerged as a leading solution for practical quantum state measurement due to its capability to provide complete quantum mechanical characterization. However, its performance is often constrained by limited bandwidth and high noise levels, primarily due to the reliance on bulk optical components and discrete receiver electronics. The dominant noise source in these systems typically stems from electronic noise, while imbalances in the optical path further degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the BHD. In this work, we present an adjustable integrated optical path to enhance the balance within the BHD system, along with a low-noise transimpedance amplifier (TIA) by employing optoelectronic co-design. Our design achieves a bandwidth of 2.5 GHz, an input-referred noise current of only 2 pA/root Hz in 180 nm CMOS technology, and a measured quantum shot noise clearance of 15 dB generated from a 700 mu A photocurrent. This is the maximum quantum shot noise clearance at the same BHD photocurrent reported to date above the GHz bandwidth.

TI Asymptotic relative submajorization of multiple-state boxes
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Pairs of states, or "boxes" are the basic objects in the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability (Wang and Wilde in Phys Rev Res 1(3):033170, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033170), where free operations are arbitrary quantum channels that are applied to both states. From this point of view, hypothesis testing is seen as a process by which a standard form of distinguishability is distilled. Motivated by the more general problem of quantum state discrimination, we consider boxes of a fixed finite number of states and study an extension of the relative submajorization preorder to such objects. In this relation, a tuple of positive operators is greater than another if there is a completely positive trace nonincreasing map under which the image of the first tuple satisfies certain semidefinite constraints relative to the other one. This preorder characterizes error probabilities in the case of testing a composite null hypothesis against a simple alternative hypothesis, as well as certain error probabilities in state discrimination. We present a sufficient condition for the existence of catalytic transformations between boxes, and a characterization of an associated asymptotic preorder, both expressed in terms of sandwiched Renyi divergences. This characterization of the asymptotic preorder directly shows that the strong converse exponent for a composite null hypothesis is equal to the maximum of the corresponding exponents for the pairwise simple hypothesis testing tasks.

TI A simple and efficient joint measurement strategy for estimating

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians relevant in quantum chemistry and correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is based on implementing a measurement that jointly measures noisy versions of any product of two or four Majorana operators in an N mode fermionic system. To realize our measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries that realize products of Majorana fermion operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable post-processing.

TI Deconfined Quantum Criticality on a Triangular Rydberg Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct ordered phases-so-called deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs)-which lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition between two ordered phases at 1/3 and 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which were recently probed experimentally in [Scholl et al., Quantum simulation of 2D antiferromagnets with hundreds of Rydberg atoms, Nature (London) 595, 233 (2021).]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1) symmetry-a signature of DQCPs-and confirm these predictions numerically. Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.

TI The Timescales of Quantum Breaking
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time tq$t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining tq$t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how tq$t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number N. The presence of a classical instability leads to tq & SIM;lnN$t_q\sim \ln N$ or tq & SIM;N$t_q\sim \sqrt {N}$. In the stable case, we observe tq & SIM;N$t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with tq & SIM;N & gamma;$t_q\sim N<^>\gamma$ (0<& gamma;<1$0<\gamma <1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.

TI Revision of the edge channel picture for the integer quantum Hall effect
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB State of the art computing opens now a new window to the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) regime, which enforces a major revision of the common knowledge accumulated so far. In our record-breaking application of the Hartree-Fock method we use up to 3000 electrons distributed over up to 5000 states for almost macroscopic system size of 1000 x 1000 nm. In particular, the formation of compressible and in-compressible edge stripes turns out to develop essentially different from the common picture used so far. Oppositely to the theory of Chklovskii, Shklovskii and Glazman (CSG), the narrow channels, as assumed by the early models of the IQHE, do not widen up into wide compressible stripes. Instead, the wide compressible stripes of CSG transform into a mixture of clusters of full and empty spin-split LLs, while the cluster boundaries create a network of still narrow quantum channels sitting on top of the wide compressible stripes. On this background the early models based on narrow edge channels do not suffer from neglecting electron-electron interaction as falsely stated in the past. Quite oppositely, in contrast to the common believe, our modeling demonstrates that also the IQHE regime carries the hallmark of many-body physics which stabilizes narrow edge channels also in the presence of electron-electron interaction.

TI Quantifying the effect of gate errors on variational quantum
   eigensolvers for quantum chemistry
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum eigen solvers (VQEs) are leading candidates to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage. Here, we conductdensity-matrix simulations of leading gate-based VQEs for a range of molecules. We numerically quantify their level of tolerable depolarizing gate-errors. Wefind that: (i) The best-performing VQEs require gate-error probabilities between 10(-6)and 10(-4)(10(-4)and 10(-2)with error mitigation) to predict, within chemical accuracy, ground-state energies of small molecules with 4-14 orbitals.(ii) ADAPT-VQEs that construct ansatz circuits iteratively out perform fixed-circuit VQEs. (iii) ADAPT-VQEs perform better with circuits constructed from gate-efficient rather than physically-motivated elements. (iv) The maximally-allowed gate-error probability, p(c), for any VQE to achieve chemical accuracy decreases with the number N-II of noisy two-qubit gates as p(c)alpha N-II(-1). Additionally, p(c) decreases with system size, even with error mitigation, implying that larger molecules require even lower gate-errors. Thus, quantum advantage via gate-based VQEs is unlikely unless gate-error probabilities are decreased by orders of magnitude.

TI Deterministic nanoscale quantum spin-defect implantation and diffraction
   strain imaging
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Local crystallographic features negatively affect quantum spin defects by changing the local electrostatic environment, often resulting in degraded or varied qubit optical and coherence properties. Few tools exist that enable the deterministic synthesis and study of such intricate systems on the nano-scale, making defect-to-defect strain environment quantification difficult. In this paper, we highlight state-of-the-art capabilities from the U.S. Department of Energy's Nanoscale Science Research Centers that directly address these shortcomings. Specifically, we demonstrate how complementary capabilities of nano-implantation and nano-diffraction can be used to demonstrate the quantum relevant, spatially deterministic creation of neutral divacancy centers in 4H silicon carbide, while investigating and characterizing these systems on the <= 25 nm scale with strain sensitivities on the order of 1 x 10(-6), relevant to defect formation dynamics. This work lays the foundation for ongoing studies into the dynamics and deterministic formation of low strain homogeneous quantum relevant spin defects in the solid state.

TI Correspondence between entangled states and entangled bases under local
   transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate whether pure entangled states can be associated to a measurement basis in which all vectors are local unitary transformations of the original state. We prove that for bipartite states with a local dimension that is either 2, 4, or 8, every state corresponds to a basis. Via numerics, we strongly evidence the same conclusion for two qutrits and three qubits also. However, for some states of four qubits, we are unable to find a basis, leading us to conjecture that not all quantum states admit a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, we investigate whether there can exist a set of local unitaries that transform any state into a basis. While we show that such a state-independent construction cannot exist for general quantum states, we prove that it does exist for real-valued n-qubit states if and only if n = 2, 3, and that such constructions are impossible for any multipartite system of an odd local dimension. Our results suggest a rich relationship between entangled states and iso-entangled measurements with a strong dependence on both particle numbers and dimension.

TI Stochastic Entropy Production: Fluctuation Relation and Irreversibility
   Mitigation in Non-unital Quantum Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we study the stochastic entropy production in open quantum systems whose time evolution is described by a class of non-unital quantum maps. In particular, as in Phys Rev E 92:032129 (2015), we consider Kraus operators that can be related to a nonequilibrium potential. This class accounts for both thermalization and equilibration to a non-thermal state. Unlike unital quantum maps, non-unitality is responsible for an unbalance of the forward and backward dynamics of the open quantum system under scrutiny. Here, concentrating on observables that commute with the invariant state of the evolution, we show how the non-equilibrium potential enters the statistics of the stochastic entropy production. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation for the latter and we find a convenient way of expressing its average solely in terms of relative entropies. Then, the theoretical results are applied to the thermalization of a qubit with non-Markovian transient, and the phenomenon of irreversibility mitigation, introduced in Phys Rev Res 2:033250 (2020), is analyzed in this context.

TI Single-Shot Error Correction of Three-Dimensional Homological Product
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Single-shot error correction corrects data noise using only a single round of noisy measurements on the data qubits, removing the need for intensive measurement repetition. We introduce a general concept of confinement for quantum codes, which roughly stipulates qubit errors cannot grow without triggering more measurement syndromes. We prove confinement is sufficient for single-shot decoding of adversarial errors and linear confinement is sufficient for single-shot decoding of local stochastic errors. Further to this, we prove that all three-dimensional homological product codes exhibit confinement in their X components and are therefore single shot for adversarial phase-flip noise. For local stochastic phase-flip noise, we numerically explore these codes and again find evidence of single-shot protection. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate sustainable thresholds of 3.08(4)% and 2.90(2)% for three-dimensional (3D) surface and toric codes, respectively, the highest observed single-shot thresholds to date. To demonstrate single-shot error correction beyond the class of topological codes, we also run simulations on a randomly constructed family of 3D homological product codes.

TI Time-dependent POVM reconstruction for single-photon avalanche photo
   diodes using adaptive regularization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report on the first realization of time-dependent quantum detector tomography for commercially available InGaAs avalanche photo detectors. For the construction of appropriate time-dependent POVMs from experimentally measured data, we introduce a novel scheme to calculate the weight of the regularization term based on the amount of measured data. We compare our POVM-based results with the theoretical predictions of the previously developed model by Gouzien et al (2018 Phys. Rev. A 98 013833). In contrast to our measurement-based construction of a time-dependent POVM for photon detectors, this previous investigation extends a time-independent POVM to a time-dependent one by including effects of detector timing jitter and dead time on the basis of particular model assumptions concerning the inner physical mechanisms of a photon detector. Our experimental results demonstrate that this latter approach is not sufficient to completely describe the observable properties of our InGaAs avalanche photo detectors. Thus, constructing the time-dependent POVM of a detector by direct quantum tomographic measurements can reveal information about the detector's interior that may not easily be included in time-independent POVMs by a priori model assumptions.

TI Randomized Benchmarking beyond Groups
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the gold standard for experimentally evaluating the quality of quantum operations. The current framework for RB is centered on groups and their representations but this can be problematic. For example, Clifford circuits need up to O(n(2)) gates and thus Clifford RB cannot scale to larger devices. Attempts to remedy this include new schemes such as linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB), cycle benchmarking, and nonuniform RB but they do not fall within the group-based RB frame-work. In this work, we formulate the universal randomized benchmarking (URB) framework, which does away with the group structure and also replaces the recovery-gate-plus-measurement component with a general "postprocessing " positive operator-valued measurement (POVM). Not only does this framework cover most of the existing benchmarking schemes but it also gives the language for and helps inspire the formulation of new schemes. We specifically consider a class of URB schemes called twirling schemes. For twirling schemes, the postprocessing POVM approximately factorizes into an intermediate channel, inverting maps, and a final measurement. This leads us to study the twirling map corresponding to the gate ensemble specified by the scheme. We prove that if this twirling map is strictly within unit distance of the Haar twirling map in induced diamond norm, the probability of measurement as a function of gate length is a single exponential decay up to small error terms. The core technical tool we use is the matrix perturbation theory of linear operators on quantum channels.

TI First-Principle Prediction of Stress-Tunable Single-Photon Emitters at
   Telecommunication Band from Point Defects in GaN
SO PHOTONICS
AB Point defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in GaN have aroused a great deal of interest due to their room-temperature operation, narrow line width and high emission rate. The room-temperature SPEs at the telecommunication bands have also been realized recently by localized defects in GaN in experiments, which are highly desired for the practical applications of SPEs in quantum communication with fiber compatibility. However, the origin and underlying mechanism of the SPEs remain unclear to date. Herein, our first-principle calculations predict and identify an intrinsic point defect N-Ga in GaN that owns a zero-phonon line (ZPL) at telecommunication windows. By tuning the triaxial compressive strain of the crystal structure, the ZPL of N-Ga can be modulated from 0.849 eV to 0.984 eV, covering the fiber telecommunication windows from the O band to the E band. Besides the ZPL, the formation energy, band structure, transition process and lifetime of the SPEs under different strains are investigated systematically. Our work gives insight into the emission mechanism of the defect SPEs in GaN and also provides effective guidance for achieving wavelength-tunable SPEs working in fiber telecommunication windows.

TI Topological and dynamical features of periodically driven spin ladders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Studies of periodically driven one-dimensional many-body systems have advanced our understanding of complex systems and stimulated promising developments in quantum simulation. It is hence of interest to go one step further, by investigating the topological and dynamical aspects of periodically driven spin ladders as clean quasi-one-dimensional systems with spin-spin interaction in the rung direction. Specifically, we find that such systems display subharmonic magnetization dynamics reminiscent to that of discrete time crystals (DTCs) at finite system sizes. Through the use of generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation, this feature can be attributed to the presence of corner Majorana p modes (MPMs), which are of topological origin, in the systems' equivalent Majorana lattice. Special emphasis is placed on how the coupling in the rung direction of the ladder prevents degeneracy from occurring between states differing by a single spin excitation, thus preserving the MPM-induced p/T quasienergy spacing of the Floquet eigenstates in the presence of parameter imperfection. This feature, which is absent in their strict one-dimensional counterparts, may yield fascinating consequences in future studies of higher dimensional Floquet many-body systems.

TI Population dynamics of Schrödinger cats
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce quantum population dynamics as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr & ouml;dinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical "Schr & ouml;digner cat" population model on a d-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr & ouml;dinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.

TI Charged Polarons and Molecules in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Ultracold hybrid ion-atom gases represent an exciting frontier for quantum simulation offering a new set of functionalities and control. Here, we study a mobile ion immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the long-range nature of the ion-atom interaction gives rise to an intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. This leads to the existence of several polaronic and molecular states due to the binding of an increasing number of bosons to the ion, which is well beyond what can be described by a short-range pseudopotential. We use a complementary set of techniques including a variational ansatz and field theory to describe this rich physics and calculate the full spectral response of the ion. It follows from thermodynamic arguments that the ion-atom interaction leads to a mesoscopic dressing cloud of the polarons, and a simplified model demonstrates that the spectral weight of the molecules scale with increasing powers of the density. We finally calculate the quantum dynamics of the ion after a quench experiment.

TI Design study for an efficient semiconductor quantum light source
   operating in the telecom C-band based on an electrically-driven circular
   Bragg grating
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The development of efficient sources of single photons and entangled photon pairs emitting in the low-loss wavelength region around 1550 nm is crucial for long-distance quantum communication. Moreover, direct fiber coupling and electrical carrier injection are highly desirable for deployment in compact and user-friendly systems integrated with the existing fiber infrastructure. Here we present a detailed design study of circular Bragg gratings fabricated in InP slabs and operating in the telecom C-band. These devices enable the simultaneous enhancement of the X and XX spectral lines, with collection efficiency in numerical aperture 0.65 close to 90% for the wavelength range 1520 - 1580 nm and Purcell factor up to 15. We also investigate the coupling into a single mode fiber, which exceeds 70% in UHNA4. Finally, we propose a modified device design directly compatible with electrical carrier injection, reporting Purcell factors up to 20 and collection efficiency in numerical aperture 0.65 close to 70% for the whole telecom C-band.

TI Bright solitons in a spin-orbit-coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate
   trapped within a double-lattice
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB By effectively controlling the dipole -dipole interaction, we investigate the characteristics of the ground state of bright solitons in a spin -orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. The dipolar atoms are trapped within a double -lattice which consists of a linear and a nonlinear lattice. We derive the motion equations of the different spin components, taking the controlling mechanisms of the dipole -dipole interaction into account. An analytical expression of dipole -dipole interaction is derived. By adjusting the dipole polarization angle, the dipole interaction can be adjusted from attraction to repulsion. On this basis, we study the generation and manipulation of the bright solitons using both the analytical variational method and numerical imaginary time evolution. The stability of the bright solitons is also analyzed and we map out the stability phase diagram. By adjusting the long-range dipole -dipole interaction, one can achieve manipulation of bright solitons in all aspects, including the existence, width, nodes, and stability. Considering the complexity of our system, our results will have enormous potential applications in quantum simulation of complex systems.

TI Effect of micromotion and local stress in quantum simulations with
   trapped ions in optical tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability to program and control interactions provides the key to implementing large-scale quantum simulation and computation in trapped-ion systems. Adding optical tweezers, which can tune the phonon spectrum and thus modify the phonon-mediated spin-spin interaction, was recently proposed as a way of programing quantum simulators for a broader range of spin models [Arias Espinoza et al., Phys. Rev. A 104, 013302 (2021)]. In this work we study the robustness of our findings in the presence of experimental imperfections: micromotion, local stress, and intensity noise. We show that the effects of micromotion can be easily circumvented when designing and optimizing tweezer patterns to generate a target interaction. Furthermore, while local stress, whereby the tweezers apply small forces on individual ions, may appear to enable further tuning of the spin-spin interactions, any additional flexibility is negligible. We conclude that optical tweezers are a useful method for controlling interactions in trapped-ion quantum simulators in the presence of micromotion and imperfections in the tweezer alignment, but require intensity stabilization on the subpercent level.

TI PT-symmetry-breaking transition in a chain of trapped interacting
   ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Trapped ions are an ideal platform to implement quantum simulation. Previously, the parity-time (PT)-reversal symmetry-breaking transition in the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hPT=J sigma(x)-i Gamma sigma(z) was observed in a single-ion experiment in a passive way. In this work we propose to study the interaction effects on the PT-symmetry-breaking transition in a chain of N trapped interacting ions. We consider an effective Ising interaction H-int(Isingx)=& sum;U-j<k(jk)sigma(j)(x)sigma(k)(x) between the ions on top of h(PT). We find that sufficiently strong interaction strength can enhance the PT-symmetric phase for even N, while the phase is suppressed in all the other cases. In particular, the suppression can be so strong that even infinitesimal dissipation, quantified by Gamma, can turn the system into the PT-symmetry-breaking phase. In addition, we assess the convolved effects due to the coupling and the spin phase shifts. Our findings can be readily tested in ion chain experiments.

TI Quantum thermalization must occur in translation-invariant systems at
   high temperature
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr & ouml;dinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.

TI Optical spin control and coherence properties of acceptor bound holes in
   strained GaAs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hole spins in semiconductors are a potential qubit alternative to electron spins. In nuclear-spin-rich host crystals like GaAs, the hyperfine interaction of hole spins with nuclei is considerably weaker than that for electrons, leading to potentially longer dephasing times. Here we demonstrate optical pumping and coherent population trapping for acceptor-bound holes in a strained GaAs epitaxial layer. We find mu s-scale longitudinal spin relaxation time T-1 and an inhomogeneous dephasing time T-2* 2 of similar to 7 ns. We attribute the spin relaxation mechanism to the combined effect of a hole-phonon interaction through the deformation potentials, and heavy-hole-light-hole mixing in an in-plane magnetic field. We attribute the short T-2* to g-factor broadening due to strain inhomogeneity. T-1 and T-2* are calculated based on these mechanisms and compared with the experimental results. While the hyperfine-mediated decoherence is mitigated, our results highlight the important contribution of strain to relaxation and dephasing of acceptor-bound hole spins.

TI Hybrid Cramér-Rao Bound for Quantum Bayes Point Estimation with Nuisance
   Parameters
SO ENTROPY
AB We develop a hybrid framework for quantum parameter estimation in the presence of nuisance parameters. In this scheme, the parameters of interest are treated as fixed non-random parameters while nuisance parameters are integrated out with respect to a prior (random parameters). Within this setting, we introduce the hybrid partial quantum Fisher information matrix (hpQFIM), defined by prior-averaging the nuisance block of the QFIM and taking a Schur complement, and derive a corresponding Cram & eacute;r-Rao-type lower bound on the hybrid risk. We establish the structural properties of the hpQFIM, including inequalities that bracket it between computationally tractable approximations, as well as limiting behaviors under extreme priors. Operationally, the hybrid approach improves over pure point estimation since the optimal measurement for the parameters of interest depends only on the prior distribution of the nuisance, rather than on its unknown value. We illustrate the framework with analytically solvable qubit models and numerical examples, clarifying how partial prior information on nuisance variables can be systematically exploited in quantum metrology.

TI Insights on the coupling between vibronically active molecular
   vibrations and lattice phonons in molecular nanomagnets
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Spin-lattice relaxation is a key open problem to understand the spin dynamics of single-molecule magnets and molecular spin qubits. While modelling the coupling between spin states and local vibrations allows to determine the more relevant molecular vibrations for spin relaxation, this is not sufficient to explain how energy is dissipated towards the thermal bath. Herein, we employ a simple and efficient model to examine the coupling of local vibrational modes with long-wavelength longitudinal and transverse phonons in the clock-like spin qubit [Ho(W5O18)(2)](9-). We find that in crystals of this polyoxometalate the vibrational mode previously found to be vibronically active at low temperature does not couple significantly to lattice phonons. This means that further intramolecular energy transfer via anharmonic vibrations is necessary for spin relaxation in this system. Finally, we discuss implications for the spin-phonon coupling of [Ho(W5O18)(2)](9-) deposited on a MgO (001) substrate, offering a simple methodology that can be extrapolated to estimate the effects on spin relaxation of different surfaces, including 2D materials.

TI Ab initio calculation of the spectrum of Feshbach resonances in NaLi

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the spectrum of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in NaLi (a3E+) + Na collisions. In the accompanying paper, J. J. Park, H. Son, Y.-K. Lu, T. Karman, M. Gronowski, M. Tomza, A. O. Jamison, and W. Ketterle, Phys. Rev. X 13, 031018 (2023), we observe experimentally 8 and 17 resonances occurring between B = 0 and 1400 G in upper and lower spin-stretched states, respectively. Here, we perform ab initio calculations of the NaLi + Na interaction potential and describe in detail the coupled-channel scattering calculations of the Feshbach resonance spectrum. The positions of the resonances cannot be predicted with realistic uncertainty in the state-of-the-art ab initio potential, but our calculations yield a typical number of resonances that is in near-quantitative agreement with experiment. We show that the main coupling mechanism results from spin-rotation and spin-spin couplings in combination with the anisotropic atom-molecule interaction. The calculations furthermore explain the qualitative difference between the numbers of resonances in either spin state.

TI Quantum Fisher Information in Curved Spacetime: Dirac Particles in Noisy
   Channels around a Schwarzschild Black Hole

This work investigates the behavior of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and parameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to dissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels- generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD)- on the QFI with respect to entanglement weight (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\theta$$\end{document}) and phase (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\phi$$\end{document}) parameters.

TI Highly Nondegenerate Polarization-Entangled Photon Pairs Produced
   through Noncritical Phasematching in Single-Domain KTiOPO4
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Photon-pair sources are useful for entanglement distribution. The most mature of these are spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) sources, most of which achieve phasematching via engineering the domains in poled crystals or the angle between the optic axis and the pump beam. For multichannel entanglement distribution of photon pairs, where one photon is transmitted through free-space and the other photon is transmitted through fiber, it is beneficial to use highly nondegenerate photon-pair sources. The currently accepted approach in such sources is quasi-phasematching. In this paper, a simpler, more stable alternative is presented for producing highly nondegenerate photon pairs. A source of polarization-entangled photon pairs with low temperature sensitivity based on noncritical phasematched SPDC in single-domain potassium titanyl phosphate was demonstrated. Over a crystal temperature range of 75 degrees C, the center wavelength of the idler photons was observed to change by 10.8(20) nm while the average entanglement visibility was maintained above 98%. With the signal photons detected locally, the idler photons were transmitted through 62 km and 93 km of deployed telecom fibers with average raw visibilities of 98.2(1)% and 95.6(3)% respectively.

TI Vector-Mode Decay in Atmospheric Turbulence: An Analysis Inspired by
   Quantum Mechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Vector beams are inhomogeneously polarized optical fields with nonseparable quantumlike correlations between their polarization and spatial components, and they hold tremendous promise for classical and quantum communication across various channels, e.g., the atmosphere, underwater, and in optical fiber. Here, we show that by exploiting their quantumlike features by virtue of the nonseparability of the field, the decay of both the polarization and spatial components can be studied in tandem. In particular, we invoke the principle of channel-state duality to show that the degree of nonseparability of any vector mode is purely determined by that of a maximally nonseparable one, which we confirm using orbital angular momentum (OAM) as an example for topological charges of ? = 1 and ? = 10 in a turbulent atmosphere. A consequence is that the well-known cylindrical vector vortex beams are sufficient to predict the behavior of all vector OAM states through the channel. Our method reveals interesting features about the performance of various modes through the channel: the decay in vector quality decreases with an increasing OAM value, even though the spread is higher for larger OAM modes. Our approach offers a fast and easy probe of noisy channels, while at the same time revealing the power of quantum tools applied to classical light.

TI Highly efficient visible and near-IR photon pair generation with
   thin-film lithium niobate
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Efficient on-chip entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths is an integral aspect of emerging quantum optical technologies, particularly for quantum communication and computing. However, moving to shorter wavelengths enables the use of more accessible silicon detector technology, and opens up applications in imaging and spectroscopy. Here, we present high brightness ((1.6 +/- 0.3) x 109 pairs/s/mW/nm) visible-nearIR photon pair generation in a periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide. The degenerate spectrum of the photon pairs is centered at 811 nm with a bandwidth of 117 nm when pumped with a spectrally multimode laser diode. The measured on-chip source efficiency of (2.3 +/- 0.5) x 1011 pairs/s/mW is on par with source efficiencies at telecom wavelengths and is also orders of magnitude higher than the efficiencies of other visible sources implemented in bulk crystal or diffused waveguide-based technologies. Further improvements in the brightness and efficiencies are possible by pumping the device with a single-frequency laser, which would also shrink the pair bandwidth. These results represent the shortest wavelength of photon pairs generated in a nanophotonic waveguide reported to date by nearly an octave.

TI Probing confinement through dynamical quantum phase transitions: From
   quantum spin models to lattice gauge theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Confinement is an intriguing phenomenon prevalent in condensed matter and high-energy physics. Exploring its effect on the far-from-equilibrium criticality of quantum many-body systems is of great interest from both a fundamental and a technological point of view. Here, we employ large-scale uniform matrix product state calculations to show that a qualitative change in the type of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) accompanies the confinement-deconfinement transition in three paradigmatic models: the power-law interacting quantum Ising chain, the two-dimensional quantum Ising model, and the spin-S U(1) quantum link model. By tuning a confining parameter in these models, it is found that branch (manifold) DQPTs arise as a signature of (de)confinement. Whereas manifold DQPTs are associated with a sign change of the order parameter, their branch counterparts are not, but rather occur even when the order parameter exhibits considerably constrained dynamics. Our conclusions can be tested in modern quantum-simulation platforms, such as ion-trap setups and cold-atom experiments of gauge theories.

TI Design and assembly of a cavity microscope with high numerical aperture
   for quantum simulations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of highnumerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of 19.786 mm, a finesse of 2.35 x 104 and operates 214 mu m away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of 0.52 each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.

TI Combined tight-binding and configuration interaction study of unfolded
   electronic structure of the G color center in Si
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We have theoretically studied the G center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at P point of the Brillouin zone. The G center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single-and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approaches, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach, it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudoband structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton, both for bright and dark doubletes, in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.

TI Efficient experimental quantum fingerprinting with channel multiplexing
   and simultaneous detection
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum communication complexity explores the minimum amount of communication required to achieve certain tasks using quantum states. One representative example is quantum fingerprinting, in which the minimum amount of communication could be exponentially smaller than the classical fingerprinting. Here, we propose a quantum fingerprinting protocol where coherent states and channel multiplexing are used, with simultaneous detection of signals carried by multiple channels. Compared with an existing coherent quantum fingerprinting protocol, our protocol could consistently reduce communication time and the amount of communication by orders of magnitude by increasing the number of channels. Our proposed protocol can even beat the classical limit without using superconducting-nanowire single photon detectors. We also report a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration with six wavelength channels to validate the advantage of our protocol in the amount of communication. The experimental results clearly prove that our protocol not only surpasses the best-known classical protocol, but also remarkably outperforms the existing coherent quantum fingerprinting protocol.
   Quantum fingerprinting could allow an exponential quantum advantage in a cryptographic protocol, but current schemes are still difficult to scale. Here, the authors exploit wavelength division multiplexing to increase the channel capacity and reduce the communication time without the need for demultiplexing.

TI Dynamical Hadron Formation in Long-Range Interacting Quantum Spin Chains
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The study of confinement in quantum spin chains has seen a large surge of interest in recent years. It is not only important for understanding a range of effective one-dimensional condensed-matter realiza-tions but it also shares some of the nonperturbative physics with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which makes it a prime target for current quantum simulation efforts. In analogy to QCD, the confinement -induced two-particle bound states that appear in these models are dubbed mesons. Here, we study scattering events due to meson collisions in a quantum spin chain with long-range interactions such that two mesons have an extended interaction. We show how novel hadronic bound states, e.g., with four con-stituent particles akin to tetraquarks, may form dynamically in fusion events. In a natural collision their signal is weak, as elastic meson scattering dominates. However, we propose two controllable protocols that allow for a clear observation of dynamical hadron formation. We discuss how this physics can be simulated in trapped-ion or Rydberg-atom setups.

TI Flux-Tunable Cavity for Dark Matter Detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet, it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a dc flux tunable superconducting quantum interference device. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum nondemolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to epsilon < 8.2 x 10-15 in a tunable band from 5.672 to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.

TI Trotter error bounds and dynamic multi-product formulas for Hamiltonian
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multi-product formulas (MPFs) are linear combinations of Trotter circuits offering high-quality simulation of Hamiltonian time evolution with fewer Trotter steps. Here we report two contributions aimed at making multi-product formulas more viable for near-term quantum simulations. First, we extend the theory of Trotter error with commutator scaling developed by Childs et al. [A. M. Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020 (2021)] to multi-product formulas. Our result implies that multi-product formulas can achieve a quadratic reduction of Trotter error in 1-norm (nuclear norm) on arbitrary time intervals compared with the regular product formulas without increasing the required circuit depth or qubit connectivity. The number of circuit repetitions grows only by a constant factor. Second, we introduce dynamic multi-product formulas with time-dependent coefficients chosen to minimize a certain efficiently computable proxy for the Trotter error. We use a minimax estimation method to make dynamic multi-product formulas robust to uncertainty from algorithmic errors, sampling, and hardware noise. We call this method the minimax MPF and we provide a rigorous bound on its error.

TI Action formalism for geometric phases from self-closing quantum
   trajectories
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB When subject to measurements, quantum systems evolve along stochastic quantum trajectories that can be naturally equipped with a geometric phase observable via a post-selection in a final projective measurement. When post-selecting the trajectories to form a close loop, the geometric phase undergoes a topological transition driven by the measurement strength. Here, we study the geometric phase of a subset of self-closing trajectories induced by a continuous Gaussian measurement of a single qubit system. We utilize a stochastic path integral that enables the analysis of rare self-closing events using action methods and develop the formalism to incorporate the measurement-induced geometric phase therein. We show that the geometric phase of the most likely trajectories undergoes a topological transition for self-closing trajectories as a function of the measurement strength parameter. Moreover, the inclusion of Gaussian corrections in the vicinity of the most probable self-closing trajectory quantitatively changes the transition point in agreement with results from numerical simulations of the full set of quantum trajectories.

TI Piezoelectrically driven diamond phononic nanocavity by phonon-matching
   scheme for quantum applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efficiently exciting and controlling phonons in diamond nanoresonators represents a fundamental challenge for quantum applications. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of exciting mechanical modes within a double hybrid cavity (DHC), formed by adjoining to a diamond cavity a second cavity made of aluminum nitride. The latter is piezoelectric and serves as a microwave-to-phonon transducer, activating mechanical modes in the entire DHC. We show the process of matching the cavities' phononic properties, making them work coordinately in the DHC and obtaining a well-confined mode. In the diamond part of the cavity, this mode replicates the fundamental mode of the individual diamond cavity, showing that the piezoelectric transducer does not alter the diamond individual fundamental mode. In the piezoelectric part, the strong confinement of stress and electric field results in a high piezoelectric coupling rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of a phononic cavity as a transducer. The study is contextualized in the framework of a quantum networking application, where the DHC serves as a spin qubit, exploiting the spin-mechanical coupling within diamond color centers.

TI Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum coherence beyond linear
   response
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum thermodynamics allows for the interconversion of quantum coherence and mechanical work. Quantum coherence is thus a potential physical resource for quantum machines. However, formulating a general nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum coherence has turned out to be challenging. In particular, precise conditions under which coherence is beneficial to or, on the contrary, detrimental for work extraction from a system have remained elusive. We here develop a generic dynamic-Bayesian-network approach to the far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics of coherence. We concretely derive generalized fluctuation relations and a maximum-work theorem that fully account for quantum coherence at all times, for both closed and open dynamics. We obtain criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and identify a nonequilibrium regime where maximum work extraction is increased by quantum coherence for fast processes beyond linear response.
   Formulating a general nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum coherence and identifying conditions for it to affect work extraction has remained elusive.

AB We introduce quantum-K (QK), a measure of the descriptive complexity of density matrices using classical prefix-free Turing machines and show that the initial segments of weak Solovay random and quantum Schnorr random states are incompressible in the sense of QK. Many properties enjoyed by prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity (K) have analogous versions for QK; notably a counting condition.
   Several connections between Solovay randomness and K, including the Chaitin type characterization of Solovay randomness, carry over to those between weak Solovay randomness and QK. We work towards a Levin-Schnorr type characterization of weak Solovay randomness in terms of QK.
   Schnorr randomness has a Levin-Schnorr characterization using K-C; a version of K-using a computable measure machine, C. We similarly define QK(C), a version of QK. Quantum Schnorr randomness is shown to have a Levin-Schnorr and a Chaitin type characterization using QK(C). The latter implies a Chaitin type characterization of classical Schnorr randomness using K-C. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI False signals of chaos from quantum probes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate that two-time correlation functions, which are generalizations of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), can show "false flags" of chaos by exhibiting behavior predicted by random matrix theory even in a system with classically regular dynamics. In particular, we analyze a system of bosons trapped in a double-well potential and probed by a quantum dot which is coupled to the bosons dispersively. This system is integrable. Despite the continuous time evolution generated by the true Hamiltonian, we find that the n-fold two-time correlation function for the probe describes an effective stroboscopic or Floquet dynamics. From this perspective, the bosons appear to be alternately driven by two different noncommuting Hamiltonians in a manner reminiscent of the Trotterized time evolution that occurs in digital quantum simulation. The classical limit of this effective dynamics can have a nonzero Lyapunov exponent, while the effective level statistics and return probability show traditional signatures of chaotic behavior. In line with several other recent studies, this work highlights the fact that the behavior of OTOCs and their generalizations must be interpreted with some care.

TI Robust preparation of ground state phases under noisy imaginary time
   evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonunitary state preparation protocols such as imaginary time evolution (ITE) offer substantial advantages relative to unitary ones, including the ability to prepare certain long-range correlated states more efficiently. Here, we ask whether such protocols are also robust to noise arising due to coupling to the environment. We consider a nonunitary ITE "circuit" subjected to a variety of noise models and investigate whether the resulting steady state remains in the same phase as the target state of the ITE at finite noise strength. Taking the one-dimensional quantum Ising model as a concrete example, we find that the ground-state order and associated phase transition persist in the presence of noise, provided the noise does not explicitly break the symmetry that protects the phase transition. That is, the noise must possess the protecting symmetry in a weak (or average) form. Our analysis is facilitated by a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian picture in a doubled Hilbert space. We discuss possible implications of these findings for quantum simulation on noisy quantum hardware.

TI Giant Rectification in Strongly Interacting Driven Tilted Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Correlated quantum systems feature a wide range of nontrivial effects emerging from interactions between their constituent particles. In nonequilibrium scenarios, these manifest in phenomena such as many-body insulating states and anomalous scaling laws of currents of conserved quantities, crucial for applications in quantum circuit technologies. In this work, we propose a giant-rectification scheme based on the asymmetric interplay between strong particle interactions and a tilted potential, each of which induces an insulating state on its own. While for reverse bias both cooperate and induce a strengthened insulator with an exponentially suppressed current, for forward bias they compete, generating conduction resonances; this leads to a rectification coefficient of many orders of magnitude. We uncover the mechanism underlying these resonances as enhanced coherences between energy eigenstates occurring at avoided crossings in the bulk energy spectrum of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the complexity of the many-body nonequilibrium conducting state through the emergence of enhanced density-matrix impurity and operator-space entanglement entropy close to the resonances. Our proposal paves the way for implementing a perfect diode in currently available electronic and quantum simulation platforms.

TI Ultra-Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral In-Sb
   Chlorides with Near-Unity Quantum Yield
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials hold significant promise in advanced optoelectronics. However, it still remains challenging to obtain chiral metal halides with simultaneously a large luminescence dissymmetry factor (g lum) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Inspired by the intriguing luminescence properties of heterometallic-doping complexes, we successfully synthesized chiral indium-antimony halide hybrids, (R/S-MPZ)2In1-xSbxCl7 (R/S-1) (MPZ = 2-Methylpiperazine, x approximate to 0.02), where the alloying of Sb3+ ions significantly enhances PLQY and optimizes the distortion of metal halide octahedra, thereby synergistically improving the g lum. As a result, R-1 exhibits excellent CPL performance with PLQY and |g lum| values up to 98.2% and 0.1, respectively. The high figure of merit of 9.82 x 10-2 significantly surpasses those of the reported indium-based CPL materials. Furthermore, the resulting circularly polarized light-emitting diode exhibits a high |g lum| value of 9.3 x 10-3, being superior to most reported CPL-active materials. This work provides a robust strategy for addressing the synergistic enhancement between g lum and PLQY in CPL systems, offering a high-performance polarized light source for quantum communication and optical encryption.

TI Polarization-controlled Brillouin scattering in elliptical optophononic
   resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The fast-growing development of optomechanical applications has motivated advancements in Brillouin scattering research. In particular, the study of high-frequency acoustic phonons at the nanoscale is interesting due to the large range of interactions with other excitations in matter. However, standard Brillouin spectroscopy schemes rely on fixed wavelength filtering, which limits their usefulness for the study of tunable optophononic resonators. It has been recently demonstrated that elliptical optophononic micropillar resonators induce different energy-dependent polarization states for the Brillouin and the elastic Rayleigh scattering and that a polarization filtering setup could be implemented to increase the contrast between the inelastic and elastic scattering of the light. An optimal filtering configuration can be reached when the polarization states of the laser and the Brillouin signal are orthogonal to each other. In this work, we theoretically investigate the parameters of such polarization-based filtering techniques to enhance the efficiency of Brillouin scattering detection. For the filtering optimization, we explore the initial wavelength and polarization state of the incident laser, as well as the ellipticity of the micropillars, and reach an almost optimal configuration for nearly background-free Brillouin detection. Our findings are one step forward in the efficient detection of Brillouin scattering in nanostructures for potential applications in fields such as optomechanics and quantum communication.

TI Measurements of the hyperfine structure of nPJ Rydberg states by
   microwave spectroscopy in Cs atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present measurements of the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the nPJ J Rydberg states for a large range of principal quantum number n (n n = 41-55) employing microwave spectroscopy in an ultracold cesium Rydberg ensemble. A microwave field with 30-mu s duration couples the nS-* nP transition, yielding a narrow linewidth spectroscopy that approaches the Fourier limit, which allows us to resolve the hyperfine structure of nPJ J states. By analyzing the hyperfine splittings of nPJ J states, we determine the magnetic dipole HFS coupling constant A <overline> HFS, P 1 / 2 = 3.760(26) . 760(26) GHz for the P 1 / 2 state, and A <overline> HFS, P 3 / 2 = 0.718(27) . 718(27) GHz and B <overline> HFS, P 3 / 2 = - 0 . 084(102) GHz for the P 3 / 2 state. Systematic uncertainties caused by stray electromagnetic field, microwave field power, and Rydberg interaction are analyzed. This measurement is significant for the investigation of Rydberg electrometry and quantum simulation with dipole interaction involving the nPJ J state.

TI High finesse bow-tie cavity for strong atom-photon coupling in Rydberg
   arrays
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a high-finesse bow-tie cavity designed for atomic physics experiments with Rydberg atom arrays. The cavity has a finesse of 51,000 and a waist of 7.1 mu m at the cesium D2 line (852 nm). With these parameters, the cavity is expected to induce strong coupling between a single atom and a single photon, corresponding to a cooperativity per traveling mode of 35 at the cavity waist. To trap and image atoms, the cavity setup utilizes two in-vacuum aspheric lenses with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.35 and is capable of housing NA = 0.5 microscope objectives. In addition, the large atom-mirror distance (greater than or similar to 1.5 cm) provides good optical access and minimizes stray electric fields at the position of the atoms. This cavity setup can operate in tandem with a Rydberg array platform, creating a fully connected system for quantum simulation and computation.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Design and construction of a quantum matter synthesizer
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB The quantum matter synthesizer (QMS) is a new quantum simulation platform in which individual particles in a lattice can be resolved and re-arranged into arbitrary patterns. The ability to spatially manipulate ultracold atoms and control their tunneling and interactions at the single-particle level allows full control of a many-body quantum system. We present the design and characterization of the QMS, which integrates into a single ultra-stable apparatus a two-dimensional optical lattice, a moving optical tweezer array formed by a digital micromirror device, and site-resolved atomic imaging. We demonstrate excellent mechanical stability between the lattice and tweezer array with relative fluctuations below 10 nm, diffraction-limited imaging at a resolution of 655 nm, and high-speed real-time control of the tweezer array at a 2.52 kHz refresh rate, which will be adopted to realize fast rearrangement of atoms. The QMS also features new technologies and schemes, such as nanotextured anti-reflective windows and all-optical long-distance transport of atoms.

TI Recent advances in understanding the role of solvated electrons at the

SO SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB The solvated electron is one of the strongest known reducing species. Solution-based glow discharges, in which a gaseous discharge is ignited between a metal electrode and a liquid surface, are an emerging spectrochemical source in analytical atomic emission and mass spectrometry. In other disciplines, the similar setup is called plasma electrolysis and can be used for materials and chemical synthesis. Regardless of its name and application areas, electrons are injected into a solution and the underlying physics and chemistry in these systems is complex. Quantitative understanding is necessary in order to maximize performance for chemical and materials applications. In this paper, we summarize the state-of-the-art in plasma-liquid interactions involving solvated electrons, with a particular emphasis on the work by our group, and highlight potential areas of future study to both fill in knowledge gaps and drive applications forward.

TI Realizing tight-binding Hamiltonians using site-controlled coupled
   cavity arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Analog quantum simulators rely on programmable and scalable quantum devices to emulate Hamiltonians describing various physical phenomenon. Photonic coupled cavity arrays are a promising alternative platform for realizing such simulators, due to their potential for scalability, small size, and high-temperature operability. However, programmability and nonlinearity in photonic cavities remain outstanding challenges. Here, using a silicon photonic coupled cavity array made up of 8 high quality factor (Q up to similar to 7:1 x 10(4)) resonators and equipped with specially designed thermo-optic island heaters for independent control of cavities, we demonstrate a programmable photonic cavity array in the telecom regime, implementing tight-binding Hamiltonians with access to the full eigenenergy spectrum. We report a similar to 50% reduction in the thermal crosstalk between neighboring sites of the cavity array compared to traditional heaters, and then present a control scheme to program the cavity array to a given tight-binding Hamiltonian. The ability to independently program high-Q photonic cavities, along with the compatibility of silicon photonics to high volume manufacturing opens new opportunities for scalable quantum simulation using telecom regime infrared photons.

TI Mapping time-dependent quasi-energies of laser dressed helium
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient absorption spectrum of helium dressed by a moderately intense infrared laser pulse is investigated. Strategies for correct retrieval of the time-dependent quasi-energies of helium with excitation energies covering both singly and doubly excited states are proposed. For long-lived singly excited states, the profound hyperbolic structures due to long lasting dipole can be diminished by convoluting the transient absorption spectrogram with a spectral window, allowing the time-dependent quasi-energies close to 1s2p resonance to be correctly mapped out. For short-lived doubly excited states near 2s2p resonance, the radiation dipole decays rapidly due to autoionization and the transient absorption spectrogram already recovers the main structure of quasi-energies without the convolution operation. The quantum simulation indicates that the convolution operation controls the effective decay speed of the dipole moment, which effectively builds up an instant probe that is essential for mapping time dependent quasi-energies of laser dressed systems.

TI Radiation hardness properties and DCR reduction via laser annealing of
   InGaAs/InP SPADs for space applications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a theoretical and experimental study of proton radiation effects on the performance of InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), used in applications such as space communications and remote sensing, where single-photon detectors for the telecom-compatible near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are required. The devices were exposed to 3 MeV protons at different fluences. At high fluences (above 1010 protons/cm2), we measured large variations in dark current, breakdown voltage, and dark count rate, while at lower fluences (below 109 protons/cm2), minor variations in dark count rate, negligible variations in the dark current, and no shift in the breakdown voltage were observed. Combining experimental results with TRIM simulations, we determined the proton radiation hardness parameters, including the acceptable displacement damage dose (DDD) to avoid catastrophic failure of these types of photodiodes. Furthermore, we experimentally investigated the mitigation of the radiation damage through annealing by means of high-power lasers, and we observed a significant reduction in the dark count rate of the InGaAs/InP SPADs that were irradiated at low fluences. Our study provides important guidance on using telecom-wavelength compatible single-photon detectors in a space environment and shows that such devices are good candidates for satellite-based quantum communication nodes.

   Applications, and Future Outlook
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB Quantum antennas represent a significant leap forward in antenna technology, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance communication, imaging, and sensing applications in the terahertz, infrared, and optical regimes. This review begins with an overview of the theoretical foundations for quantum antennas as open quantum systems, discussing how strong coupling and quantum state manipulation can be harnessed for practical implementations. We then examine groundbreaking advancements in quantum antenna design, including the integration of novel material configurations, such as quantum dot arrays and their interactions with photonic reservoirs. The review explores the unique quantum phenomena exhibited by these antennas, including Rabi oscillations, solitons, and non-reciprocal behavior, which set them apart from classical antennas. Additionally, we discuss the role of quantum metasurfaces in manipulating electromagnetic waves at the quantum level, opening new avenues for antenna design and functionality. Understanding these quantum effects enables the optimization of antenna performance for emerging applications in quantum communication, where enhanced security and efficiency are paramount. Finally, this comprehensive analysis not only bridges the gap between classical and quantum antennas but also underscores the remarkable potential of quantum antennas, highlighting future directions and their evolving role in emerging technologies

TI Tunable hybrid silicon single-electron transistor-nanoscale field-effect
   transistor operating at room temperature
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A hybrid silicon single-electron transistor (SET)-field-effect transistor (FET), tunable by gate voltages between single-electron and classical FET operation, at room temperature (RT) is demonstrated. The device uses a side-gated, similar to 6 nm wide, heavily doped n(+) silicon fin. A gatecontrolled transition occurs from a depletion mode FET, including characteristic output saturation, to a quantum dot SET with "Coulomb diamond" characteristics above and near the threshold voltage, respectively. Below the threshold voltage, p-FET behavior implies ambipolar operation. Statistics for 180 research devices show a high yield of similar to 37% for RT SET-FET operation and mean single-electron addition energy similar to 0.3 eV. This yield also demonstrates the probability of single-electron effects in highly scaled doped nanoFETs and the possibility of electrically tunable, RT quantum and classical mode, nanoelectronic circuits.

TI Generation of 1319 nm Pulsed Vortex Laser by Annular Pumped Bonded
   Nd:YAG/V:YAG Crystal
SO PHOTONICS
AB Vortex lasers have shown significant advantages in fields such as quantum communication and optical detection due to their unique optical field structure. In this manuscript, we present a watt-level nanosecond Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beam from an end-pumped bonded Nd:YAG/V:YAG laser, which was pumped by a ring-shaped beam shaped by an axicon focusing system. By solving the transfer matrix of the resonator and designing a corresponding pump beam shaping system, mode matching between the LG01 beam and the annular pump beam was effectively achieved. The conditions for exciting the LG01 mode were theoretically calculated, and experimental results verified that the pump power required to excite the LG01 vortex beam is approximately twice that for exciting the fundamental Gaussian mode. Stable output of nanosecond lasers in the LG01 mode was achieved, with an output power of 1.943 W, a highest repetition rate of 291.3 kHz, a pulse width of 3.3 ns, and beam quality factors of Mx2=2.17 in the horizontal direction and My2=2.21 in the vertical direction. The results have significant value for applications such as visible light communication and high-resolution laser imaging.

TI A Perspective on Synthetic Dimensions in Photonics
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The concept of synthetic dimension has recently emerged as a versatile way to overcome limitations in the number of effectively available dimensions by leveraging non-spatial degrees of freedom to mimic additional geometric ones. In particular, the field of photonics offers a plethora of technological possibilities for controlling photons and their degrees of freedom, such as polarization, frequency, or orbital angular momentum. Consequently, a broad range of higher-dimensional physical phenomena is already experimentally accessible in lower-dimensional photonic devices and has been used and celebrated, for instance, for the exploration of topological physics. The field of synthetic dimensions is currently even further boosted due to additional mathematical mapping procedures, which pave the way toward even higher synthetic dimensions or, in the presence of optical nonlinearities, can translate to multi-particle quantum systems, allowing appealing alternatives for quantum simulation. In this perspective, current experimental approaches for harnessing synthetic dimensions to probe higher-dimensional physics on various light-based platforms are summarized and discussed including an outlook on promising future prospects in this field.

TI Reformulation of gauge theories in terms of gauge invariant fields
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We present a reformulation of gauge theories in terms of gauge invariant fields. Focusing on abelian theories, we show that the gauge and matter covariant fields can be recombined to introduce new gauge invariant degrees of freedom. Starting from the (1 + 1) dimensional case on the lattice, with both periodic and open boundary conditions, we then generalize to higher dimensions and to the continuum limit. To show explicit and physically relevant examples of the reformulation, we apply it to the Hamiltonian of a single particle in a (static) magnetic field, to pure abelian lattice gauge theories, to the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics in (3+1) dimensions and to the Hamiltonian of the 2d and the 3d Hofstadter model. In the latter, we show that the particular construction used to eliminate the gauge covariant fields enters the definition of the magnetic Brillouin zone. Finally, we briefly comment on relevance of the presented reformulation to the study of interacting gauge theories. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Design, Realization, and Validation of the Scheme for Quantum
   Degenerate Research in Microgravity
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB In microgravity, atoms can be prepared to a lower temperature and manipulated with a longer time. The Cold Atom Physics Research Rack (CAPR) in Chinese Space Station, which aims to prepare quantum degenerate gas for deep cooling and quantum simulation in microgravity, has been designed, realized, and validated. We built an integrated CAPR, consisting of a physical system, an all-fiber 780 nm laser system and a low phase noise 1064 nm fiber laser system, and an electrical driving and controlling system. With the CAPR, a Rb-87 quantum degenerate gas with 1.2 x 10(5) atoms and a temperature below 30 nK was achieved on ground. In this article, we also show the robustness of the rack, based on the experimental results before and after the simulation of the vibration and impact during the launch.

TI Finding the ground state of a lattice gauge theory with fermionic tensor
   networks: A 2+1D Z2 demonstration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Tensor network states, and in particular projected entangled pair states (PEPS) have been a strong ansatz for the variational study of complicated quantum many-body systems, thanks to their built-in entanglement entropy area law. In this work, we use a special kind of PEPS-gauged Gaussian fermionic PEPS (GGFPEPS)-to find the ground state of 2 thorn 1 dimensional pure Z2 lattice gauge theories for a wide range of coupling constants. We do so by combining PEPS methods with Monte-Carlo computations, allowing for efficient contraction of the PEPS and computation of correlation functions. Previously, such numerical computations involved the calculation of the Pfaffian of a matrix scaling with the system size, forming a severe bottleneck; in this work we show how to overcome this problem. This paves the way for applying the method we propose and benchmark here to other gauge groups, higher dimensions, and models with fermionic matter, in an efficient, sign-problem-free way.

TI Synthetic U(1) gauge invariance in a spin-1 Bose gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent experimental realizations of the U(1) gauge invariance [Nature (London) 587, 392 (2020); Science 367, 1128 (2020)] open a door for quantum simulation of elementary particles and their interactions using ultracold atoms. Stimulated by such exciting progress, we propose a platform-a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate-to simulate the deconfined lattice Schwinger model. Unlike previous platforms, it is shown that the atomic interactions in the spin-1 condensate naturally lead to a matter-field interaction term which respects the U(1) gauge symmetry. As a result, a new Z3-ordered phase with threefold ground-state degeneracy emerges in the phase diagram. The Z3 phase connects to the disordered phase by a three-state Potts criticality, which is in contrast to the conventional Coleman's transition with Ising criticality. Furthermore, the ordered state is constructed by a set of weak quantum scars, which is responsible for the anomalously slow dynamics as it is quenched to a special point in the phase diagram. Our proposal provides a platform for extracting emergent physics in synthetic gauge systems with matter-field interactions.

TI Orchestrating Spontaneous Emission With Metasurfaces: Recent Advances in
   Engineering Thermal, Luminescent, and Quantum Emissions
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Metasurfaces have emerged as powerful tools for controlling spontaneous emission, offering unprecedented control over light-matter interactions at sub-wavelength scales. While metasurfaces are traditionally utilized for shaping coherent electromagnetic waves, they have recently extended their capabilities to control incoherent or spontaneous emission. This examines review how metasurfaces can enhance and precisely control properties of thermal, luminescent, and quantum emission. In thermal emission, metasurfaces enable control over spatial, temporal, and spin coherence, offering new possibilities for applications such as energy harvesting, radiative cooling and heat assisted ranging and detection. For luminescent emission, metasurfaces significantly improve emission rates, quantum efficiency, and directionality, driving innovations in lighting and display technologies. For controlling quantized spontaneous emission, metasurfaces are instrumental in enhancing single-photon sources and enabling novel functionalities in quantum states through photon-pair generation, which is vital for quantum communication, meteorology, and computing. Despite these advancements several challenges to increase the operational bandwidths, accelerate and develop simulation strategies, and fabrication complexities persist. Emerging trends are also dicussed, such as dynamic metasurfaces and their integration with nanophotonic platforms, which could further expand the capabilities of light-emitting metasurfaces.

TI Enhancing Quantum Image Encryption With QLSTM and Chaos Synchronisation
   Control: A Deep Neural Network Approach
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
AB Quantum image encryption is crucial for data protection, but current methods lack attack resistance and have complex encryption processes. This paper proposes a quantum long short - term memory (QLSTM)-based quantum image encryption method to enhance chaotic sequences and achieve chaos synchronisation control. The QLSTM network improves the Lorenz chaotic sequence, increasing its unpredictability. An adaptive synchronisation control algorithm, using the enhanced chaotic sequence from QLSTM, ensures sender-receiver synchronization. Optimised through deep neural networks, the system maintains stable synchronization under interference. New cryptographic quantum infrastructure (NCQI) was constructed, and images were encrypted using third-order radial diffusion, quantum generalised Arnold transform, and quantum W transform. The QLSTM-improved chaotic sequence showed excellent LLE and 0-1 test results. Information entropy was near 8, with R, G and B channels exceeding 7.999. Anti-attack analysis revealed high information entropy, strong attack resistance, and number of pixels change rate/unified average changing intensity (NPCR/UACI) values of 99.698% and 33.460%, respectively, indicating significant pixel-level changes. Combining quantum chaotic system prediction with the QLSTM model enhanced quantum communication stability and anti-interference ability. This QLSTM-based quantum encryption method, with chaos synchronisation control, significantly improves encryption security and reliability, maintaining high information entropy and complexity under attacks, proving its effectiveness in image encryption.

TI Constraint on local definitions of quantum internal energy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent advances in quantum thermodynamics have been focusing on ever more elementary systems of interest, approaching the limit of a single qubit, with correlations, strong coupling, and far-from-equilibrium environments coming into play. Under such scenarios, it is clear that fundamental physical quantities must be revisited. This article questions whether a universal definition of internal energy for open quantum systems can be devised, setting limits on its possible properties. We argue that, for such a definition to be regarded as local, it should be determined by using only local resources, i.e., the open system's reduced density operator p and its time derivatives. The simplest construction, then, would be a functional U(p, <(p)over dot>). We adopt the minimalist implementation of a bipartite quantum universe, namely, two qubits in a pure joint state, and show that the functional relationship cannot be that simple if it is to generally recover the well-established internal energy of the universe. No further hypothesis or approximation scheme was assumed. An illustrative counterexample is explored, and possible implications of the general constraint are discussed.

TI Comparing metrics for mixed quantum states: Sjoqvist and Bures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is known that there are infinitely many distinguishability metrics for mixed quantum states. This freedom, in turn, leads to metric-dependent interpretations of physically meaningful geometric quantities such as complexity and volume of quantum states. In this paper, we first present an explicit and unabridged mathematical discussion on the relation between the Sjoqvist metric and the Bures metric for arbitrary nondegenerate mixed quantum states, using the notion of decompositions of density operators by means of ensembles of pure quantum states. Then, to enhance our comprehension of the difference between these two metrics from a physics standpoint, we compare the formal expressions of these two metrics for arbitrary thermal quantum states specifying quantum systems in equilibrium with a reservoir at nonzero temperature. For illustrative purposes, we show the difference between these two metrics in the case of a simple physical system characterized by a spin-qubit in an arbitrarily oriented uniform and stationary external magnetic field in thermal equilibrium with a finite-temperature bath. Finally, we compare the Bures and Sjoqvist metrics in terms of their monotonicity property.

TI Simple, Reliable, and Noise-Resilient Continuous-Variable Quantum State
   Tomography with Convex Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Precise reconstruction of unknown quantum states from measurement data, a process commonly called quantum state tomography, is a crucial component in the development of quantum informa-tion processing technologies. Many different tomography methods have been proposed over the years. Maximum-likelihood estimation is a prominent example, being the most popular method for a long period of time. Recently, more advanced neural-network methods have started to emerge. Here, we go back to basics and present a method for continuous-variable state reconstruction that is both conceptually and prac-tically simple, based on convex optimization. Convex optimization has been used for process tomography and qubit-state tomography, but seems to have been overlooked for continuous-variable quantum-state tomography. We demonstrate high-fidelity reconstruction of an underlying state from data corrupted by thermal noise and imperfect detection, for both homodyne and heterodyne measurements. A major advan-tage over other methods is that convex optimization algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.

TI Sensing of Arbitrary-Frequency Fields Using a Quantum Mixer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum sensors such as spin defects in diamond have achieved excellent performance by combining high sensitivity with spatial resolution. Unfortunately, these sensors can only detect signal fields with frequency in a few accessible ranges, typically low frequencies up to the experimentally achievable control field amplitudes and a narrow window around the sensors' resonance frequency. Here, we develop and demonstrate a technique for sensing arbitrary-frequency signals by using the sensor qubit as a quantum frequency mixer, enabling a variety of sensing applications. The technique leverages nonlinear effects in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems to achieve quantum frequency mixing of the signal and an applied bias ac field. The frequency-mixed field can be detected using well-developed sensing techniques such as Rabi and CPMG with the only additional requirement of the bias field. We further show that the frequency mixing can distinguish vectorial components of an oscillating signal field, thus enabling arbitrary-frequency vector magnetometry. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to sense a 150-MHz signal field, proving the versatility of the quantum mixer sensing technique.

TI Spin resonance amplitude and frequency of a single atom on a surface in
   a vector magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigated spin-1/2 hydrogenated titanium (Ti) atoms on MgO using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) in vector magnetic fields. Rotating external magnetic fields, we observed rather drastic changes in both amplitude and frequency of resonance signals for single Ti atoms. While the variation of ESR amplitudes reflects the effects of the spin polarization of a magnetic tip and local magnetic fields created by the interaction between the tip and Ti, the change of resonance frequencies shows the anisotropy of g values for Ti atoms. Using the Ti atoms at the low-symmetry bridge adsorption site of the MgO lattice allowed for identifying the g values in all three spatial directions. Multiplet calculations confirmed the origin of this anisotropy as the spin-orbit coupling induced effects of crystal. Our results show the capability of single atomic spins as a sensor to probe magnetic surroundings and highlight the precision of ESR-STM to identify the single atom's spin states in a solid-state environment.

TI Simplifying the design of multilevel thermal machines using virtual
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum thermodynamics often deals with the dynamics of small quantum machines interfacing with a large and complex environment. Virtual qubits, collisional models, and reset master equations have become highly useful tools for predicting the qualitative behavior of two-dimensional target systems coupled to few-qubit machines and a thermal environment. While few successes in matching the simplified model parameters for all possible physical systems are known, the qualitative predictions still allow for a general design of quantum machines irrespective of the implementation. We generalise these tools by introducing multiple competing virtual qubits for modeling multidimensional systems coupled to larger and more complex machines. By simulating the full physical dynamics for targets with three dimensions, we uncover general properties of reset models that can be used as "dials" to correctly predict the qualitative features of physical changes in a realistic setup and thus design autonomous quantum machines beyond a few qubits. We then present a general analytic solution of the reset model for arbitrary-dimensional systems coupled to multiqubit machines. Finally, we showcase an improved three-level laser as an exemplary application of our results.

AB Topological superconductivity has been sought in a variety of heterostructure systems, the interest being that a material displaying such a phenomenon could prove to be the ideal platform to support Majorana fermions, which in turn could be the basis for advanced qubit technologies. Recently, the high-T-c family of superconductors, FeTe1-xSex, have been shown to exhibit the property of topological superconductivity and further, evidence has been found for the presence of Majorana fermions. We have studied the interplay of topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in the FeTe1-xSex family using high-resolution laser-based photo-emission. At the bulk superconducting transition, a gap opens at the chemical potential as expected. However, a second gap is observed to open at the Dirac point in the topological surface state. The associated mass acquisition in the topological state points to time-reversal symmetry breaking, probably associated with the formation of ferromagnetism in the surface layer. The presence of intrinsic ferromagnetism combined with strong spin-orbit coupling provides an ideal platform for a range of exotic topological phenomena.

TI Real-imaginary spectrum decomposition of the transparency spectra in
   microwave dressed Rydberg systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB To distinguish the contributions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) in their applications in precision laser spectroscopy, we propose a real -imaginary spectrum decomposition method to investigate the transparency spectra in a four -level microwave (MW) dressed Rydberg system. We show that the opening transparency windows in the absorption spectra of probe field is a prominent character by EIT, EIT-ATS crossover, and ATS when the MW field is turned off and the intensity of the control field is adjusted. When the MW field is turned on and gradually increased, the EIT is destroyed and disappears. In addition, the most prominent characters that open a transparency window are the EIT-ATS crossover and the ATS. Then, if we further increase the intensity of the MW field, we find that the transparency windows open mainly due to the ATS. Compared to the previous considerations of this issue, which were limited to three -level systems, our four -level scheme reported here is useful for understanding the features of quantum interference in multilevel atomic systems, and has potential applications to study enhanced sensitivity, measurement spectroscopic, quantum processing, quantum communication, and transmission.

TI Frequency-subspace encoding for multiplexed quantum secret sharing
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a multi-party quantum communication protocol that can be realized with bipartite entanglement and relative phase encoding. Previous implementations typically encoded the phase in the pump, applying it across the entire source bandwidth, thereby limiting scalability via wavelength multiplexing. In contrast, we present a variant of the standard QSS protocol that leverages frequency correlations to connect multiple users with a single source. The secret owner, who has access to the source, encodes classical information by applying frequency-dependent phase modulation to a broadband polarization-entangled photon pair. Each frequency channel, therefore, provides an independent QSS session among the secret owner and a pair of users. We demonstrate state fidelities of at least 90% for a channel pair of the 200 GHz ITU grid, a configuration that can be extended to more than 40 frequency bins for the same grid spacing. Notably, despite the use of large grid spacing and the experimental limitations, the system achieves full connectivity of a network of 7 users while maintaining a key fraction of 0.4 bits/photon. These results provide a resource-efficient path toward multi-user secret sharing over wavelength-multiplexed networks, eliminating the need for multiple two-photon or multi-photon sources.

TI Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.

TI Deformed Fredkin model for the ν = 5/2 Moore-Read state on thin
   cylinders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a frustration-free model for the Moore-Read quantum Hall state on sufficiently thin cylinders with circumferences 7 magnetic lengths. While the Moore-Read Hamiltonian involves complicated long-range interactions between triplets of electrons in a Landau level, our effective model is a simpler one-dimensional chain of qubits with deformed Fredkin gates. We show that the ground state of the Fredkin model has high overlap with the Moore-Read wave function and accurately reproduces the latter's entanglement properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model captures the dynamical response of the Moore-Read state to a geometric quench, induced by suddenly changing the anisotropy of the system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism of the quench dynamics and show that it coincides with the linearized bimetric field theory. The minimal model introduced here can be directly implemented as a first step towards quantum simulation of the Moore-Read state, as we demonstrate by deriving an efficient circuit approximation to the ground state and implementing it on an IBM quantum processor.

TI Observation of topological phase with critical localization in a
   quasi-periodic lattice
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Disorder and localization have dramatic influence on the topological properties of a quantum system. While strong disorder can close the band gap thus depriving topological materials of topological features, disorder may also induce topology from trivial band structures, wherein topological invariants are shared by completely localized states. Here we experimentally investigate a fundamentally distinct scenario where topology is identified in a critically localized regime, with eigenstates neither fully extended nor completely localized. Adopting the technique of momentum-lattice engineering for ultracold atoms, we implement a one-dimensional, generalized Aubry-Andre model with both diagonal and off-diagonal quasi-periodic disorder in momentum space, and characterize its localization and topological properties through dynamic observables. We then demonstrate the impact of interactions on the critically localized topological state, as a first experimental endeavor toward the clarification of many-body critical phase, the critical analogue of the many-body localized state.

TI Quantum adiabatic doping for atomic Fermi-Hubbard quantum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is important to dope the antiferromagnetic state while preserving low entropy, in the quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 233603 (2019)], we proposed a quantum adiabatic doping protocol using an incommensurate lattice potential, where its feasibility is demonstrated with a certain particle-doping fraction. Here, we carry out a systematic study of quantum adiabatic doping for a wide range of doping fractions including both particle doping and hole doping, with both commensurate and incommensurate cases considered. We find that there is still a localizationlike slowing-down problem even at commensurate fillings, and that it becomes less harmful in the hole-doped regime. With interactions, the adiabatic preparation is found to be more efficient because the interaction effect destabilizes localization. For both free and interacting cases, we find adiabatic doping has a better performance in the hole-doped regime than the particle-doped regime. We also investigate adiabatic doping starting from a half-filling Mott insulator, which is found to be more efficient for certain filling fractions.

TI Certifiable Lower Bounds of Wigner Negativity Volume and Non-Gaussian
   Entanglement with Conditional Displacement Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics devices where control qubits are dispersively coupled to high-quality-factor cavities, characteristic functions of cavity states can be directly probed with conditional displacement (CD) gates. In this Letter, I propose a method to certify non-Gaussian entanglement between cavities using only CD gates and qubit readouts. The CD witness arises from an application of Bochner's theorem to a surprising connection between two negativities: that of the reduced Wigner function, and that of the partial transpose. Non-Gaussian entanglement of some common states, like entangled cats and photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacua, can be detected by measuring as few as four points of the characteristic function. Furthermore, the expectation value of the witness is a simultaneous lower bound to the Wigner negativity volume and a geometric measure of entanglement conjectured to be the partial transpose negativity. Both negativities are strong monotones of non-Gaussianity and entanglement, respectively, so the CD witness provides experimentally accessible lower bounds to quantities related to these monotones without the need for tomography on the cavity states.

TI Objective trajectories in hybrid classical-quantum dynamics
SO QUANTUM
AB Consistent dynamics which couples classical and quantum degrees of freedom exists, provided it is stochastic. This dynamics is linear in the hybrid state, completely positive and trace preserving. One application of this is to study the back-reaction of quantum fields on space-time which does not suffer from the pathologies of the semi-classical equations. Here we introduce several toy models in which to study hybrid classical-quantum evolution, including a qubit coupled to a particle in a potential, and a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a classical one. We present an unravelling approach to calculate the dynamics, and provide code to numerically simulate it. Unlike the purely quantum case, the trajectories (or histories) of this unravelling can be unique, conditioned on the classical degrees of freedom for discrete realisations of the dynamics, when different jumps in the classical degrees of freedom are accompanied by the action of unique operators on the quantum system. As a result, the "measurement postulate" of quantum theory is not needed; quantum systems become classical because they interact with a fundamentally classical field.

TI Entropy Production in Non-Markovian Collision Models: Information
   Backflow vs. System-Environment Correlations
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the irreversible entropy production of a qubit in contact with an environment modelled by a microscopic collision model in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Our main goal is to contribute to the discussions on the relationship between non-Markovian dynamics and negative entropy production rates. We employ two different types of collision models that do or do not keep the correlations established between the system and the incoming environmental particle, while both of them pertain to their non-Markovian nature through information backflow from the environment to the system. We observe that as the former model, where the correlations between the system and environment are preserved, gives rise to negative entropy production rates in the transient dynamics, the latter one always maintains positive rates, even though the convergence to the steady-state value is slower as compared to the corresponding Markovian dynamics. Our results suggest that the mechanism underpinning the negative entropy production rates is not solely non-Markovianity through information backflow, but rather the contribution to it through established system-environment correlations.

TI Heralding Higher-Dimensional Bell and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
   using multiport splitters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB One of the most important resources for quantum optical experiments and applications are on-demand highly entangled multiphoton quantum states. A promising way of generating them is heralding entanglement generation at a high rate from letting independent photons interfere. However, such schemes often work for a specific internal degree of freedom of the interfering photons only. Going to higher numbers of entangled photons, the success probabilities decrease while the number of necessary resources, e.g. auxiliary photons and optical elements, increases. To make probabilistic schemes feasible also for larger quantum states, it is therefore important to find resource-efficient generation schemes with high success probabilities. In this work, we introduce easily implementable schemes to herald qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, higher-dimensional Bell states and higher-dimensional three-party GHZ states. Our schemes solely rely on multiphoton interference, i.e. they can be adjusted to work for arbitrary degrees of freedom. Furthermore, they demonstrate high success probabilities and need comparably few auxiliary photons.

TI Quantum many-body spin rings coupled to ancillary spins: The sunburst
   quantum Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study the ground-state properties of a quantum sunburst model, composed of a quantum Ising spin ring in a transverse field, symmetrically coupled to a set of ancillary isolated qubits, to maintain a residual translation invariance and also a Z2 symmetry. The large-size limit is taken in two different ways: either by keeping the distance between any two neighboring ancillary qubits fixed or by fixing their number while increasing the ring size. Substantially different regimes emerge, depending on the various Hamiltonian parameters: For small energy scale 8 of the ancillary subsystem and small ring-qubit interaction ??, we observe rapid and nonanalytic changes in proximity to the quantum transitions of the Ising ring, both first order and continuous, which can be carefully controlled by exploiting renormalization-group and finite-size scaling frameworks. Smoother behaviors are instead observed when keeping 8 > 0 fixed and in the Ising disordered phase. The effect of an increasing number n of ancillary spins turns out to scale proportionally to ???n for sufficiently large values of n.

TI Quantum frames of reference and the noncommutative values of observables
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Based on a recent relational formulation of quantum reference frame transformations, especially with a case of quantum spatial translations in particular, we analyzed how the 'value' of an observable for a fixed state change. That is the exact analog of the classical description, for example, of the value of the x-coordinate for a particle decrease by 2 units when we perform a translation of the reference frame putting the new origin at x = 2. The essence of the quantum reference frame transformations is to have the quantum fluctuations, and even entanglement, of the physical object which serves as the (new) reference frame, taken into account. We illustrate how the recently introduced notion of the noncommutative values of quantum observables gives such a definite description successfully. Formulations, and an analysis of a case example in qubit systems, of analog transformations for observables with a discrete or finite spectrum is also presented. Issues about the evolving picture of the symmetry system of all quantum reference frame transformations discussed.

TI Dynamical Aharonov-Bohm cages and tight meson confinement in a Z2-loop
   gauge theory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Low-dimensional lattice gauge theories based on simplified gauge groups have emerged as relevant models of charge-confinement that can potentially be realized with quantum simulators. The intertwined dynamics of matter and gauge fields can result in quantum phases of the confined matter that have not yet been fully explored, especially in connection to the underlying mechanisms behind confinement. Here we study the finite-density phases of a Z2 lattice gauge theory of interconnected loops and dynamical Z2 charges. We show that the gauge-magnetic flux threading each loop is responsible for a phenomenon of dynamical Aharonov-Bohm caging, determining the confinement of particles into tightly-bound charge-neutral pairs, the Z2 analogue of mesons. The latter are trapped inside the cages, which become mobile by adding quantum fluctuations through an external electric field. These tightly-bound mesons can either propagate, manifesting a Luttinger liquid behaviour, or form an incompressible Mott insulator. In light of recent trapped-ion experiments for a single Z2 loop, these phases could be explored in future experiments.

TI Floquet Engineering Hz-Level Rabi Spectra in Shallow Optical Lattice
   Clock
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum metrology with ultrahigh precision usually requires atoms prepared in an ultrastable environment with well-defined quantum states. Thus, in optical lattice clock systems deep lattice potentials are used to trap ultracold atoms. However, decoherence, induced by Raman scattering and higher order light shifts, can significantly be reduced if atomic clocks are realized in shallow optical lattices. On the other hand, in such lattices, tunneling among different sites can cause additional dephasing and strongly broadening of the Rabi spectrum. Here, in our experiment, we periodically drive a shallow Sr-87 optical lattice clock. Counterintuitively, shaking the system can deform the wide broad spectral line into a sharp peak with 5.4 Hz linewidth. With careful comparison between the theory and experiment, we demonstrate that the Rabi frequency and the Bloch bands can be tuned, simultaneously and independently. Our work not only provides a different idea for quantum metrology, such as building shallow optical lattice clock in outer space, but also paves the way for quantum simulation of new phases of matter by engineering exotic spin orbit couplings.

This yields large-area (2 mm x 4 mm), high-density (similar to 40x103 mm-2) microlens arrays of uniform shape. The brightest QD emissions are found in lenses with 2.7 mu m diameter and 1.35 mu m height. Finite-difference time-domain simulations of lens geometries reveal optimization potentials, including anti-reflection coatings. It is found that free-space and fiber-coupled extraction efficiencies can reach up to 62% and 37%, respectively. A statistical fabrication model, validated through photoluminescence spectroscopy, shows intensity enhancements up to x 200 in ca. 1 out of 200 lenses, aligning well with theoretical predictions. This approach highlights the promise of compact, efficient photon sources for future large-scale quantum network applications.

TI Spatio-spectral localized modal coupling for room-temperature quantum
   coherence protection
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB This work aims to advance the room-temperature manipulation of photonic qubits and enhance coherence preservation in and for quantum applications via tailored spatio-spectral localized (SSL) systems. We focus on an innovative all-plasmonic SSL system consisting of a gold bowtie array on a gold substrate. This design produces a high-Q spectral-localized mode through the lattice array, emerging from the collective lattice response of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), particularly the surface lattice resonance (SLR). The SSL system enables tunable modal coupling between the LSPR and SLR, allowing precise alignment with quantum emitters to form quasi-bound states across an energy range of 1.45-1.91 eV. This flexibility allows us to investigate how innovative configurations - such as three-body coupling symmetry and modal-coupling strength - affect coherence protection. These insights pave the way for optimizing SSL systems, setting the stage for significant advancements in nanophotonic qubit manipulation at ambient conditions and the future of photonic quantum systems.

TI Time-delayed quantum feedback and incomplete decoherence suppression
   with a no-knowledge measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The no-knowledge quantum feedback was proposed by Szigeti et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett, 113, 020407 (2014)] as a measurement-based feedback protocol for decoherence suppression for an open quantum system. By continuously measuring environmental noises and feeding back controls on the system, the protocol can completely reverse the measurement back-action and therefore suppress the system's decoherence. However, the complete decoherence cancellation was shown only for the instantaneous feedback, which is impractical in real experiments. Therefore, in this work, we generalize the original work and investigate how the decoherence suppression can be degraded with unavoidable delay times, by analyzing non-Markovian average dynamics. We present analytical expressions for the average dynamics and numerically analyze the effects of the delayed feedback for a coherently driven two-level system, coupled to a bosonic bath via a Hermitian coupling operator. We also find that, when the qubit's unitary dynamics does not commute with the measurement and feedback controls, the decoherence rate can be either suppressed or amplified, depending on the delay time.

TI DMRG on Top of Plane-Wave Kohn-Sham Orbitals: A Case Study of Defected
   Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB In this paper, we analyze the numerical aspects of the inherent multireference density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on top of the periodic Kohn-Sham density functional theory using the complete active space approach. The potential of the framework is illustrated by studying hexagonal boron nitride nanoflakes embedding a charged single boron vacancy point defect by revealing a vertical energy spectrum with a prominent multireference character. We investigate the consistency of the DMRG energy spectrum from the perspective of sample size, basis size, and active space selection protocol. Results obtained from standard quantum chemical atom-centered basis calculations and plane-wave based counterparts show excellent agreement. Furthermore, we also discuss the spectrum of the periodic sheet which is in good agreement with extrapolated data of finite clusters. These results pave the way toward applying the DMRG method in extended correlated solid-state systems, such as point defect qubit in wide band gap semiconductors.

TI Hybrid acousto-optical swing-up state control in a quantum dot
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB State transfer between different quantum systems is key for successful quantum technologies. Over long distances, photons are irreplaceable, but on short ranges in miniaturized complex devices or hybrid systems, coupling via orders of magnitude shorter-wavelength acoustic waves has great potential. With interfaces to light, acoustic waves, and more, optically active quantum dots (QDs) are essential for multi-component systems. Here, we propose a hybrid acousto-optical method for non-resonant QD charge state control, extending the recent all-optical swing-up state preparation. We show that exciton and biexciton states, or other superpositions of charge states, can be prepared. Each field can act as a trigger, allowing for the implementation of either an optically gated acoustic control or the opposite scheme, where an optical pulse controls the transition during acoustic modulation. Thus, we introduce acoustic state control into a system that lacks direct acoustic coupling between the states. The method does not rely on pulse shaping and is expected to work with arbitrary pulse shapes as long as the optical dressing is performed quasi-adiabatically. Evaluating the phonon impact, we find an almost decoherence-free exciton preparation even at elevated temperatures with current QD and acoustic technology. This approach may also pave the way for optically controlled entanglement between emitters and acoustic modes, and further on-chip state transfer via quantum acoustic buses.

TI Master equation for non-Markovian quantum Brownian motion: The emergence
   of lateral coherences
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Understanding the behavior of a quantum system coupled to its environment is of fundamental interest in the general field of quantum technologies. It also has important repercussions on foundational problems in physics, such as the process of decoherence and the so-called quantum measurement problem. There have been many approaches to explore Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics within the framework of open quantum systems, but the richness of the ensuing dynamics is still not fully understood. In this paper we develop a non-Markovian extension of the standard Caldeira-Leggett model, based on expanding the dynamics of the reduced system at high temperature in inverse powers of the high-frequency cutoff of the Ohmic spectral density of the environment and derive a non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density matrix for the case of a general potential. We also obtain a fully analytical solution in the free particle case. While the short-time behavior of this solution does not diverge substantially from the Markovian behavior, at intermediate times we find a resurgence of coherence, which we name lateral coherence. We identify this with a corresponding transient negative entropy production rate, which is understood to be characteristic of non-Markovian dynamics. We also analyze the positivity of the reduced density matrix and derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in the classical limit.

TI Atomistic modeling of InGaN/GaN quantum dots-in-nanowire for graded
   surface-emitting low-threshold, blue exciton laser
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB While the development of the quantum photonics field, including emitter-light coupling using photonic system, has given a lot of attention, it offers quantum control of light. However, the main challenge is coupling to strongly photonic mode localization with nanosystem accuracy. This paper highlights the numerical simulations employed by atomically spin tight-binding model of realistically sized InGaN/GaN dots-in nanowire (NW) architectures. The effects of active region size/shapes, crystal growth directions, graded surface/interface properties, strain relaxation distributions, and polarization-induced potentials on the oscillator strengths of InGaN-based lasers have been investigated. The 3D nanofocused photonic modes, which have been deterministically coupled to multiple quantum dots (QDs) through graded surface/interface technique, have been demonstrated. By using a thin graded layers of a site-controlled pyramidal QDs, the photonic nanofocusing on these QDs at the nonpolar pyramid apex has been geometrically accomplished and successfully leads to stronger characteristics in terms of exciton bandgap energy and polarized emission rate compared to its polar counterpart. For optimum coupling, the nonpolar NW, with intrinsically lower built-in field, exhibits an enhancement of the QDs emission rate as high as 0.98, which is 12% greater than that in a recently reported semipolar MQD structure. The atomistic simulated emission rate for the core QDs buried in NW structure is then incorporated into a TCAD simulator to obtain laser device characteristics. Here, the achievement of truncated pyramid-electrically injected graded surface-emitting laser by nanofocusing the photonic modes formed in InGaN NW has been reported. The nonpolar laser device operates at similar to 402 nm and exhibits a threshold current of similar to 391 A/cm(2), which is lower nine order of magnitude lower compared to recently reported semipolar green laser diodes. Our model benchmarking has been done against a reported experiment of polar InGaN disks in GaN NW. Significantly, this engineering innovation proves the viability of InGaN nonpolar quantum dots-in-nanowire architecture as low threshold, high polarized, coherent blue nanoscale lasing emitters, and opens future trends toward a next-generation of electrically injected and interfacial grading-emitting nanolasers operating at high-frequency up to a GHz range.

TI Optimal repetitive readout of single solid-state spins determined by
   Fisher information
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum systems, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, quantum dots, solid-state defects, etc., have achieved considerable advancements in readout fidelity. However, the widely used threshold method disregards the importance of temporal characteristics of the signal during continuous measurements, leading to information loss. Here, we applied Fisher information to quantify the potential enhancement by using the temporal information. We proposed an optimal data processing method and derived the condition for equality to the error constrained by Fisher information. Applying this method to the single-shot readout of a 13C nuclear spin of nitrogen-vacancy center marks a 33.8 +/- 1.2% error reduction compared to the threshold method, improving the fidelity to 99.649(5)%. The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through the single-shot readout of charge states. This work illustrates the advantage of using photon arrival time for improving readout fidelity without upgrading experimental hardware. The method of using Fisher information to analyze readout fidelity also holds promise for broad applicability to other systems.

TI Nanoscale Positioning and In Situ Enhancement of Single G Center in
   Silicon Using a Fluorescence-Localization Technique
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Silicon-based semiconductor nanofabrication technology has achieved a remarkable level of sophistication and maturity, and color centers in silicon naturally inherit this advantage. Besides, their emissions appear in telecommunication bands, which makes them play a crucial role in the construction of a quantum network. To address the challenge of weak spontaneous emission, different optical cavities are fabricated to enhance the emission rate. However, the relative location between cavity and emitter is random, which greatly reduces the success probability of enhancement. Here, we report on a fluorescence-localization technique (FLT) for precisely locating a single G center in silicon and embedding it in the center of a circular Bragg grating cavity in situ, achieving 240-times improvement of the success probability. We observe a 30-fold enhancement of luminescence, 2.5-fold acceleration of the emission from a single G center, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 11. Our findings pave the way for large-scale integration of quantum light sources.

TI Resource-efficient shadow tomography using equatorial stabilizer
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a resource-efficient shadow-tomography scheme using equatorial-stabilizer measurements generated from subsets of Clifford unitaries. For n-qubit systems, equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow-tomography schemes can estimate M observables (up to an additive error epsilon) using O(log(M), poly(n), 1/epsilon 2) sampling copies for a large class of observables, including those with traceless parts possessing polynomially bounded Frobenius norms. For arbitrary quantum-state observables with a constant Frobenius norm, sampling complexity becomes n independent. Our scheme only requires an n-depth controlled-Z (CZ) circuit [O(n2) CZ gates] and Pauli measurements per sampling copy. Alternatively, our scheme is realizable with 2n-depth circuits comprising n2 nearest-neighboring CNOT gates, exhibiting a smaller maximal gate count relative to previously known randomized-Clifford-based proposals. We numerically confirm our theoretically derived shadow-tomographic sampling complexities with random pure states and multiqubit graph states. Finally, we demonstrate that equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow tomography is more noise tolerant than randomized-Clifford-based schemes in terms of fidelity estimation for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and W state.

TI PT symmetry in a superconducting hybrid quantum system with longitudinal
   coupling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme consisting of coupled nanomechanical cantilever resonators and superconducting flux qubits to engineer a parity-time- (PT-) symmetric phononic system formed by active and passive modes. The effective gain (loss) of the phonon mode is achieved by the longitudinal coupling of the resonator and the fast dissipative superconducting qubit with a blue-sideband driving (red-sideband driving). A PT-symmetric to broken-PT-symmetric phase transition can be observed in both balanced gain-to-loss and unbalanced gain-to-loss cases. Applying a resonant weak probe field to the dissipative resonator, we find that (i) for balanced gain and loss, the acoustic signal absorption to amplification can be tuned by changing the coupling strength between resonators; (ii) for unbalanced gain and loss, both acoustically induced transparency and anomalous dispersion can be observed around Delta = 0, where the maximum group delay is also located at this point. Our work provides an experimentally feasible scheme to design PT-symmetric phononic systems and a powerful platform for controllable acoustic signal transmission in a hybrid quantum system.

TI Isolation and Quantification of Plasma Cell-Free DNA Using Different
   Manual and Automated Methods
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) originates from various tissues and cell types and can enable minimally invasive diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancer and other diseases. Proper extraction of cfDNA is critical to obtain optimal yields and purity. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of six commercial cfDNA kits to extract pure, high-quality cfDNA from human plasma samples and evaluate the quantity and size profiles of cfDNA extracts-among them, two spin-column based, three magnetic bead-based and two automatic magnetic bead-based methods. Significant differences were observed in the yield of DNA among the different extraction kits (up to 4.3 times), as measured by the Qubit Fluorometer and Bioanalyzer. All kits isolated mostly small fragments corresponding to mono-nucleosomal sizes. The highest yield and reproducibility were obtained by the manual QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and automated MagNA Pure Total NA Isolation Kit. The results highlight the importance of standardizing preanalytical conditions depending on the requirements of the downstream applications.

TI State space structure of tripartite quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB State space structure of tripartite quantum systems is analyzed. In particular, it has been shown that the set of states separable across all the three bipartitions [say, B-int (ABC)] is a strict subset of the set of states having positive partial transposition across the three bipartite cuts [say, P-int (ABC)] for all the tripartite Hilbert spaces C-A(d1) circle times C-B(d2) circle times C-C(d3) with min{d(1), d(2), d(3)} >= 2. The claim is proved by constructing a state belonging to the set P-int (ABC) but not to B-int (ABC). For (C-d)(circle times 3) with d >= 3, the construction follows from a specific type of multipartite unextendible product bases. However, such a construction is not possible for (C-2)(circle times 3) since bipartite systems C-2 circle times C-n do not allow any unextendible product bases for arbitrary n [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385 (1999)]. For the three-qubit system, we therefore come up with a different construction.

TI Completely quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Artificial neural networks are at the heart of modern deep learning algorithms. We describe how to embed and train a general neural network in a quantum annealer without introducing any classical element in training. To implement the network on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, we develop three crucial ingredients: binary encoding the free parameters of the network; polynomial approximation of the activation function; and reduction of binary higher-order polynomials into quadratic ones. Together, these ideas allow encoding the loss function as an Ising model Hamiltonian. The quantum annealer then trains the network by finding the ground state. We implement this for an elementary network and illustrate the advantages of quantum training: its consistency in finding the global minimum of the loss function and the fact that the network training converges in a single annealing step, which leads to short training times while maintaining a high classification performance. After training the network using a quantum annealer, one can then use the quantum network weights in a classical network algorithm of identical design for inference. Our approach opens an avenue for the quantum training of general machine learning models.

TI Managing extreme cryptocurrency volatility in algorithmic trading:
   EGARCH via genetic algorithms and neural networks
SO QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB The blockchain ecosystem has seen a huge growth since 2009, with the introduction of Bitcoin, driven by conceptual and algorithmic innovations, along with the emergence of numerous new cryptocurrencies. While significant attention has been devoted to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the continuous introduction of new tokens requires a nuanced examination. In this article, we contribute a comparative analysis encompassing deep learning and quantum methods within neural networks and genetic algorithms, incorporating the innovative integration of EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) into these methodologies. In this study, we evaluated how well Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms predict "buy" or "sell" decisions for different cryptocurrencies, using F1 score, Precision, and Recall as key metrics. Our findings underscored the Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Fuzzy Logic as the most accurate and precise within genetic algorithms. Furthermore, neural network methods, particularly the Quantum Neural Network, demonstrated noteworthy accuracy. Importantly, the X2Y2 cryptocurrency consistently attained the highest accuracy levels in both methodologies, emphasizing its predictive strength. Beyond aiding in the selection of optimal trading methodologies, we introduced the potential of EGARCH integration to enhance predictive capabilities, offering valuable insights for reducing risks associated with investing in nascent cryptocurrencies amidst limited historical market data. This research provides insights for investors, regulators, and developers in the cryptocurrency market. Investors can utilize accurate predictions to optimize investment decisions, regulators may consider implementing guidelines to ensure fairness, and developers play a pivotal role in refining neural network models for enhanced analysis.

TI The First Droplet in a Cloud Chamber Track
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB In a cloud chamber, the quantum measurement problem amounts to explaining the first droplet in a charged-particle track; subsequent droplets are explained by Mott's 1929 wave-theoretic argument about collision-induced wavefunction collimation. I formulate a mechanism for how the first droplet in a cloud chamber track arises, making no reference to quantum measurement axioms. I look specifically at tracks of charged particles emitted in the simplest slow decays, because I can reason about rather than guess the form that wave packets take. The first visible droplet occurs when a randomly occurring, barely-subcritical vapor droplet is pushed past criticality by ionization triggered by the faint wavefunction of the emitted charged particle. This is possible because potential energy incurred when an ionized vapor molecule polarizes the other molecules in a droplet can balance the excitation energy needed for the emitted charged particle to create the ion in the first place. This degeneracy is a singular condition for Coulombic scattering, leading to infinite or near-infinite ionization cross sections, and from there to an emergent Born rule in position space, but not an operator projection as in the projection postulate. Analogous mechanisms may explain canonical quantum measurement behavior in detectors such as ionization chambers, proportional counters, photomultiplier tubes or bubble chambers. This work is important because attempts to understand canonical quantum measurement behavior and its limitations have become urgent in view of worldwide investment in quantum computing and in searches for super-rare processes (e.g., proton decay).

AB The complete ecosystem of electronic device manufacturers, from microelectronics, software and hardware designers to developers, producers, and integrators, is facing an immense new environmental challenge: to cope with the data deluge and to reduce the energy consumption of digital technologies. The purpose of this paper is to propose scientific and technical directions to reach global data and power sobriety while preserving computational efficiency. We present nine opportunities to lower the power consumption of computing units. A growth factor of 100 to 1000 in energy efficiency is achievable in the next 10 years if we take full advantage of all the potential improvements, working simultaneously at all five levels of the technological ecosystem (process steps, circuits, architecture, software and algorithms). We will indeed need to exploit all the possible technological advances to achieve this goal, including resistive memories, 3D stacking and new computing paradigms such as in-memory-computing, neuromorphic computing and quantum computing. Additionally, in order to maximize efficiency and performance, the research and development communities must work closer together and embrace a real culture of co-design to optimize applications and algorithms, algorithms and architectures, architectures and technologies jointly. We also propose to perform data processing operations as closely as possible to the source, in order to curtail the energy consumption that comes with data transport. Finally, we believe it is essential to accept the constraints for sustainable electronics now, and to change our mindsets quite radically by carrying out product life-cycle assessments in the very early phases of any new research.

TI Engineering local strain for single-atom nuclear acoustic resonance in
   silicon
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Mechanical strain plays a key role in the physics and operation of nanoscale semiconductor systems, including quantum dots and single-dopant devices. Here, we describe the design of a nanoelectronic device, where a single nuclear spin is coherently controlled via nuclear acoustic resonance (NAR) through the local application of dynamical strain. The strain drives spin transitions by modulating the nuclear quadrupole interaction. We adopt an AlN piezoelectric actuator compatible with standard silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor processing and optimize the device layout to maximize the NAR drive. We predict NAR Rabi frequencies of order 200 Hz for a single Sb-123 nucleus in a wide region of the device. Spin transitions driven directly by electric fields are suppressed in the center of the device, allowing the observation of pure NAR. Using electric field gradient-elastic tensors calculated by the density-functional theory, we extend our predictions to other high-spin group-V donors in silicon and to the isoelectronic Ge-73 atom.

TI CSI-Otter: isogeny-based (partially) blind signatures from the class
   group action with a twist
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB In this paper, we construct the first provably-secure isogeny-based (partially) blind signature scheme. While at a high level the scheme resembles the Schnorr blind signature, our work does not directly follow from that construction, since isogenies do not offer as rich an algebraic structure. Specifically, our protocol does not fit into the linear identification protocol abstraction introduced by Hauck, Kiltz, and Loss (EUROCYRPT'19), which was used to generically construct Schnorr-like blind signatures based on modules such as classical groups and lattices. Consequently, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model (ROM) against poly-logarithmically-many concurrent sessions assuming the subexponential hardness of the group action inverse problem. In more detail, our blind signature exploits the quadratic twist of an elliptic curve in an essential way to endow isogenies with a strictly richer structure than abstract group actions (but still more restrictive than modules). The basic scheme has public key size 128 B and signature size 8 KB under the CSIDH-512 parameter sets-these are the smallest among all provably secure post-quantum secure blind signatures. Relying on a new ring variant of the group action inverse problem (rGAIP\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textsf{rGAIP}$$\end{document}), we can halve the signature size to 4 KB while increasing the public key size to 512 B. We provide preliminary cryptanalysis of rGAIP\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\textsf{rGAIP}} $$\end{document} and show that for certain parameter settings, it is essentially as secure as the standard GAIP\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textsf{GAIP}$$\end{document}. Finally, we show a novel way to turn our blind signature into a partially blind signature, where we deviate from prior methods since they require hashing into the set of public keys while hiding the corresponding secret key-constructing such a hash function in the isogeny setting remains an open problem.

TI Efficient mass manufacturing of high-density, ultra-low-loss Si3N4
   photonic integrated circuits
SO OPTICA
AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer significant advantages over traditional silicon photonics, including low loss and superior power handling at optical communication wavelength bands. To facilitate high-density integration and effective nonlinearity, the use of thick, stoichiometric Si3N4 films is crucial. However, when using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) to achieve high optical material transparency, Si3N4 films exhibit large tensile stress on the order of GPa, leading to wafer cracking that challenges mass production. Methods for crack prevention are therefore essential. The photonic Damascene process has addressed this issue, attaining record low-loss Si3N4 PICs, but it lacks control of the waveguide height, leading to large random variations of waveguide dispersion and unpredictable spectrum responses of critical functional devices such as optical couplers. Conversely, subtractive processes achieve better dimension control but rely on techniques unsuitable for large-scale production. To date, an outstanding challenge is to attain both lithographic precision and ultra-low loss in high-confinement Si3N4 PICs that are compatible with large-scale foundry manufacturing. Here, we present a single-step deposited, DUV-based subtractive method for producing wafer-scale ultra-low-loss Si3N4 PICs that harmonize these necessities. By employing deep etching of densely distributed, interconnected trenches into the substrate, we effectively mitigate the tensile stress in the Si3N4 layer, enabling direct deposition of thick films without cracking and substantially prolonged storage duration. A secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis reveals that these deep trenches simultaneously serve as gettering centers for metal impurities, in particular copper, thereby reducing the absorption loss in Si3N4 waveguides. Lastly, we identify ultraviolet (UV)-radiation-induced damage that can be remedied through a rapid thermal annealing. Collectively, we develop ultra-low-loss Si3N4 microresonators and 0.5-m-long spiral waveguides with losses down to 1.4 dB/m at 1550 nm with high production yield. This work addresses the long-standing challenges toward scalable and cost-effective production of tightly confined, low-loss Si3N4 PICs as used for quantum photonics, large-scale linear and nonlinear photonics, photonic computing, and narrow-linewidth lasers.

TI Practical Hamiltonian learning with unitary dynamics and Gibbs states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We study the problem of learning the parameters for the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system, given limited access to the system. In this work, we build upon recent approaches to Hamiltonian learning via derivative estimation. We propose a protocol that improves the scaling dependence of prior works, particularly with respect to parameters relating to the structure of the Hamiltonian (e.g., its locality k). Furthermore, by deriving exact bounds on the performance of our protocol, we are able to provide a precise numerical prescription for theoretically optimal settings of hyperparameters in our learning protocol, such as the maximum evolution time (when learning with unitary dynamics) or minimum temperature (when learning with Gibbs states). Thanks to these improvements, our protocol has practical scaling for large problems: we demonstrate this with a numerical simulation of our protocol on an 80-qubit system.
   Efficient characterisation of quantum many-body Hamiltonians has important applications for benchmarking NISQ devices. Here, the authors propose a method employing Chebyshev regression to learn the full Hamiltonian of a quantum system, with a sample complexity that scales efficiently with the system size.

TI Shadow Tomography from Emergent State Designs in Analog Quantum
   Simulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a method that allows one to infer many properties of a quantum state-including nonlinear functions such as Renyi entropies-using only global control over the constituent degrees of freedom. In this protocol, the state of interest is first entangled with a set of ancillas under a fixed global unitary, before projective measurements are made. We show that when the unitary is sufficiently entangling, a universal relationship between the statistics of the measurement outcomes and properties of the state emerges, which can be connected to the recently discovered phenomeonon of emergent quantum state designs in chaotic systems. Thanks to this relationship, arbitrary observables can be reconstructed using the same number of experimental repetitions that would be required in classical shadow tomography [Huang et al., Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)]. Unlike previous approaches to shadow tomography, our protocol can be implemented using only global Hamiltonian evolution, as opposed to qubit-selective logic gates, which makes it particularly well suited to analog quantum simulators, including ultracold atoms in optical lattices and arrays of Rydberg atoms.

TI Large Dispersive Interaction between a CMOS Double Quantum Dot and
   Microwave Photons
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We report fast charge-state readout of a double quantum dot in a CMOS split-gate silicon nanowire transistor via the large dispersive interaction with microwave photons in a lumped-element resonator formed by hybrid integration with a superconducting inductor. We achieve a coupling rate g(0)/(2 pi) = 204 +/- 2 MHz by exploiting the large interdot gate lever arm of an asymmetric split-gate device, alpha = 0.72, and by inductively coupling to the resonator to increase its impedance, Z(r) = 560 Omega. In the dispersive regime, the large coupling strength at the double quantum-dot hybridization point produces a frequency shift comparable to the resonator linewidth, the optimal setting for maximum state visibility. We exploit this regime to demonstrate rapid dispersive readout of the charge degree of freedom, with a SNR of 3.3 in 50 ns. In the resonant regime, the fast charge decoherence rate precludes reaching the strong coupling regime, but we show a clear route to spin-photon circuit quantum electrodynamics using hybrid CMOS systems.

TI Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion for the tunnelling in
   SARS-COVID-19 virus
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB In the context of biology, unlike the well-established Standard Model in physics, many biological processes lack a complete theoretical framework and are often described phenomenologically. A pertinent example is olfaction, the process through which humans and animals distinguish various odors. The conventional biological explanation for olfaction relies on the lock and key model, which, while useful, does not fully account for all observed phenomena. As an alternative or complement to this model, vibration-assisted electron tunnelling has been proposed. Drawing inspiration from the vibration-assisted electron tunnelling model for olfaction, we have developed a theoretical model for electron tunnelling in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection within a non-Markovian framework. We approach this by solving the non-Markovian quantum stochastic Schr & ouml;dinger equation. In our model, the spike protein and the GPCR receptor are conceptualized as a dimer, utilizing the spin-Boson model to facilitate the description of electron tunnelling. Our analysis shows that electron tunnelling persists even at intermediate and strong coupling limits between the dimer components, presenting a stark contrast to the predictions from Markovian regime models. Notably, Markovian models often yield unphysical negative probabilities, particularly in the strong coupling limit, underscoring significant discrepancies and highlighting the importance of considering non-Markovian dynamics in accurately modeling such quantum processes. This approach enhances our understanding of viral infection mechanisms while also offering deeper insights into the quantum biological process of olfaction.

TI Intermodal microwave-to-optical transduction using silicon-on-sapphire
   optomechanical ring resonator
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optomechanical and electro-optomechanical systems have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for quantum microwave-to-optical transduction to interconnect distributed quantum modalities for scaling the quantum systems. These systems use suspended structures to increase mode overlap and mitigate loss to achieve high efficiency. However, the suspended design's poor heat dissipation under strong drive limits the ultimate efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an unsuspended optomechanical ring resonator (OMR) based on the silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) platform for microwave-to-optical frequency conversion. The OMR achieves a triply resonant optical-to-optical conversion with an enhanced coupling rate Gb = 3.6 gigahertz per square-root milliwatt at a peak conversion efficiency of 1.2% with 3.6-milliwatt microwave drive power and a microwave-to-optical conversion efficiency of 1.5 x 10-5 at 10-milliwatt optical drive power. Our results show that the unsuspended SOS platform, which mitigates the thermal effect and is compatible with superconducting qubits, is a promising platform for optomechanical circuitry and quantum transduction.

TI Efficiently catching entangled microwave photons from a quantum
   transducer with shaped optical pumps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A quantum transducer, when working as a microwave and optical entanglement generator, provides a practical way to coherently connect optical communication channels and microwave quantum processors. Recent experiments on a quantum transducer verifying entanglement between the microwave and optical photons show the promise of approaching that goal. While flying optical photons can be efficiently controlled or detected, the microwave photon needs to be stored in a cavity or converted to the excitation of a superconducting qubit for further quantum operations. However, it remains challenging to efficiently capture or detect a single microwave photon with an arbitrary time profile. This work focuses on this challenge in the setting of an entanglement-based quantum transducer and proposes a solution by shaping the optical pump pulse. By Schmidt decomposing the output entangled state, we show that the microwave-optical photon pair takes a specific temporal profile that is controlled by the optical pump. The microwave photon from the transducer can be nearly perfectly absorbed by a receiving cavity with tunable coupling and is ready to be converted to the excitation of superconducting qubits, enabling further quantum operations.

TI Pauli spin blockade in a resonant triple quantum dot molecule
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A Pauli spin blockade in quantum dot systems occurs when the charge transport is allowed only for some spin states, and it has been an efficient tool in spin-based qubit devices in semiconductors. We theoretically investigate a Pauli spin blockade in a triple quantum dot molecule consisting of three identical quantum dots in a semiconductor in the presence of an external magnetic field through the molecule. When the three-electron state is on resonance with two-or four-electron states, the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation and the Zeeman splitting lead to a periodic spin blockade effect. We focus on the spin blockade at a two-and three-electron resonance and show that we can tune the magnetic field to selectively allow only either a spin-singlet or spin-triplet state to add an additional electron from tunnel-coupled leads. This spin blockade maintains the three quantum dots at the optimal sweet spot against the charge noise, demonstrating its potential as an efficient readout scheme for the qubits in quantum dot systems.

TI Incompatibility in General Probabilistic Theories, Generalized
   Spectrahedra, and Tensor Norms
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we investigate measurement incompatibility in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). We show several equivalent characterizations of compatible measurements. The first is in terms of the positivity of associated maps. The second relates compatibility to the inclusion of certain generalized spectrahedra. For this, we extend the theory of free spectrahedra to ordered vector spaces. The third characterization connects the compatibility of dichotomic measurements to the ratio of tensor crossnorms of Banach spaces. We use these characterizations to study the amount of incompatibility present in different GPTs, i.e. their compatibility regions. For centrally symmetric GPTs, we show that the compatibility degree is given as the ratio of the injective and the projective norm of the tensor product of associated Banach spaces. This allows us to completely characterize the compatibility regions of several GPTs, and to obtain optimal universal bounds on the compatibility degree in terms of the 1-summing constants of the associated Banach spaces. Moreover, we find new bounds on the maximal incompatibility present in more than three qubit measurements.

TI Gate-Tunable Hole Transport in In-Plane Ge Nanowires by V-Groove
   Confined Selective Epitaxy
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Germanium (Ge) nanowires hold great promise as building blocks for hole spin-based quantum processors. Realizing this potential requires their direct integration onto silicon (Si) wafers. This work introduces V-groove-confined selective epitaxy to enable the in-plane growth of nanowires on Si substrates. Nanowires form fully confined within V-shaped grooves, a process driven by surface energy minimization and in agreement with Winterbottom-like construction calculations. This confinement eliminates the direct Ge-SiO2 interface, reducing spurring charge noise and enhancing nanowire functionality. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals the cross-sectional shape and single-crystalline nature of the nanowires. Low-temperature magnetotransport measurements on Ge nanowire Hall bars demonstrate gate-tunable hole densities and a peak mobility of approximately 600 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1) at a density of 1.2 x 10(13) cm(-2). These findings establish V-groove-confined epitaxy as a scalable pathway for the integration of high-performance Ge nanowire-based quantum devices.

TI A concept of controlling Grover diffusion operator: a new approach to
   solve arbitrary Boolean-based problems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A controlled-diffusion operator for Boolean oracles is designed as a new approach for Grover's algorithm to search for solutions for arbitrary logical structures of such oracles, since the Grover diffusion operator is not able to find correct solutions for some logical structures of Boolean oracles. We also show that the Phase oracles do not work sometimes correctly using the Grover diffusion operator. Our proposed controlled-diffusion operator relies on the states of output qubit, as the reflection of Boolean decisions from a Boolean oracle without relying on the phase kickback. We prove that on many examples of Boolean and Phase oracles the Grover diffusion operator is not working correctly. The oracles in these examples are constructed using different structures of POS, SOP, ESOP, CSP-SAT, and XOR-SAT. Our mathematical models and experiments prove that the proposed controlled-diffusion operator successfully searches for all solutions for all Boolean oracles regardless of their different logical structures.

TI Quantum Synchronization and Entanglement of Dissipative Qubits Coupled
   to a Resonator
SO ENTROPY
AB In a dissipative regime, we study the properties of several qubits coupled to a driven resonator in the framework of a Jaynes-Cummings model. The time evolution and the steady state of the system are numerically analyzed within the Lindblad master equation, with up to several million components. Two semi-analytical approaches, at weak and strong (semiclassical) dissipations, are developed to describe the steady state of this system and determine its validity by comparing it with the Lindblad equation results. We show that the synchronization of several qubits with the driving phase can be obtained due to their coupling to the resonator. We establish the existence of two different qubit synchronization regimes: In the first one, the semiclassical approach describes well the dynamics of qubits and, thus, their quantum features and entanglement are suppressed by dissipation and the synchronization is essentially classical. In the second one, the entangled steady state of a pair of qubits remains synchronized in the presence of dissipation and decoherence, corresponding to the regime non-existent in classical synchronization.

TI Transition from order to chaos in reduced quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study a damped kicked top dynamics of a large number of qubits (N oc,) and focus on an evolution of a reduced single-qubit subsystem. Each subsystem is subjected to the amplitude damping channel controlled by the damping constant r e [0, 1], which plays the role of the single control parameter. In the parameter range for which the classical dynamics is chaotic, while varying r we find the universal period-doubling behavior characteristic to one-dimensional maps: period-2 dynamics starts at r1 ti 0.3181, while the next bifurcation occurs at r2 ti 0.5387. In parallel with period-4 oscillations observed for r r3 ti 0.5672, we identify a secondary bifurcation diagram around r ti 0.544, responsible for a small-scale chaotic dynamics inside the attractor. The doubling of the principal bifurcation tree continues until r roc, similar to 0.578, which marks the onset of the full scale chaos interrupted by the windows of the oscillatory dynamics corresponding to the Sharkovsky order. Finally, for r = 1 the model reduces to the standard undamped chaotic kicked top.

TI Polarized Single Photon Generation from a Quantum Dot
SO APPLIED SCIENCE AND CONVERGENCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The linearly polarized single photon is a key component for single-photon applications, such as quantum simulators and quantum key distribution. Here, we propose a novel approach for generating linearly polarized single photons using a simple elliptic mesa containing an InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD). We found that 91% of the QD emission can be linearly polarized along the major axis for an elliptic mesa with a minor axis diameter of 300 nm. The degree of linear polarization of the QD emission was studied with the polarization mode distribution in the QD layer of the elliptic mesa by finite-difference time-domain simulations. The mode polarized along the major axis was dominant over the mesa plane, especially in the center for the 300 nm mesa, enabling high linear polarization of single photons emitted from the mesa. The proposed method for generating linearly polarized single photons using a simple elliptic mesa, which features a broad operation band and can be easily fabricated, will be potentially useful in numerous single-photon applications.

AB A lemma stated by Li (Ann Statist 42:171-189, 2014) has been used in, for example, Nilanjana et al. (J Math Phys 57:062207, 2016), Kaur et al. (Phys Rev A 96:062318, 2017), Rouze, Datta (IEEE Trans Inform Theory 64:593-612, 2018), Tomamichel, Tan (Comm Math Phys 338:103-137, 2015) and Wilde et al. (IEEE Trans Inform Theory 63:1792-1817, 2017) for various tasks in quantum hypothesis testing, data compression with quantum side information or quantum key distribution. This lemma was originally proven in finite dimension, with a direct extension to type I von Neumann algebras. Here, we show that the use of modular theory allows to give more transparent meaning to the objects constructed by the lemma, and to prove it for general von Neumann algebras. This yields a new proof of quantum Stein's lemma with slightly weaker assumption, as well as immediate generalizations of its second-order asymptotics, for example the main results in Nilanjana et al. (J Math Phys 57:062207, 2016) and Li (Ann Statist 42:171-189, 2014).

TI Ge-on-Si single-photon avalanche diode detectors for short-wave infrared
   wavelengths
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Germanium-on-silicon (Ge-on-Si) based single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have recently emerged as a promising detector candidate for ultra-sensitive and picosecond resolution timing measurement of short-wave infrared (SWIR) photons. Many applications benefit from operating in the SWIR spectral range, such as long distance light detection and ranging, however, there are few single-photon detectors exhibiting the high-performance levels obtained by all-silicon SPADs commonly used for single-photon detection at wavelengths mu m. This paper first details the advantages of operating at SWIR wavelengths, the current technologies, and associated issues, and describes the potential of Ge-on-Si SPADs as a single-photon detector technology for this wavelength region. The working principles, fabrication and characterisation processes of such devices are subsequently detailed. We review the research in these single-photon detectors and detail the state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities offered by Ge-on-Si SPAD detectors are discussed.

TI Navigation Ranging Scheme Based on Quantum Illumination
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective As the basic technology for positioning and navigation of unknown targets, ranging technology is closely related to people's life, national defense construction, aerospace exploration, and other aspects. The traditional positioning system can realize navigation ranging by continuously transmitting electromagnetic pulses into space, and the pulses will be reflected to the receiver as the presence of targets. As a result, we can detect the echo pulse and estimate its time delay through the propagation time. Wider bandwidth and greater transmission power of a transmitted electromagnetic pulse signal indicate higher precision of time accuracy. However, due to the restriction of the energy and bandwidth of the electromagnetic pulse, the accuracy of navigation ranging has certain limits. To go beyond the limits of energy, bandwidth, and accuracy in classical measurement, quantum ranging makes use of the entangled state, squeezed state, as well as other characteristics to make the transmitted quantum information have a strong correlation and high density. It can obtain much higher ranging accuracy (Heisenberg limit) than that of classical radio ranging systems, and thus it can be further applied to systems such as navigation, positioning, and gravitational wave measurement. In view of the problem that many previous ranging schemes are highly sensitive to photon loss and that it is difficult to achieve longdistance transmission through quantum interferometry, we use the squeezed state to improve the peak estimation of the time delay and propose a non-classical navigation ranging scheme based on quantum illumination, which makes a statistical judgment on the echo signal of a target to determine the distance parameter. We hope that our study can be helpful for the application of quantum information and the design of future navigation and positioning systems.
   Methods The quantum ranging scheme enhanced by Gaussian entanglement can be used for high-precision navigation ranging, whose form is similar to that of the classical radio ranging method. With the ranging scheme based on quantum illumination, a pair of entangled photons is generated through parametric down- conversion, and one photon is emitted as the detection signal, while the other photon is left in the local area as the idle signal. If there is a target, the photon scattered by the target can be entangled with the local photon for entanglement measurement, and additional performance gain can be obtained. In our work, first, the basic principles of radar ranging and quantum illumination are introduced, and the discrimination theory of Gaussian states is deduced. Then, upon the analysis of the statistical properties of three Gaussian states, namely, the coherent state, thermal state, and squeezed state, the new ranging method that uses the quantum squeezing effect to improve the estimation accuracy of the time delay is described, and the proposed quantum illumination scheme is further used to improve the entanglement ranging performance. Finally, given the navigation ranging scheme based on quantum illumination, the performance of the coherent state is compared with that of the twomode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state in the application of entanglement ranging. In addition, the Chernoff bound of quantum signal detection is used for quantitative analysis.
   Results and Discussions The results show that the detection error probability of the TMSV state is about 6 dB lower than that of the coherent state in the exponential part after the idle signal is stored, which effectively improves the performance of the navigation ranging system. The Chernoff bound of the detection error probability decreases as the number of signal photons grows and increases as the number of noise photons rises ( Fig. 7). At the same time, the entanglement gain performance of the TMSV state is significantly better than that of the coherent state. According to the analysis of quantum hypothesis theory, the detection performance of navigation ranging based on quantum illumination can be improved by about four times (6 dB) in the exponential part compared with that of the traditional scheme when the number of signal photons is small, or the number of noise photons is large. This gain is significant under the circumstance of low-brightness illumination sources or strong noise environments (Fig. 8). The entangled navigation ranging scheme significantly enhances the signal detection performance, improves the range resolution, and can more sensitively determine the range element with lower error probability, thus realizing high-precision navigation ranging. Compared with the situation of the classical navigation ranging scheme, when the detection probability of the echo pulse signal is the same, the receiver in the squeezed- state quantum illumination ranging scheme will have a lower detection threshold, which will expand the maximum range of the navigation ranging system according to the radar range equation. If the detection threshold D-0 is reduced to 1/ 16 of the original value, doubling the navigation range is promising.
   Conclusions In this work, a new navigation ranging method based on quantum illumination is proposed. For quantum navigation ranging, we can use the squeezed state and entangled state of the quantum to improve the performance of time delay estimation. Comprehensively utilizing the quantum squeezing and entanglement properties, we focus on the comparison of the entanglement ranging performance between TMSV state and coherent state and the analysis of the quantum Chernoff bound for error probability. When the idle signal is stored at the receiver for entanglement measurement, the detection error probability of the TMSV state decreases by about 6 dB in the exponential part compared with that of the coherent state, which effectively improves the detection performance of the navigation ranging system. The quantum illumination scheme has a higher detection probability when the measurement range is fixed, and meanwhile, the scheme has a larger measurement range when the detection probability is the same as that of the classical ranging scheme. Therefore, the scheme is suitable for low-brightness illumination sources and has stronger anti-interference performance for ranging signal detection in complex environments. At present, the optimal quantum receiver design still requires further research, but many theoretical models and experiments of suboptimal receivers have made significant progress. Preliminary theoretical analysis and recent experiments show that the proposed navigation ranging scheme is feasible and can be further applied to quantum navigation and positioning systems in the future.

TI Sensitive single-photon test of extended quantum theory with
   two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum theory is the foundation of modern physics. Some of its basic principles, such as Born's rule, however, are based on postulates which require experimental testing. Any deviation from Born's rule would result in higher-order interference and can thus be tested in an experiment. Here, we report on such a test with a quantum light source based on a color center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) coupled to a microcavity. Our room-temperature photon source features a narrow-linewidth, high-efficiency, high-purity, and on-demand single-photon generation. With the single-photon source we can increase the interferometric sensitivity of our three-path interferometer compared to conventional laser-based light sources by fully suppressing the detector nonlinearity. We thereby obtain a tight bound on the third-order interference term of 3.96(523) x 10(-4). We also measure an interference visibility of 98.58% for our single photons emitted from hBN at room temperature, which provides a promising route for using the hBN platform as light source for phase-encoding schemes in quantum key distribution.

TI Fast polynomial inversion for post quantum QC-MDPC cryptography
SO INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION
AB New post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) designs, evaluated as part of the NIST PQC standardization Project, pose challenging tradeoffs between communication bandwidth and computational overheads. Several KEM designs evaluated in Round-2 of the project are based on QC-MDPC codes. BIKE-2 uses the smallest communication bandwidth, but its key generation requires a costly polynomial inversion. In this paper, we provide details on the optimized polynomial inversion algorithm for QC-MDPC codes (originally proposed in the conference version of this work). This algorithm makes the runtime of BIKE-2 key generation tolerable. It brings a speedup of 11.4x over the commonly used NTL library, and 83.5x over OpenSSL. We achieve additional speedups by leveraging the latest Intel's Vector-PCLMULQDQ instructions, 14.3x over NTL and 103.9x over OpenSSL. Our algorithm and implementation were the reason that BIKE team chose BIKE-2 as the only scheme for its Round-3 specification (now called BIKE). (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Telecom-Band Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in
   AlGaAs-on-Insulator Waveguides
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Widespread commercial adoption of telecom-band quantum key distribution (QKD) will require fully integrated, room-temperature transmitters. Implementing highly efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) on a platform that offers co-integration of the pump laser has been an outstanding challenge. Here, using such a platform based on AlGaAs-on-insulator waveguides, telecom-band SPDC (and SHG, second harmonic generation) is reported with exceedingly large efficiencies of 26 GHz generated pairs per mW over a 7 THz bandwidth, which would saturate the usable photon-flux for a 70-channel wavelength-multiplexed QKD system at merely 1.7 mW of pump laser power.
   The authors present a highly efficient, room temperature operated, and mass-producible integrated photonics solution that utilizes the largest available second- and third-order parametric nonlinear responses of all solid-state materials to generate broadband quantum light. Its experimentally demonstrated performance figures enable highly multiplexed quantum-secure telecommunications at unprecedented single emitter key-rates while the pump laser demand stays limited to a mere 1 mW of injected power. image

TI Computing Free Energies with Fluctuation Relations on Quantum Computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As a central thermodynamic property, free energy enables the calculation of virtually any equilibrium property of a physical system, allowing for the construction of phase diagrams and predictions about transport, chemical reactions, and biological processes. Thus, methods for efficiently computing free energies, which in general is a difficult problem, are of great interest to broad areas of physics and the natural sciences. The majority of techniques for computing free energies target classical systems, leaving the computation of free energies in quantum systems less explored. Recently developed fluctuation relations enable the computation of free energy differences in quantum systems from an ensemble of dynamic simulations. While performing such simulations is exponentially hard on classical computers, quantum computers can efficiently simulate the dynamics of quantum systems. Here, we present an algorithm utilizing a fluctuation relation known as the Jarzynski equality to approximate free energy differences of quantum systems on a quantum computer. We discuss under which conditions our approximation becomes exact, and under which conditions it serves as a strict upper bound. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a proof of concept of our algorithm using the transverse field Ising model on a real quantum processor. As quantum hardware continues to improve, we anticipate that our algorithm will enable computation of free energy differences for a wide range of quantum systems useful across the natural sciences.

TI Combined Optical Fiber Transmission System Based on QNSC and BER-LM
SO PHOTONICS
AB A quantum noise stream cipher (QNSC) is a physical layer encryption technology based on quantum noise. Bit error rate loopback measurement (BER-LM) is a method to measure the BER of a loopback channel and extract channel characteristics. Then, channel characteristics can be extracted, and consensus keys can be obtained through negotiation. In previous studies, encryption and key distribution were implemented in independent channels. In this paper, we propose a scheme that combines these two technologies in a single fiber channel to achieve encrypted transmission and key distribution. We verified a 20 Gbps QPSK coherent optical transmission system with a PSK/QNSC scheme. The results show that by reasonably setting the negotiation bit position, the consensus key could be obtained through negotiation, and the requirements of transmission performance could be met. When the negotiation bit position was set to seven, the Q-factor of the system was nine, which met the error-free condition of the 7% forward error correction (FEC) limit.

AB Spectre attacks void the guarantees of constant-time cryptographic code by leaking secrets during speculative execution. Recent research shows that such code can be protected from Spectre-v1 attacks with minimal overhead, but leaves open the question of protecting against other Spectre variants.
   In this work, we design, validate, implement, and verify a new approach to protect cryptographic code against all known classes of Spectre attacks, in particular Spectre-RSB. Our approach combines a new value-dependent information-flow type system that ensures that no secrets leak even under speculative execution and a compiler transformation that enables it on the generated low-level code.
   We first prove the soundness of the type system and the correctness of the compiler transformation using the Coq proof assistant. We then implement our approach in the Jasmin framework for high-assurance cryptography and demonstrate that the overhead incurred by all Spectre protections is below 2% for most cryptographic primitives and reaches only about 5-7% for the more complex post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism Kyber.

TI Integrated balanced homodyne photonic-electronic detector for beyond 20
   GHz shot-noise-limited measurements
SO OPTICA
AB Optical homodyne detection is used in numerous quantum and classical applications that demand high levels of sensitivity. However, performance is typically limited due to the use of bulk optics and discrete receiver electronics. To address these performance issues, in this work we present a co-integrated balanced homodyne detector consisting of a silicon photonics optical front end and a custom integrated transimpedance amplifier designed in a 100 nm GaAs pHEMT technology. The high level of co-design and integration provides enhanced levels of stability, bandwidth, and noise performance. The presented detector shows a linear operation up to 28 dB quantum shot noise clearance and a high degree of common-mode rejection, at the same time achieving a shot-noise-limited bandwidth of more than 20 GHz. The high performance of the developed devices provide enhanced operation to many sensitive quantum applications such as continuous variable quantum key distribution, quantum random number generation, or high-speed quantum tomography.

TI Spin-Mechanics with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers and Trapped Particles
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Controlling the motion of macroscopic oscillators in the quantum regime has been the subject of intense research in recent decades. In this direction, opto-mechanical systems, where the motion of micro-objects is strongly coupled with laser light radiation pressure, have had tremendous success. In particular, the motion of levitating objects can be manipulated at the quantum level thanks to their very high isolation from the environment under ultra-low vacuum conditions. To enter the quantum regime, schemes using single long-lived atomic spins, such as the electronic spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, coupled with levitating mechanical oscillators have been proposed. At the single spin level, they offer the formidable prospect of transferring the spins' inherent quantum nature to the oscillators, with foreseeable far-reaching implications in quantum sensing and tests of quantum mechanics. Adding the spin degrees of freedom to the experimentalists' toolbox would enable access to a very rich playground at the crossroads between condensed matter and atomic physics. We review recent experimental work in the field of spin-mechanics that employ the interaction between trapped particles and electronic spins in the solid state and discuss the challenges ahead. Our focus is on the theoretical background close to the current experiments, as well as on the experimental limits, that, once overcome, will enable these systems to unleash their full potential.

TI Direct phase modulation via optical injection: theoretical study
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Direct phase modulation via optical injection is a newly developed method for coding the phase of a gain-switched laser, which meets high requirements placed on transmitters for quantum key distribution: compactness, low losses, compatibility with CMOS technologies, and the absence of undesirable effects leading to the side-channel information leakage. Despite the successful implementation and good prospects for the further development of this system, there is still a lack of theoretical investigations of this scheme in the literature. Here, for the first time, we perform its theoretical analysis. We study the influence of the spontaneous emission noise, examine the role of the gain non-linearity, and consider the temperature drift effect. The results obtained reveal that these phenomena significantly affect system performance. We have tried to formulate here practical instructions, which will help to take these features into account when elaborating and employing the optical-injection-based phase modulator.

TI A tunable transition metal dichalcogenide entangled photon-pair source
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entangled photon-pair sources are at the core of quantum applications like quantum key distribution, sensing, and imaging. Operation in space-limited and adverse environments such as in satellite-based and mobile communication requires robust entanglement sources with minimal size and weight requirements. Here, we meet this challenge by realizing a cubic micrometer scale entangled photon-pair source in a 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystal. Its crystal symmetry enables the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without additional components and provides tunability by simple control of the pump polarization. Remarkably, generation rate and state tuning are decoupled, leading to equal generation efficiency and no loss of entanglement. Combining transition metal dichalcogenides with monolithic cavities and integrated photonic circuitry or using quasi-phasematching opens the gate towards ultrasmall and scalable quantum devices.
   Spontaneous parametric down-conversion in thin films should allow to realise extremely compact entangled photon sources. Here, the authors generate entangled photon pairs from a 3R-MoS2 flake, characterize them via quantum state tomography, and show how to tune between different Bell state outputs by changing the pump polarization.

TI High energy particle detection with large area superconducting microwire
   array
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB We present the first detailed study of an 8-channel 2 x 2 mm2 WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV proton beam and 8 GeV electron and pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The SMSPD detection efficiency was measured for the first time for protons, electrons, and pions, enabled by the use of a silicon tracking telescope that provided precise spatial resolution of 30 mu m for 120 GeV protons and 130 mu m for 8 GeV electrons and pions. The result demonstrated consistent detection efficiency across pixels and at different bias currents. Time resolution of 1.15 ns was measured for the first time for SMSPD with proton, electron, and pions, enabled by the use of an MCP-PMT which provided a ps-level reference time stamp. The results presented is the first step towards developing SMSPD array systems optimized for high energy particle detection and identification for future accelerator-based experiments.

TI Interference effects in commercially available free-space silicon
   single-photon avalanche diodes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are essential for photon-based measurements and metrology, enabling measurement comparisons at the few-photon level and facilitating global traceability to the SI. A spatially uniform detector response is crucial for these applications. Here, we report on interference effects in commercially available silicon SPADs that are detrimental to their spatial uniformity. Contrasts as high as 18% are observed, posing problems for metrology and general applications that utilize coherent light and require stable detection efficiencies. We eliminate the device optical window as a contributing interface, isolating likely causes to anti-reflective coatings, the semiconductor surface, and the SPAD's internal structure. We also present results where we leverage this sub-optimal behavior by aligning an incident beam with the position of maximum constructive interference, yielding an effective detection efficiency of 51.1(1.7)% compared to the normal value of 44.3(1)% obtained with the interference suppressed. We anticipate that this work will significantly impact the continuing development of these devices, the methods for characterizing them, and their use in accurate measurements.

TI Analytic approach to the Landau-Zener problem in bounded parameter space
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Three analytic solutions to the Schrodinger equation for the time-dependent Landau-Zener (LZ) Hamiltonian are presented. They correspond to specific finite-time driving paths in a bounded parameter space of a two-level system. Two of these paths go through the avoided crossing of levels, either with a constant speed or with variable speed that decreases in the region of reduced energy gap, the third path bypasses the crossing such that the energy gap remains constant. The solutions yield exact time dependencies of the excitation probability for the system evolving from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. The LZ formula emerges as an approximation valid within a certain interval of driving times for the constant-speed driving through the avoided crossing. For long driving times, all solutions converge to the prediction of the adiabatic perturbation theory. The excitation probability vanishes at some discrete time instants.

TI Near-unit efficiency of chiral state conversion via hybrid-Liouvillian
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Following the evolution under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (nHH) involves significant probability loss. This makes various nHH effects impractical in the quantum realm. In contrast, Lindbladian evolution conserves probability, facilitating observation and application of exotic effects characteristic of open quantum systems. Here we are concerned with the effect of chiral state conversion: encircling an exceptional point, multiple system states are converted into a single system eigenmode. While for nHH the possible converted-into eigenmodes are pure states, for Lindbladians these are typically mixed states. We consider hybrid-Liouvillian evolution, which interpolates between a Lindbladian and a nHH and enables combining the best of the two worlds. We design adiabatic evolution protocols that give rise to chiral state conversion with pure final states, no probability loss, and high fidelity. Furthermore, extending beyond continuous adiabatic evolution, we design a protocol that facilitates conversion to pure states with fidelity 1 and, at the same time, no probability loss. Employing recently developed experimental techniques, our proposal can be implemented with superconducting qubit platforms.

TI Effect of electron-beam irradiation on the luminescent properties of
   nitrogen-related defects in the needle shaped diamond
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-containing structural defects in diamond that exhibit luminescent properties are highly attractive for quantum sensing and information processing. Controlling the formation and modification of these defects, especially ensuring their localization, is an important challenge. In this study, we investigate the local effects of electron-beam irradiation on the luminescent characteristics of single-crystal diamond in the form of needle-like crystallites. These diamond needles were grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as part of polycrystalline films and were subsequently extracted by gasifying the more defective parts of the films during thermal oxidation. The needles, with lengths exceeding 100 mu m and thicknesses up to 10 mu m, were irradiated with a focused electron beam at accelerating voltages ranging from 5 to 30 kV. Cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping revealed a pronounced local decrease in the intensity of the 389 nm CL band, accompanied by increases in the intensities of the 575 nm and 634 nm PL bands in the irradiated regions. This effect is attributed to the transformation of nitrogen-related defects present in the as-grown diamond needles into specific forms-namely, NV0 and NV-centers. The obtained results demonstrate a method for localized control of nitrogen-vacancy centers and may also be significant for interpreting experimental data in studies related to nitrogen defects and luminescent centers in diamond.

TI Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional
   superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. We demonstrate an improved technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance-up to one part per million-and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multilayered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe2 at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered two-dimensional materials and heterostructures.

TI A quantum dot in germanium proximitized by a superconductor
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB As one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, planar germanium hosting proximitized quantum dots is a compelling platform to achieve and combine topological superconductivity with existing and new qubit modalities. We demonstrate a quantum dot in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtSiGe) superconducting lead, forming a superconducting lead-quantum dot-superconducting lead junction. We show tunability of the coupling strength between the quantum dot and the superconducting lead, and gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap, and we tune the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize critical magnetic field strengths, finding a critical out-of-plane field of 0.90 +/- 0.04 T. Finally, we explore sub-gap spin splitting, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. Our findings open up the physics of alternative spin and superconducting qubits, and the physics of Josephson junction arrays, in germanium.

TI Strong hole-photon coupling in planar Ge for probing charge degree and
   strongly correlated states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures have emerged as front-runners for future hole-based quantum processors. Here, we present strong coupling between a hole charge qubit, defined in a double quantum dot (DQD) in planar Ge, and microwave photons in a high-impedance (Z(r) = 1.3 k Omega) resonator based on an array of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Our investigation reveals vacuum-Rabi splittings with coupling strengths up to g(0)/2 pi = 260 MHz, and a cooperativity of C similar to 100, dependent on DQD tuning. Furthermore, utilizing the frequency tunability of our resonator, we explore the quenched energy splitting associated with strong Coulomb correlation effects in Ge QDs. The observed enhanced coherence of the strongly correlated excited state signals the presence of distinct symmetries within related spin functions, serving as a precursor to the strong coupling between photons and spin-charge hybrid qubits in planar Ge. This work paves the way towards coherent quantum connections between remote hole qubits in planar Ge, required to scale up hole-based quantum processors.

TI Illuminating Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials: The Power of Optical
   Spectroscopy
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB 2D materials, characterized by atomically thin structures and extraordinary electronic properties, offer fertile ground for exploring quantum phenomena governed by reduced dimensionality, quantum confinement, and strong many-body interactions. Understanding these quantum effects-such as quantum tunneling, plasmonic excitations, and exciton dynamics is crucial for enabling future quantum technologies. Optical spectroscopy, due to its non-invasive nature, ultrahigh spatial, and temporal resolution, and exceptional sensitivity to electronic, vibrational, and structural states, has emerged as an indispensable approach for investigating these phenomena. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, a systematic experimental review explicitly connecting quantum properties in 2D materials to advanced optical spectroscopic techniques remains lacking. This review addresses this gap by describing the experimental manifestations of quantum properties and their characterization using cutting-edge optical tools, including near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), pump-probe spectroscopy, advanced Raman-based methods (such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and time-resolved Raman (TRR)), and optical frequency comb spectroscopy. Emphasis is placed on the distinct capabilities of each technique for elucidating ultrafast carrier dynamics, phonon coherence, interlayer tunneling, and exciton relaxation processes. By linking individual quantum phenomenon to appropriate spectroscopic approaches, this review shines a light on optical spectroscopy in advancing both fundamental understanding and technological development of next-generation quantum materials.

TI Recent Developments in Quantum-Circuit Refrigeration
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The recent progress in direct active cooling of the quantum-electric degrees of freedom in engineered circuits, or quantum-circuit refrigeration is reviewed. In 2017, the discovery of a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) based on photon-assisted tunneling of quasiparticles through normal-metal-insulator-superconductor junctions inspired a series of experimental studies demonstrating the following main properties: i) the direct-current (dc) bias voltage of the junction can change the QCR-induced damping rate of a superconducting microwave resonator by orders of magnitude and give rise to nontrivial Lamb shifts, ii) the damping rate can be controlled in nanosecond time scales, and ii) the dc bias can be replaced by a microwave excitation, the amplitude of which controls the induced damping rate. Theoretically, it is predicted that state-of-the-art superconducting resonators and qubits can be reset with an infidelity lower than 10(-4) in tens of nanoseconds using experimentally feasible parameters. A QCR-equipped resonator has also been demonstrated as an incoherent photon source with an output temperature above 1 K yet operating at millikelvin. This source has been used to calibrate cryogenic amplification chains. In the future, the QCR may be experimentally used to quickly reset superconducting qubits, and hence assist in the great challenge of building a practical quantum computer.

   2021)

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB With progress toward a practical quantum computer has come an increasingly rapid search for quantum-safe, secure communication schemes that do not rely on discrete logarithm or factorization problems. One such encryption scheme, Multi-path Switching with Secret Sharing (MSSS), combines secret sharing with multi-path switching to achieve security as long as the adversary does not have global observability of all paths and thus cannot capture enough shares to reconstruct messages. MSSS assumes that sending a share on a path is an atomic operation and all paths have the same delay.
   We identify a side-channel vulnerability for MSSS, created by the fact that in real networks, sending a share is not an atomic operation as paths have multiple hops and different delays. This channel, referred to as Network Data Remanence (NDR), is present in all schemes like MSSS whose security relies on transfer atomicity and all paths having the same delay. We demonstrate the presence of NDR in a physical testbed. We then identify two new attacks that aim to exploit the side-channel, referred to as NDR Blind and NDR Planned, propose an analytical model to analyze the attacks, and demonstrate them using an implementation of MSSS based on the ONOS SDN controller. Finally, we present a countermeasure for the attacks and show its effectiveness in simulations and Mininet experiments.

TI Non-Hermitian critical dynamics and its application to quantum many-body
   systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, two independent research fields, i.e. non-Hermitian and strongly correlated systems have been merged, forming an important research field in physics. The progress of relevant theories and experiments has reshaped our understanding of matter. In this field, the research object is not limited to the influence of non-Hermiticity on the energy spectrum and the eigenstate properties of many-body systems. Researchers have paid more attention to the manipulation of quantum states. It is universally received that the exceptional point is the most significant featurethat distinguishes non-Hermitian quantum mechanics from Hermitian quantum mechanics. In addition to the recent advances in non-Hermitian topological band theory and quantum sensing around the exceptional points, this paper concentrates on the non-Hermitian critical dynamical phenomenon and its application to the quantum many-body system. When the system has an exceptional point, an arbitrary initial state belonging to the coalescent subspace will be projected on the coalescent state. Based on the directionality of the evolved quantum state, this paper reviews our several representative researches in recent years, including local-field-induced dynamical magnetization, quantum phase transition in transverse field, Ising model at non-zero temperature, quantum mold casting in the center-environment system, as well as superconducting state preparation in the non-Hermitian strongly correlated system. We also focus on the new preparation methods and detection schemes of non-equilibrium quantum states related to exception points.

TI Creation of nitrogen-vacancy centers in chemical vapor deposition
   diamond for sensing applications
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising quantum system for magnetometry applications exhibiting optical readout of minute energy shifts in its spin sub-levels. Key material requirements for NV ensembles are a high NV- concentration, a long spin coherence time and a stable charge state. However, these are interdependent and can be difficult to optimize during diamond growth and subsequent NV creation. In this work, we systematically investigate the NV center formation and properties in bulk chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond. The nitrogen flow during growth is varied by over four orders of magnitude, resulting in a broad range of single substitutional nitrogen concentrations of 0.2-20 parts per million. For a fixed nitrogen concentration, we optimize electron-irradiation fluences with two different accelerated electron energies, and we study defect formation via optical characterizations. We discuss a general approach to determine the optimal irradiation conditions, for which an enhanced NV concentration and an optimum of NV charge states can both be satisfied. We achieve spin-spin coherence times T (2) ranging from 45.5 to 549 mu s for CVD diamonds containing 168 to 1 parts per billion NV- centers, respectively. This study shows a pathway to engineer properties of NV-doped CVD diamonds for improved sensitivity.

TI Crystal Structure, Magnetic Phase Transitions and Magnetocaloric Effect
   of DyCo2-xGex Compounds
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The crystal structure, magnetic phase transitions and magnetocaloric effect of DyCo2-xGex (x = 0.0-0.2) compounds were studied. X-ray diffraction coupled with Rietveld analysis shows that all DyCo2-xGex samples maintain the cubic Laves structure (MgCu2-type, Fd-3 m space group), and the lattice parameter increases as x increases. Under an applied field change of 0-5 T, the maximum magnetic entropy change of DyCo2-xGex (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.15 and 0.2) compounds are 10.4, 10.3, 7.3 and 6.3 J/kg K, and the values of relative cooling power are 290.6, 309.6, 290.4 and 271.8 J/kg, respectively. According to Arrott plots and the Inoue-Shimizu model, DyCo2 and DyCo1.95Ge0.05 compounds still maintain the first-order magnetic phase transition. But when the Ge content exceeds 0.05, a magnetic phase transition from first-order to second-order occurs. Magnetic measurement reveals that the Ge content increases the Curie temperature from 151 (for x = 0.0) to 179 K (for x = 0.2). This suggests that the DyCo2-xGex compounds are candidate materials for cryogenic magnetic cooling, which can be used in natural gas liquefaction, biological organ storage in medicine and quantum computer heat dissipation.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) firmware upgrade has turned out to be a challenging task with respect to security. While Over-The-Air (OTA) software upgrade possibility is an essential feature to achieve security, it is also most sensitive to attacks and lots of different firmware upgrade attacks have been presented in the literature. Several security solutions exist to tackle these problems. We observe though that most prior art solutions are public key-based, they are not flexible with respect to firmware image distribution principles and it is challenging to make a design with good Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks resistance. Apart from often being rather resource demanding, a limitation with current public key-based solutions is that they are not quantum computer resistant. Hence, in this paper, we take a new look into the firmware upgrade problem and propose RoSym, a secure, firmware distribution principle agnostic, and DoS protected upgrade mechanism purely based on symmetric cryptography. We present an experimental evaluation on a real testbed environment for the scheme. The results show that the scheme is efficient in comparison to other state of the art solutions. We also make a formal security verification of RoSym showing that it is robust against different attacks.

TI Phase-space methods for neutrino oscillations: Extension to multibeams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The phase-space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in Lacroix et al. [Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beams. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many- body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonians. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.

TI A Method to Correct the Temporal Drift of Single-Photon Detectors Based
   on Asynchronous Quantum Ghost Imaging
SO SENSORS
AB Single-photon detection and timing has attracted increasing interest in recent years due to their necessity in the field of quantum sensing and the advantages of single-quanta detection in the field of low-level light imaging. While simple bucket detectors are mature enough for commercial applications, more complex imaging detectors are still a field of research comprising mostly prototype-level detectors. A major problem in these detectors is the implementation of in-pixel timing circuitry, especially for two-dimensional imagers. One of the most promising approaches is the use of voltage-controlled ring resonators in every pixel. Each of these runs independently based on a voltage supplied by a global reference. However, this yields the problem that the supply voltage can change across the chip which, in turn, changes the period of the ring resonator. Due to additional parasitic effects, this problem can worsen with increasing measurement time, leading to drift in the timing information. We present here a method to identify and correct such temporal drifts in single-photon detectors based on asynchronous quantum ghost imaging. We also show the effect of this correction on recent quantum ghost imaging (QGI) measurement from our group.

TI Non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics with ultracold atoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Combining quantum many-body physics and nonequilibrium physics is an important opportunity and challenge for current physics research. Nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics is not only a subject of common interest to many branches of physics but also an indispensable theoretical foundation for developing emergent quantum technologies. Cold atom system provides an ideal platform for studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. The advantages of cold atom system, as well as other synthetic quantum systems, are reflected in studying various nonequilibrium processes such as the thermalization of isolated system, dissipation induced by coupling to the environment, ramping, quench, or periodically driving physical parameters of a system. In this work, three examples from our research are discussed to show how the study of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics with cold atoms can help us go beyond the existing framework of topological physics, uncover new methods of detecting quantum many-body correlations, and enrich the physical content of gauge theory. Such a research concerns the fundamental properties of quantum many-body system, such as topology and correlation, utilizes the advantages of cold atomic system to achieve a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment, and aims at discovering universal physical rules for nonequilibrium quantum many-body process, which can be extended to condensed matter and nuclear matter systems.

TI Optimization of carbon irradiation parameters for creating spin defects
   in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION ENGINEERING
AB Negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B(-)) spin defects are stable in nanoscale hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes, which can be easily integrated into two-dimensional materials and devices to serve as both sensors and protective materials. Ion irradiation is frequently employed to create V(B)(-)spin defects in hBN. However, the optimal ion irradiation parameters remain unclear, even though they play a crucial role in determining the depth and density of the defects, which in turn affect sensing sensitivity. In this work, we optimize the carbon ion irradiation parameters for creating V-B(-) spin defects by varying the irradiation dose and the incident angle. For 30 keV carbon ion irradiation, the optimal irradiation dose to create a V-B(-) ensemble is determined to be 4 x 10(13) ions/cm(2), and both continuous and pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance measurements are used to estimate the magnetic sensitivity and spin coherence properties. Moreover, the incident angle of energetic ions is found to influence both the depth and density distributions of the V-B(-) ensemble, a factor that is often overlooked. These results pave the way for improving the performance of quantum sensors based on hBN spin defects by optimizing the irradiation parameters. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Aluminum-rich reconstructed sapphire as a high-quality substrate for
   tungsten disulfide synthesis
SO NANOSCALE
AB 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted significant attention due to their unique properties, which make them highly promising for a variety of applications ranging from quantum technologies, to electronic and photonic applications. In this context, developing scalable methods for high-quality synthesis is a major research priority, with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) emerging as the most promising approach. In this work, we reveal the critical role of substrate preparation in the CVD growth of tungsten disulfide (WS2) on sapphire by comparing the aluminum-rich reconstructed surface with a conventionally prepared one. We find that on average the reconstructed sapphire surface provides a significant 50% increase in crystal size and 125% increase in nucleation density. It also has a strong impact on the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 crystals, leading to quenching at the center while the edges exhibit intense red-shifted emission. Correlative Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analyses reveal that PL quenching in the center is due to a strong coupling between the Al-rich reconstructed sapphire and the WS2 crystals, while the edges appear to be decoupled from the substrate, likely due to substrate degradation during the growth process. These findings highlight the importance of substrate reconstruction for tuning the morphology and optoelectronic properties of 2D materials.

TI Games for Teaching/Learning Quantum Mechanics: A Pilot Study with
   High-School Students
SO EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB The teaching of quantum physics is challenging, not the least because teachers must overcome the traditional narrative approach, students must gain a conceptual understanding of fundamentals, and citizens must become aware of quantum technologies. Quantum games are powerful tools to overcome obstacles and push one's limits without fear of failure. We report on a pilot study involving twenty high-school student volunteers, consisting of a compact intervention module on the concepts of quantum states, properties, measurement, superposition, and entanglement within the framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction, followed by playing a game, quantum TiqTaqToe. The outcomes of this research-based learning environment are discussed via the qualitative analysis of students' answers to two open questionnaires. We find that students grasped the concepts of superposition and, with special awareness, entanglement, the game proving effective to help students experience their implications in quantum behavior. The informal and stimulating tournament atmosphere favored intertwining of the game with learning goals. Our central message is that the use of quantum game tools fits a teaching/learning environment in manners often not well understood in the literature; it enhances awareness of the nature of new and non-intuitive concepts, increases complementarity with other languages within the process of thinking about physics, boosts student engagement, and improves intervention efficiency and effectiveness.

TI Gravity field mapping using laser-coupled quantum accelerometers in
   space
SO JOURNAL OF GEODESY
AB The emergence of quantum technologies, including cold atom-based accelerometers, offers an opportunity to improve the performances of space geodesy missions. In this context, CNES initiated an assessment study called GRICE (GRadiometrie a Interferometres quantiques Correles pour l'Espace) in order to evaluate the contribution of cold atom technologies to space geodesy and to the end users of geodetic data. In this paper, we present mission scenario for gravity field mapping based on a long baseline gradiometer. The mission is based on a constellation of two satellites, flying at an altitude of 373 km, each equipped with a cold atom accelerometer with a sensitivity of 6 x 10(-10) ms-2 t (-1/2.) A laser link measures the distance between the two satellites and couples these two instruments in order to produce a correlated differential acceleration measurement. The main parameters, determining the performances of the payload, have been investigated. We carried out a general study of satellite architecture and simulations of the mission performances in terms of restitution of the gravity field. The simulations show that this concept would give its best performance in terms of monthly gravity fields recovery under 1000 km resolution. In the resolution band between 1000 and 222 km, the improvement of the GRICE gradient approach over the traditional range-rate approach is globally in the order of 10 to 25%.

TI Rydberg Atom-Based Sensors: Principles, Recent Advances, and
   Applications
SO PHOTONICS
AB Rydberg atoms are neutral atoms excited to high principal quantum number states, which endows them with exaggerated properties such as large electric dipole moments, long lifetimes, and extreme sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields. These characteristics form the foundation of Rydberg atom-based sensors, an emerging class of quantum devices capable of optically detecting electric fields across frequencies from DC to the terahertz regime. Rydberg-based electrometry operates through both Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of resonant Rydberg transitions and Stark-shift measurements for high-frequency or far-detuned fields, enabling broadband field sensing from DC to the THz regime. Using ladder-type electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and AT splitting, these sensors enable non-invasive, SI-traceable measurements of field amplitude, frequency, phase, and polarization. Recent developments have demonstrated broadband electric field probes, voltage calibration standards, and compact RF receivers based on thermal vapor cells and integrated photonic architectures. Furthermore, innovations in multi-photon EIT, superheterodyne readout, and multi wave mixing have expanded the dynamic range and bandwidth of Rydberg-based electrometry. Despite challenges related to environmental perturbations, linewidth broadening, and laser stabilization, ongoing advances in atomic control, hybrid photonic integration, and EIT-based readout promise scalable, chip-compatible sensors. This review summarizes the physical principles, experimental progress, and emerging applications of Rydberg atom-based sensing, emphasizing their potential for next generation quantum metrology, wireless communication, and precision field mapping.

TI Computational Analysis of Chemical Reactions Using a Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver Algorithm without Specifying Spin Multiplicity
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The analysis of a chemical reaction along the ground-statepotentialenergy surface in conjunction with an unknown spin state is challengingbecause electronic states must be separately computed several timesusing different spin multiplicities to find the lowest energy state.However, in principle, the ground state could be obtained with justa single calculation using a quantum computer without specifying thespin multiplicity in advance. In the present work, ground-state potentialenergy curves for PtCO were calculated as a proof-of-concept usinga variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This system exhibitsa singlet-triplet crossover as a consequence of the interactionbetween Pt and CO. VQE calculations using a statevector simulatorwere found to converge to a singlet state in the bonding region, whilea triplet state was obtained at the dissociation limit. Calculationsperformed using an actual quantum device provided potential energieswithin +/- 2 kcal/mol of the simulated energies after error mitigationtechniques were adopted. The spin multiplicities in the bonding anddissociation regions could be clearly distinguished even in the caseof a small number of shots. The results of this study suggest thatquantum computing can be a powerful tool for the analysis of the chemicalreactions of systems for which the spin multiplicity of the groundstate and variations in this parameter are not known in advance.

TI Quasi-optimal Sampling from Gibbs States via Non-commutative Optimal
   Transport Metrics
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover the nearest neighbour case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature, satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.

TI Tunable Plasmonic Response of Silver Nanoparticles Entangled in
   Detonation Nanodiamond Network via Colloidal Self-Assembly
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB This study explores the self-assembly of nanocomplexes formed by well-defined 20-nm colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with 4-nm detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs), focusing on plasmonic resonance. Water-diluted DNDs spontaneously aggregate into chain-like structures entangling AgNPs, forming stable nanocomplexes that sediment within minutes but maintain their plasmonic properties even after redispersion, indicating robust interparticle bonding and interactions. While driven by electrostatics, the binding is stabilized by surface chemistry. AgNPs become spatially entangled yet not aggregated within the DND network, resulting in 8-nm red shift of the plasmonic peak. This nanocomplex morphology is supported by transmission electron microscopy images and electromagnetic numerical simulations. Modeling shows that a 3-nm gap between AgNP and DND particles consistently reproduces experimental data, confirming that DNDs modulate the plasmonic electromagnetic field. Moreover, the plasmonic peaks undergo pronounced intensity changes depending on AgNP concentration: low concentrations enhance (up to +78%), whereas high concentrations lead to suppression (down to -49%) of AgNP plasmonic absorption, independent of DND content. The model shows that, this arises from AgNP field redistribution and interference. The AgNP-DND entangled nanocomplexes thus offer a simple route to a stable hybrid nanoparticle system with tunable optical properties for diverse applications, from biosensing to catalysis, energy conversion or quantum technologies.

TI Coherent phenomena in exciton-polariton systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB Exciton-polariton systems, formed through the strong coupling of excitons and photons, provide a unique platform for investigating quantum coherence and collective dynamics in solid-state systems. These hybrid quasiparticles combine photonic and excitonic characteristics, enabling phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, long-distance coherent energy transfer, ballistic energy transport, and Bose-Einstein condensation. Their ability to sustain macroscopic quantum coherence, alongside their sensitivity to environmental and system-engineering factors, highlights their potential for advancing both fundamental quantum science and practical applications, including nanophotonics, energy harvesting, and quantum technologies. This review aims to offer a comprehensive exploration of coherent phenomena in exciton-polariton systems, spanning theoretical foundations, experimental realizations, and applications. Key topics include the dynamics of strong light-matter coupling, the role of vibrational modes and energetic disorder, and the interplay between coherence and dissipation. Advances in ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum electrodynamics models have been pivotal in uncovering polaritonic behavior and optimizing system performance. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in maintaining coherence and addressing the effects of dissipation and disorder. By overcoming these hurdles, exciton-polariton systems promise transformative technological applications and deeper insights into quantum phenomena, positioning them as a cornerstone in the future of quantum science and technology.

TI An overview on plasmon-enhanced photoluminescence via metallic
   nanoantennas
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB In the realm of nanotechnology, the integration of quantum emitters with plasmonic nanostructures has emerged as an innovative pathway for applications in quantum technologies, sensing, and imaging. This research paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the photoluminescence enhancement induced by the interaction between quantum emitters and tailored nanostructure configurations. Four canonical nanoantennas (spheres, rods, disks, and crescents) are systematically investigated theoretically in three distinct configurations (single, gap, and nanoparticle-on-mirror nanoantennas), as a representative selection of the most fundamental and commonly studied structures and arrangements. A detailed analysis reveals that the rod gap nanoantenna configuration achieves the largest photoluminescence enhancement factor, of up to three orders of magnitude. The study presented here provides insights for the strategic design of plasmonic nanoantennas in the visible and near-IR spectral range, offering a roadmap for these structures to meet specific requirements in plasmon-enhanced fluorescence. Key properties such as the excitation rate, the quantum yield, the enhanced emitted power, or the directionality of the emission are thoroughly reviewed. The results of this overview contribute not only to the fundamental understanding of plasmon-enhanced emission of quantum emitters but also set the basis for the development of advanced nanophotonic devices with enhanced functionalities.

TI Magnetic exchange interactions at the proximity of a superconductor
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Interfacing magnetism with superconductivity gives rise to a wonderful playground for intertwining key degrees of freedom: Cooper pairs, spin, charge, and spin-orbit interaction, from which emerge a wealth of exciting phenomena, fundamental in the nascent field of superconducting spinorbitronics and topological quantum technologies. Magnetic exchange interactions (MEIs), being isotropic or chiral such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, are vital in establishing the magnetic behavior at these interfaces as well as in dictating not only complex transport phenomena, but also the manifestation of topologically trivial or non-trivial objects. Here, we propose a methodology enabling the extraction of the tensor of MEI from electronic structure simulations accounting for superconductivity. We apply our scheme to the case of a Mn layer deposited on Nb(110) surface and explore proximity-induced impact on the MEI. The latter are weakly modified by a realistic electron-phonon coupling. However, tuning the superconducting order parameter, we unveil potential change of the magnetic order accompanied with chirality switching, as induced by the interplay of spin-orbit interaction and Cooper pairing. Owing to its simple formulation, our methodology can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art frameworks capable of tackling superconductivity and magnetism. We thus foresee implications in the simulations and prediction of topological superconducting bits as well as of cryogenic superconducting hybrid devices involving magnetic units.

TI Epitaxial growth of crystal phase quantum dots in III-V semiconductor
   nanowires
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Crystal phase quantum dots (QDs) are formed during the axial growth of III-V semiconductor nanowires (NWs) by stacking different crystal phases of the same material. In III-V semiconductor NWs, both zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) crystal phases can coexist. The band structure difference between both crystal phases can lead to quantum confinement. Thanks to the precise control in III-V semiconductor NW growth conditions and the deep knowledge on the epitaxial growth mechanisms, it is nowadays possible to control, down to the atomic level, the switching between crystal phases in NWs forming the so-called crystal phase NW-based QDs (NWQDs). The shape and size of the NW bridge the gap between QDs and the macroscopic world. This review is focused on crystal phase NWQDs based on III-V NWs obtained by the bottom-up vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method and their optical and electronic properties. Crystal phase switching can be achieved in the axial direction. In contrast, in the core/shell growth, the difference in surface energies between different polytypes can enable selective shell growth. One reason for the very intense research in this field is motivated by their excellent optical and electronic properties both appealing for applications in nanophotonics and quantum technologies.

TI An Evaluation of Moderate-Refractive-Index Nanoantennas for Enhancing
   the Photoluminescence Signal of Quantum Dots
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The use of nanostructures to enhance the emission of single-photon sources has attracted some attention in the last decade due to the development of quantum technologies. In particular, the use of metallic and high-refractive-index dielectric materials has been proposed. However, the utility of moderate-refractive-index dielectric nanostructures to achieve more efficient single-photon sources remains unexplored. Here, a systematic comparison of various metallic, high-refractive-index and moderate-refractive-index dielectric nanostructures was performed to optimize the excitation and emission of a CdSe/ZnS single quantum dot in the visible spectral region. Several geometries were evaluated in terms of electric field enhancement and Purcell factor, considering the combination of metallic, high-refractive-index and moderate-refractive-index dielectric materials conforming to homogeneous and hybrid nanoparticle dimers. Our results demonstrate that moderate-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles can enhance the photoluminescence signal of quantum emitters due to their broader electric and magnetic dipolar resonances compared to high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles. However, hybrid combinations of metallic and high-refractive-index dielectric nanostructures offer the largest intensity enhancement and Purcell factors at the excitation and emission wavelengths of the quantum emitter, respectively. The results of this work may find applications in the development of single-photon sources.

TI Voltage-controlled two-dimensional Fresnel diffraction pattern in
   quantum dot molecules
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study explores the influence of inter-dot tunneling effects within a quantum dot molecule on the Fresnel diffraction phenomenon. Our findings indicate that the Fresnel diffraction of the output probe Gaussian field can be manipulated by adjusting the inter-dot tunneling parameter's strength and the characteristics of the coupling field. The inter-dot tunneling effect establishes a closed-loop system, setting conditions for the interference of the applied fields. We specifically examine a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) coupling field, investigating how its properties-such as strength, value, and sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM)-impact the Fresnel diffraction of the output probe field. Increasing the inter-dot tunneling parameter and the coupling LG field's strength allows for control over the spatial distribution of the Fresnel diffraction pattern. Notably, the inter-dot tunneling parameter can disturb the symmetry of the diffraction patterns. Additionally, considering a negative OAM for the coupling LG field transforms the diffraction pattern into its inverse shape. This suggests that, in the presence of the inter-dot tunneling effect, the Fresnel diffraction pattern is contingent on the direction of rotation of the helical phase front of the coupling LG field. Our results offer insights into quantum control of Fresnel diffraction patterns and the identification of OAM in LG beams, presenting potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Aromaticity Reversal Induced by Vibrations in Cyclo[16]carbon
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Aromaticity is typically regarded as an intrinsic property of a molecule, correlated with electron delocalization, stability, and other properties. Small variations in the molecular geometry usually result in small changes in aromaticity, in line with Hammond's postulate. For example, introducing bond-length alternation in benzene and square cyclobutadiene by modulating the geometry along the Kekule vibration gradually decreases the magnitude of their ring currents, making them less aromatic and less antiaromatic, respectively. A sign change in the ring current, corresponding to a reversal of aromaticity, typically requires a gross perturbation such as electronic excitation, addition or removal of two electrons, or a dramatic change in the molecular geometry. Here, we use multireference calculations to show how movement along the Kekule vibration, which controls bond-length alternation, induces a sudden reversal in the ring current of cyclo[16]carbon, C-16. This reversal occurs when the two orthogonal pi systems of C-16 sustain opposing currents. These results are rationalized by a Huckel model which includes bond-length alternation, and which is combined with a minimal model accounting for orbital contributions to the ring current. Finally, we successfully describe the electronic structure of C-16 with a "divide-and-conquer" approach suitable for execution on a quantum computer.

TI Proposal for the search for new spin interactions at the micrometer
   scale using diamond quantum sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB For decades, searches for exotic spin interactions have used increasingly precise laboratory measurements to test various theoretical models of particle physics. However, most searches have focused on interaction length scales of greater than or similar to 1 mm, corresponding to hypothetical boson masses of less than or similar to 0.2 meV. Recently, quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a promising platform to probe spin interactions at the micrometer scale, opening the door to explore new physics at this length scale. Here, we propose experiments to search for several hypothetical interactions between NV electron spins and moving masses. We focus on potential interactions involving the coupling of NV spin ensembles to both spin-polarized and unpolarized masses attached to vibrating mechanical oscillators. For each interaction, we estimate the sensitivity, identify optimal experimental conditions, and analyze potential systematic errors. Using multipulse quantum sensing protocols with NV spin ensembles to improve sensitivity, we project constraints that are a greater than or similar to 5-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous constraints at the micrometer scale. We also identify a spin-polarized test mass, based on hyperpolarized C-13 nuclear spins in a thin diamond membrane, which offers a favorable combination of high spin density and low stray magnetic fields. Our analysis is timely in light of a recent preprint by Rong et al. (arXiv:2010.15667) reporting a surprising nonzero result of micrometer-scale spin-velocity interactions.

TI Dynamics Reflects Quantum Phase Transition of Rabi Model
SO PHOTONICS
AB As the simplest and most fundamental model describing the interaction between light and matter, a breakdown in the rotating wave approximation of the Rabi model leads to phase transition versus coupling strength when the frequency of the qubit greatly surpasses that of the oscillator. In addition to the phase transition revealed in the ground state, we show that the dynamics of physical quantities can reflect such a phase transition for this model. In addition to the excitation of the bosonic field in the ground state, we show that the witness of inseparability (entanglement), mutual information, quantum Fisher information, and the variance of cavity quadrature can be employed to detect the phase transition in quench. We also reveal the negative impact of temperature on checking the phase transition by quench. This model can be implemented using trapped ions, superconducting artificial atoms coupled bosonic modes, and quantum simulations. By reflecting the phase transition in a fundamental quantum optics model without imposing the thermodynamic limit, this work offers an idea to explore phase transitions by nonequilibrium process for open quantums.

TI Effective Hamiltonians in the quantum Rabi problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We revisit the theoretical description of the ultrastrong light-matter interaction in terms of exactly solvable effective Hamiltonians. A perturbative approach based on polaronic and spin-dependent squeezing transforma-tions provides an effective Hamiltonian for the quantum Rabi model up to the second order in the expansion parameter. The model consistently includes both rotating and counter-rotating terms, going therefore beyond the rotating-wave approximation. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed Hamiltonian performs better than the Bloch-Siegert model when calculating operator averages (e.g., the mean photon number and number of excitations). This improvement is due to a refined calculation of the dressed states within the present model. Regarding the frequency shift induced by the qubit-photon interaction, we find a different sign from the Bloch-Siegert value. This influences the structure of the eigenstates in a nontrivial way and ensures the correct calculation of the number of excitations associated with a given dressed state. As a consistency check, we show that the exactly solvable independent boson model is reproduced as a special limit case of the perturbative Hamiltonian.

TI Measuring the capabilities of quantum computers
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Evaluations of quantum computers across architectures need reliable benchmarks. A class of benchmarks that can directly reflect the structure of any algorithm shows that different quantum computers have considerable variations in performance.
   Quantum computers can now run interesting programs, but each processor's capability-the set of programs that it can run successfully-is limited by hardware errors. These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor's capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today's hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure.

TI Fast and differentiable simulation of driven quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The controls enacting logical operations on quantum systems are described by time-dependent Hamiltonians that often include rapid oscillations. In order to accurately capture the resulting time dynamics in numerical simulations, a very small integration time step is required, which can severely impact the simulation run time. Here, we introduce a semianalytic method based on the Dyson expansion that allows us to time-evolve driven quantum systems much faster than standard numerical integrators. This solver, which we name Dysolve, efficiently captures the effect of the highly oscillatory terms in the system Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the simulation's run time as well as its sensitivity to the time-step size. Furthermore, this solver provides the exact derivative of the time-evolution operator with respect to the drive amplitudes. This key feature allows for optimal control in the limit of strong drives and goes beyond common pulse-optimization approaches that rely on rotating-wave approximations. As an illustration of our method, we show results of the optimization of a two-qubit gate using transmon qubits in the circuit QED architecture.

TI An overview of advanced instruments for magnetic characterization and
   measurements
SO FRONTIERS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Magnetic materials play a pivotal role in emerging fields such as new energy, information technology, and biomedicine, where accurate magnetic characterization is essential for material innovation and device engineering. Notably, with the burgeoning development of nanomaterials and spintronics, the importance of magnetic characterization has grown significantly, accompanied by increasingly higher requirements for precision and multi-dimensional analysis. This paper elaborates on the working principles and structural components of static magnetic measurement techniques-including Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), Alternating Gradient Magnetometer (AGM), Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) Microscope, Magnetic Force Microscope (MFM) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Magnetometer, as well as dynamic magnetic measurement techniques such as Alternating Current (AC) susceptometry and Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR). In addition, this review also introduces emerging techniques relevant to spintronics, including Magnetometer based on negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond, Spin-polarized Scanning Tunneling Microscope (SP-STM), Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscope (LTEM), and Soft X-ray-based techniques, highlighting their principles and applications in quantum sensing, magnetic imaging, and element-specific spin analysis. This overview emphasizes the unique capabilities and measurement principles of each magnetic characterization instrument, providing users with practical guidance to identify the most appropriate tool based on specific research objectives, material properties, and experimental requirements, thereby improving characterization efficiency and accuracy.

TI Exceptional-Point-Enhanced Superior Sensing Using Asymmetric
   Coupled-Lossy-Resonator Based Optical Metasurface
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Exotic optical responses of designed metasurfaces, including non-Hermitian photonic systems exhibiting exceptional point (EP)-singularities, offer diverse applications in the field of quantum sensing, laser technology, gravitational-wave detection as well as biomedical instrumentation for weak signal detection. However, the sensitivity enhancement of such EP-sensors is limited by quantum/thermal noises. Here we propose a novel scheme of EP-based superior photonic sensing of any molecule, using suitably designed asymmetric coupled-lossy-resonators (ACLR) with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Unlike conventional approach of EP-degeneracy lifting, the perturbing Hamiltonian of the molecular-vibron, in the present method, generates an EP-singularity by coupling with the ACLR that does not exhibit EP in the unperturbed condition. Raman spectroscopic measurements performed on such systems provide significantly enhanced peaks at the vibronic modes, thereby exploring a novel method for molecule detection with superior sensitivity. Such EP-sensing is experimentally demonstrated in the current work by detecting the relevant protein-vibrons of the recombinant Omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2 with 350%-2200% enhanced Raman intensities, using an optical-metasurface consisting of an array of Au-asymmetric split-ring-resonators as the ACLRs. This work will open up a novel field of EP-based superior photonic sensing of any molecule, in general, by appropriately designing the ACLR-structures for detecting molecular-vibrons with desired enhanced sensitivity.

TI Evaluation of Performance, Energy, and Computation Costs of
   Quantum-Attack Resilient Encryption Algorithms for Embedded Devices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The accelerated development of quantum computers poses a direct threat to all current standards of public key encryption, for example, the Shor algorithm exploits the superposition state of the qubits to solve the problem of integer factorization in polynomial time, rendering all systems whose security relies on this hard mathematical problem not secure. Public key encryption algorithms are used in a multitude of applications that form the core of the digital world (e.g., emails, banking, digital currency, defense, and communication.). The prospects of a quantum machine that can break such systems are too risky to ignore, even if such a computer still needs thirty years to build. This is because adversaries can be storing data now to decrypt later aka. SNLD attack, moreover, some systems have an operational lifetime that spans more than thirty years (e.g., defense, aviation industry). Consequently, the work has already started to develop quantum-attack resilient security schemes. The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected to be around 29 billion in 2030, forming a significant portion of all computing machines. Most of these will be implemented as embedded systems with limited resources. Consequently, assessing the energy and computational overheads of the quantum-attack resilient security schemes is vital. This work presents a comprehensive study that evaluates the energy and performance costs of the proposed solutions in resource-constrained devices, in comparison with the existing schemes. This was achieved through the development of a testbed that emulates a client-server configuration, wherein both devices perform mutual authentication and then agree on a shared key using the TLS protocol. A Raspberry Pi 3b+ was used as a server, and a client in the first set of experiments. Raspberry Pi Pico W was the client in the second group of tests. The results of the evaluation have shown that Kyber1-Dilithuim-2 is the most resource-efficient solution, it outperforms all other PQC algorithms, including the current scheme that uses elliptic curve cryptography. Our study has also shown the digital signature scheme Sphinx+ is associated with significant latency and energy costs so may not be suitable for IoT-type devices.

TI Strained crystalline nanomechanical resonators with quality factors
   above 10 billion
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB In strained mechanical resonators, the concurrence of tensile stress and geometric nonlinearity dramatically reduces dissipation. This phenomenon, called dissipation dilution, is employed in mirror suspensions of gravitational-wave interferometers and at the nanoscale, where soft clamping and strain engineering have allowed extremely high quality factors. However, these techniques have so far been applied only to amorphous materials, specifically Si3N4. Crystalline materials exhibit substantially lower intrinsic damping at cryogenic temperatures. Applying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials could, therefore, enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, as they combine low internal friction, high intrinsic strain and high yield strength. This potential has not yet been fully exploited. Here we demonstrate that single-crystal strained silicon-a material developed for high-mobility transistors-can be used to realize mechanical resonators with ultralow dissipation. We fabricate strained silicon nanostrings with high aspect ratios supporting megahertz mechanical modes with quality factors exceeding 10(10) at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported in Si3N4. We estimate a thermal-noise-limited force sensitivity of (5 +/- 2) x 10(-20) N Hz(-1/2) at 7 K-approaching that of carbon nanotubes-and a heating rate of only 60 quanta per second. The low mass and high quality factors of our nanomechanical resonators make them particularly promising for quantum sensing and transduction.
   Soft clamping reduces the dissipation of nanomechanical resonators, but this method has been limited to amorphous materials. When applied in crystalline silicon, it enables resonators with quality factors beyond ten billion.

TI Nonlinear Behavior of Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Recent advancements in quantum technologies and advanced detection experiments have underscored the pressing need for the detection of exceedingly weak signals within the microwave frequency spectrum. Addressing this challenge, the Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) has been proposed as a cryogenic front-end amplifier capable of approaching the quantum noise limit while providing a relevant bandwidth. This research is centered on a comprehensive numerical investigation of the JTWPA, without resorting to simplifications regarding the nonlinearity of the essential components. Specifically, this study focuses on a thorough examination of the system, characterized by coupled nonlinear differential equations representing all components of the device. Proper input and output signals at the device's boundaries are considered. The analysis of the output signals undergoing the parametric amplification process involves a detailed exploration of phase-space dynamics and Fourier spectral analysis of the output voltage. This study is conducted while considering the parameters ruling the response of the device under pump and signal excitations. In addition to the expected signal amplification, the findings reveal that the nonlinear nature of the system can give rise to unforeseen phenomena, depending on the system's operational conditions, which include: the generation of pump tone harmonics, modulation of the signal gain, and incommensurate frequency generation-effects that are not easily accommodated by simplistic linearized approaches.

TI Wafer-Scale Emission Energy Modulation of Indium Flushed Quantum Dots
SO CRYSTALS
AB Semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) have garnered immense attention for their potential in various quantum technologies and photonics applications. Here, we explore a novel approach for fine-tuning the emission wavelength of QDs by building upon the indium flush growth method: Submonolayer variations in the capping thickness reveal a non-monotonic progression, where the emission energy can decrease even though the capping thickness decreases. indium flush, a well-known technique for inducing blue shifts in quantum dot emissions, involves the partial capping of QDs with GaAs followed by a temperature ramp-up. However, our findings reveal that the capping layer roughness, stemming from fractional monolayers during overgrowth, plays a pivotal role in modulating the emission energy of these QDs. We propose increased indium interdiffusion between the QDs and the surrounding GaAs capping layer for a rough surface surrounding the QD as the driving mechanism. This interdiffusion alters the indium content within the QDs, resulting in an additional emission energy shift, counterintuitive to the capping layer's thickness increase. We utilize photoluminescence spectroscopy to generate wafer maps depicting the emission spectrum of the QDs. Using thickness gradients, we produce systematic variations in the capping layer thickness on 3 '' wafers, resulting in modulations of the emission energy of up to 26 meV.

TI A quantum resistant universal designated verifier signature proof
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB In order to ensure that only the designated person can verify the signer's signature on the message, Steinfeld et al. introduced the concept of Universal Designated Verifier Signature (UDVS), which enables a designator who has obtained a signature on a message from the signer to designate the signature to any desired designated verifier. This idea was developed to address the privacy concerns of the signature holder at the time of certificate distribution. They are appropriate for applications that demand the designer's secrecy. The fact that the designated verifier must generate a public key with regard to the signer's public parameter for signature verification is a significant drawback of UDVS methods. In cases where the verifier is unable to begin the key generation procedure, this constraint is inapplicable. Baek et al. developed the idea of "Universal Designated Verifier Signature Proof (UDVSP)", which does not require the verifier's public key for verification, to get around this restriction. All existing UDVSP constructions are based on a discrete logarithm problem, which is vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. As a result, an efficient quantum resistant UDVSP is built on a hard problem in coding theory, as suggested by NIST reports. The scheme's security against forgeability and impersonation attacks is examined using the random oracle model.

TI Real-Time Measure of the Lattice Temperature of a Semiconductor
   Heterostructure Laser via an On-Chip Integrated Graphene Thermometer
SO ACS NANO
AB The on-chip integration of two-dimensional nanomaterials, having exceptional optical, electrical, and thermal properties, with terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) has recently led to wide spectral tuning, nonlinear high-harmonic generation, and pulse generation. Here, we transfer a large area (1 x 1 cm2) multilayer graphene (MLG), to lithographically define a micro thermometer, on the bottom contact of a single-plasmon THz QCL to monitor, in real-time, its local lattice temperature during operation. We exploit the temperature dependence of the MLG electrical resistance to measure the local heating of the QCL chip. The results are further validated through microprobe photoluminescence experiments, performed on the front-facet of the electrically driven QCL. We extract a heterostructure cross-plane conductivity of k perpendicular to= 10.2 W/m center dot K, in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental reports. Our integrated system endows THz QCLs with a fast (similar to 30 ms) temperature sensor, providing a tool to reach full electrical and thermal control on laser operation. This can be exploited, inter alia, to stabilize the emission of THz frequency combs, with potential impact on quantum technologies and high-precision spectroscopy.

TI Revealing superradiant emission in the single-to-bulk transition of
   quantum emitters in nanodiamond agglomerates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Individual quantum emitters form a fundamental building block for emerging quantum technologies. Collective effects of emitters, such as superradiance, might improve the performance of applications even further. When scaling materials to larger sizes, however, the optical density of states is modified by the surrounding material, and the collective coupling in small domains might be covered by transitions to bulk properties due to the presence of multiple collectively emitting domains, which inhomogeneously add. Here, we probe the optical properties of nitrogen vacancy centers in agglomerates of nanodiamonds. We quantify the transition from individual emitters to bulk emission by fluorescence lifetime measurements, and find a transition to occur on a length scale of similar to 3 wavelengths around the emitter. While our lifetime measurements are consistent with superradiant decay, the second-order correlation function, which is a standard measure to reveal collective properties, fails to probe collective effects for our case of an ensemble of collectively contributing domains to the emission. Therefore, we propose and apply a new measure to trace collective effects based on the intensity fluctuations of the emitted light. Our work points toward systematically studying collective effects in a scalable solid-state quantum system, and using them for quantum optical applications in agglomerates of highly-doped nanodiamonds.

TI Tunable photo-patterning of organic color-centers
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Organic color-centers (OCCs) in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been intensively investigated for quantum technologies, bio-and chemical sensing, bioimaging. The precise localization of OCCs at a scalable manner will bring about a revolution into next generation optoelectronics, which, however, remains a great challenge till now. Here, a scalable, low cost and universal photo-patterning strategy is developed to implant OCCs at desired locations on (6,5)-chirality SWCNT films by combining optically active diazonium chemistry and micro-contact printing methods. Notably, the patterns can be tunable by changing the solvents used for the patterning chemistry, affording control over the weight of diazonium salts at different regions. A systematic investigation reveals that the solvent properties (polarity and vapor pressure), the volume and concentration of ink used, the patterning methods, and the concentration of MeODz all contribute to the tunable patterning. This spatial accurate and solvent tunable photo-patterning technique is simple, scalable, and amenable to the integration of other color center chemistries and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for the next-generation chip-integrated nanoelectronics and optoelectronics with high device uniformity and manipulability at molecular level.

TI Introduction to the Pontryagin Maximum Principle for Quantum Optimal
   Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Optimal control theory is a powerful mathematical tool, which has known a rapid development since the 1950s, mainly for engineering applications. More recently, it has become a widely used method to improve process performance in quantum technologies by means of highly efficient control of quantum dynamics. This tutorial aims at providing an introduction to key concepts of optimal control theory that is accessible to physicists and engineers working in quantum control or in related fields. The different mathematical results are introduced intuitively, before being rigorously stated. This tutorial describes modern aspects of optimal control theory, with a particular focus on the Pontryagin maximum principle, which is the main tool for determining open-loop control laws without experimental feedback. The different steps to solve an optimal control problem are discussed, before moving on to more advanced topics such as the existence of optimal solutions or the definition of the different types of extremals, namely normal, abnormal, and singular. The tutorial covers various quantum control issues and describes their mathematical formulation suitable for optimal control. The connection between the Pontryagin maximum principle and gradient-based optimization algorithms used for high-dimensional quantum systems is described. The optimal solution of different low-dimensional quantum systems is presented in detail, illustrating how the mathematical tools are applied in a practical way.

TI Charge-singlet measurement toolbox
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Symmetry is fundamental to physical laws across different scales-from spacetime structure in general relativity to particle interactions in quantum field theory. Local symmetries, described by gauge theories, are central to phenomena such as superconductivity, topological phases, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Emerging simulation techniques using tensor network states or quantum computers offer exciting possibilities of exploring the physics of these gauge theories, but require careful implementation of gauge symmetry and charge-neutrality constraints. This is especially challenging for non-Abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In a recent article (Than et al., arXiv:2501.00579), we introduced "charge-singlet measurements" for quantum simulations, consisting of a projection-based technique from group representation theory that allowed us to probe for the first time the phase diagram of (1 + 1)-dimensional QCD on a quantum computer. In this article, we show more broadly how to apply charge-singlet measurements as a flexible tool for both classical and quantum simulations of discrete and continuous gauge theories. Our approach extends the use of charge-singlet measurements beyond state preparation in the charge neutral (charge-singlet) sector to include noise mitigation in symmetry-preserving time-evolution circuits. We further demonstrate how this method enables the computation of thermodynamic observables-such as entropy-within the charge-singlet subspace, providing a tool for exploring the connection between quantum thermodynamics and gauge symmetry.

TI Versatile Quadrature Antenna for Precise Control of Large Electron Spin
   Ensembles in Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An easily reproducible inexpensive microwave antenna that can generate a strong and homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary polarization is presented, which enables fast and coherent control of electron spins over a large volume. Unlike preceding works, a resonant antenna with ample optical access and which maintains its resonant behavior regardless of the proximity of other experimental hardware components is presented. This robustness is crucial as it enables using microscope objectives with short working distances to perform wide-field imaging/sensing with bulk diamonds. The antenna generates a magnetic field strength of 22.3 A m-1${\rm m}<^>{-1}$ for 1 W total driving power, which doubles the power efficiency compared with previously reported patch antenna designs. The magnetic field homogeneity in a volume of 0.3mm3$0.3\text{mm}<^>3$, 0.6mm3$0.6\text{mm}<^>3$ and 1mm3$1\text{mm}<^>3$ is within 3%, 8% and 14%, respectively. The antenna can be driven off-resonance without affecting the ellipticity and inhomogeneity of the field, and has a full-width-at-half-maximum bandwidth of similar to$\sim$200 MHz. Its resonant frequency can be tuned over a 400 MHz range via varactors. The PCB files are provided open-source. This work facilitates a robust and versatile piece of instrumentation, being particularly appealing for applications such as high sensitivity magnetometry and wide-field imaging/sensing with nitrogen-vacancy centers.

TI Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cells with Multi-Optical Channels Based on
   an Innovative Inner-Sidewall Molding Process
SO ENGINEERING
AB Existing microfabricated atomic vapor cells have only one optical channel, which is insufficient for supporting the multiple orthogonal beams required by atomic devices. In this study, we present a novel wafer-level manufacturing process for fabricating multi-optical-channel atomic vapor cells and an innovative method for batch processing the inner sidewalls of millimeter glass holes to meet optical channel requirements. Surface characterization and transmittance tests demonstrate that the processed inner sidewalls satisfy the criteria for an optical channel. In addition, the construction of an integrated processing platform enables multilayer non-isothermal anode bonding, the filling of inert gases, and the recovery and recycling of noble gases. Measurements of the absorption spectra and free-induction decay signals of xenon-129 (129Xe) and xenon-131 (131Xe) under different pump-probe schemes demonstrate the suitability of our vapor cell for use in atomic devices including atomic gyroscopes, dual-beam atomic magnetometers, and other optical/atomic devices. The proposed micromolding technology has broad application prospects in the field of optical-device processing. (c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI Sensing Applications of PT-Symmetry in Non-Hermitian Photonic Systems
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In recent years, rapid advances in non-Hermitian physics and PT-symmetry have brought new opportunities for ultra-sensitive sensing. Especially the presence of controllable non-conservative processes in optical and photonic systems has triggered the development of singularity-based sensing. By flexibly tuning gain, loss, and coupling strength, a series of high-resolution sensing approaches can be realized, with the potential of on-chip integration. Another important non-Hermitian singularity is the coherent perfect absorption-lasing (CPAL) point in the PT-broken phase, which manifests the coexistence of lasing and CPA, exhibiting intriguing properties with considerable sensing potential. As a crucial method for quantum sensing and metrology, the interaction between light and alkali-metal atomic ensembles promises unprecedented sensitivity in the measurement of ultra-weak magnetic field, inertia, and time. Therefore, extending the study of PT-symmetry and singularity-based sensing from conventional solid-state wave systems to diffusive systems such as atomic ensembles is attracting wide attention. In this review, the development of singularity-based sensing in PT/anti-PT symmetric non-Hermitian systems is summarized, with a special focus on photonic platforms including integration with waveguides, microcavities, metasurface, etc. In addition, sensing applications with discussion further extended to atomic ensembles, projecting future research trends in the field.

TI Quantum homogenization in non-Markovian collisional model
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Collisional models are a category of microscopic framework designed to study open quantum systems. The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Here, we study the homogenization process for a single qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we numerically demonstrate that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality, being dependent on the initial states of the bath units.

TI Continuous percolation in a Hilbert space for a large system of qubits
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB The development of percolation theory was historically shaped by its numerous applications in various branches of science, in particular in statistical physics, and was mainly constrained to the case of Euclidean spaces. One of its central concepts, the percolation transition, is defined through the appearance of the infinite cluster, and therefore cannot be used in compact spaces, such as the Hilbert space of an N-qubit system. Here, we propose its generalization for the case of a random space covering by hyperspheres, introducing the concept of a "maximal cluster". Our numerical calculations reproduce the standard power-law relation between the hypersphere radius and the cover density, but show that as the number of qubits increases, the exponent quickly vanishes (i.e., the exponentially increasing dimensionality of the Hilbert space makes its covering by finite-size hyperspheres inefficient). Therefore the percolation transition is not an efficient model for the behavior of multiqubit systems, compared to the random walk model in the Hilbert space. However, our approach to the percolation transition in compact metric spaces may prove useful for its rigorous treatment in other contexts.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this work we evaluate quantum Fisher information (QFI) of a two-qubit reduced state in the Ising-XXZ diamond structure at finite temperatures, which is applied to demonstrate quantum criticality and quantum phase transition in this model. Here we adopt the average QFI with respect to the local orthonormal observable bases [Phys. Rev. A. 88, 014,301 (2013)]. The results show that QFI around quantum critical points decreases or increases steeper when the system temperature is relatively lower. Meanwhile the singularity of QFI' first derivatives is becoming more and more obvious as the temperature is approaching zero. By the finite temperature QFI and its scaling relation with temperature, quantum phase transitions can be well detected from the entangled state in ferrimagnetic phase to an unentangled state in ferrimagnetic phase or to an unentangled state in ferromagnetic phase. Moreover it is further found that the two kinds of phase transitions can be distinguished by the different scaling behaviors. It has been proved that QFI has enough capability to characterize quantum phase transition at finite temperature.

TI Optimal shape approximation and writing strategy for integrated photonic
   waveguides fabricated with variable-shaped electron-beam lithography
SO JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOPATTERNING MATERIALS AND METROLOGY-JM3
AB Background: Integrated photonics offers a miniaturization potential for applications such as sensing, data communication, and emerging quantum technologies. For prototyping and small-scale production, variable-shaped electron-beam direct lithography constitutes a flexible, accurate, and fast production tool. The non-Manhattan shapes which are ubiquitous in photonics layouts, however, need to be approximated with the available exposure primitives without bloating the writing time or introducing artifacts that lead to excess scattering loss. Aim: We compare the optical performance of curved and slanted waveguides prepared with the common border approximation algorithm and with Vistec's shot-count optimized and edge-roughness aware JES approximation. We also compare the loss of waveguides exposed with the single- and double-pass strategy. Approach: Identical photonics layouts were fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator wafer with different approximation settings and exposure strategies, and their respective waveguide loss was experimentally determined. Results: We find that the JES approximation significantly outperforms the border approximation at only a fraction of the writing time. Additional improvement is achieved by employing a double-pass strategy. In total, we observe a loss reduction by a factor of two just from optimizing the data preparation. Conclusions: Data preparation is a critical step for fabricating curvilinear designs with smooth sidewalls.

TI Development of Quantum Limited Superconducting Amplifiers for Advanced
   Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Ultralow-noise microwave amplification and detection play a central role in different applications, going from fundamental physics experiments to the deployment of quantum technologies. In many applications the necessity of reading multiple detectors, or cavities or qubits, calls for large bandwidth amplifiers with the lowest possible noise. Current technologies are based on High Electron Mobility Transistors and Josephson Parametric Amplifiers. Both have limitations, the former in terms of the minimum noise, the latter in terms of bandwidth. Superconducting Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) have the potential of offering quantum limited noise and large bandwidth. These amplifiers are based on the parametric amplification of microwaves traveling along a transmission line with embedded nonlinear elements. We are developing superconducting TWPAs based both on Josephson junction arrays (Traveling Wave Josephson Parametric Amplifiers) and on nonlinear kinetic inductance (Dispersion Engineered Traveling Wave Kinetic Inductance Amplifiers). Our goal is to achieve large bandwidth (in the 5 to 10 GHz range), large gain (more than 20 dB), large saturation power (more than -50 dBm), and near quantum limited noise (noise temperature less than 600 mK). Current achievements in the design and development of the high performance TWPAs are here reported and discussed, together with current limitations and possible future developments.

TI Luminescence thermometry based on photon emitters in nanophotonic
   silicon waveguides
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The reliable measurement and accurate control of the temperature within nanophotonic devices is a key prerequisite for their application in both classical and quantum technologies. Established approaches use sensors that are attached in proximity to the components, which only offers a limited spatial resolution and thus impedes the measurement of local heating effects. Here, we, therefore, study an alternative temperature sensing technique that is based on measuring the luminescence of erbium emitters directly integrated into nanophotonic silicon waveguides. To cover the entire temperature range from 295 K to 2 K, we investigate two different approaches: The thermal activation of nonradiative decay channels for temperatures above 200 K and the thermal depopulation of spin and crystal field levels at lower temperatures. The achieved sensitivity is 0.22(4) %/K at room temperature and increases up to 420(50) %/K at approximately 2 K. Within a few-minute measurement interval, we thus achieve a measurement precision that ranges from 0.04(1) K at the lowest studied temperature to 6(1) K at ambient conditions. In the future, the measurement time can be further reduced by optimizing the excitation pulse sequence and the fiber-to-chip coupling efficiency. Combining this with spatially selective implantation promises precise thermometry from ambient to cryogenic temperatures with a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers.

TI Pulse characterization at the single-photon level through chronocyclic
   Q-function measurements
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The characterization of the complex spectral amplitude, that is, the spectrum and spectral phase, of single-photon-level light fields is a crucial capability for modern photonic quantum technologies. Since established pulse characterization techniques are not applicable at low intensities, alternative approaches are required. Here, we demonstrate the retrieval of the complex spectral amplitude of single-photon-level light pulses through measuring their chronocyclic Q-function. Our approach draws inspiration from quantum state tomography by exploiting the analogy between quadrature phase space and time-frequency phase space. In the experiment, we perform time-frequency projections with a quantum pulse gate (QPG), which directly yield the chronocyclic Q-function. We evaluate the complex spectral amplitude from the measured chronocyclic Q-function data with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is the established technique for quantum state tomography. The MLE yields not only an unambigious estimate of the complex spectral amplitude of the state under test that does not require any a priori information, but also allows for, in principle, estimating the spectral-temporal coherence properties of the state. Our method accurately recovers features such as jumps in the spectral phase and is resistant against regions with zero spectral intensity, which makes it immediately beneficial for classical pulse characterization problems.

TI High crosstalk suppression in InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode
   arrays by carrier extraction structure
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Crosstalk has become an urgent issue for single-photon avalanche diode arrays. In previous work, trenches were introduced between pixels to block the crosstalk optical path in planar InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode arrays, since the optical crosstalk was considered as the main crosstalk mechanism. However, the crosstalk suppression effect of this solution is not satisfactory. Here, we demonstrate a carrier extraction structure to efficiently reduce crosstalk by electrically guiding photogenerated crosstalk holes in the non-pixel region to the surface, since we find that the optical-electrical crosstalk is the dominant crosstalk mechanism. Experimental measurements show that a narrow carrier extraction structure makes a 91.52% (96.22%) crosstalk reduction between the nearest neighbor pixels in arrays with 100 (50) mu m pixel pitch, and it does not cause any etching damage. These results reveal the primary source of crosstalk in InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode arrays and provide a practical route to fabricate low-crosstalk, high-pixel-density arrays for use in high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and quantum technologies.
   Opticalelectrical crosstalk, rather than optical crosstalk, is the primary issue in InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode arrays. Here, Tang et al. propose a carrier-extraction structures to replace the trenching method, effectively reducing crosstalk and maintaining device reliability.

TI Near-Field Nanospectroscopy and Mode Mapping of Lead Telluride
   Hoppercubes
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Lead chalcogenides are compelling materials for nanophotonics and optoelectronics due to their high refractive indices, extreme thermo-optic coefficients, and high transparency in the mid-infrared (MIR). In this study, PbTe hoppercubes (HC, face-open box cubes) are synthesized and explored for their MIR resonant characteristics. Single-particle microspectroscopy uncovered deep-subwavelength light localization, with a spectral response dominated by both fundamental and multiple high-order Mie-resonant modes. Nanoimaging mapping using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) reveals that the scattering at the center of the HC is reduced by more than five times compared to the edges. 2D-Hyperspectral scans conducted using a low-power broadband MIR source and nanometer spatial resolutions provided information on the local amplitude and phase-resolved near-fields, including amplitude and phase mapping of higher order modes with measured Q-factors of close to 100. Employing s-SNOM to characterize complex resonant nanophotonic structures holds implications for quantum sensing, IR photodetection, non-linear generation, and ultra-compact high-Q metaphotonics.

TI From Classical Ferroelectricity to Emerging Low-Dimensional Phases
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Ferroelectric materials have historically enabled breakthroughs in a wide range of technologies due to their intrinsic spontaneous polarization and electrically switchable states. While classical oxide perovskites, such as BaTiO3 and Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 laid the foundational understanding of ferroelectric phenomena, recent years have witnessed remarkable progress with the discovery of novel classes of ferroelectrics, including hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, binary oxides such as HfO2, and 2D mono and dichalcogenide materials. These emerging low-dimensional ferroelectrics not only extend the fundamental understanding of polar phenomena but also promise revolutionary device applications in nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, and quantum technologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview, starting from classical polarization mechanisms rooted in phonon instabilities and lattice distortions, and progresses to recently identified ferroelectric phenomena in materials like doped HfO2 and 2D van der Waals crystals In2Se, (Sn,Ge)(S,Se), and (Mo,W,Ta)(S,Se)2. Special attention is given to novel polarization switching mechanisms, domain-wall dynamics, and the coupling between ferroelectricity, topology, and valley physics. The implications of quantum confinement, reduced dimensionality, and structural metastability in these emerging systems are discussed in detail, outlining how these unique properties open new frontiers for future ferroelectric research and technology development.

TI Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atom arrays in free space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) enables the control of light-matter interactions at the singlephoton level, rendering it a key component of many quantum technologies. Its practical realization, however, is complex since it involves placing individual quantum emitters close to mirror surfaces within a high-finesse cavity. In this work, we propose a cavity QED architecture fully based on atoms trapped in free space. In particular, we show that a pair of two-dimensional, ordered arrays of atoms can be described by conventional cavity QED parameters. Such an atom-array cavity exhibits the same cooperativity as a conventional counterpart with matching mirror specifications even though the cavity coupling strength and decay rate are modified by the narrow bandwidth of the atoms. We estimate that an array cavity composed of 87Rb atoms in an optical lattice can reach a cooperativity of about 10. This value can be increased suppressing atomic motion with larger trap depths and may exceed 104 with an ideal placement of the atoms. To reduce the experimental complexity of our scheme, we propose a spatially dependent ac Stark shift as an alternative to curving the arrays, which may be of independent interest. In addition to presenting a promising platform for cavity QED, our work creates opportunities for exploring novel phenomena based on the intrinsic nonlinearity of atom arrays and the possibility to dynamically control them.

TI Experimental observation of non-Abelian topological acoustic semimetals
   and their phase transitions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Topological phases of matter connect mathematical principles to real materials, and may shape future electronic and quantum technologies. So far, this discipline has mostly focused on single-gap topology described by topological invariants such as Chern numbers. Here, based on a tunable kagome model, we observe non-Abelian band topology and its transitions in acoustic semimetals, in which the multi-gap Hilbert space plays a key role. In non-Abelian semimetals, the topological charges of band nodes are converted through the braiding of nodes in adjacent gaps, and their behaviour cannot be captured by conventional topological band theory. Using kagome acoustic metamaterials and pump-probe measurements, we demonstrate the emergence of non-Abelian topological nodes, identify their dispersions and observe the induced multi-gap topological edge states. By controlling the geometry of the metamaterials, topological transitions are induced by the creation, annihilation, merging and splitting of band nodes. This reveals the underlying rules for the conversion and transfer of non-Abelian topological charges in multiple bandgaps. The resulting laws that govern the evolution of band nodes in non-Abelian multi-gap systems should inspire studies on multi-band topological semimetals and multi-gap topological out-of-equilibrium systems.
   Non-Abelian topology allows topological charges in multi-gap systems to be converted by braiding of different band nodes. Such multi-gap effects are experimentally observed in an acoustic semimetal.

TI Quantum Systems Correlated with a Finite Bath: Nonequilibrium Dynamics
   and Thermodynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Describing open quantum systems far from equilibrium is challenging, in particular when the environment is mesoscopic, when it develops nonequilibrium features during the evolution, or when memory effects cannot be disregarded. Here we derive a master equation that explicitly accounts for system-bath correlations and includes, at a coarse-grained level, a dynamically evolving bath. It applies to a wide variety of environments; for instance, those that can be described by random matrix theory or the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We obtain a local detailed balance condition that does not forbid the emergence of stable negative temperature states in unison with the definition of temperature through the Boltzmann entropy. We benchmark the master equation against the exact evolution and observe very good agreement in a situation where the conventional Born-Markov-secular master equation breaks down. The present description of the dynamics is robust and it remains accurate even if some of the assumptions are relaxed. Even though our master equation describes a dynamically evolving bath not described by a Gibbs state, we provide a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework and derive the first and second law as well as the Clausius inequality. Our work paves the way for studying a variety of nanoscale quantum technologies, including engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps, beyond the conventionally used assumption of a static thermal bath.

TI Probing Low-Frequency Charge Noise in Few-Electron CMOS Quantum Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Charge noise is one of the main sources of environmental decoherence for spin qubits in silicon, pre-senting a major obstacle in the path towards highly scalable and reproducible qubit fabrication. Here we demonstrate in-depth characterization of the charge noise environment experienced by a quantum dot in a CMOS-fabricated silicon nanowire. We probe the charge noise for different quantum dot configurations, finding that it is possible to tune the charge noise over two orders of magnitude, ranging from 1 mu eV2/Hz to 100 mu eV2/Hz. In particular, we show that the top interface and the reservoirs are the main sources of charge noise, and their effect can be mitigated by controlling the quantum dot extension. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for the measurement of the charge noise experienced by a quantum dot in the few -electron regime. We measure a comparatively high charge noise value of 40 mu eV2/Hz at the first electron, and demonstrate that the charge noise is highly dependent on the electron occupancy of the quantum dot.

TI Tunable Valley Splitting and Bipolar Operation in Graphene Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum states in graphene are 2-fold degenerate in spins, and 2-fold in valleys. Both degrees of freedom can be utilized for qubit preparations. In our bilayer graphene quantum dots, we demonstrate that the valley g-factor g(v), defined analogously to the spin g-factor g(s) for valley splitting in a perpendicular magnetic field, is tunable by over a factor of 4 from 20 to 90, by gate voltage adjustments only. Larger g(v) results from larger electronic dot sizes, determined from the charging energy. On our versatile device, bipolar operation, charging our quantum dot with charge carriers of the same or the opposite polarity as the leads, can be performed. Dots of both polarities are tunable to the first charge carrier, such that the transition from an electron to a hole dot by the action of the plunger gate can be observed. Addition of gates easily extends the system to host tunable double dots.

TI Room-temperature spin pumping from canted antiferromagnet
   α-Fe2O3
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Spin pumping from canted antiferromagnets is a cutting-edge topic in modern spintronics. The interest for fundamental and applied research that these materials arouse is related to their unusual structure, namely, with a small canting of the magnetic sublattices, which is explained by the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Through this effect, it becomes possible to experimentally study quasi-ferromagnetic resonance spectra and spin pumping in the range of tens of GHz at room temperature. In this paper, an experimental and theoretical investigation of spin pumping from an antiferromagnet with weak ferromagnetism, alpha-Fe2O3, is carried out. The conversion of the precession of the magnetization vector, excited by an alternating magnetic microwave field, into a constant voltage is realized using the inverse spin Hall effect in the hematite/heavy metal structure. Using a constant magnetic field up to 5 kOe, the resonant frequency of such a detector is tunable over a wide range up to 32 GHz with potential sensitivity reaching 10.1 mu V/W. Confirmation of the measurement of the spin current is the change in the sign of V sp when the polarity of the constant magnetic field alters. We believe that these studies will make a major contribution to the understanding of the physics of the spin-pumping effect from antiferromagnets and will also help in the development of devices for quantum technologies and next-generation communication technologies.

TI Exciting High-Frequency Short-Wavelength Spin Waves using High Harmonics
   of a Magnonic Cavity Mode-Revision
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spin waves (SWs) are promising objects for signal processing and future quantum technologies due to their high microwave frequencies with corresponding nanoscale wavelengths. However, the nano-wavelength SWs generated so far are limited to low frequencies. In the paper, using micromagnetic simulations, it is shown that a microwave-pumped SW mode confined to the cavity of a thin film magnonic crystal (MC) can be used to generate waves at tens of GHz and wavelengths well below 50 nm. These multi-frequency harmonics of the fundamental cavity mode are generated when the amplitude of the pumping microwave field exceeds a threshold, and their intensities then scale linearly with the field intensity. The frequency of the cavity mode is equal to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the planar ferromagnetic film, which overlaps with the magnonic bandgap, providing an efficient mechanism for confinement and magnetic field tunability. The effect reaches saturation when the microstrip feed line covers the entire cavity, making the system feasible for realization.
   The microwave pumped spin wave (SW) mode confined to the cavity of a thin film magnonic crystal (MC) is used to generate SWs at high frequency, tens of GHz, and very short wavelengths, well below 50 nm, at two and three times the fundamental cavity mode frequency. image

TI All-optical control of charge-trapping defects in rare-earth doped
   oxides
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Charge-trapping defects in crystalline solids play important roles in applications ranging from microelectronics, optical storage, sensing and quantum technologies. On one hand, depleting trapped charges in the host matrix reduces charge noise and enhances coherence of solid-state quantum emitters. On the other hand, stable charge traps can enable high-density optical storage systems. Here we report all-optical control of charge-trapping defects via optical charge trapping (OCT) spectroscopy of a rare-earth ion doped oxide (Y2O3). Charge trapping is realized by low intensity optical excitation in the 200-375 nm range. Charge detrapping or depletion is carried out by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) under 532 nm stimulation. Using a Pr-doped Y2O3 polycrystalline ceramic host matrix, we observe charging pathways via the inter-band optical absorption of Y2O3 and via the 4f-5d transitions of Pr3+. We demonstrate effective control of the density of trapped charges within the Y2O3 matrix at ambient environment. These results point to a viable method for controlling the local charge environment in rare-earth doped crystals via all-optical means, and pave the way for further development of efficient optical storage technologies with ultrahigh storage capacity, as well as for the localized control of quantum coherence in rare-earth doped solids.

TI Robust quantum engineering of current flow in carbon nanostructures at
   room temperature
SO CARBON
AB Bottom-up on-surface synthesis enables the fabrication of carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. Good examples are graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), 1D conjugated polymers, and nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), which are gathering increasing attention for future carbon nanoelectronics. A key step is the ability to manipulate current flow within these nanomaterials. Destructive quantum interference (QI), long studied in the field of single-molecule electronics, has been proposed as the most effective way to achieve such control with molecularscale precision. However, for practical applications, it is essential that such QI-engineering remains effective near or above room temperature. To assess this important point, here we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and quantum transport calculations and focus our study on NPGs formed as arrays of laterally bonded GNRs. By considering various NPGs with different inter-GNR chemical connections we disentangle the different factors determining electronic transport in these carbon nanomaterials at 300 K. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that QI survives at room temperature, with thermal vibrations weakly restricting current flow along GNRs while completely blocking transport across GNRs. Our results thus pave the way towards the future realization of QI-engineered carbon nanocircuitry operating at room temperature, which is a fundamental step towards carbon-based nanoelectronics and quantum technologies.

TI Can a one-day event trigger interest in quantum physics at the
   university level?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The ongoing second quantum revolution and the growing impact of quantum technologies on our society and economy are making quantum physics education even more important. Consequently, there is a lot of research on quantum physics education for university students and even the general public. However, studying quantum physics or any other topic is primarily voluntary and thus a matter of personal interest-and it can only grow from a seed planted earlier. Here, we describe and test how a one-day event designed to trigger interest and change perceptions about quantum physics among physics and mathematics students at the University of Turku, Finland succeeded in meeting its goals. The data was collected from participants through questionnaires and complementary interviews. We found that the event made attitudes and views toward quantum physics more positive, versatile, and realistic. Although the event was too short to notably or permanently elevate the phase of interest when evaluated externally on a four-level scale, self-evaluations still reported an increased interest for most participants. Thus, it appears that even a short event can cultivate the ground to make it fertile for maintaining and developing interest further, for example, by well-designed and -timed quantum physics curriculum.

TI Time-dependent Gutzwiller simulation of Floquet topological
   superconductivity
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Periodically driven systems provide a novel route to control the topology of quantum materials. In particular, Floquet theory allows an effective band description of periodically-driven systems through the Floquet Hamiltonian. Here, we study the time evolution of d-wave superconductors irradiated with intense circularly-polarized laser light. We consider the Floquet t-J model with time-periodic interactions, and investigate its mean-field dynamics by formulating the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation. We observe the development of the idxy-wave pairing amplitude along with the original dx2-y2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${d}_{{x}<^>{2}-{y}<^>{2}}$$\end{document}-wave order upon gradual increasing of the field amplitude. We further numerically construct the Floquet Hamiltonian for the steady state, with which we identify the system as the fully-gapped d + id superconducting phase with a nonzero Chern number. We explore the low-frequency regime where the perturbative approaches in the previous studies break down, and find that the topological gap of an experimentally-accessible size can be achieved at much lower laser intensities.
   Light-matter interaction provides advanced solutions to engineer quantum phases of matter. The authors unveil the emergence of a topological gap in superconductors when circularly polarized light impinges on the material, thereby disclosing accessible strategies to implement novel quantum technologies.

TI Tuning dipolar and multipolar resonances of chiral silicon
   nanostructures for control of near field superchirality
SO NANOSCALE
AB Chiral materials display a property called optical activity, which is the capability to interact differentially with left and right circularly polarised light. This leads to the ability to manipulate the polarisation state of light, which has a broad range of applications spanning from energy efficient displays to quantum technologies. Both synthesised and engineered chiral nanomaterials are exploited in such devices. The design strategy for optimising the optical activity of a chiral material is typically based on maximising a single parameter, the electric dipole-magnetic dipole response. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach of controlling optical activity by manipulating both the dipole and multipolar response of a nanomaterial. This provides an additional parameter for material design, affording greater flexibility. The exemplar systems used to illustrate the strategy are nanofabricated chiral silicon structures. The multipolar response of the structures, and hence their optical activity, can be controlled simply by varying their height. This phenomenon allows optical activity and the creation of so called superchiral fields, with enhanced asymmetries, to be controlled over a broader wavelength range, than is achievable with just the electric dipole-magnetic dipole response. This work adds to the material design toolbox providing a route to novel nanomaterials for optoelectronics and sensing applications.
   Superchiral resonances of silicon metasurfaces are controlled by manipulation of their excited electric and magnetic multipoles.

TI Interplay between disorder and topology in Thouless pumping on a
   superconducting quantum processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological phases are robust against weak perturbations, but break down when disorder becomes sufficiently strong. However, moderate disorder can also induce topologically nontrivial phases. Thouless pumping, as a (1+1)D counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, is one of the simplest manifestations of topology. Here, we report experimental observations of the competition and interplay between Thouless pumping and disorder on a 41-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We improve a Floquet engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder and show its breakdown as the strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological pumping that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder, respectively. In particular, an intrinsic topological pump that is induced by quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before. Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform for studying various aspects of topological physics in the presence of disorder.

TI Measurement-Induced Transmon Ionization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Despite the high measurement fidelity that can now be reached, the dispersive qubit readout of circuit quantum electrodynamics is plagued by a loss of its quantum nondemolition character and a decrease in fidelity with increased measurement strength. In this work, we elucidate the nature of this dynamical process, which we refer to as transmon ionization. We develop a comprehensive framework which provides a physical picture of the origin of transmon ionization. This framework consists of three complementary levels of descriptions: a fully quantized transmon-resonator model, a semiclassical model where the resonator is treated as a classical drive on the transmon, and a fully classical model. Crucially, all three approaches preserve the full cosine potential of the transmon and lead to similar predictions. This framework identifies the multiphoton resonances responsible for transmon ionization. It also allows one to efficiently compute numerical estimates of the photon number threshold for ionization, which are in remarkable agreement with recent experimental results. The tools developed within this work are both conceptually and computationally simple, and we expect them to become an integral part of the theoretical underpinning of all circuit QED experiments.

TI Asymmetric molecules deposited into micro-SQUID susceptometers: in
   situ characterization of their magnetic integrity
SO NANOSCALE
AB The controlled integration of magnetic molecules into superconducting circuits is key to developing hybrid quantum devices. Herein, we study [Dy-2] molecular dimers deposited into micro-SQUID susceptometers. The results of magnetic, heat capacity and magnetic resonance experiments, backed by theoretical calculations, show that each [Dy-2] dimer fulfills the main requisites to encode a two-spin quantum processor. Arrays of between 2 x 10(8) and 7 x 10(9)[Dy-2] molecules were optimally integrated under ambient conditions inside the 20 mu m wide loops of micro-SQUID sensors by means of dip-pen nanolithography. Equilibrium magnetic susceptibility and phonon-assisted spin tunneling dynamics measured in situ substantiate that these molecules preserve spin ground states, magnetic interactions and magnetic asymmetry that characterize them in bulk. These results show that it is possible to interface multi-qubit molecular complexes with on-chip superconducting circuits without disturbing their relevant properties and suggest the potential of soft nanolithography techniques to achieve this goal.

TI Gaussian continuous-variable isotropic state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Inspired by the definition of the non-Gaussian two-parametric continuous-variable analog of an isotropic state introduced by Mista et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 062315 (2002)], we propose to take the Gaussian part of this state as an independent state by itself, which yields a simple, but with respect to the correlation structure interesting, example of a two-mode Gaussian analog of an isotropic state. Unlike conventional isotropic states which are defined as a convex combination of a thermal and an entangled density operator, the Gaussian version studied here is defined by a convex combination of the corresponding covariance matrices and can be understood as an entangled pure state with additional Gaussian noise controlled by a mixing probability. Using various entanglement criteria and measures, we study the nonclassical correlations contained in this state. Unlike the previously studied non-Gaussian two-parametric isotropic state, the Gaussian state considered here features a finite threshold in the parameter space where entanglement sets in. In particular, it turns out that it exhibits an analogous phenomenology as the finite-dimensional two-qubit isotropic state.

TI Quantum dynamics of a fully blockaded Rydberg atom ensemble
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Classical simulation of quantum systems plays an important role in the study of many -body phenomena and in the benchmarking and verification of quantum technologies. Exact simulation is often limited to small systems because the dimension of the Hilbert space increases exponentially with the size of the system. For systems that possess a high degree of symmetry, however, classical simulation can reach much larger sizes. Here we consider an ensemble of strongly interacting atoms with permutation symmetry, enabling the computation of certain collective observables for hundreds of atoms at arbitrarily long evolution times. The system is realized by an ensemble of three -level atoms, where one of the levels corresponds to a highly excited Rydberg state. In the limit of all -to -all Rydberg blockade, the Hamiltonian is invariant under permutation of the atoms. Using techniques from representation theory, we construct a block -diagonal form of the Hamiltonian, where the size of the largest block increases only linearly with the system size. We apply this formalism to derive efficient pulse sequences to prepare arbitrary permutation -invariant quantum states. Moreover, we study the quantum dynamics following a quench, uncovering a parameter regime in which the system thermalizes slowly and exhibits pronounced revivals. Our results create opportunities for the experimental and theoretical study of large interacting and nonintegrable quantum systems.

TI Smart Cut Transfer of Wide-Bandgap Materials: The Case of Diamond
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Diamond exhibits a unique combination of exceptional properties, making it a highly attractive material for advanced technologies. Yet, these outstanding characteristics come at a cost: Diamond remains difficult to fabricate and is not readily available in large formats. In this context, the well-known Smart Cut layer transfer process-based on ion implantation and annealing-has been adapted for the first time to diamond. Turning a limitation into an advantage, the metastable nature of diamond allows for reducing the thermal budget required for cleavage. By finely tuning the implantation conditions, a buried sp(2)-rich layer can be created to serve as a fracture plane. Using this method, we successfully transfer an similar to 800-nm-thick diamond film onto a silicon substrate via metal bonding. After plasma etching of the residual sp(2)-rich layer, the transferred diamond preserves good crystalline quality, as confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), nanobeam diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. While some implantation-induced point defects remain, they may be mitigated by a post-transfer annealing step. These results show that Smart Cut can be extended to ultrahard and chemically inert materials like diamond. This opens new perspectives for cost-effective, epi-ready diamond substrates on engineered hosts, paving the way for future high-performance electronics and quantum technologies.

TI Prospects and applications of on-chip lasers
SO ELIGHT
AB Integrated silicon photonics has sparked a significant ramp-up of investment in both academia and industry as a scalable, power-efficient, and eco-friendly solution. At the heart of this platform is the light source, which in itself, has been the focus of research and development extensively. This paper sheds light and conveys our perspective on the current state-of-the-art in different aspects of application-driven on-chip silicon lasers. We tackle this from two perspectives: device-level and system-wide points of view. In the former, the different routes taken in integrating on-chip lasers are explored from different material systems to the chosen integration methodologies. Then, the discussion focus is shifted towards system-wide applications that show great prospects in incorporating photonic integrated circuits (PIC) with on-chip lasers and active devices, namely, optical communications and interconnects, optical phased array-based LiDAR, sensors for chemical and biological analysis, integrated quantum technologies, and finally, optical computing. By leveraging the myriad inherent attractive features of integrated silicon photonics, this paper aims to inspire further development in incorporating PICs with on-chip lasers in, but not limited to, these applications for substantial performance gains, green solutions, and mass production.

TI Deep Learning Quantum States for Hamiltonian Estimation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Human experts cannot efficiently access physical information of a quantum many-body states by simply "reading" its coefficients, but have to reply on the previous knowledge such as order parameters and quantum measurements. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) can learn from coefficients of many-body states or reduced density matrices to estimate the physical parameters of the interacting Hamiltonians, such as coupling strengths and magnetic fields, provided the states as the ground states. We propose QubismNet that consists of two main parts: the Qubism map that visualizes the ground states (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that maps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain constraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits impressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin models. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain ranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of the states beyond such training regions. For instance, our results show that QubismNet can estimate the magnetic fields near the critical point by learning from the states away from the critical vicinity. Our work provides a data-driven way to infer the Hamiltonians that give the designed ground states, and therefore would benefit the existing and future generations of quantum technologies such as Hamiltonian-based quantum simulations and state tomography.

TI Catalytic Electron-Driven Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition in Quantum
   Electronic Heterostructures
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Thermodynamic phases of matter are defined by temperature, pressure, and particle number while their changes in solids are known to induce phase transitions. It is demonstrated that in heterostructures with an extra degree of freedom-two different electron pathways across the interface-electron flow creates new thermodynamic phases. Topological insulators (TIs) are used with two distinct electronic states: topological surface and confined insulating bulk states. The electrons can flow from a surface state to a bulk band (Path I) across the interface and vice versa (Path II). By manipulating electron density with light pulses and monitoring electron flow with ultrafast terahertz probes, a new thermodynamic phase of TI is identified with interfacial excitons (Phase II: excitonic TI), distinct from the equilibrium TI state (Phase I: TI). The results indicate that approximate to 3.5 x 1012 electrons (16% of the total) act as catalysts facilitating the transition to Phase II, while 84% (18.5 x 1012 electrons) occupy the new Phase II (excitonic TI). While the study focuses on ultrafast, pathway-selective electron dynamics-beyond the conventional photodoping paradigm-the underlying principle of electron-flow-mediated phase control through interface can be generalized to diverse quantum heterostructures for realizing emergent quantum states and for advancing quantum technologies.

TI Sol-Gel-Synthesized Metal Oxide Nanostructures: Advancements and
   Prospects for Spintronic Applications-A Comprehensive Review
SO GELS
AB Spintronics, an interdisciplinary field merging magnetism and electronics, has attracted considerable interest due to its potential to transform data storage, logic devices, and emerging quantum technologies. Among the materials explored for spintronic applications, metal oxide nanostructures synthesized via sol-gel methods offer a unique combination of low-cost processing, structural tunability, and defect-mediated magnetic control. This comprehensive review presents a critical overview of recent advances in sol-gel-derived magnetic oxides, such as Co-doped ZnO, La1-xSrxMnO3, Fe3O4, NiFe2O4, and transition-metal-doped TiO2, with emphasis on synthesis strategies, the dopant distribution, and room-temperature ferromagnetic behavior. Key spintronic functionalities, including magnetoresistance, spin polarization, and magnetodielectric effects, are systematically examined. Importantly, this review differentiates itself from the prior literature by explicitly connecting sol-gel chemistry parameters to spin-dependent properties and by offering a comparative analysis of multiple oxide systems. Critical challenges such as phase purity, reproducibility, and defect control are also addressed. This paper concludes by outlining future research directions, including green synthesis, the integration with 2D materials, and machine-learning-assisted optimization. Overall, this work bridges sol-gel synthesis and spintronic material design, offering a roadmap for advancing next-generation oxide-based spintronic devices.

TI Theoretical exploration of atomic structure calculation of sodium atom
   confined in the fullerene cage: a primer investigation for EIT
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Alterations in the electronic structural properties of a sodium atom confined inside a fullerene cage are investigated in this manuscript; the engineered atom is explored to suit for the quantum technique applications. A Gaussian annular square well (GASW) model has been used to mimic the fullerene environment. Electronic properties such as energy levels, probabilities, the lifetime of the levels, etc, have been studied for various confinement depths of GASW using the multi-configuration Dirac Hartree-Fock technique. The wavelengths of the D lines of the sodium atom have been shifted from the typical yellow to the blue and then to the ultraviolet region upon confinement. Using the range-shifted blue D lines of the engineered atom, a typical Lambda-type electromagnetically induced transparency configuration is proposed. Furthermore, we have shown the explicit dependency of relevant atomic parameters on the confinement depth, which showcases the tunability to suit the engineered atoms for various applications; for instance, increasing the confinement depth increases the lifetime of 3D5/2 and 3D3/2 states significantly from the typical lifetime value, which has potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Exploring regenerative coupling in phononic crystals for room
   temperature quantum optomechanics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum technologies play a pivotal role in driving transformative advancements across diverse fields, surpassing classical approaches and empowering us to address complex challenges more effectively; however, the need for ultra-low temperatures limits the use of these technologies to particular fields. This work comes to alleviate this problem. We present a way of phononic bandgap engineering using FEM by which the radiative mechanical energy dissipation of a nanomechanical oscillator can be significantly suppressed through coupling with a complementary oscillating mode of a defect of the surrounding phononic crystal (PnC). Applied to an optomechanically coupled nanobeam resonator in the megahertz regime, we find a mechanical quality factor improvement of up to four orders of magnitude compared to conventional PnC designs. As this method is based on geometrical optimization of the PnC and frequency matching of the resonator and defect mode, it is applicable to a wide range of resonator types and frequency ranges. Taking advantage of the, hereinafter referred to as, "regenerative coupling" in phononic crystals, the presented device is capable of reaching f x Q products exceeding 10E16 Hz with only two rows of PnC shield. Thus, stable quantum states with mechanical decoherence times up to 700 mu s at room temperature can be obtained, offering new opportunities for the optimization of mechanical resonator performance and advancing the room temperature quantum field across diverse applications.

TI Lossy SU(1,1) interferometers in the single-photon-pair regime
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The success of quantum technologies is intimately connected to the possibility of using them in real-world applications. This requires the system to be comprehensively modeled including various relevant experimental parameters. To this aim, in this paper, we study the performance of lossy SU(1,1) interferometers in the single-photon pair regime, posing particular attention to the different amount of information contained in the measurement of single counts and of coincidences at the output of the interferometer. To this aim, we derive the classical Fisher information (FI) of both single and coincidence events, and study it as a function of the internal and external losses of the system. Our analysis shows that, in the absence of external losses, the FI of the coincidence events is always higher or equal than the one of single events. On the other hand, in the presence of external losses, the FI of the singles can increase above the one of the coincidences. Moreover, our analysis shows that coincidence measurement can be exploited to partially mitigate the effect of internal losses in the absence of external losses. Finally, comparing SU(1,1) and classical SU(2) interferometers, we find that the former can outperform the classical systems when the internal losses are above 50%.

TI Tuning Magnetic Properties of a Carbon Nanotube-Lanthanide Hybrid
   Molecular Complex through Controlled Functionalization
SO MOLECULES
AB Molecular magnets attached to carbon nanotubes (CNT) are being studied as potential candidates for developing spintronic and quantum technologies. However, the functionalization routes used to develop these hybrid systems can drastically affect their respective physiochemical properties. Due to the complexity of this systems, little work has been directed at establishing the correlation between the degree of functionalization and the magnetic character. Here, we demonstrate the chemical functionalization degree associated with molecular magnet loading can be utilized for controlled tuning the magnetic properties of a CNT-lanthanide hybrid complex. CNT functionalization degree was evaluated by interpreting minor Raman phonon modes in relation to the controlled reaction conditions. These findings were exploited in attaching a rare-earth-based molecular magnet (Gd-DTPA) to the CNTs. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and super conducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements were used to elucidate the variation of magnetic character across the samples. This controlled Gd-DTPA loading on the CNT surface has led to a significant change in the nanotube intrinsic diamagnetism, showing antiferromagnetic coupling with increase in the Weiss temperature with respect to increased loading. This indicates that synthesis of a highly correlated spin system for developing novel spintronic technologies can be realized through a carbon-based hybrid material.

TI Effects of local decoherence on quantum critical metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The diverging responses to parameter variations of systems at quantum critical points motivate schemes of quantum critical metrology (QCM), which feature sub-Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity with the system size (e.g., the number of particles). This sensitivity enhancement by quantum criticality is rooted in the formation of Schrodinger cat states, or macroscopic superposition states at the quantum critical points. The cat states, however, are fragile to decoherence caused by coupling to local environments, since the local decoherence of any particle would cause the collapse of the whole cat state. Therefore, it is unclear whether the sub-Heisenberg scaling of QCM is robust against the local decoherence. Here we study the effects of local decoherence on QCM, using a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as a representative example. We find that the standard quantum limit is recovered by single-particle decoherence. Using renormalization group analysis, we demonstrate that the noise effects on QCM is general and applicable to many universality classes of quantum phase transitions whose low-energy excitations are described by a phi(4) effective field theory. Since in general the many-body entanglement of the ground states at critical points, which is the basis of QCM, is fragile to quantum measurement by local environments, we conjecture that the recovery of the standard quantum limit by local decoherence is universal for QCM using phase transitions induced by the formation of long-range order. This work demonstrates the importance of protecting macroscopic quantum coherence for quantum sensing based on critical behaviors.

TI Photonic heat amplifier based on a disordered semiconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A photonic heat amplifier designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two variable-range-hopping reservoirs connected by lossless lines, which allow them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance, which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, one reservoir is maintained at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other reservoir, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and the drain by adjustment of the gate temperature. We present two different parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulation of the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the modulation of the lower-temperature variable-range-hopping reservoir. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposed photonic heat amplifier addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the millikelvin range, while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and the development of thermal circuits and control devices at subkelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.

TI Optical pumping of electronic quantum Hall states with vortex light
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB A fundamental requirement for quantum technologies is the ability to coherently control the interaction between electrons and photons. However, in many scenarios involving the interaction between light and matter, the exchange of linear or angular momentum between electrons and photons is not feasible, a condition known as the dipole approximation limit. An example of a case beyond this limit that has remained experimentally elusive is when the interplay between chiral electrons and vortex light is considered, where the orbital angular momentum of light can be transferred to electrons. Here we present a mechanism for such an orbital angular momentum transfer from optical vortex beams to electronic quantum Hall states. Specifically, we identify a robust contribution to the radial photocurrent, in an annular graphene sample within the quantum Hall regime, that depends on the vorticity of light. This phenomenon can be interpreted as an optical pumping scheme, where the angular momentum of photons is transferred to electrons, generating a radial current, and the current direction is determined by the vorticity of the light. Our findings offer fundamental insights into the optical probing and manipulation of quantum coherence, with wide-ranging implications for advancing quantum coherent optoelectronics.
   Orbital angular momentum transfer from optical vortex beams to electronic quantum Hall states is reported in a graphene sheet, showing a robust contribution to the radial photocurrent that depends on the vorticity of light.

TI Large magnetic exchange coupling in rhombus-shaped nanographenes with
   zigzag periphery
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Nanographenes with zigzag edges are predicted to manifest non-trivial pi-magnetism resulting from the interplay of concurrent electronic effects, such as hybridization of localized frontier states and Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. This provides a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetism at the nanoscale and opens avenues towards organic spintronics. The magnetic stability in nanographenes is thus far greatly limited by the weak magnetic exchange coupling, which remains below the room-temperature thermal energy. Here, we report the synthesis of large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries on gold and copper surfaces. Single-molecule scanning probe measurements show an emergent magnetic spin singlet ground state with increasing nanographene size. The magnetic exchange coupling in the largest nanographene (C70H22, containing five benzenoid rings along each edge), determined by inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, exceeds 100 meV or 1,160 K, which outclasses most inorganic nanomaterials and survives on a metal electrode.
   Open-shell nanographenes are promising for quantum technologies, but their magnetic stability has remained limited by weak exchange coupling. Now, two large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries, one with 48 carbon atoms and the other with 70, have been synthesized on gold and copper surfaces. The 70-carbon compound exhibits a large magnetic exchange coupling exceeding 100 meV.

TI Quantum Oscillations in Ferromagnetic (Sb, V)2Te3
   Topological Insulator Thin Films
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB An effective way of manipulating 2D surface states in magnetic topological insulators may open a new route for quantum technologies based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The doping-dependent evolution of the electronic band structure in the topological insulator Sb2-xVxTe3 (0 <= x <= 0.102) thin films is studied by means of electrical transport. Sb2-xVxTe3 thin films were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH) oscillations are observed in both the longitudinal and transverse transport channels. Doping with the 3d element, vanadium, induces long-range ferromagnetic order with enhanced SdH oscillation amplitudes. The doping effect is systematically studied in various films depending on thickness and bottom gate voltage. The angle-dependence of the SdH oscillations reveals their 2D nature, linking them to topological surface states as their origin. Furthermore, it is shown that vanadium doping can efficiently modify the band structure. The tunability by doping and the coexistence of the surface states with ferromagnetism render Sb2-xVxTe3 thin films a promising platform for energy band engineering. In this way, topological quantum states may be manipulated to crossover from quantum Hall effect to quantum anomalous Hall effect, which opens an alternative route for the design of quantum electronics and spintronics.

TI Sensitivity and Contrast Characterization of PMMA 950K Resist Under 30
   keV Focused Ga+ Ion Beam Exposure
SO MICROMACHINES
AB In this study, the key lithographic performance of PMMA 950K resist was evaluated by exposure to a 30 keV focused gallium (Ga+) ion beam. The sensitivity and contrast of PMMA 950K were directly compared with those of electron exposure under identical development conditions. It was found that the sensitivity of PMMA 950K to Ga+ ions for 50 nm films reaches a value of about 0.4 mu C/cm(2), which is more than 250 times higher than its sensitivity to electron exposure. A method for evaluating the resist contrast during ion exposure is proposed in this work, taking into account the highly non-uniform dose distribution across the resist depth; it yielded a contrast value of gamma = 2.6, which is consistent with the result obtained with electron exposure (gamma = 2.8). In addition, a pronounced dependence of the resist sensitivity on the resist thickness was found: with an increase in thickness from 10 nm to 60 nm the sensitivity decreases by an order of magnitude. The obtained results form a reliable methodological basis for characterizing the behavior of polymer resists under ion irradiation and provide valuable recommendations for optimizing lithography with a focused beam of Ga+ ions when creating nanostructures for microelectronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.

TI Strain activation of localized states in WSe2
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe2 on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence peaks in the regions 1.62-1.68 eV and 1.70-1.73 eV characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few mu N and generally red-shift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (T <60 degrees C), WSe2 experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blue shift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.

TI Element-specific X-Ray detection of electron paramagnetic resonance in
   thin films of quantum bits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Element-specific magnetism accessible by synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy has proven to be valuable to study spin and orbital moments of transition metals and lanthanides in technologically relevant thin-film and monolayer samples. The access to coherent spin superposition states relevant for emergent quantum technologies remains, however, elusive with ordinary X-ray spectroscopy. Here, we approach the study of such quantum-coherent states via the X-ray detection of microwave-driven electron paramagnetic resonance, which involves much smaller signal levels than X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance on classical magnets. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with thin films of phthalocyanine-based metal complexes containing copper or vanadium centers. We also identify X-ray specific phenomena that we relate to charge trapping of secondary electrons resulting from the decay of the X-ray excited core-hole state. Our findings pave the way toward the element-specific X-ray detection of coherent superposition states in monolayers of atomic and molecular spins on virtually arbitrary surfaces.
   Synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study element-specific magnetism. Here, X-ray detected paramagnetic resonance on molecular quantum bit candidates is demonstrated, paving the way toward the element-specific detection of coherently excited spin superposition states.

TI Physics mechanisms underlying the optimization of coherent heat transfer
   across width-modulated nanowaveguides with calculations and machine
   learning
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Optimization of heat transfer at the nanoscale is necessary for efficient modern technology applications in nanoelectronics, energy conversion, and quantum technologies. In such applications, phonons dominate thermal transport and optimal performance requires minimum phonon conduction. Coherent phonon conduction is minimized by maximum disorder in the aperiodic modulation profile of width-modulated nanowaveguides, according to a physics rule. It is minimized for moderate disorder against physics intuition in composite nanostructures. Such counter behaviors call for a better understanding of the optimization of phonon transport in non-uniform nanostructures. We have explored mechanisms underlying the optimization of width-modulated nanowaveguides with calculations and machine learning, and we report on generic behavior. We show that the distribution of the thermal conductance among the aperiodic width-modulation configurations is controlled by the modulation degree irrespective of choices of constituent material, width-modulation-geometry, and composition constraints. The efficiency of Bayesian optimization is evaluated against increasing temperature and sample size. It is found that it decreases with increasing temperature due to thermal broadening of the thermal conductance distribution. It shows weak dependence on temperature in samples with high discreteness in the distribution spectrum. Our work provides new physics insight and indicates research pathways to optimize heat transfer in non-uniform nanostructures.

TI Generalized approach to quantum interference in lossy N-port
   devices via a singular value decomposition
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Modeling quantum interference in the presence of dissipation is a critical aspect of quantum technologies. Including dissipation into the model of a linear device enables for assessing the detrimental impact of photon loss, as well as for studying dissipation-driven quantum state transformations. However, establishing the input-output relations characterizing quantum interference at a general lossy N-port network poses important theoretical challenges. Here, we propose a general procedure based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows for the efficient calculation of the input-output relations for any arbitrary lossy linear device. In addition, we show how the SVD provides an intuitive description of the principle of operation of linear optical devices. We illustrate the applicability of our method by evaluating the input-output relations of popular reciprocal and non-reciprocal lossy linear devices, including devices with singular and nilpotent scattering matrices. Our method also enables the analysis of quantum interference in large lossy networks, as we exemplify with the study of an N-port epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) hub. We expect that our procedure will motivate future research on quantum interference in complex devices, as well as the realistic modelling of photon loss in linear lossy devices.

TI Frequency fluctuations of ferromagnetic resonances at millikelvin
   temperatures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Unwanted fluctuations over time, in short, noise, are usually detrimental to device performance, especially for quantum coherent circuits. Recent efforts have demonstrated routes to utilizing magnon systems for quantum technologies by interfacing single magnons with superconducting qubits. However, the coupling of several components often introduces additional noise to the system, hence degrading its coherence. Researching the system's temporal behavior can help us to identify the underlying noise sources, which is a vital step toward improving coherence times and hybrid device performance. Yet, the frequency noise of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) has so far been unexplored at mK-temperatures. Here, we investigate such FMR frequency fluctuations of a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere and find that these fluctuations are independent of temperature and drive power. This suggests that the measured frequency noise in YIG is dominated by undetermined noise sources, whose properties are not consistent with the conventional model of two-level systems, despite their effect on the sample linewidth. Moreover, the functional form of the FMR frequency noise power spectral density (PSD) cannot be described by a simple power law. By employing time-series analysis, we find a closed function for the PSD that fits the observations. Our results underline the necessity of coherence improvements to magnon systems for useful applications in quantum magnonics. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Effects of Thermal Oxidation and Proton Irradiation on Optically
   Detected Magnetic Resonance Sensitivity in Sub-100 nm Nanodiamonds
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB In recent decades, nanodiamonds (NDs) have emerged as innovative nanotools for weak magnetic fields and small temperature variation sensing, especially in biological systems. At the basis of the use of NDs as quantum sensors are nitrogen-vacancy center lattice defects, whose electronic structures are influenced by the surrounding environment and can be probed by the optically detected magnetic resonance technique. Ideally, limiting the NDs' size as much as possible is important to ensure higher biocompatibility and provide higher spatial resolution. However, size reduction typically worsens the NDs' sensing properties. This study endeavors to obtain sub-100 nm NDs suitable to be used as quantum sensors. Thermal processing and surface oxidations were performed to purify NDs and control their surface chemistry and size. Ion irradiation techniques were also employed to increase the concentration of the nitrogen-vacancy centers. The impact of these processes was explored in terms of surface chemistry (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), structural and optical properties (Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy), dimension variation (atomic force microscopy measurements), and optically detected magnetic resonance temperature sensitivity. Our results demonstrate how surface optimization and defect density enhancement can reduce the detrimental impact of size reduction, opening to the possibility of minimally invasive high-performance sensing of physical quantities in biological environments with nanoscale spatial resolution.

TI Quantum Secure Undeniable Signature for Blockchain-Enabled Cold-Chain
   Logistics System
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Data security and user privacy are two main security concerns in the cold-chain logistics system (CCLS). Many security issues exist in traditional CCLS, destroying data security and user privacy. The digital signature can provide data verification and identity authentication based on the mathe-matical difficulty problem for logistics data sharing in CCLS. This paper first established a blockchain-enabled cold-chain logistics system (BCCLS) based on union blockchain technology, which can provide secure data sharing among different logistics nodes and guarantee logistics data security with the untampered blockchain ledger. Meanwhile, a lattice-based undeniable signature scheme is designed to strengthen the security of logistics data and user privacy against quantum attacks. This scheme is based on the lattice assumption, which can provide anti-quantum security for BCCLS in the future quantum computer age. It also establishes the undeniable mechanism that guarantees that the actual signer cannot deny a valid signature. Then, security proof shows that this undeniable signature scheme is correct and safe, and an efficiency comparison shows that it is more efficient than other schemes in similar literature. The performance evaluations of transaction throughput and latency show that the proposed BCCLS is efficient and practical. This work can improve the security and efficiency of logistics data management and promote the reform and development of the logistics industry.

TI Photonic spin Hall effect using bilayer graphene in nano-optomechanical
   cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a theoretical model to obtain the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in an optomechanical nanocavity using a graphene bilayer as the intracavity medium. In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right-and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field, and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is nonzero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.

TI Topological Polaritonic Metamaterials Realized in Bulk Transition Metal
   Dichalcogenide Crystals
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Due to the enhanced nature of the interactions of light with quantum excitations, topological polaritonic (TP) systems form a unique platform that offers on-chip control over half-light, half-matter excitations via synthetic degrees of freedom. Among other polaritonic platforms, van der Waals materials (vdW) have recently attracted significant interest due to the relative simplicity of their integration into topological photonic structures. Several TP insulators based on vdW materials have been demonstrated; however, they rely on hybrid structures with nanopatterned dielectric substrates, which limit the strength of light-matter interactions. Here, a monolithic all-vdW TP insulator based on bulk crystals of transition metal dichalcogenide WS2 is designed and experimentally realized. Due to their high refractive index and the presence of exciton modes, these nanomaterials prove to be excellent platforms for TPs, offering both excellent confinement and strong light-matter interactions in monolithic structures. The emergence of TP boundary modes is confirmed by Fourier and real-space imaging, and a dramatic reduction in dissipation is observed at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed monolithic all-vdW topological insulators, which are characterized by extreme confinement of optical fields and moderate losses, can serve as an alternative to silicon photonics-based systems in the quest for the development of polaritonic quantum technologies.

TI Inhomogeneous broadening in the time domain
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Forty-five years after the initial attempts - first by Efimov-Khitrov in 1979, then by Brendel-Bormann in 1992 - we present a comprehensive, causal, and physically consistent framework for modeling the dielectric function with inhomogeneous (non-Lorentzian) broadening, where scattering becomes frequency- or time-dependent. This theoretical framework is based on spectral diffusion, described in the frequency domain by a complex probability density function and in the time domain by a matching characteristic function. The proposed approach accurately models the lineshapes resulting from multiple broadening mechanisms and enables the retrieval of intrinsic homogeneous linewidths as well as inhomogeneous disorder-controlled material dispersion features. To implement the new general dispersion function in time-domain Maxwell solvers, we have designed a constrained minimax-based semi-analytical approximation method (MiMOSA) that generates the shortest possible numerical stencils for a given approximation error. Application examples of exact and approximate MiMOSA models include the Gauss-Lorentz oscillator, Gauss-Debye relaxation, and Gauss-Drude conductivity. Although this study primarily focuses on the optical domain, the resulting models, which account for the Doppler shift, are equally applicable to other wave propagation phenomena in disordered dispersive media in a broad range of areas, including acoustics, magnonics, astrophysics, seismology, plasma, and quantum technologies.

TI Resonance Fluorescence from a Single Quantum Dot in a Nanopost Optical
   Cavity
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Scaling-up photonic quantum technologies will require the parallel operation of on-demand sources of identical single photons. In this context, broadband photonic structures embedding a single quantum dot (QD) are particularly appealing, as optimal source performance can be maintained upon QD spectral tuning. The nanopost-a nanocavity built with a segment of photonic wire-offers a broadband Purcell effect and a directive output beam. So far, however, QD-nanopost devices were only characterized using nonresonant optical excitation. Here, we employ a continuous wave laser to resonantly drive a single QD in a nanopost and detect its resonance fluorescence. Even though the nanopost introduces a significant optical roughness at the scale of the focused laser spot, a cross-polarization scheme leads to an excellent rejection of the excitation laser. We extensively characterize the QD optical emission by combining linescans and intensity correlation measurements, which are jointly analyzed with an analytical model. The emission features a pronounced antibunching (g (2)(0) = 0.02), close to the one of an ideal two-level system. For small driving powers, the homogeneous (total) spectral linewidth is a factor of 1.4 (5) above the Fourier limit. Combined with future device improvements, these results mark an important step toward the realization of bright and widely tunable sources of indistinguishable single photons.

TI Enhancing Nonlinear Interactions by the Superposition of Plasmonic
   Lattices on χ(2)-Nonlinear Photonic Crystals
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Plasmonic structures have been revealed as efficient units to enhance localized nonlinear phenomena generated at dielectric-metal interfaces. However, their effect on the nonlinear interactions provided by quasi-phase matching processes in AP modulated dielectric crystals have been scarcely addressed, mainly due to the complexity in manufacturing appropriate periodic plasmonic structures overlying the chi((2)) dielectric structure. Here, by a simple method we have fabricated a periodic structure based on the combination of two commensurate lattices: a periodic lattice of chains of Ag nanoparticles and a periodic lattice of chi((2))-modulation based on a ferroelectric domains structure. The hybrid system supports multiple surface plasmon lattice resonances (SLRs) at the technologically relevant NIR spectral region, which yield the enhancement of the nonlinear diffraction pattern generated by the chi((2)) structure. The superposition of the plasmonic and the chi((2))-modulation lattice results in a 20-fold enhancement of the directional SHG due to the excitation of SLRs by the interacting waves involved in the nonlinear process. The results are obtained in lithium niobate, a widely used crystal in optoelectronics, and demonstrate the potential of the approach to design integrated solid-state platforms for on-chip optical steering, multiplexing or quantum technologies.

TI A nanowire optical nanocavity for broadband enhancement of spontaneous
   emission
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB To deliver an optimal performance for photonic quantum technologies, semiconductor quantum dots should be integrated in a carefully designed photonic structure. Here, we introduce a nanowire optical nanocavity designed for free-space emission. Thanks to its ultrasmall mode volume, this simple structure offers a large acceleration of spontaneous emission (predicted Purcell factor of 6.3) that is maintained over a 30-nm bandwidth. In addition, a dielectric screening effect strongly suppresses the emission into the 3D continuum of radiation modes. The fraction of spontaneous emission funneled into the cavity mode reaches 0.98 at resonance and exceeds 0.95 over a 100-nm spectral range. Close-to-optimal collection efficiency is maintained over an equivalent bandwidth and reaches a predicted value of 0.54 at resonance for a first lens with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.75. As a first experimental demonstration of this concept, we fabricate an Au-SiO2-GaAs device embedding isolated InAs quantum dots. We measure a maximal acceleration of spontaneous emission by a factor as large as 5.6 and a bright quantum dot emission (collection efficiency of 0.35 into NA=0.75). This nanowire cavity constitutes a promising building block to realize advanced sources of quantum light for a broad range of material systems.

TI Quantum spin liquid candidate as superior refrigerant in cascade
   demagnetization cooling
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The quantum spin liquid (QSL) states with no long-range magnetic order even down to zero temperature have recently raised intensive research interest. Here we propose that the spin frustration characteristic of the QSL candidates also make them superior magnetocaloric materials that exhibit prominent cooling effect, especially near the quantum critical points. By simulating the highly frustrated kagome and triangular lattice models, we reveal a significant magnetothermal pumping effect when combing quantum magnets with paramagnetic salts, which can be exploited to design a high-performance cascade demagnetization refrigerator. Moreover, with realistic magnetic compounds YbAlO3 and Na2BaCo(PO4)(2), we find a giant enhancement in the cooling capacity characterized by a great increment rate, e.g., more than 200% when working between 3 K heat sink and 30 mK load. Our work thus paves a promising and viable way for the quantum spin cooling to promote the helium-free refrigeration useful in space applications and quantum technologies.
   Quantum spin liquids are a series of materials which exhibit an absence of magnetic order down to absolute zero and may have applications for data storage and memory. Here, using numerical simulations, the authors propose that the magnetic frustration in a quantum spin liquid may also lead to pronounced magnetocaloric effects near the quantum critical point with potential application as materials for refrigerants.

TI Superconductivity in Hourglass Dirac Chain Metals (Ti, Hf)IrGe
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Realizing superconductivity in stoichiometric topological materials is a major focus in condensed matter physics, as it paves the way to achieve topological superconductivity. Here, it is reported that the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, MIrGe (M = Ti, Hf), predicted to exhibit non-symmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains, can be prime candidates for topological superconductivity. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation (mu SR) measurements, these materials are established as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in MIrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain - a ring of fourfold - degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead - like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states suggests MIrGe as a rare platform to achieve topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.

TI A subwavelength atomic array switched by a single Rydberg atom
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Enhancing light-matter coupling at the level of single quanta is essential for numerous applications in quantum science. The cooperative optical response of subwavelength atomic arrays has been found to open new pathways for such strong light-matter couplings, while simultaneously offering access to multiple spatial modes of the light field. Efficient single-mode free-space coupling to such arrays has been reported, but spatial control over the modes of outgoing light fields has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such spatial control over the optical response of an atomically thin mirror formed by a subwavelength array of atoms in free space using a single controlled ancilla atom excited to a Rydberg state. The switching behaviour is controlled by the admixture of a small Rydberg fraction to the atomic mirror, and consequently strong dipolar Rydberg interactions with the ancilla. Driving Rabi oscillations on the ancilla atom, we demonstrate coherent control of the transmission and reflection of the array. These results represent a step towards the realization of quantum coherent metasurfaces, the demonstration of controlled atom-photon entanglement and deterministic engineering of quantum states of light.
   The realization of efficient light-matter interfaces is important for many quantum technologies. An experiment now shows how to coherently switch the collective optical properties of an array of quantum emitters by driving a single ancilla atom to a Rydberg state.

TI Efficient Biexciton State Preparation in a Semiconductor Quantum Dot
   Coupled to a Metal Nanoparticle with Linearly Chirped Gaussian Pulses
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We consider a hybrid nanostructure composed of a semiconductor quantum dot placed near a spherical metallic nanoparticle, and study the effect of the nanoparticle on the population transferral from the ground to the biexciton state of the quantum dot, when using linearly chirped Gaussian pulses. For various values of the system parameters (biexciton energy shift, pulse area and chirp, interparticle distance), we calculate the final population of the biexciton state by performing numerical simulations of the non-linear density matrix equations which describe the coupled system, as well as its interaction with the applied electromagnetic field. We find that for relatively large values of the biexciton energy shift and not very small interparticle distances, the presence of the nanoparticle improves the biexciton state preparation, since it effectively increases the area of the applied pulse. For smaller biexciton energy shifts and smaller distances between the quantum dot and the nanoparticle, the performance is, in general, degraded. However, even in these cases we can still find ranges of parameter values where the population transfer to the biexciton state is accomplished with high fidelity, when using linearly chirped Gaussian pulses. We anticipate that our results may be exploited for the implementation of novel nanoscale photonic devices or future quantum technologies.

TI First-Principles Investigation of Excited-State Lattice Dynamics and
   Mechanical Properties in Diamond
SO MICROMACHINES
AB The study of the excited-state properties of diamond is crucial for understanding its electronic structure and surface physicochemical properties, providing theoretical support for its applications in optoelectronic devices, quantum technologies, and catalysis. This research employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the fixed electron occupation method to simulate the electron excitation. Using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) within DFT, we systematically investigated the excited-state characteristics of diamond by simulating the transfer of a fraction of electrons from the Highest Occupied Crystal Orbital (HOCO) to the Lowest Unoccupied Crystal Orbital (LUCO). Theoretical calculations indicate that with increasing electron excitation levels, the diamond crystal structure transitions from cubic to tetragonal, accompanied by a gradual decrease in the bandgap. Mechanical property analysis reveals that both Young's modulus and shear modulus decrease with increasing excitation rate, while the bulk modulus remains nearly constant. These findings indicate a significant impact of electronic excitation on the mechanical stability of diamond. Phonon dispersion curves exhibit reduced degeneracy in high-frequency optical branches and a marked decrease in crystal symmetry upon excitation. This study not only advances the understanding of diamond's excited-state properties but also offers valuable theoretical insights into its structural evolution and performance tuning under such extreme conditions.

TI Witnessing Wigner Negativity
SO QUANTUM
AB Negativity of the Wigner function is arguably one of the most striking non-classical features of quantum states. Beyond its fundamental relevance, it is also a necessary resource for quantum speedup with continuous variables. As quantum technologies emerge, the need to identify and characterize the resources which provide an advantage over existing classical technologies becomes more pressing. Here we derive witnesses for Wigner negativity of single mode and multimode quantum states, based on fidelities with Fock states, which can be reliably measured using standard detection setups. They possess a threshold expectation value indicating whether the measured state has a negative Wigner function. Moreover, the amount of violation provides an operational quantification of Wigner negativity. We phrase the problem of finding the threshold values for our witnesses as an infinite-dimensional linear optimisation. By relaxing and restricting the corresponding linear programs, we derive two hierarchies of semidefinite programs, which provide numerical sequences of increasingly tighter upper and lower bounds for the threshold values. We further show that both sequences converge to the threshold value. Moreover, our witnesses form a complete family-each Wigner negative state is detected by at least one witness-thus providing a reliable method for experimentally witnessing Wigner negativity of quantum states from few measurements. From a foundational perspective, our findings provide insights on the set of positive Wigner functions which still lacks a proper characterisation.

TI Reinforcement Learning Enabled Nanophotonic Devices
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Controlling multiple degrees of freedom of light in a small-footprint with high-efficiency in a foundry-manufacturable platform is foundational for a range of classical and quantum technologies. Achieving this requires photonic design strategies that go beyond traditional physical intuition-based methods. Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine learning, is successful in achieving optimum outcomes in dynamically evolving environments, e.g., in strategy games or self-driving cars. Here, a novel paradigm based on reinforcement learning is presented for photonic device design, and multifunctional metasurface optics and integrated photonic devices operating in the visible are realized. RL-based metasurface optics operating at free-space wavelengths of 461 and 689 nm designed are fabricated and experimentally characterized to simultaneously deflect input light at large deflection angles and maintain or change its polarization. Further, the RL approach is used to design in-plane integrated photonic devices such as bends, mode-converters, wavelength demultiplexers, and beamsplitters, as well as waveguide-coupled grating out-couplers to both control the angle of the out-of-plane beam emission and polarization at visible wavelengths on a silicon nitride platform. The results, targeting a two-color strontium magneto-optical trap for the realization of a portable, alignment-free optical lattice clock, elucidate the potential of reinforcement learning for the design of high-performance optics.

TI Magnetic Anisotropy in 2D van der Waals Magnetic Materials and their
   Heterostructures: Importance, Mechanisms, and Opportunities
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB 2D magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) monolayers and heterostructures has attracted significant attention due to its promising potential for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. A key factor in stabilizing long-range magnetic order in these systems is magnetic anisotropy, which plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This review provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental overview of the importance of magnetic anisotropy in enabling intrinsic 2D magnetism and shaping the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW materials. It begins by summarizing the fundamental mechanisms that determine magnetic anisotropy, emphasizing the contributions from strong ligand spin-orbit coupling of ligand atoms and unquenched orbital magnetic moments. A range of material engineering approaches is then examined, including alloying, doping, electrostatic gating, strain, and pressure, that have been employed to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Finally, open challenges and promising future directions in this rapidly advancing field are discussed. By presenting a broad perspective on the role of magnetic anisotropy in 2D magnetism, this review aims to stimulate ongoing efforts and new ideas toward the realization of robust, room-temperature applications based on 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures.

TI Precise quantum control of molecular rotation toward a desired
   orientation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The lack of a direct map between control fields and desired control objectives poses a significant challenge in applying quantum control theory to quantum technologies. Here, we propose an analytical framework to precisely control a limited set of quantum states and construct desired coherent superpositions using a well-designed laser pulse sequence with optimal amplitudes, phases, and delays. This theoretical framework that corresponds to a multilevel pulse-area theorem establishes a straightforward mapping between the control parameters of the pulse sequence and the amplitudes and phases of rotational states within a specific subspace. As an example, we utilize this approach to generate 15 distinct and desired rotational superpositions of ultracold polar molecules, leading to 15 desired field-free molecular orientations. By optimizing the superposition of the lowest 16 rotational states, we demonstrate that this approach can achieve a maximum orientation value of |(cos theta)|max above 0.99, which is very close to the global optimal value of 1 that could be achieved in an infinite-dimensional state space. This work marks a significant advancement in achieving precise control over multilevel subsystems within molecules. It holds potential applications in molecular alignment and orientation, as well as in various interdisciplinary fields related to the precise quantum control of ultracold polar molecules, opening up considerable opportunities in molecular-based quantum techniques.

TI Orbital selective Kondo effect in heavy fermion superconductor
   UTe2
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Heavy fermion systems emerge from the collective Kondo effect, and their superconductivity can serve as a promising platform for realizing next-generation quantum technologies. However, it has been a great challenge to explore many-body effects in heavy fermion systems with ab-initio approaches. We computed the electronic structure of UTe2 without purposive judgements, such as intentional selection of on-site Coulomb interaction and disregarding spin-orbit coupling. We show that U-5f electrons are highly localized in the paramagnetic normal state, giving rise to the Kondo effect. It is also found that the hybridization between U-5f and U-6d predominantly in the orthorhombic ab-plane is responsible for the high-temperature Kondo effect. In contrast, the hybridization between U-5f and Te-5p along the c-axis manifests the Kondo scattering at a much lower temperature, which could be responsible for the low-temperature upturn of the c-axis resistivity. Our results show that the electron correlation in UTe2 is orbital selective, which naturally elucidates the recent experimental observations of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity. Furthermore, we suggest that the Kondo effect is suppressed at high pressure owing to weak localization of magnetic moments, which results from enhanced U-5f electron hopping. Our discovery provides significant insight toward understanding anisotropic quantum behavior including selective re-entrant superconductivity in heavy fermion UTe2.

TI Multimode optomechanics with a two-dimensional optomechanical crystal
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Chip-scale multimode optomechanical systems have unique benefits for sensing, metrology, and quantum technologies relative to their single-mode counterparts. Slot-mode optomechanical crystals enable sideband resolution and large optomechanical couplings of a single optical cavity to two microwave-frequency mechanical modes. Still, previous implementations have been limited to nanobeam geometries, whose effective quantum cooperativity at ultralow temperatures is limited by their low thermal conductance. In this work, we design and experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional mechanical-optical-mechanical (MOM) platform that dispersively couples a slow-light slot-guided photonic-crystal waveguide mode and two slow-sound similar to 7 GHz phononic wire modes localized in physically distinct regions. We first demonstrate optomechanical interactions in long waveguide sections, unveiling acoustic group velocities below 800 m/s, and then move on to mode-gap adiabatic heterostructure cavities with a tailored mechanical frequency difference. Through optomechanical spectroscopy, we demonstrate optical quality factors Q similar to 10(5), vacuum optomechanical coupling rates, g(o)/2 pi, of 1.5 MHz, and dynamical back-action effects beyond the single-mode picture. At a larger power and adequate laser-cavity detuning, we demonstrate regenerative optomechanical oscillations involving a single mechanical mode, extending to both mechanical modes through modulation of the input laser drive at their frequency difference. This work constitutes an important advance toward engineering MOM systems with nearly degenerate mechanical modes as part of hybrid multipartite quantum systems.

TI Photolithography-compatible three-terminal superconducting switch for
   driving CMOS loads
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting devices have enabled breakthrough performance in quantum sensing and ultralowpower computing. Nevertheless, the need for a cryoelectronics platform that can interface superconductor electronics with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices has become increasingly evident in many cutting-edge applications. In this work, we present a three-terminal micrometer-wide superconducting-wire-based cryotron switch (wTron), fabricated using photolithography, that can directly interface with CMOS electronics. The wTron features an output impedance exceeding 1 kQ and exhibits reduced sensitivity to ambient magnetic noise, similar to its nanoscale predecessor, the nanocryotron. In addition, its micrometer-wide wires support switching currents in the milliamp range, making it well suited to driving current-hungry resistive loads and highly capacitive CMOS loads. We demonstrate this capability by using the wTron to drive room-temperature CMOS electronics, including a light-emitting diode and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) with a gate capacitance of 500 pF. We then examine the optimal design parameters required for wTrons to drive CMOS loads, such as MOSFETs, high-electron mobility transistors, and electro-optic modulators. Furthermore, to demonstrate the foundry readiness of the wTron, we fabricate wTrons using MIT Lincoln Laboratory's SFQ5ee superconducting process and characterize their switching behavior. Our work shows that the wTron will facilitate the interface between superconductor electronics and CMOS devices, thereby paving the way for the development of foundry-compatible cryoelectronic ecosystems to advance next-generation computing and quantum applications.

TI Sub-kilohertz linewidth free-running monolithic cavity VECSEL with
   10-12 stability
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report the development of a compact, highly stable, monolithic-cavity, GaInP/AlGaInP-based vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) with electronically tunable emission wavelength centered at 689.4425 nm for neutral strontium (Sr)-based applications. The output power reaches 40 mW (pump-power-limited) with ultra-low frequency and intensity noise performance resulting in a free-running linewidth of 720 Hz, reduced to 390 Hz when frequency locked to a reference cavity and verified via a heterodyne beat note measurement with 2 s averaging time. For shorter averaging times (0.1 ms), the free-running linewidth is as low as 40 Hz. We estimate a Lorentzian, or intrinsic, linewidth of 64 mHz from the frequency noise power spectral density at high frequencies, thus providing further evidence of the ultra-narrow fundamental linewidth of VECSELs. High frequency stability was measured via Allan deviation resulting in 1.05 x 10(-12) at 2 s and 2.11 x 10(-13) at 7 s averaging times when the 689 nm monolithic cavity VECSEL is free-running and locked, respectively, suitable for neutral Sr-based quantum technologies, such as optical clocks and atom interferometry.

TI Coherent interaction of atoms with a beam of light confined in a light
   cage
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Controlling coherent interaction between optical fields and quantum systems in scalable, integrated platforms is essential for quantum technologies. Miniaturised, warm alkali-vapour cells integrated with on-chip photonic devices represent an attractive system, in particular for delay or storage of a single-photon quantum state. Hollow-core fibres or planar waveguides are widely used to confine light over long distances enhancing light-matter interaction in atomic-vapour cells. However, they suffer from inefficient filling times, enhanced dephasing for atoms near the surfaces, and limited light-matter overlap. We report here on the observation of modified electromagnetically induced transparency for a non-diffractive beam of light in an on-chip, laterally-accessible hollow-core light cage. Atomic layer deposition of an alumina nanofilm onto the light-cage structure was utilised to precisely tune the high-transmission spectral region of the light-cage mode to the operation wavelength of the atomic transition, while additionally protecting the polymer against the corrosive alkali vapour. The experiments show strong, coherent light-matter coupling over lengths substantially exceeding the Rayleigh range. Additionally, the stable non-degrading performance and extreme versatility of the light cage provide an excellent basis for a manifold of quantum-storage and quantum-nonlinear applications, highlighting it as a compelling candidate for all-on-chip, integrable, low-cost, vapour-based photon delay.

TI Probing Vibrational Symmetry Effects and Nuclear Spin Economy Principles
   in Molecular Spin Qubits
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The selection of molecular spin qubits with a long coherence time, T-m, is a central task for implementing moleculebased quantum technologies. Even if a sufficiently long T-m can be achieved through an efficient synthetic strategy and ad hoc experimental measurement procedures, many factors contributing to the loss of coherence still need to be thoroughly investigated and understood. Vibrational properties and nuclear spins of hydrogens are two of them. The former plays a paramount role, but a detailed theoretical investigation aimed at studying their effects on the spin dynamics of molecular complexes such as the benchmark phthalocyanine (Pc) is still missing, whereas the effect of the latter deserves to be examined in detail for such a class of compounds. In this work, we adopted a combined theoretical and experimental approach to investigate the relaxation properties of classical [Cu(Pc)] and a Cu-II complex based on the ligand tetrakis(thiadiazole)porphyrazine (H(2)TTDPz), characterized by a hydrogen-free molecular structure. Systematic calculations of molecular vibrations exemplify the effect of normal modes on the spin-lattice relaxation process, unveiling a different contribution to T-1 depending on the symmetry of normal modes. Moreover, we observed that an appreciable T-m enhancement could be achieved by removing hydrogens from the ligand.

TI Mapping propagation of collective modes in Bi2Se3
   and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 topological
   insulators by near-field terahertz nanoscopy
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Near-field microscopy discloses a peculiar potential to explore novel quantum state of matter at the nanoscale, providing an intriguing playground to investigate, locally, carrier dynamics or propagation of photoexcited modes as plasmons, phonons, plasmon-polaritons or phonon-polaritons. Here, we exploit a combination of hyperspectral time domain spectroscopy nano-imaging and detectorless scattering near-field optical microscopy, at multiple terahertz frequencies, to explore the rich physics of layered topological insulators as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8, hyperbolic materials with topologically protected surface states. By mapping the near-field scattering signal from a set of thin flakes of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 of various thicknesses, we shed light on the nature of the collective modes dominating their optical response in the 2-3 THz range. We capture snapshots of the activation of transverse and longitudinal optical phonons and reveal the propagation of sub-diffractional hyperbolic phonon-polariton modes influenced by the Dirac plasmons arising from the topological surface states and of bulk plasmons, prospecting new research directions in plasmonics, tailored nanophotonics, spintronics and quantum technologies.
   Propagation of photoexcited modes provides important information for novel quantum state. Here, the authors reveal the propagation of sub-diffractional hyperbolic phonon-polariton modes influenced by the Dirac plasmons in topological insulators.

TI Optical properties of intrinsic vacancy and interstitial defects in AlN
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Aluminum nitride (AlN), a wide-band-gap semiconductor, is a key material for ultraviolet optoelectronics and emerging quantum technologies. However, its performance is significantly affected by intrinsic point defects that introduce deep and shallow levels within the bandgap. Here, we combine a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical embedded cluster approach with direct comparison to photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements to investigate the optical transition properties of the four most stable intrinsic point defects in AlN: aluminum vacancies, nitrogen vacancies, aluminum interstitials, and nitrogen interstitials. Calculated configuration-coordinate diagrams across all relevant charge states enable the assignment of experimentally observed optical bands to specific defect-related transitions. Our results highlight N vacancies as the dominant contributors to optical signals under most growth conditions. Although we find that Al vacancies are frequently associated with blue-to-UV optical transitions, their actual contribution remains uncertain due to the dependence of their formation on donor-rich environments. N split-interstitials also play a significant role depending on concentrations and growth conditions. This theoretical analysis, grounded firmly in suitable experimental compaisons, advances the understanding of defect-related optical properties in AlN and offers guidance for the design of optoelectronic and quantum devices.

TI High-entropy engineering of the crystal and electronic structures in a
   Dirac material
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Dirac and Weyl semimetals are a central topic of contemporary condensed matter physics, and the discovery of new compounds with Dirac/Weyl electronic states is crucial to the advancement of topological materials and quantum technologies. Here we show a widely applicable strategy that uses high configuration entropy to engineer relativistic electronic states. We take the AMnSb2 (A = Ba, Sr, Ca, Eu, and Yb) Dirac material family as an example and demonstrate that mixing of Ba, Sr, Ca, Eu and Yb at the A site generates the compound (Ba0.38Sr0.14Ca0.16Eu0.16Yb0.16)MnSb2 (denoted as A 5MnSb2), giving access to a polar structure with a space group that is not present in any of the parent compounds. A 5MnSb2 is an entropy-stabilized phase that preserves its linear band dispersion despite considerable lattice disorder. Although both A 5MnSb2 and AMnSb2 have quasi-two-dimensional crystal structures, the two-dimensional Dirac states in the pristine AMnSb2 evolve into a highly anisotropic quasi-three-dimensional Dirac state triggered by local structure distortions in the high-entropy phase, which is revealed by Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations measurements.
   Manipulating the electronic properties of topological semimetals is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics research. Here, the authors demonstrate how a high-entropy engineering approach allows for the tuning of the crystal structure and the electronic states in a Dirac semimetal.

TI Van der Waals heterostructures for spintronics and opto-spintronics
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The large variety of 2D materials and their co-integration in van der Waals heterostructures enable innovative device engineering. In addition, their atomically thin nature promotes the design of artificial materials by proximity effects that originate from short-range interactions. Such a designer approach is particularly compelling for spintronics, which typically harnesses functionalities from thin layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials and the interfaces between them. Here we provide an overview of recent progress in 2D spintronics and opto-spintronics using van der Waals heterostructures. After an introduction to the forefront of spin transport research, we highlight the unique spin-related phenomena arising from spin-orbit and magnetic proximity effects. We further describe the ability to create multifunctional hybrid heterostructures based on van der Waals materials, combining spin, valley and excitonic degrees of freedom. We end with an outlook on perspectives and challenges for the design and production of ultracompact all-2D spin devices and their potential applications in conventional and quantum technologies.
   The preparation of a diverse set of 2D materials and their co-integration in van der Waals heterostructures enable innovative material design and device engineering. This Review summarizes recent advances in 2D spintronics and opto-spintronics, the underlying physical concepts and future perspectives of the field.

TI Quantum Dichotomies and Coherent Thermodynamics beyond First-Order
   Asymptotics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We address the problem of exact and approximate transformation of quantum dichotomies in the asymptotic regime, i.e., the existence of a quantum channel E mapping p circle times n by trace distance) and sigma circle times n 1 into sigma circle times Rnn 2 exactly, for a large number n. We derive second-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal transformation rate Rn in the small-, moderate-, and large-deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error regime, for an arbitrary pair (p1, sigma 1) of initial states and a commuting pair (p2, sigma 2) of final states. We also prove that for sigma 1 and sigma 2 given by thermal Gibbs states, the derived optimal transformation rates in the first three regimes can be attained by thermal operations. This allows us, for the first time, to study the second-order asymptotics of thermodynamic state interconversion with fully general initial states that may have coherence between different energy eigenspaces. Thus, we discuss the optimal performance of thermodynamic protocols with coherent inputs and describe three novel resonance phenomena allowing one to significantly reduce transformation errors induced by finite-size effects. What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.

TI Strain-induced bandgap engineering in 2D ψ-graphene materials: a
   first-principles study
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB High mechanical strength, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, and tunable properties make two-dimensional (2D) materials attractive for various applications. However, the metallic nature of these materials restricts their applications in specific domains. Strain engineering is a versatile technique to tailor the distribution of energy levels, including bandgap opening between the energy bands. W-Graphene is a newly predicted 2D nanosheet of carbon atoms arranged in 5,6,7-membered rings. The half and fully hydrogenated (hydrogen-functionalized) forms of W-graphene are called W-graphone and W-graphane. Like W-graphene, W-graphone has a zero bandgap, but W-graphane is a wide-bandgap semiconductor. In this study, we have applied in-plane and out- of-plane biaxial strain on pristine and hydrogenated W-graphene. We have obtained a bandgap opening (200 meV) in W-graphene at 14% in-plane strain, while W-graphone loses its zero-bandgap nature at very low values of applied strain (both +1% and- 1%). In contrast, fully hydrogenated W-graphene remains unchanged under the influence of mechanical strain, preserving its initial characteristic of having a direct bandgap. This behavior offers opportunities for these materials in various vital applications in photodetectors, solar cells, LEDs, pressure and strain sensors, energy storage, and quantum computing. The mechanical strain tolerance of pristine and fully hydrogenated W-graphene is observed to be- 17% to +17%, while for W-graphone, it lies within the strain span of- 16% to +16%.

TI Kitaev interaction and possible spin liquid state in CoI2 and
   Co2/3Mg1/3I2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI2, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co2+ ion is in the Jeff = 1/2 state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong t2g-eg hopping via the strong Co 3d-I 5p hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction (K1) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak t2g-t2g hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction J1. The resultant |K1/J1| = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction J3 gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI2. We then propose to suppress the J3 using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co2/3Mg1/3I2 has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.

TI Atomic Layer Deposition of Molybdenum Carbide Thin Films
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB The development of deposition processes for metal carbide thin films is rapidly advancing, driven by their potential for applications including catalysis, batteries, and semiconductor devices. Within this landscape, atomic layer deposition (ALD) offers exceptional conformality, uniformity, and thickness control on spatially complex structures. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the thermal ALD of MoCx with MoCl5 and 1,4-bis(trimethylgermyl)-1,4-dihydropyrazine [(Me3Ge)2DHP] as precursors, focusing on the functional properties and characterization of the films. The depositions are conducted at 200-300 degrees C and very smooth films with RMS Rq approximate to 0.3-0.6 nm on Si, TiN, and HfO2 substrates are obtained. The process has a high growth rate of 1.5 & Aring; cycle-1 and the films appear to be continuous already after 5 cycles. The films are conductive even at thicknesses below 5 nm, and films above 18 nm exhibit superconductivity up to 4.4 K. In lieu of suitable references, Raman modes for molybdenum carbides and nitrides are calculated and X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used for phase analysis.

TI Explicit noise and dissipation operators for quantum stochastic
   thermodynamics
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines, from quantum computing and information science to molecular electronics and quantum thermodynamics. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for which it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain.

TI Optimized Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystem: Integrating Kyber-KEM with
   Hardware TRNG on Zynq Platform
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Traditional cryptographic systems face critical vulnerabilities posed by the rapid advancement of quantum computing, particularly concerning key exchange mechanisms and the quality of entropy sources for random number generation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-layered, quantum-resistant hybrid cryptographic architecture. First, to ensure robust data confidentiality and secure key establishment, the architecture employs AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard-256) for data encryption and utilizes the Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), which is based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, for secure key exchange. Second, to further bolster overall security by establishing a high-quality cryptographic foundation, we design a TRNG (true random number generator) system based on a multi-level Ring Oscillator (RO) architecture (employing 5, 7, 9, and 11 inverter stages), which provides a reliable and high-quality entropy source. Third, to enable intelligent and adaptive security management, we introduce FA-Kyber (Flow-Adaptive Kyber), a dual-trigger key exchange framework facilitating dynamic key management strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our implementation exhibits robust performance, achieving an encrypted data transmission throughput of over 550 Mbps with an average end-to-end latency of only 3.14 ms and a key exchange success rate of 99.99% under various network conditions. The system exhibits excellent stability under network congestion, maintaining 86% of baseline throughput under moderate stress, while adaptively increasing the key rotation frequency to enhance security. This comprehensive approach strikes an optimal balance between performance and post-quantum resilience for sensitive communications.

TI Quantum Field Theory Model for Spin-Based Devices Using 2-D van der
   Waals Materials
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EXPLORATORY SOLID-STATE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICES AND
   CIRCUITS
AB We explore the effects of layered geometries of 2-D quantum spin systems as a method to tune and control material properties for spintronic devices. We analyze the dispersion relation of a 2-D quantum spin system with a shifted bilayer square lattice through the linear spin wave (LSW) approximation of quantum field theory (QFT). Inspired by recent interest in 2-D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials, we consider both short-range interactions given by nearest-neighbor intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This case, along with lattice shifts, has not been treated in the literature via LSW theory. Computations show the gap in the frequencies for the two lowest-energy magnon modes at zero wavenumber that depend on the horizontal and vertical layer shifts. The frequency gap is attributed to the long-range dipole interaction with the gap becoming more sensitive to the horizontal layer shifts for small layer separation. Our general framework is suitable for numerical computations of a wide collection of 2-D lattice models and presents an essential first step toward a comprehensive model that can incorporate quantum effects leading to quantifiable predictions of additional physical properties, for example, spin coherence length and damping, of interest for engineering of spintronic devices.

TI Bifurcation and chaos: Unraveling soliton solutions in a couple
   fractional-order nonlinear evolution equation
SO NONLINEAR ENGINEERING - MODELING AND APPLICATION
AB Shallow water waves represent a significant and extensively employed wave type in coastal regions. The unconventional bidirectional transmission of extended waves across shallow water is elucidated through nonlinear fractional partial differential equations, specifically the space-time fractional-coupled Whitham-Broer-Kaup equation. The application of two distinct analytical methods, namely, the generalized logistic equation approach and unified approach, is employed to construct various solutions such as bright solitons, singular solitary waves, kink solitons, and dark solitons for the proposed equation. The physical behavior of calculated results is graphically represented through density, two- and three-dimensional plots. The obtained solutions could have significant implications across a range of fields including plasma physics, biology, quantum computing, fluid dynamics, optics, communication technology, hydrodynamics, environmental sciences, and ocean engineering. Furthermore, the qualitative assessment of the unperturbed planar system is conducted through the utilization of bifurcation theory. Subsequently, the model undergoes the introduction of an outward force with the aim of inducing disruption, resulting in the emergence of a perturbed dynamical system. The detection of chaotic trajectory in the perturbed system is accomplished through the utilization of a variety of tools designed for chaos detection. The execution of the Runge-Kutta method is employed to assess the sensitivity of the examined model. The results obtained serve to underscore the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodologies for the assessment of soliton structures within a broad spectrum of nonlinear models.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Big data analytics (BDA) is a wide and deep application in e-commerce, which impacts positively on the global economy, especially the U.S. and China who have done well. This paper seeks to examine the relative influence of theoretical research and practical activities of BDA in e-commerce to explain the differences between the U.S. and China according to the two main literature databases, Web of Science and CNKI, respectively, and by employing other samples that present retail e-commerce sales and the number of some data companies founded in the U.S. and China each year. We further determine the reasons leading to the difference between the U.S. and China in BDA in e-commerce, which can help managers devise appropriate business strategies in e-commerce for each of them, and provide a proof of the significant relationship of theoretical research and practical activities in BDA in e-commerce. In addition, the variables related to big data companies show a moderation effect rather than mediating effect relative to the practice of theoretical research in e-commerce in the United States, but they show a moderate effect and mediating effects in China. The results of this study help clarify doubts regarding the development of China's e-commerce. Moreover, three orientations in e-commerce using BDA and the use of quantum computing in e-commerce to solve existing e-commerce problems are explored to provide better evidence for decision-making that could be valuable in future research.

TI An Intelligent Quantum Cyber-Security Framework for Healthcare Data
   Management
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Digital healthcare is essential to facilitate consumers to access and disseminate their medical data easily for enhanced medical care services. However, the significant concern with digitalization across healthcare systems necessitates for a prompt, productive, and secure storage facility along with a vigorous communication strategy, to stimulate sensitive digital healthcare data sharing and proactive estimation of malicious entities. In this context, this paper introduces a comprehensive quantum-based framework to overwhelm the potential security and privacy issues for secure healthcare data management. It equips quantum encryption for the secured storage and dispersal of healthcare data over the shared cloud platform by employing quantum encryption. Also, the framework furnishes a quantum feed-forward neural network unit to examine the intention behind the data request before granting access, for proactive estimation of potential data breach. In this way, the proposed framework delivers overall healthcare data management by coupling the advanced and more competent quantum approach with machine learning to safeguard the data storage, access, and prediction of malicious entities in an automated manner. Thus, the proposed IQ-HDM leads to more cooperative and effective healthcare delivery and empowers individuals with adequate custody of their health data. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed IQ-HDM framework with state-of-the-art methods outline a considerable improvement up to 67.6%, in tackling cyber threats related to healthcare data security.

TI Cooling positronium to ultralow velocities with a chirped laser pulse
   train
SO NATURE
AB When laser radiation is skilfully applied, atoms and molecules can be cooled(1-3), allowing the precise measurements and control of quantum systems. This is essential for the fundamental studies of physics as well as practical applications such as precision spectroscopy(4-7), ultracold gases with quantum statistical properties(8-10) and quantum computing. In laser cooling, atoms are slowed to otherwise unattainable velocities through repeated cycles of laser photon absorption and spontaneous emission in random directions. Simple systems can serve as rigorous testing grounds for fundamental physics-one such case is the purely leptonic positronium(11,12), an exotic atom comprising an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. Laser cooling of positronium, however, has hitherto remained unrealized. Here we demonstrate the one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium. An innovative laser system emitting a train of broadband pulses with successively increasing central frequencies was used to overcome major challenges posed by the short positronium lifetime and the effects of Doppler broadening and recoil. One-dimensional chirp cooling was used to cool a portion of the dilute positronium gas to a velocity distribution of approximately 1 K in 100 ns. A major advancement in the field of low-temperature fundamental physics of antimatter, this study on a purely leptonic system complements work on antihydrogen(13), a hadron-containing exotic atom. The successful application of laser cooling to positronium affords unique opportunities to rigorously test bound-state quantum electrodynamics and to potentially realize Bose-Einstein condensation(14-18) in this matter-antimatter system.

TI High-Temperature Excitonic Condensation in 2D Lattice
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Exploration of high-temperature bosonic condensation is of significant importance for the fundamental many-body physics and applications in nanodevices, which, however, remains a huge challenge. Here, in combination of many-body perturbation theory and first-principles calculations, a new-type spatially indirect exciton can be optically generated in two-dimensional (2D) Bi2S2Te because of its unique structure feature. In particular, the spin-singlet spatially indirect excitons in Bi2S2Te monolayer are dipole/parity allowed and reveal befitting characteristics for excitonic condensation, such as small effective mass and satisfied dilute limitation. Based on the layered Bi2S2Te, the possibility of the high-temperature excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and superfluid state in two dimensions, which goes beyond the current paradigms in both experiment and theory, are proved. It should be highlighted that record-high phase transition temperatures of 289.7 and 72.4 K can be theoretically predicted for the excitonic BEC and superfluidity in the atomic thin Bi2S2Te, respectively. It therefore can be confirmed that Bi2S2Te featuring bound bosonic states is a fascinating 2D platform for exploring the high-temperature excitonic condensation and applications in such as quantum computing and dissipationless nanodevices.
   A novel type of spatially indirect exciton in two-dimensional Bi2S2Te monolayer due to its unique structure is identified. The spin-singlet excitons are dipole/parity allowed and feature with small effective mass and large binding energy. High-temperature excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity can be anticipated, offering a fascinating platform for exploring excitonic condensation and the development of excitonic dissipationless nanodevices. image

TI Spin exchange of two spin-1/2 atoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum Cheshire cat effect is an important phenomenon in quantum mechanics that reveals the separability of physical properties from their carriers. This effect transcends the classical framework whose attributes must be inherently attached to objects, providing new perspectives for quantum information and precision measurement. According to the quantum Cheshire cat effect, we prepare a pre-selected state of a spin-1/2 atomic system composed of two particles through a pre-selection process. We conduct quantum weak measurements on the spins and positions of these two atoms and extract weak values by using the method of imaginary time evolution (ITE). Subsequently, we perform post-selection on these two atoms and design two distinct post-selected states. Initially, we calculate analytical solutions when both atoms encounter these two different post-selected states separately. Then, during the stage of obtaining weak values via ITE, we first discuss the scenario with only one post-selected state. In this case, our experimental goal is to achieve spin exchange between the two atoms. We use ITE to obtain normalized coincidence rate for the system. By linearly fitting these normalized coincidence rate, we derive numerical solutions for the weak values of the system. The comparison between the analytical solutions and numerical results indicates that they are in close agreement, demonstrating that our method promotes spin exchange between the two atoms. Next, we examine scenarios involving both post-selected states in the post-selection process. After completing weak measurements on particles, delayed-choice allows them to evolve along different paths ultimately leading to distinct post-selected states. One particular post-selected state that results in final measurement outcomes indicates that the spin exchange occurs between both particles with amplification. Conversely, the other post-selected state ensures that even after undergoing weak measurement and delayed-choice, the states of the two particles remain consistent with their pre-measurement conditions. We also compare the analytical and numerical solutions of the experiment involving delayed choice and find that they are very consistent with each other. This consistency indicates that delayed-choice indeed has a significant influence on whether the final exchange occurs. Our research theoretically confirms the feasibility of fermionic systems within bipartite quantum Cheshire cat effects and illustrates how delayed-choice influences quantum Cheshire cat effects in spin-1/2 atomic systems.

TI Quantum-Inspired Multi-Scale Object Detection in UAV Imagery: Advancing
   Ultra-Small Object Accuracy and Efficiency for Real-Time Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Ultra-small object detection in UAV imagery presents significant challenges due to scale variation, environmental complexity, and computational constraints. This study introduces a quantum-inspired multi-scale object detection model designed to address these issues effectively. By integrating quantum-inspired sub-pixel convolution, adversarial training, and self-supervised learning, the model enhances detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These advancements are particularly critical for UAV applications such as surveillance, precision agriculture, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. The proposed model was evaluated on the VisDrone2019 dataset and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including YOLOv4, YOLO11, RT-DETR, and EfficientDet. It achieved 65.3% precision, 52.4% recall, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 34.5%, outperforming conventional models in detecting ultra-small objects. Efficiency optimizations, including structured pruning and quantization, reduced computational load to 30 GFLOPS with an inference time of 8.1 milliseconds, ensuring suitability for real-time UAV applications on resource-constrained platforms. This research offers a practical and robust solution for UAV-based object detection tasks, combining state-of-the-art accuracy with operational efficiency. It also establishes a foundation for future advancements, including scalability to diverse datasets, integration with edge computing platforms, and the exploration of quantum computing techniques. These contributions pave the way for enhanced capabilities in computer vision and autonomous aerial systems.

TI Design and optimization of a fault-tolerant demultiplexer based on
   nano-scale quantum-dots
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL MODELLING-ELECTRONIC NETWORKS DEVICES
   AND FIELDS
AB In quantum electronics, quantum-dot cellular automata (CA) is a technology to replace current transistor-based technologies. It provides low-power, incredibly dense, and high-speed constructions at a nano-scale. Quantum-dot CA is a revolutionary nano-scale technology that overcomes various restrictions in metal-oxide technology and simplifies the construction of digital integrated circuits. On the other hand, the demultiplexer is a valuable component for optimizing the entire process in logical design. So, proper cell placement and associated clock zone become the most important design requirement for effective logic operation in demultiplexer. Also, redundancy in fault-tolerant circuits can increase the dependability of digital circuits. However, in this area, the studies are not adequate, and most of them suffer from improper use of clocking systems and inefficient circuit features such as fault-tolerant. As a result, the current study demonstrates a unique quantum-dot CA-based fault-tolerant 1:2 demultiplexer design. The proposed method is verified by implementing the fault-tolerant gates and cell redundancy. Also, we look at the layouts' cells, area, latency, single-cell missing, single-cell displacement, and additional single-cell. We also use the famous simulator, QCADesigner, to model the proposed design. The proposed fault-tolerant 1:2 demultiplexer's effectiveness is also discussed. Sixty-eight cells and 0.04 mu m(2) of occupied space make up the unique fault-tolerant 1:2 demultiplexer. The results showed that the proposed design is completely faults-tolerance regarding tolerant missing, displaced, and additional single cells faults.

TI The Electronic Control System of a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor: A
   Systematic Literature Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB [Background] Ions in an ion trap are among the most promising technologies to implement a quantum processor. This machine is governed by a classic electronic control system, for which we found no systematic electronic system-level approach for its conception, design, implementation, and/or verification. The trapped-ion quantum processor cannot advance its roadmap without an appropriate and fitting electronic control system. To fully enable further advancements in the field, an understanding of the electronic control system as a system of its own and the conception of its electronic system-level description, are due needed. [Objective] Therefore, we want to address the electronic control system of a trapped-ion quantum processor as a system of its own by first identifying its published literature. [Method] For that purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review abiding by the APISSER methodology for systematic literature reviews in engineering, which describes and delimits the reach of this study. [Results] In this paper, we report the results of the study, classify them, and present possible research directions and considerations to be taken in the conception of this system. [Conclusion] This study lays a introductory foundation to grasp the requirements and environment of the electronic control system of a trapped-ion quantum processor. A foundation much needed to leverage further research on this topic by the engineering community. Furthermore, it serves as a checkpoint in time: listing and synthesizing, the existing published body-of-knowledge of this topic within the defined boundaries of our method.

TI Engineering random spin models with atoms in a high-finesse cavity
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Random spin models play a key role in our understanding of disorder and complex many-body systems. Two all-to-all interacting, disordered models have now been realized using a cavity quantum electrodynamics platform.
   All-to-all interacting, disordered quantum many-body models have a wide range of applications across disciplines, from spin glasses in condensed-matter physics over holographic duality in high-energy physics to annealing algorithms in quantum computing. Typically, these models are abstractions that do not find unambiguous physical realizations in nature. Here we realize an all-to-all interacting, disordered spin system by subjecting an atomic cloud in a cavity to a controllable light shift. Adjusting the detuning between atom resonance and cavity mode, we can tune between disordered versions of a central-mode model and a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. By spectroscopically probing the low-energy excitations of the system, we explore the competition of interactions with disorder across a broad parameter range. We show how disorder in the central-mode model breaks the strong collective coupling, making the dark-state manifold cross over to a random distribution of weakly mixed light-matter, 'grey', states. In the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, the ferromagnetic finite-sized ground state evolves towards a paramagnet as disorder is increased. In that regime, semi-localized eigenstates emerge, as we observe by extracting bounds on the participation ratio. These results present substantial steps towards freely programmable cavity-mediated interactions for the design of arbitrary spin Hamiltonians.

TI Improved Quantum Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm-Optimized Artificial
   Intelligence Models for Suspended Sediment Load Predicting
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB River sediment plays a critical role in maintaining the health of river ecosystems, and accurately predicting suspended sediment load (SSL) is vital for effective river management. This study proposes a quantum bee colony algorithm based on Boltzmann's selection and dimensional dynamic update strategy (BDQABC). The BDQABC is utilized to optimize artificial intelligence (AI) models, specifically BDQABC-SVR and BDQABC-ANN. Both models are applied to predict SSL at the Caguas Municipio station in Lo & iacute;za River, Puerto Rico. To evaluate the predictive capability, the models are compared with quantum bee colony algorithm-optimized AI models (QABC-SVR and QABC-ANN), genetic algorithm-optimized AI models (GA-SVR and GA-ANN) and traditional AI models (SVR and ANN). The models using various combinations of lagged river flow and SSL values as inputs. The performance of the models is assessed using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of determination, and graphical comparison methods. The results indicate that the BDQABC-SVR and BDQABC-ANN models exhibit stronger predictive capabilities for SSL than other models. Specifically, BDQABC-SVR improves the RMSE accuracy of the QABC-SVR model by 5.6% and 22.0% respectively, while BDQABC-ANN improves the RMSE accuracy of the QABC-ANN model by 13.3% and 9.7%, respectively for the two input scenarios.

TI HHL algorithm with mapping function and enhanced sampling for model
   predictive control in microgrids
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB This paper presents a refined quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for microgrid control. The first novelty of the developed method is that a mapping shift function enables the original HHL algorithm to handle general linear equations with non-singular and indefinite matrix. Second, a method of Matrix Extension for Amplifying Sampling Probabilities of Intended Solution (ME-ASPI) is proposed to design the reformulated linear algebraic equations, allowing for improved sampling efficiency of the quantum tomography in the refined HHL algorithm. Then, we applied the method to solve the model predictive control (MPC) problem in nonlinear dynamical microgrids. Specifically, with the ME-ASPI method, the refined HHL algorithm can effectively obtain the intended partial optimal control inputs for MPC. The optimization of quadratic programming problem in each time step of MPC is transformed into a linear system problem, which is addressed by the proposed quantum solver through using only partial information, with the time complexity improved from O(.2.37286) classically to O(.2 log. x plogp) in quantum. Numerical examples have validated the effectiveness of the refined HHL algorithm with the proposed mapping function and the ME-ASPI method. By leveraging quantum properties, the proposed method provides a hybrid quantum-classical framework for microgrid control. This generic method can also potentially tackle many other challenges in analyzing and controlling general complex engineered systems.

TI Characteristics of interacting carbon-antisite-vacancies in 4H silicon
   carbide
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Spin defects in semiconductors have demonstrated promising electronic structures for potential applications in quantum computing and sensing. Among various proposed quantum byte systems, spin defects in silicon carbide have attracted significant attention due to several advantages they offer over other options. In this study, we investigate carbon-antisite-vacancy defects in 4H silicon carbide through ab initio density functional theory calculations. With the HSE06 functionals, the ab initio computation can predict much more accurate electronic structures. However, the corresponding computational cost is high, especially for supercells consisting of several hundreds of atoms. In this investigation, the carbon-antisite-vacancy defect is studied by using a high-performance computing cluster, with a specific focus on supercells that encompass two such defects. The extension of a single carbon-antisite-vacancy defect is depicted by referring to the spin density distribution. Different defect types show similar spin density patterns. Based on the single defect characteristics, supercells with paired carbon-antisite-vacancy defects are created. It is found that the binding energy can reach 2 eV for overlapping defects. In the case of insignificant overlap of the corresponding single defects, the ground state magnetic moment is 4 mu B, accompanied by a negligible binding energy. However, if there is a significant overlap of the spin density, the magnetic moment changes to 2 mu B. These findings can serve as helpful references for the study of spin defects in 4H silicon carbide, particularly in the potential carbon-antisite-vacancy application research.

TI Ligand Optimization of Exchange Interaction in Co(II) Dimer Single
   Molecule Magnet by Machine Learning
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Designing single-molecule magnets (SMMs) for potential applications in quantum computing and high-density data storage requires tuning their magnetic properties, especially the strength of the magnetic interaction. These properties can be characterized by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we study the experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer (Co-2(C5NH5)(4)(mu-PO2(CH2C6H5)(2))(3)) SMM with the goal to control the exchange energy, Delta E-J, between the Co atoms through tuning of the capping ligands. The experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer molecule has a very small Delta E-J < 1 meV. We assemble a DFT data set of 1081 ligand substitutions for the Co(II) dimer. The ligand exchange provides a broad range of exchange energies, Delta E-J, from +50 to -200 meV, with 80% of the ligands yielding a small Delta E-J < 10 meV. We identify descriptors for the classification and regression of Delta E-J using gradient boosting machine learning models. We compare one-hot encoded, structure-based, and chemical descriptors consisting of the HOMO/LUMO energies of the individual ligands and the maximum electronegativity difference and bond order for the ligand atom connecting to Co. We observe a similar overall performance with the chemical descriptors outperforming the other descriptors. We show that the exchange coupling, Delta E-J, is correlated to the difference in the average bridging angle between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, similar to the Goodenough-Kanamori rules.

TI AKLT-States as ZX-Diagrams: Diagrammatic Reasoning for Quantum States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB From Feynman diagrams to tensor networks, diagrammatic representations of computations in quantum mechanics have catalyzed progress in physics. These diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus, that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely graphically. As a demonstration, we express the one-dimensional (1D) AKLT-state, a symmetry protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation straightforwardly recovers the AKLT matrix-product state representation, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the nonvanishing of a string-order parameter. Extending beyond these known properties, our diagrammatic approach also allows us to analytically derive that the Berry phase of any finite-length 1D AKLT chain is pi. In addition, we provide an alternative proof that the two-dimensional (2D) AKLT-state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum-computing resource. Lastly, we build 2D higher-order topological phases diagrammatically, which we use to illustrate a symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop more efficient many-body algorithms and giving a novel diagrammatic perspective on quantum phase transitions.

AB Quantum electronic circuits where the logic information is processed and stored in single flux quanta promise efficient computation in a performance/power metric, and thus are of utmost interest as possible replacement or enhancement of CMOS. Several electronic device families leverage superconducting materials and transitions between resistive and superconducting states. Information is coded into bits with deterministic values - as opposed to qubits used in quantum computing. As an example, information can be coded into pulses. Logic gates can be modeled as finite-state machines, that emit logic outputs in response to inputs. The most natural realization of such circuits is through synchronous implementations, where a clock stimulus is transmitted to every logic gate and where logic depth is balanced at every input to achieve full synchrony. Novel superconducting realization families try to go beyond the limitations of synchronous logic with approaches reminiscent of asynchronous design style and leveraging information coding. Moreover, some superconducting families exploit adiabatic operation, in the search for minimizing energy consumption. Design automation for quantum electronic logic families is still in its infancy, but important results have been achieved in terms of automatic balancing and fanout management. The combination of these problems with logic restructuring poses new challenges, as the overall problem is more complex as compared to CMOS and algorithms and tools cannot be just adapted. This presentation will cover recent advancement in design automation for superconducting electronic circuits as well as address future developments in the field.

TI Hybrid ARMA-GARCH-Neural Networks for intraday strategy exploration in
   high-frequency trading
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB The frequency of armed conflicts increased during the last 20 years. The problems of the emergence of military disputes, not only concern social parameters, but also economic and financial dimensions. This study examines the potential impact of global geopolitical events on the stock market prices of the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index and Foreign Exchange (FOREX) markets movements. We analyse whether defence stocks and exchange rate perform similarly during military incidents or geopolitical crises. We built an Autoregressive Moving Average Model with a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity process (ARMAGARCH) with the machine learning methods of Neural Networks, Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Decision Trees, Quantum Neural Networks, and Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks, aimed at detecting intraday patterns for forecasting defence stock market and FOREX markets disturbances in a market microstructure framework. The empirical results provide preliminary findings on the foreseeability of market disturbances and small differences are observed before and during geopolitical events. Additionally, we confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid model ARMA-GARCH with the machine learning approaches, being ARMAGARCH-Quantum Recurrent Neural Network the technique that achieves the best accuracy results. Our work has a large potential impact on investment market agents and portfolio managers, as shocks from geopolitical events could provide a new methodology to support the decision-making process for trading in High-Frequency Trading.

TI Next-generation even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states of
   interacting composite fermions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The discovery of the fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) in 1982 ushered a new era of research in many-body condensed matter physics. Among the numerous FQHSs, those observed at even-denominator Landau level filling factors are of particular interest as they may host quasiparticles obeying non-Abelian statistics and be of potential use in topological quantum computing. The even-denominator FQHSs, however, are scarce and have been observed predominantly in low-disorder two-dimensional (2D) systems when an excited electron Landau level is half filled. An example is the well-studied FQHS at filling factor v = 5/2 which is believed to be a Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer-type, paired state of flux-particle composite fermions (CFs). Here, we report the observation of even-denominator FQHSs at v = 3/10, 3/8, and 3/4 in the lowest Landau level of an ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D hole system, evinced by deep minima in longitudinal resistance and developing quantized Hall plateaus. Quite remarkably, these states can be interpreted as even-denominator FQHSs of CFs, emerging from pairing of higher-order CFs when a CF Landau level, rather than an electron or a hole Landau level, is half-filled. Our results affirm enhanced interaction between CFs in a hole system with significant Landau level mixing and, more generally, the pairing of CFs as a valid mechanism for even-denominator FQHSs, and suggest the realization of FQHSs with non-Abelian anyons.

TI Heart Failure Detection Using Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning and
   Traditional Machine Learning Techniques for Internet of Artificially
   Intelligent Medical Things
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Quantum-enhanced machine learning plays a vital role in healthcare because of its robust application concerning current research scenarios, the growth of novel medical trials, patient information and record management, procurement of chronic disease detection, and many more. Due to this reason, the healthcare industry is applying quantum computing to sustain patient-oriented attention to healthcare patrons. The present work summarized the recent research progress in quantum-enhanced machine learning and its significance in heart failure detection on a dataset of 14 attributes. In this paper, the number of qubits in terms of the features of heart failure data is normalized by using min-max, PCA, and standard scalar, and further, has been optimized using the pipelining technique. The current work verifies that quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms such as quantum random forest (QRF), quantum K nearest neighbour (QKNN), quantum decision tree (QDT), and quantum Gaussian Naive Bayes (QGNB) are better than traditional machine learning algorithms in heart failure detection. The best accuracy rate is (0.89), which the quantum random forest classifier attained. In addition to this, the quantum random forest classifier also incurred the best results in F1 score, recall and, precision by (0.88), (0.93), and (0.89), respectively. The computation time taken by traditional and quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms has also been compared where the quantum random forest has the least execution time by 150 microseconds. Hence, the work provides a way to quantify the differences between standard and quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms to select the optimal method for detecting heart failure.

TI Broadband Noise Characterization of SiGe HBTs Down to 4K
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the DC and RF behavior of HBTs, spanning temperatures from 350 to 3.8 K. It underscores the necessity of detailed studies for the design of RF circuits for quantum computing, including LNAs, VCOs, and mixers, due to the absence of cryogenic models. The DC gain shows betas of 800 at room temperature (RT) and 3000 at 3.8 K. RF characterization indicates a maximum f(T) of 500 GHz at 3.8 K and 300 GHz at RT. The proposed figure-of-merit, (g(m).f(T)/I-c), typically used in CMOS design, is explored across the temperature range. The study reveals a noise equivalent temperature of sub-1 K at 3.8 K with source matching. The noise behavior of Si/SiGe:C HBTs within 0.13 mu m BiCMOS technology is characterized over 293 to 4 K and 10 kHz to 12 GHz. The analysis shows a significant increase in the flicker noise coefficient, K, and corner frequency reduction at 4 K. The high frequency parameter f(T) reaches 500 GHz, demonstrating better performance compared to advanced CMOS nodes. This research supports the modeling of HBTs that are critical for circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures. These models are particularly beneficial for designing classical-to-quantum interfaces.

TI Non-Volatile Hybrid Optical Phase Shifter Driven by a Ferroelectric
   Transistor
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Optical phase shifters are essential elements in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and function as a direct interface to program the PICs. Non-volatile phase shifters, which can retain information without a power supply, are highly desirable for low-power static operations. Here a non-volatile optical phase shifter is demonstrated by driving a III-V/Si hybrid metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) phase shifter with a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) operating in the source follower mode. Owing to the various polarization states in the FeFET, multistate non-volatile phase shifts up to 1.25 pi are obtained with CMOS-compatible operation voltages and low switching energy up to 3.3 nJ. Furthermore, a crossbar array architecture is proposed to simplify the control of non-volatile phase shifters in large-scale PICs and verify its feasibility by confirming the selective write-in operation of a targeted FeFET with a negligible disturbance to the others. This work paves the way for realizing large-scale non-volatile programmable PICs for emerging computing applications such as deep learning and quantum computing.

TI Efficient nonlinear optical mixing enabled by Brillouin
   zone-folding-induced BICs and intrinsic leaky modes in one-dimensional
   photonic structures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Four-wave mixing (FWM), as a significant third-order nonlinear optical process, holds great promise for applications in quantum computing, imaging technologies, and other photonic fields. Here, we propose a design strategy to enhance third-harmonic generation (THG) and FWM by simultaneously exciting two quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) originated from the Brillouin zone-folding-induced BICs and an intrinsic leaky mode (LM) in a one-dimensional grating. Eigenvalue calculations reveal that periodic perturbations induce band folding, bringing guided-mode resonances initially located below the light cone into the radiative continuum, thus forming a symmetry-protected BIC. Under oblique incidence, the Brillouin zone-folding-induced BIC evolves into a Q-BIC and simultaneously the Q-BIC undergoes a spectral splitting into two resolvable resonant modes. The cooperative interaction between two Q-BICs and an intrinsic LM in the grating structure significantly enhances THG and FWM. Finite-element simulations suggest that the LM yields the THG with a conversion efficiency of 10(-4)-three orders of magnitude higher than that of the Q-BICs. Furthermore, enabled by the synergistic interplay between two Q-BICs and a LM, the degenerate and non-degenerate FWM processes yield output powers of 4.07 and 1.55 W/m, respectively. Importantly, both THG and FWM efficiencies exhibit remarkable robustness against variations in the incidence angle. Our findings not only provide a novel theoretical platform for nonlinear frequency conversion but also advance the application of optical mixers in quantum nanophotonics and photonic circuitry.

TI An anti-aliasing filtering of quantum images in spatial domain using a
   pyramid structure
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB As a part of quantum image processing, quantum image filtering is a crucial technology in the development of quantum computing. Low-pass filtering can effectively achieve anti-aliasing effects on images. Currently, most quantum image filterings are based on classical domains and grayscale images, and there are relatively fewer studies on anti-aliasing in the quantum domain. This paper proposes a scheme for anti-aliasing filtering based on quantum grayscale and color image scaling in the spatial domain. It achieves the effect of anti-aliasing filtering on quantum images during the scaling process. First, we use the novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) and the improved quantum representation of color images (INCQI) to represent classical images. Since aliasing phenomena are more pronounced when images are scaled down, this paper focuses only on the anti-aliasing effects in the case of reduction. Subsequently, we perform anti-aliasing filtering on the quantum representation of the original image and then use bilinear interpolation to scale down the image, achieving the anti-aliasing effect. The constructed pyramid model is then used to select an appropriate image for upscaling to the original image size. Finally, the complexity of the circuit is analyzed. Compared to the images experiencing aliasing effects solely due to scaling, applying anti-aliasing filtering to the images results in smoother and clearer outputs. Additionally, the anti-aliasing filtering allows for manual intervention to select the desired level of image smoothness.

TI Compression Techniques for Real-Time Control and Non-Time-Critical Big
   Data in Smart Grids: A Review
SO ENERGIES
AB Significant amounts of data need to be transferred in order to optimize the operation of power grids. The development of advanced metering and control infrastructure ensures a growth in the amount of data transferred within smart grids. Data compression is a strategy to reduce the burden. This paper presents current challenges in the field of time-series data compression. This paper's novel contribution is the division of data in smart grids to real-time data used for control purposes and big data sets used for non-time-critical analysis of the system. Both of these two applications have different requirements for effective compression. Currently used algorithms are listed and described with their advantages and drawbacks for both of these applications. Details needed for the implementation of an algorithm were also provided. Comprehensive analysis and comparison are intended to facilitate the design of a data compression method tailored for a particular application. An important contribution is the description of the influence of data compression methods on cybersecurity, which is one of the major concerns in modern power grids. Future work includes the development of adaptive compression methods based on artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and quantum computing. This review will offer a solid foundation for the research and design of data compression methods.

TI Uncovering instabilities in variational-quantum deep Q-networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has considerably advanced over the past decade. At the same time, state-of-the-art RL algorithms require a large computational budget in terms of training time to converge. Recent work has started to approach this problem through the lens of quantum computing, which promises theoretical speed-ups for several traditionally hard tasks. In this work, we examine a class of hybrid quantum-classical RL algorithms that we collectively refer to as variational quantum deep Q-networks (VQ-DQN). We show that VQ-DQN approaches are subject to instabilities that cause the learned policy to diverge, study the extent to which this afflicts reproducibility of established results based on classical simulation, and perform systematic experiments to identify potential explanations for the observed instabilities. Additionally, and in contrast to most existing work on quantum reinforcement learning, we execute RL algorithms on an actual quantum processing unit (an IBM Quantum Device) and investigate differences in behaviour between simulated and physical quantum systems that suffer from implementation deficiencies. Our experiments show that, contrary to opposite claims in the literature, it cannot be conclusively decided if known quantum approaches, even if simulated without physical imperfections, can provide an advantage as compared to classical approaches. Finally, we provide a robust, universal and well-tested implementation of VQ-DQN as a reproducible testbed for future experiments. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Charge-offset stability of single-electron devices based on
   single-layered Fe nanodot array
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In metal-based single-electron devices (SEDs), charge-offset drift has been observed, which is a time-dependent instability caused by charge noise. This instability is an issue in the application of new information processing devices, such as neural network devices, quantum computing devices (charge sensing), and reservoir computing devices. Therefore, the charge-offset drift in metal-based SEDs needs to be suppressed. However, the charge-offset stability of metal-based SEDs has not been investigated in depth, except in the case of Al and Al2O3 SEDs. In this work, Fe-based SEDs formed by single-layer Fe nanodot arrays embedded in MgF2 were studied with regard to their charge-offset stability. Using devices that produce simple current oscillations, the charge-offset drift (Delta Q(0)) of Fe-based SEDs was evaluated by focusing on peak shifts of the simple current oscillation over time, despite the use of a multi-dot system. This drift (Delta Q(0) approximate to 0.3e) was shown to be much lower than in SEDs with Al-dots and Al2O3 tunnel junctions. Notably, the charge-offset drift in the metal-based SEDs was suppressed using the Fe-MgF2 system. The excellent stability of these devices was attributed to the material properties of the Fe-MgF2 system. Finally, as the Fe nanodot array contained numerous dots, the effect of satellite dots acting as traps on the charge-offset instability was discussed. The findings of this study will be important in future applications of metal-based SEDs in new information processing devices.

TI Quantum-Inspired Moth Flame Optimizer Enhanced Deep Learning for
   Automated Rice Variety Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Automated rice variety detection and classification is a task that includes automatically categorizing and identifying varieties or different types of rice based on different characteristics namely grain texture, shape, color, and size. This process is essential for quality assessment, agricultural management, and research purposes. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine leaching (ML) that focuses on training an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was widely applied in image-based tasks such as rice variety detection, as they could efficiently capture visual features and patterns. In this study, we propose an Automated Rice Variety Detection and Classification using Quantum Inspired Moth Flame Optimizer with Deep Learning (ARVDC-QIMFODL) technique. The presented ARVDC-QIMFODL technique focuses on the automated identification and classification of distinct kinds of rice varieties. To accomplish this, the ARVDC-QIMFODL technique uses the Median modified wiener filter (MMWF) technique for the noise removal process. Followed by, the feature extraction process takes place by an improved ShuffleNet model. For rice variety detection and classification, the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach was applied. At last, the QIMFO algorithm-based hyperparameter selection process is performed to optimize the detection results of the LSTM system. The simulation outcome of the ARVDC-QIMFODL method is tested on a rice image dataset. An extensive set of experiments showed the remarkable efficiency of the ARVDC-QIMFODL system over other models.

TI Design and simulation of QCA-based 3-bit binary to gray and vice versa
   code converter in reversible and non-reversible mode
SO OPTIK
AB The current Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology has reached its peak due to the fundamental physical limits of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS). Quantumdot Cellular Automata (QCA) is considered a proper alternative to CMOS technology in digital circuit design. QCA has features like low power, small area, and high speed in nanoscale digital circuit design. A code converter is a circuit that converts a determined code to another one. Code converters such as Binary to Gray, Gray to Binary, and Binary to BCD converters have a crucial role in fast signal processing in digital systems. Also, code converters are used as a base unit for data transmission into the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform processes. A Binary-to-Gray converter converts the input data to a Gray number. In this paper, we propose a 3-bit Binary to Gray and vice versa code converter in QCA. Previous proposed designs could only convert Binary to Gray code or vice versa, but the proposed design convert both B2G and G2B codes into a circuit. We design our circuit in both reversible and non-reversible modes. The simulation of the proposed design is done using the QCADesigner 2.0.3 tools. The simulation results show that the proposed design is superior to the existing designs in terms of evaluation parameters such as cell count, area, latency, and quantum cost.

TI A many-body quantum model is proposed as the mechanism responsible for
   accelerating rates of heat uptake by oceans as anthropogenic heat inputs
   rise
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB A recent many-body quantum approach to thermal radiation (Smith GB, et al 2022 J. Phys. Commun.6, 065004) reveals that the energy capacitance of heated water is about twice its heat capacitance, due to energy stored as local hybrid pairs of photons coupled resonantly to local matter excitations, with pair density weighted by mass density. Energy exchange between photons and localised dipole excitations inside water at steady temperature T, occurs at sites where a hybridisation potential within the Hamiltonian couples local oscillation modes to 'free' photon modes. Photon modes in both directions are phase retarded at exit sides of a hybrid site. Optically sharp variations with frequency in the index of refraction n(f) and photon density of states follow. Exit spectral intensities at equilibrium temperature T carry quantum information on the energy density of matter excitations coupled to photons, while occupied hybrid sites are the source of all 'free' photons and internal spectral intensities. The matter excitations coupled locally to photons are distinct from those that define specific heat, but in water both arise from molecular oscillations. The energy capacitance C-EX(T) of hybrid pairs depends on mass density and is independent of the heat capacitance C-HT(T), which sets temperature T. C-EX(T) is sensitive to T and doubles as a capacitance of energy and of 'quantum information'. Expressions for C-EX(T) are derived from first principles and applied to water. The density of occupied hybrids is amplified near surfaces by photons reflected off the surface, which create new hybrid pairs, but not extra heat. Energy capacitance C-EX(T)+C-HT(T) sets dT(t)/dt prior to a new equilibrium state emerging, after input heating rate dQ/dt is switched. Rising atmospheric intensities then raise T, dQ/dt, C-EX(T) and C-HT(T). The times available to cool overnight are fixed, so that a rising capacitance, adds to energy stored at an accelerating rate.

TI Conserved Quantities in Linear and Nonlinear Quantum Search
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB In this tutorial, which contains some original results, we bridge the fields of quantum computing algorithms, conservation laws, and many-body quantum systems by examining three algorithms for searching an unordered database of size N using a continuous-time quantum walk, which is the quantum analogue of a continuous-time random walk. The first algorithm uses a linear quantum walk, and we apply elementary calculus to show that the success probability of the algorithm reaches 1 when the jumping rate of the walk takes some critical value. We show that the expected value of its Hamiltonian H0 is conserved. The second algorithm uses a nonlinear quantum walk with effective Hamiltonian H(t) = H-0 + lambda|psi|(2), which arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing Bose-Einstein condensates. When the interactions between the bosons are repulsive, lambda > 0, and there exists a range of fixed jumping rates such that the success probability reaches 1 with the same asymptotic runtime of the linear algorithm, but with a larger multiplicative constant. Rather than the effective Hamiltonian, we show that the expected value of H-0+(1)(2)lambda|psi|(2)is conserved. The third algorithm utilizes attractive interactions, corresponding to lambda < 0. In this case, there is a time-varying critical function for the jumping rate gamma(c)(t) that causes the success probability to reach 1 more quickly than in the other two algorithms, and we show that the expected value of H(t)/[gamma(c)(t)N] is conserved.

TI Q-RTOP: Quantum-Secure Random Transaction Ordering Protocol for
   Mitigating Maximal Extractable Value Attacks in Blockchains With a
   Priority Gas-Fee Policy
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Public blockchains, such as Ethereum, rely on decentralized networks of peer-to-peer nodes known as validators or miners to verify all transactions and create new valid blocks. These validators can prioritize transactions, primarily based on high gas fees, allowing miners to maximize their block rewards, a concept referred to as maximal extractable value (MEV). However, MEV is vulnerable to front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks (FBSAs), and is exploited by malicious nodes and bots to manipulate users' valuable transactions. These malicious activities adversely impact the Blockchain's scalability, transparency, and security. Flashbots, as one of the solutions, introduces centralization since all nodes have to forward all blocks to the central node. To address these issues, we have designed a new Blockchain transaction ordering protocol called Quantum Random Transaction Ordering Protocol (Q-RTOP). The proposed protocol operates on top of the existing Blockchain transaction ordering mechanism. However, instead of allowing validators to select transactions based on high gas fees, decentralized nodes running Q-RTOP securely randomize all transactions and then forward them to the validators, which proceed with the block validation without any change. Our protocol primarily focuses on randomizing transactions before being processed by the validators by utilizing a quantum random generator as a secure source of randomness. The final results demonstrated that Q-RTOP effectively secured user transactions and randomized 8192 transactions within 25 milliseconds.

TI Image Denoising Based on Quantum Calculus of Local Fractional Entropy
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Images are frequently disrupted by noise of all kinds, making image restoration very challenging. There have been many different image denoising models proposed over the last few decades. Some models preserve the image's smooth region, while others preserve the texture margin. One of these methods is by using quantum calculus. Quantum calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of functions and operators in a quantum mechanical setting. It has been used in image processing to improve the speed and accuracy of image-processing algorithms. In quantum computing, entropy can be defined as a measure of the disorder or randomness of a quantum state. The concept of local fractional entropy has been used to study a wide range of quantum systems. In this study, an image denoising model is proposed based on the quantum calculus of local fractional entropy (QC-LFE) to remove a Gaussian noise. The local fractional entropy is used to estimate the image pixel probability, while the quantum calculus is used to estimate the convolution window mask for image denoising. A processing fractional mask with n x n elements was used in the suggested denoising algorithm. The proposed image denoising algorithm uses mask convolution to process each corrupted pixel one at a time. The proposed denoising algorithm's effectiveness is assessed using peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual perception (PSNR). The experimental findings show that, compared to other similar fractional operators, the proposed method can better preserve texture details when denoising.

TI Self-organized magnon condensation in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared
   cuprates without external magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multimagnon bound states were predicted nearly a century ago and have since been a key topic in condensed matter physics due to their intriguing quantum properties. However, their realization in natural materials remains elusive, especially in low-dimensional quantum magnets, where stabilizing them is particularly challenging due to the traditionally required extremely high external magnetic fields near or below presently available experimentally achieved fields using pulsed techniques in spite of corresponding resolution problems. However, these difficulties may be circumvented considering the much easier and convenient experimental case of ambient external magnetic fields. Therefore, we introduce a mechanism that enables the stabilization of multimagnon bound states in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates. Our theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data, demonstrates that small antiferromagnetic interchain couplings act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting a collinear antiferromagnetic order and enabling magnon condensation even at zero external field. This intrinsic stabilization mechanism eliminates the need for high external fields, offering a platform that is more accessible for experimental realization. We validate this concept by applying it to representative materials such as Li2CuO2, Ca2Y2Cu5O10, LiCuSbO4, and PbCuSO4(OH)2. Beyond its experimental feasibility, this mechanism could drive advancements in magnon-based quantum computing, low-power spintronic devices, and high-speed magnonic circuits. Moreover, our findings reveal that small interchain and/or interlayer couplings can generally unlock previously overlooked magnetic phenomena, redefining the nature of magnetically ordered states and expanding the frontiers of quantum magnetism.

TI Securing 5G Wireless Networks With Advanced Key Management and
   Authentication for Enhanced Data Protection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AB The deployment of 5G technology marks a significant milestone in wireless communication, offering unparalleled speed, low latency, and the capacity to connect billions of devices through the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these advancements introduce considerable security challenges due to the increased complexity and scale of 5G networks, as well as the growing threat landscape. This paper introduces a novel security framework for 5G networks, addressing these challenges with innovative cryptographic and authentication solutions. By integrating elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with quantum-resistant algorithms, the framework ensures secure key management that is future-proof against emerging threats, including those posed by quantum computing. Furthermore, the hybrid multifactor authentication system, encompassing biometric verification, one-time passwords (OTPs), and mutual authentication, provides a robust defense mechanism against unauthorized access and identity spoofing. Simulation results using NS3 demonstrate the model's superior performance, achieving 99.5% accuracy and low latency of 200 ms, surpassing traditional methods in both security and efficiency. The framework is further designed to withstand common cyberattacks, including man-in-the-middle and replay attacks, ensuring robust protection for critical applications like IoT ecosystems, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. This comprehensive approach not only enhances data protection and network security but also ensures scalability, adaptability, and energy efficiency, positioning the framework as a critical solution for next-generation communication systems and beyond.

TI A Small Change in Structure, a Big Change in Flexibility
SO MOLECULES
AB Studies of the rotational barrier energy of the amide bond using quantum computing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are focused mainly on its use as a model of the peptide bond. The results of these studies are valuable not only in terms of the fundamental conformational properties of amide bonds, but also in the design of molecular machines, which have recently attracted interest. We investigate the fluxionality of the amide and enamide bonds of compound 3-[(E)-(dimethylamino)methylidene]-1,1-dimethylurea using advanced dynamic NMR experiments and a theoretical evaluation of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The dynamic NMR study shows restricted rotation around the amide group (16.4 kcal/mol) and a very high barrier around the enamine group (18.6 kcal/mol). In a structurally similar compound, (E)-3-(dimethylamino)-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (N atom is replaced by CH), the amide barrier is 12.4 kcal/mol and the enamine barrier is 11.7 kcal/mol. The DFT studies of both compounds reveal the electronic origin of this phenomenon. Theoretical calculations reveal the origin of the higher enamine barrier. The better delocalization of the lone pair of electrons on the end nitrogen atom into the antibonding orbital of the neighboring C-N double bond leads to the better stabilization of the ground state, and this leads to a greater increase in the enamine barrier.

TI Imidosulfonate scorpionate ligands in lanthanide single-molecule magnet
   design: slow magnetic relaxation and butterfly hysteresis in
   [ClDy{Ph2PCH2S(NtBu)3}2</su
   b>]
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) harbour vast opportunities for potential pioneering applications upon optimization like big data storage and quantum computing. Lanthanides were found to be highly suitable candidates in the design of such molecules, as they intrinsically hold a large unquenched orbital momentum and a strong spin-orbit coupling, warranting a high magnetic anisotropy. An indispensable element in successfully tailoring SMMs is the ligand design. Polyimido sulfur ligands offer a promising choice because the polar S+-N--bond facilitates both electronic and geometric adaptability to various f-metals. In particular, the acute N-Ln-N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. The [Ph2PCH2S(NtBu)(3)](-) anion, introduced from [(thf)(3)K{Ph2PCH2S(NtBu)(3)}] (2) to a series of complexes [ClLn{Ph2PCH2S (NtBu)(3)}(2)] with Ln = Tb (3a), Dy (3b), Er (3c), Ho (3d), and Lu (3e), provides tripodal shielding of the metal's hemisphere as well as a side-arm donation of a soft phosphorus atom. For the Tb and Er complexes 3a and 3d, slow magnetic relaxation (U-eff = 235 and 34.5 cm(-1), respectively) was only observed under an applied dc field. The dysprosium congener 3b, however, is a true SMM with relaxation at zero field (U-eff = 66 cm(-1)) and showing a butterfly hysteresis close to 3.5 K. Upon magnetic dilution with the diamagnetic and isostructural lutetium complex 3e or application of a magnetic field, the energy barrier to spin reversal is increased to 74 cm(-1).

TI Spectral signature of high-order photon processes enhanced by
   Cooper-pair pairing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Inducing interactions between individual photons is key for photonic quantum information and studying many-body photon states. Superconducting circuits are well suited to combine strong interactions with low losses. Typically, microwave photons are stored in an LC oscillator shunted by a Josephson junction, where the zero-point phase fluctuations across the junction determine the strength and order of photon interactions. Most superconducting nonlinear oscillators operate with small phase fluctuations, where two-photon Kerr interactions dominate. In our experiment, we shunt a high-impedance LC oscillator with a dipole element favoring the tunneling of paired Cooper pairs. This leads to large phase fluctuations of 3.4, accessing a regime where transition frequencies shift non-monotonically with excitation number. From spectroscopy, we extract two-, three-, and four-photon interaction energies, all of similar strength and exceeding the photon loss rate. Our results open a new regime of high-order photon interactions in microwave quantum optics.

TI Quantum tomography of a third-order exceptional point in a dissipative
   trapped ion
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hermiticity in quantum mechanics ensures the reality of energies, while parity-time symmetry offers an alternative route. Interestingly, in a three-level system, parity-time symmetry-breaking can lead to third-order exceptional points with distinctive topological properties. Experimentally implementing this in open quantum systems requires two well-controlled loss channels, resulting in dynamics that challenges a pure non-Hermitian description. Here we address the challenge by employing two approaches to eliminate the effects of quantum jump terms, ensuring pure non-Hermitian dynamics in a dissipative trapped ion. Based on this, we experimentally observe a parity-time symmetry-breaking-induced third-order exceptional point through non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy. Quantum state tomography further demonstrates the coalescence of three eigenstates into a single eigenstate at the exceptional point. Finally, we identify an intrinsic third-order Liouvillian exceptional point via quench dynamics. Our experiments can be extended to observe other non-Hermitian phenomena involving multiple dissipative levels and potentially find applications in quantum information technology.

TI Ultrafast plasmonic rotors for electron beams
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The interaction between free electrons and laser-induced near-fields provides a platform to study ultrafast processes and quantum phenomena while enabling precise manipulation of electron wavefunctions through linear and orbital momentum transfer. Here, by introducing phase offset between two orthogonally polarized laser pulses exciting a gold nanorod, we generate a rotating plasmonic near-field dipole with clockwise and counterclockwise circulating orientations and investigate its interaction with a slow electron beam. Our findings reveal that the circulation direction of plasmonic fields plays a crucial role in modulating electron dynamics, enhancing coupling strength, and controlling recoil. Furthermore, synchronizing the interaction time of the electron beam with rotational dipolar plasmonic resonances results in significant transfer of angular momentum to the electron beams and deflects the electron wavepackets from their original trajectory. These findings highlight the potential of plasmon rotors for shaping electron wavepackets, offering promising applications in ultrafast microscopy, spectroscopy, and quantum information processing.

TI Mollow triplet in Two-Impurity dumbbell quantum dot
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The current study uses various computational methods to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a specific system-namely, a two-impurity, two-electron system within a dumbbell-shaped quantum dot. Initially, the single-electron, single-impurity problem is resolved using the effective mass approximation and the finite element method. Subsequently, a technique similar to the linear combination of atomic orbitals is applied to derive singlet-triplet states. The research work deeply investigates the key characteristics of the mentioned states, with a particular focus on their energy splitting and exchange times. Additionally, it highlights the dynamic evolution of the singlet-triplet two-level system, illustrating its manipulation through detuning and Rabi frequency. The Mollow triplet spectrum is also calculated and analyzed under various initial conditions. The findings of this research have significant implications across multiple domains, including the advancement of quantum information processing, the enhancement of optoelectronic device performance, and the development of innovative sensing and communication technologies.

TI Utilizing photonic band gap in triangular silicon carbide structures for
   efficient quantum nanophotonic hardware
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Silicon carbide is among the leading quantum information material platforms due to the long spin coherence and single-photon emitting properties of its color center defects. Applications of silicon carbide in quantum networking, computing, and sensing rely on the efficient collection of color center emission into a single optical mode. Recent hardware development in this platform has focused on angle-etching processes that preserve emitter properties and produce triangularly shaped devices. However, little is known about the light propagation in this geometry. We explore the formation of photonic band gap in structures with a triangular cross-section, which can be used as a guiding principle in developing efficient quantum nanophotonic hardware in silicon carbide. Furthermore, we propose applications in three areas: the TE-pass filter, the TM-pass filter, and the highly reflective photonic crystal mirror, which can be utilized for efficient collection and propagating mode selection of light emission.

TI Realization of superabsorption by time reversal of superradiance
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Emission and absorption of light lie at the heart of light-matter interaction(1). Although emission and absorption rates are regarded as intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules, various ways to modify these rates have been sought in applications such as quantum information processing(2), metrology(3) and light-energy harvesting(4). One promising approach is to utilize collective behaviour of emitters in the same way as in superradiances. Although superradiance has been observed in diverse systems(3,6-10), its conceptual counterpart in absorption has never been realized(11) until now. Here we demonstrate enhanced cooperative absorption-superabsorption-by implementing a time-reversal process of superradiance. The observed superabsorption rate is much higher than that of ordinary absorption, with the number of absorbed photons scaling with the square of the number of atoms, exhibiting the cooperative nature of superabsorption. The present superabsorption-which performs beyond the limitations of conventional absorption-can facilitate weak-signal sensing(1), light-energy harvesting(11) and light-matter quantum interfaces(2).

TI Enhancing Deepfake Detection Through Quantum Transfer Learning and
   Class-Attention Vision Transformer Architecture
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The widespread use of the internet, coupled with the increasing production of digital content, has caused significant challenges in information security and manipulation. Deepfake detection has become a critical research topic in both academic and practical domains, as it involves identifying forged elements in artificially generated videos using various deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques. In this dissertation, an innovative model was developed for detecting deepfake videos by combining the Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) and Class-Attention Vision Transformer (CaiT) architectures. The Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset was used for training, and a system capable of detecting spatiotemporal inconsistencies was constructed by integrating QTL and CaiT technologies. In addition to existing preprocessing methods in the literature, a novel preprocessing function tailored to the requirements of deep learning models was developed for the dataset. The advantages of quantum computing offered by QTL were merged with the global feature extraction capabilities of the CaiT. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a remarkable performance in detecting deepfake videos, with an accuracy of 90% and ROC AUC score of 0.94 achieved. The model's performance was compared with other methods evaluated on the DFDC dataset, highlighting its efficiency in resource utilization and overall effectiveness. The findings reveal that the proposed QTL-CaiT-based system provides a strong foundation for deepfake detection and contributes significantly to the academic literature. Future research should focus on testing the model on real quantum devices and applying it to larger datasets to further enhance its applicability.

TI Attribute-Based Authentication Scheme from Partial Encryption for
   Lattice with Short Key
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Wireless network is the basis of the Internet of things and the intelligent vehicle Internet. Due to the complexity of the Internet of things and intelligent vehicle Internet environment, the nodes of the Internet of things and the intelligent vehicle Internet are more vulnerable to malicious destruc- tion and attacks. Most of the proposed authentication and key agreement protocols for wireless networks are based on traditional cryptosystems such as large integer decomposition and elliptic curves. With the rapid development of quantum computing, these authentication protocols based on traditional cryptography will be more and more threatened, so it is necessary to design some authentication and key agreement protocols that can resist quantum attacks. In this paper, an anti-quantum authentication scheme for wireless networks based on lattice cryptosystem is constructed. In the attribute-based authentication scheme, the length of the authenticated public-private key pair depends on the maximum order and complexity of the formula in the algorithm. In the attribute-based authentication scheme, there is a certain correlation between the authenticated data and the attribute value of the user in the scheme. We show that the attribute-based authentication scheme gives an attribute-based with smaller public-private key pairs. The security of the attribute-based authentication scheme is based on the sub-exponential hard problem of the LWE (Learning With Errors). The Q -poly made by the adversary in the scheme, and our attribute-based authentication scheme guarantees that private data about user attributes and ciphertext cannot be obtained by malicious attackers.

TI QuSplit: achieving both high fidelity and throughput via job splitting
   on noisy quantum computers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB With the progression into the quantum utility era, computing is shifting toward quantum-centric architectures, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computing resources. Platforms such as IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket exemplify this trend, enabling access to diverse quantum backends. However, efficient resource management remains a challenge, as quantum processors are highly susceptible to noise, which significantly impacts computation fidelity. Additionally, the heterogeneous noise characteristics across different processors add further complexity to scheduling and resource allocation. Existing scheduling strategies typically focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - among the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era - we hypothesize that executing the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly improve overall fidelity. To verify this, we use VQE as a case study and develop a Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework that incorporates job splitting to optimize fidelity and throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently maintains high fidelity across all jobs while significantly enhancing system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent scalability in handling an increasing number of quantum processors and larger workloads, making it a robust and practical solution for emerging quantum computing platforms. To further substantiate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a real quantum processor, IBM Strasbourg, which confirm that job splitting improves fidelity and reduces the number of iterations required for convergence.

TI Dynamical phase transition and selective energy exchange in dual-cavity
   optochanical systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, the cavity quantum photomechanics has been developed rapidly, and played a very important role in quantum information processing, quantum basic principle verification, and high-precision measurement. The kinds of quantum mechanical behaviors have also been explored and discovered in the study of cavity mechanics. By placing the Kerr medium in the system, quantum nonlinearity is introduced into the optomechanical system. Quantum phase transition is a relatively important part in the research of condensed matter physics. Since Dicke quantum phase transition was successfully observed experimentally, the problem of quantum phase transition in the optical cavity has attracted more attention. The spin-coherent-state variation method and the Holstein-Primakoff transformation are used to theoretically calculate the ground state energy functional, and the rich structure of the macroscopic multi-particle quantum state is given by adjusting the parameters. The quantum phase transition evolution equation describes the relationship between each phase and the time of generating a new phase when reaching the critical phase transition point. At the same time, the mode squeezing of multi-mode hybrid optomechanical system has also became one of the basic problems of quantum mechanical behavior in cavity quantum dynamics.
   In this article, we explore the quantum dynamics of optomechanical devices including single-cavity and dual-cavities. We find that the system will undergo a dynamic phase transition, which is similar to the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb superradiant type phase transition, and a new dynamic critical point appears in the coupling between the momentum quadratures of the two optical fields. By manipulating the coupling parameters, we can achieve selective energy exchange between any two modes and the critical coupling point corresponds to selective energy exchange. Mode squeezing, which is easy to measure by applying the quantum uncertainty relationship, is also revealed and consistent with selective energy exchange. The study of coordinate and momentum variances gives us the revelation that the compressed orthogonal variables are the most suitable for measurement because of the small quantum noise. In fact, phononic modes can store energy in a longer duration, while photonic modes can transfer energy in a long distance. This phenomenon makes the hybrid optomechanical cavities useful in the next-generation quantum communications and quantum information processing units.

TI Quantum approximate optimization algorithms for maximum cut on low-girth
   graphs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Maximum cut (MaxCut) on graphs is a classic NP-hard problem. In quantum computing, Farhi, Gutmann, and Goldstone proposed the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for solving the MaxCut problem. Its guarantee on the cut fraction (the fraction of edges in the output cut over all edges) was mainly studied for high-girth graphs, i.e., graphs with only long cycles. On the other hand, low-girth graphs are ubiquitous in theoretical computer science, including expander graphs, which are outstanding examples with wide applications in theory and beyond. In this paper, we apply QAOA to MaxCut on a set of expander graphs proposed by Mohanty and O'Donnell, known as additive product graphs. Additionally, we apply multi-angle QAOA (ma-QAOA) to better utilize the graph structure of additive product graphs in the ansatz design. In theory, we derive an iterative formula to calculate the expected cut fraction of such graphs. This formula also extends to the quantum MaxCut problem. On the other hand, we conduct numerical experiments to compare the best-known classical local algorithms and QAOA with constant depth. Our results demonstrate that QAOA outperforms these best-known classical algorithms by 0.3% to 5.2% on several additive product graphs, while ma-QAOA further enhances this advantage by an additional 0.6% to 2.5%. In particular, we observe cases in which ma-QAOA exhibits superiority over the best-known classical algorithms but QAOA does not. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to planar graphs, such as tiling grid graphs, where QAOA also demonstrates an advantage.

AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is introduced to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Despite the promise of QAOA, the cost of executing QAOA circuits at scale for quantum advantage may still be excessive for the near-future quantum device. We observe the increasing overhead of QAOA circuit execution in the native gate translation. To execute QAOA circuits on a real quantum computing device, Hamiltonians composed of predefined specific rotations (e.g., ZZ and X) should be decomposed into finite native gates. By adopting rotational combinations that utilize native gates more directly than the standard QAOA circuit model, the execution cost on real quantum devices can be reduced. In this study, we propose Racoon (Rotational Space Virtualization for QAOA Ansatz), an algorithm-hardware co-design approach that revisits the synthesis conditions of QAOA circuits and selects alternative candidates with different rotational combinations. Our analysis of six commercial quantum processors demonstrates that applying Racoon to QAOA circuits for the 4-node Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model reduces the number of native gates by an average of 23% and up to 79%. Consequently, using Racoon results in 43% fewer training epochs, 41% lower training energy consumption, and a 6% improvement in inference on average compared to standard QAOA. Racoon consistently reduces circuit depth as the number of qubits and layers increases, achieving 123x more circuit depth reduction compared to the recently proposed Depth First Search (DFS)-based method. Furthermore, we confirm that Racoon's method can be extended to State-of-The-Art QAOAs with modified ansatze and to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

TI Hybrid genetic optimization for quantum feature map design
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Kernel methods are an import class of techniques in machine learning. To be effective, good feature maps are crucial for mapping non-linearly separable input data into a higher dimensional (feature) space, thus allowing the data to be linearly separable in feature space. Previous work has shown that quantum feature map design can be automated for a given dataset using NSGA-II, a genetic algorithm, while both minimizing circuit size and maximizing classification accuracy. However, the evaluation of the accuracy achieved by a candidate feature map is costly. In this work, we demonstrate the suitability of kernel-target alignment as a substitute for accuracy in genetic algorithm-based quantum feature map design. Kernel-target alignment is faster to evaluate than accuracy and does not require some data points to be reserved for its evaluation. To further accelerate the evaluation of genetic fitness, we provide a method to approximate kernel-target alignment. To improve kernel-target alignment and root mean squared error, the final trainable parameters of the generated circuits are further trained using COBYLA to determine whether a hybrid approach applying conventional circuit parameter training can easily complement the genetic structure optimization approach. A total of eight new approaches are compared to the original across nine varied binary classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository, showing that kernel-target alignment and its approximation produce feature map circuits enabling comparable accuracy to the previous work but with larger margins on training data (in excess of 20% larger) that improve further with circuit parameter training.

TI Compositional Control and Optimization of Molecular Beam Epitaxial
   Growth of
   (Sb2Te3)1-X(MnSb2Te<s
   ub>4)X Magnetic Topological Insulators
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Magnetic topological insulators such as MnBi2Te4 and MnSb2Te4 are promising hosts of novel physical phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and intrinsic axion insulator state, both potentially important for the implementation in topological spintronics and error-free quantum computing. In the bulk, the materials are antiferromagnetic, but appropriate stacking with nonmagnetic layers or excess Mn in the crystal lattice can induce a net ferromagnetic alignment. Accurate control of the materials growth is thus essential to optimize the magnetic properties. In this work, we report a detailed investigation of the growth of (Sb2Te3)(1-x)(MnSb2Te4)(x) layers with varying Mn content by molecular beam epitaxy. The Mn flux fraction provided during growth controls the percent of MnSb2Te4 that is formed in the resulting layers by a self-assembly process. Highly crystalline layers with compositions varying between Sb2Te3 (x = 0) and MnSb2Te4(x = 1) were obtained. The results show that Mn is incorporated as a structural component to form septuple layers (SLs) of MnSb2Te4. Excess Mn was observed in the samples, suggesting that it is incorporated as antisite defects into both Sb2Te3 and MnSb2Te4. Two modifications of the growth conditions were implemented to enhance the incorporation of Mn as a structural element to form MnSb2Te4 SLs: annealing of a thin portion of the layer at the beginning of growth (preannealing step) and increasing the growth temperature. Both result in a larger percent of MnSb2Te4 SLs for similar Mn flux fractions during growth, increasing the control of the growth and providing insight into the Mn incorporation process.

TI Refrigeration in Adiabatically Confined Anisotropic Transition Metal
   Complexes Induced by Sudden Magnetic Field Quenching
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB The article is devoted to the theoretical development of the mechanisms of molecular refrigeration, the area combining molecular magnetism and material science with promise for low-temperature physics and quantum computing, where conventional principles of refrigeration become inefficient. Given this general trend, we propose the concept of the magnetothermal effect in magnetically anisotropic complexes of 3d metal ions, caused by fast magnetic field quenching. Within this concept, the most topical case of an axially magnetically anisotropic system isolated from the environment by adiabatic envelope is analyzed. We evaluate the temperature change as a function of the initial temperature and magnetic field and also its dependence on the sign and the magnitude of the axial zero-field splitting parameter and the Debye temperature. Correlations are revealed between the sign of the magnetic anisotropy (dictated by the sign of the axial zero field splitting parameter) and the sign of the thermal effect (heating versus cooling) caused by field quenching. The temperature change is shown to be negative (cooling) in the case of complexes exhibiting easy-axis-type magnetic anisotropy, while for the case of easy-plane-type anisotropy, it proves to be positive (heating). The thermal effects are shown to have an efficient control by varying the initially applied field. These findings allow us to propose complexes exhibiting easy-axis-type magnetic anisotropy as candidates for achieving a low-temperature refrigeration effect caused by fast field quenching and also to employ the established magnetothermal correlations to the analysis of magnetic anisotropy.

TI Compact, spatial-mode-interaction-free, ultralow-loss, nonlinear
   photonic integrated circuits
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Multi-mode waveguides are ubiquitously used in integrated photonics. Although interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes can induce novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically undesired. Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends, have been favoured to suppress spatial mode interaction. Here, we adapt and optimize Euler bends to build compact racetrack microresonators based on ultralow-loss, multi-mode, silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The racetrack microresonators feature a footprint of only 0.21 mm(2) for 19.8 GHz free spectral range, suitable for tight photonic integration. We quantitatively investigate the suppression of spatial mode interaction in the racetrack microresonators with Euler bends. We show that the low optical loss rate (15.5 MHz) is preserved, on par with the mode interaction strength (25 MHz). This results in an unperturbed microresonator dispersion profile. We further generate a single dissipative Kerr soliton of 19.8 GHz repetition rate without complex laser tuning schemes or auxiliary lasers. The optimized Euler bends and racetrack microresonators can be building blocks for integrated nonlinear photonic systems, as well as linear circuits for programmable processors or photonic quantum computing.
   Adiabatic bends are used to reduce the optical loss of waveguides for integrated optics, but quantitative analysis of their adiabaticity have not been reported. Here, racetrack microresonators with circular and Euler bends are compared quantitatively, showing that the adiabatic Euler bends can preserve low optical loss and avoid spatial mode interaction in multimode waveguides.

TI Optimizing Berth-quay Crane Allocation considering Economic Factors
   Using Chaotic Quantum SSA
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB With the regular development of the global epidemic, the global port shipping supply is tight. The problem of port congestion, soaring freight rates, and hard-to-find container space has emerged. This paper proposes a new joint berth-quay crane allocation model, namely E-B&QC, by taking the minimum of the time in the port of the ship, the cost of extra transportation distance for collector trucks in the land area of the port, and the cost of extra waiting time for ships. Then, the deficiencies of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) are considered in solving the E-B&QC model, and the SSA is improved based on the three-dimensional Cat chaos mapping and quantum computing theory. Chaotic Quantum Sparrow Search Algorithm (CQSSA) is proposed, population individual coding rules are formulated, also E-B&QC model solving algorithm is established. Finally, a new berth-crane allocation optimization method, namely, E-B&QC-CQSSA, is proposed. Subsequently, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed allocation model and solution algorithm are tested according to the actual data of a small river port in the south and a medium-sized river port in the north. Simulation examples show that the E-B&QC model can develop different high-quality solutions for container ports under different working conditions, and the more complex the actual situation of the port, the more significant the optimization effect. The proposed CQSSA for E-B&QC model can obtain a better solution.

TI Inter-Kramers electric quadrupole transitions in high-spin systems
   induced by resonant alternating inhomogeneous electric field
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study presents a theoretical analysis of the interaction of high-spin systems with inhomogeneous alternating electric field and homogeneous alternating magnetic field that induce electric quadrupole (QT, E2) and magnetic dipole transitions (MT, M1), respectively. In order to distinguish QTs from MTs, an analytical expression for the intensities and selection rules for a model system with a half-integer total spin S = 3 / 2 was derived using the spin Hamiltonian and operator-equivalent approaches. The direct comparison of the absorption patterns for the QT and MT of a model high-spin Co(II) system was performed in a frequency domain corresponding to Frequency Domain Fourier Transform Terahertz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. This type of systems often exhibits the properties of a single molecular magnet at helium temperatures and is characterized by a large zero field splitting. Despite more flexible selection rules for electric quadrupole transitions, the powder spectra of QT and MT were shown to be similar, emphasizing the need for precise spectral measurements to determine the dominant transition type in high-spin systems. The approach developed in the paper not only solves a rather complex quantum mechanical problem that includes the estimation of the quadrupole moment of unpaired electrons, but also demonstrates a possible way for advanced manipulation of spin states, a capability crucial for the development of quantum computing and information storage technologies.

TI Future-proofing genomic data and consent management: a comprehensive
   review of technology innovations
SO GIGASCIENCE
AB Genomic information is increasingly used to inform medical treatments and manage future disease risks. However, any personal and societal gains must be carefully balanced against the risk to individuals contributing their genomic data. Expanding our understanding of actionable genomic insights requires researchers to access large global datasets to capture the complexity of genomic contribution to diseases. Similarly, clinicians need efficient access to a patient's genome as well as population-representative historical records for evidence-based decisions. Both researchers and clinicians hence rely on participants to consent to the use of their genomic data, which in turn requires trust in the professional and ethical handling of this information.Here, we review existing and emerging solutions for secure and effective genomic information management, including storage, encryption, consent, and authorization that are needed to build participant trust. We discuss recent innovations in cloud computing, quantum-computing-proof encryption, and self-sovereign identity. These innovations can augment key developments from within the genomics community, notably GA4GH Passports and the Crypt4GH file container standard. We also explore how decentralized storage as well as the digital consenting process can offer culturally acceptable processes to encourage data contributions from ethnic minorities.We conclude that the individual and their right for self-determination needs to be put at the center of any genomics framework, because only on an individual level can the received benefits be accurately balanced against the risk of exposing private information.

TI Drug Discovery for Mycobacterium tuberculosis Using
   Structure-Based Computer-Aided Drug Design Approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Developing new, more effective antibiotics against resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibit its essential proteins is an appealing strategy for combating the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. Finding a compound that can target a particular cavity in a protein and interrupt its enzymatic activity is the crucial objective of drug design and discovery. Such a compound is then subjected to different tests, including clinical trials, to study its effectiveness against the pathogen in the host. In recent times, new techniques, which involve computational and analytical methods, enhanced the chances of drug development, as opposed to traditional drug design methods, which are laborious and time-consuming. The computational techniques in drug design have been improved with a new generation of software used to develop and optimize active compounds that can be used in future chemotherapeutic development to combat global tuberculosis resistance. This review provides an overview of the evolution of tuberculosis resistance, existing drug management, and the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs developed based on the contributions of computational techniques. Also, we show an appraisal of available software and databases on computational drug design with an insight into the application of this software and databases in the development of anti-tubercular drugs. The review features a perspective involving machine learning, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and CRISPR combination with available computational techniques as a prospective pathway to design new anti-tubercular drugs to combat resistant tuberculosis.

TI Optically assisted loading of single micro-diamonds in a Stylus trap
   under ambient conditions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The controlled trapping of micro- to submicrometer-sized particles is crucial for fundamental research, precision metrology, and applied technologies. However, existing loading methods often rely on stochastic processes, leading to low reproducibility and limited scalability. Here, we present an optically assisted deterministic loading method for integrating charged micro- and submicrometer particles into a so-called Stylus trap with high-optical access under ambient conditions. A focused laser beam dislodges particles from a reservoir, guiding them into the trap via radiation pressure, electrostatic forces, and background air collisions. By optimizing key parameters, we achieve 95 - 6 + 2 % loading efficiency and near-linear control over the number of trapped particles. Our scalable and reproducible approach enables precise particle manipulation, bridging atomic physics techniques with applications in quantum technology, nano-mechanics, and sensing. Future developments will focus on extending the method to vacuum environments and refining charge control mechanisms for enhanced selectivity. (C) 2025 Author(s).

TI State carving in a chirally-coupled atom-nanophotonic cavity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherent quantum control of multiqubit systems represents one of the challenging tasks in quantum science and quantum technology. Here we theoretically investigate the reflectivity spectrum in an atom-nanophotonic cavity with collective nonreciprocal couplings. In the strong-coupling regime with a high cooperativity, we theoretically predict distinct on-resonance spectral dips owing to destructive interferences of chiral couplings. Due to the well-separated multiple dips in the spectrum, a contrasted reflectivity suggests a new control knob over the desired entangled state preparation in the basis of coupled and uncoupled states from the atoms' internal hyperfine ground states. We propose to utilize such atom-nanophotonic cavity to quantum engineer the atomic internal states via photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions in the coupled state and the chirality of decay channels, where the atomic Bell state and W states for arbitrary number of atoms can be tailored and heralded by state carving in the single-photon reflection spectrum. Our results pave the way toward quantum engineering of multiqubit states and offer new opportunities for coherent and scalable multipartite entanglement transport in atoms coupled to nanophotonic devices.

TI Replacing Doping in Nano-Silicon: Ultimate Miniaturization, Energy
   Efficiency, and Cryo-Functionality
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Hard entropy limits of impurity doping prevent further miniaturization of low nanoscale silicon-based very large scale integration (VLSI) devices, thereby obstructing the path toward more energy-efficient VLSI designs with higher yield in compute power. As demonstrated here by synchrotron UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy in total fluorescence yield mode (XAS-TFY), intrinsic Si at the bottom of the nanoscale (i-nano-Si) turns into strong p- or n-Si by embedding in silicon nitride (Si3N4) or silicon dioxide (SiO2), respectively. The associated Nanoscale Electronic Structure Shift Induced by Anions at Surfaces (NESSIAS) creates a p/n junction in i-nano-Si by the quantum-chemical impact of Si3N4- vs SiO2-coating, providing energy landscapes to accumulate electrons (holes) when SiO2- (Si3N4-) coated, with free charge carriers provided by metallic interconnects. Hybrid density functional theory (h-DFT) calculations demonstrate Si NWire FETs with physical gate lengths down to 3 nm, while the electronic structure remains stable under carrier injection. A mesoscopic band model derived from synchrotron characterization data on ultrathin embedded Si nanowells (NWells), and from h-DFT confirms and further explains the NESSIAS impact to generate p/n homojunctions in i-nano-Si. Presenting a paradigm shift for Si-based VLSI, NESSIAS removes miniaturization limits, achieves faster charge carrier transport with massive reductions of energy demand and associated heat generation as required for ultralow power VLSI, and enables full cryo-functionality for quantum computing.

TI Applicability of Machine Learning and Mathematical Equations to the
   Prediction of Total Organic Carbon in Cambrian Shale, Sichuan Basin,
   China
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Accurate Total Organic Carbon (TOC) prediction in the deeply buried Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation shale is constrained by extreme heterogeneity (TOC variability: 0.5-12 wt.%, mineral composition Coefficient of Variation > 40%) and ambiguous geophysical responses. This study introduces three key innovations to address these challenges: (1) A Dynamic Weighting-Calibrated Random Forest Regression (DW-RFR) model integrating high-resolution Gamma-Ray-guided dynamic time warping (+/- 0.06 m depth alignment precision derived from 237 core-log calibration points using cross-validation), Principal Component Analysis-Deyang-Anyue Rift Trough Shapley Additive Explanations (PCA-SHAP) hybrid feature engineering (89.3% cumulative variance, VIF < 4), and Bayesian-optimized ensemble learning; (2) systematic benchmarking against conventional Delta logR (R2 = 0.700, RMSE = 0.264) and multi-attribute joint inversion (R2 = 0.734, RMSE = 0.213) methods, demonstrating superior accuracy (R2 = 0.917, RMSE = 0.171); (3) identification of Gamma Ray (r = 0.82) and bulk density (r = -0.76) as principal TOC predictors, contrasted with resistivity's thermal maturity-dependent signal attenuation (r = 0.32 at Ro > 3.0%). The methodology establishes a transferable framework for organic-rich shale evaluation, directly applicable to the Longmaxi Formation and global Precambrian-Cambrian transition sequences. Future directions emphasize real-time drilling data integration and quantum computing-enhanced modeling for ultra-deep shale systems, advancing predictive capabilities in tectonically complex basins.

TI Narrow-Linewidth 852-nm DBR-LD with Self-Injection Lock Based on
   High-Finesse Optical Cavity Filtering
SO PHOTONICS
AB Narrow-linewidth lasers have a high spectral purity, long coherent length, and low phase noise, so they have important applications in atomic clocks, precision measurement, and quantum computing. We inject a transmitted laser from a narrow-linewidth (& SIM;15 kHz) flat-concave Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity made from ultra-low expansion (ULE) optical glass into an 852 nm distributed Bragg reflector-type laser diode (DBR-LD), of which the comprehensive linewidth is 1.67 MHz for the free running case. With an increase in the self-injection power, the laser linewidth gradually narrows, and the injection locking current range gradually increases. The narrowest linewidth measured by the delayed frequency-shifted self-heterodyne (DFSSH) method is about 365 Hz, which is about 1/4500 of the linewidth for the free running case. Moreover, to characterize the laser phase noise, we use a detuned F-P cavity to measure the conversion signal from the laser phase noise to the intensity noise for both the free running case and the self-injection lock case. The laser phase noise for the self-injection lock case is significantly suppressed in the analysis frequency range of 0.1-10 MHz compared to the free running case. In particular, the phase noise is suppressed by more than 30 dB at an analysis frequency of 100 kHz.

TI Observation of miniaturized bound states in the continuum with
   ultra-high quality factors
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Light trapping is a constant pursuit in photonics because of its importance in science and technology. Many mechanisms have been explored, including the use of mirrors made of materials or structures that forbid outgoing waves, and bound states in the continuum that are mirror-less but based on topology. Here we report a compound method, combining lateral mirrors and bound states in the continuum in a cooperative way, to achieve a class of on-chip optical cavities that have high quality factors and small modal volumes. Specifically, light is trapped in the transverse direction by the photonic band gap of the lateral hetero-structure and confined in the vertical direction by the constellation of multiple bound states in the continuum. As a result, unlike most bound states in the continuum found in photonic crystal slabs that are de-localized Bloch modes, we achieve light-trapping in all three dimensions and experimentally demonstrate quality factors as high as Q = 1.09 x 10(6) and modal volumes as low as V = 17.74 (lambda(0)/n)(3) in the telecommunication regime. We further prove the robustness of our method through the statistical study of multiple fabricated devices. Our work provides a new method of light trapping, which can find potential applications in photonic integration, nonlinear optics and quantum computing. (C) 2021 Science China Press.

TI Quantum Program Synthesis Through Operator Learning and Selection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Programming for quantum computers is complicated and time-consuming, because quantum operations are counterintuitive and their combined effects are difficult to understand. Existing tools allow automatic synthesis of quantum programs, which releases the burden of handwriting. However, many existing systems arrange predetermined operators in successive manner to gradually reduce the gap with requirements; these methods are quick but often produce lengthy programs, and they are difficult to adopt for new operators. Other systems depend on stochastic or heuristic search; they identify near-optimal programs for certain cases, but it is not easy to tune the algorithms for a wide range of cases. We propose a system that produces compact programs for most cases and easily evolves with new operators. The system automatically learns the roles of available operators by composing various possible programs. Based on the knowledge, it selects a subset of operators most appropriate for requirements and uses them to compose a program. The learning is geared toward concise programs; thus, the system tends to produce programs with the fewest operators possible. We implemented the system and evaluated it by synthesizing over 400 programs. In comparison with a state-of-the-art system, the proposed system produced programs with approximately 40-times fewer operators at the cost of increased synthesis time from seconds to minutes. We also observed that the system successfully adopted new operators by learning their differences from existing operators and utilizing them in right places. We believe that the system provides a basis of utilizing machine learning for quantum program synthesis.

TI Layering and subpool exploration for adaptive variational quantum
   eigensolvers: Reducing circuit depth, runtime, and susceptibility to
   noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers (ADAPT-VQEs) are promising candidates for simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum hardware. To further improve the noise resilience of these algorithms, recent efforts have been directed towards compactifying, or layering , their Ansatz circuits. Here, we broaden the understanding of the algorithmic layering process in three ways. First, we investigate the noncommutation relations between the different elements that are used to build ADAPT-VQE Ans & auml;tze . In doing so, we develop a framework for studying and developing layering algorithms, which produce shallower circuits. Second, based on this framework, we develop a new subroutine that can reduce the number of quantum-processor calls by optimizing the selection procedure with which a variational quantum algorithm appends Ansatz elements. Third, we provide a thorough numerical investigation of the noise-resilience improvement available via layering the circuits of ADAPT-VQE algorithms. We find that layering leads to an improved noise resilience with respect to amplitude-damping and dephasing noise, which, in general, affect idling and nonidling qubits alike. With respect to depolarizing noise, which tends to affect only actively manipulated qubits, we observe no advantage of layering.

TI Structural Insight into a Sixteen Cyanine Dye Construct via
   Exciton-Exciton Annihilation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Molecular (dye) aggregates play a prominent role in light harvesting and are of interest in quantum information science; however, there are limited reports that programmably assemble many (>4) dye aggregates featuring strong coupling and exciton delocalization. Using oligonucleotides with four Cy5s covalently linked in series along the phosphate backbone, we bring 4, 8, and 16 Cy5s in close proximity by assembling four-armed junctions. We elucidate their structure via gel electrophoresis and steady-state and transient optical spectroscopy. We find that Cy5 has a strong propensity to form tetramer clusters, where the exciton is delocalized over all 4 Cy5s, that the exciton is not delocalized beyond tetramer clusters in the 8 and 16 Cy5 constructs, and that the 16 Cy5 construct may consist of pairs of tetramer clusters that are isolated from one another. Many-dye aggregates such as these may serve useful as antennae for their intense light absorption and spatially directed energy transfer.

TI Optomechanical entanglement affected by exceptional point in a WGM
   resonator system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entanglement of optical mode and mechanical mode plays a significant role for quantum information processing and memory. This type of optomechanical entanglement is always be suppressed by the mechanically dark-mode (DM) effect. However, the reason of the DM generation and how to control the bright-mode (BM) effect flexibly are still not resolved. In this letter, we demonstrate that the DM effect occurs at the exceptional point (EP) and it can be broken by changing the relative phase angle (RPA) between the nano scatters. We find that the optical mode and mechanical mode are separable at EPs but entangled when the RPA is tuned away from the EPs. Remarkably, the DM effect will be broken if the RPA away from EPs, resulting in the ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode. In addition, we prove that the chirality of the system can also influence the optomechanical entanglement. Our scheme can control the entanglement flexible merely depend on the relative phase angle, which is continuously adjustable and experimentally more feasible.

TI Optical Ramsey spectroscopy on a single molecule
SO OPTICA
AB Organic chemistry offers the potential to synthesize individual molecules for specific tasks in quantum information processing. One of their striking properties is the emission of single photons with nearly ideal coherence. Here, we implement Ramsey spectroscopy to measure the electronic state coherence of a single molecule. Conventionally, the emitter's coherence is characterized by saturation or intensity auto-correlation measurements. However, both methods are under the steady influence of continuous interaction with the excitation laser. This influence can be eliminated by using a pump-probe sequence of two optical pulses to observe the decoherence. We have measured a near-transform-limited decoherence time of 17.6 ns, while the radiative lifetime is 10.1 ns. We also perform frequency-detuned excitation, gaining richer insights into the dephasing behavior of the molecule. The experiments exhibit that optical Ramsey spectroscopy is a promising tool for measuring the emitter's coherence properties.

TI Path-entangling evolution and quantum gravitational interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore a general feature of the interaction mediated by the gravitational fields of spatially superposed masses. For this purpose, based on quantum information theory, we characterize the evolution of two particles each in a superposition state of paths. The evolution is assumed to be given by a completely positive tracepreserving (CPTP) map. We further assume that the probability of a particle being on each path is unchanged during the evolution. This property is called population preserving. We examine when a population-preserving CPTP map can create entanglement in terms of separable operations, which form a large class of local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In general, entanglement is not always generated by inseparable or nonLOCC operations, and one can consider a model of gravity described by an inseparable operation which does not create entanglement. However, we find that a population-preserving CPTP map is inseparable if and only if it can create entanglement. This means that the above model of gravity is incompatible with the possible evolution of spatially superposed masses.

TI Quantum phase with spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in an
   extended diamond chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2 plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.

TI Experimental demonstration of generalized quantum fluctuation theorems
   in the presence of coherence
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Fluctuation theorems have elevated the second law of thermodynamics to a statistical realm by establishing a connection between time-forward and time-reversal probabilities, providing invaluable insight into nonequilibrium dynamics. While well established in classical systems, their quantum generalization, incorporating coherence and the diversity of quantum noise, remains open. We report the experimental validation of a quantum fluctuation theorem (QFT) in a photonic system, applicable to general quantum processes with nonclassical characteristics, including quasi-probabilistic descriptions of entropy production and multiple time-reversal processes. Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT. Moreover, coherence induced by a quantum process leads to the imaginary components of quantum entropy production, governing the phase factor in the QFT. These findings underscore the fundamental symmetry between a general quantum process and its time reversal, providing an elementary toolkit to explore noisy quantum information processing.

TI Low-loss nanoscale zero-index metawaveguides and metadevices
SO OPTICA
AB Zero-index metamaterials exhibit a uniform spatial phase distribution, promising numerous applications such as efficient electromagnetic tunneling and high-fidelity optical computing. These applications necessitate an integrated, low-loss zero-index waveguide platform for guiding, routing, and interfering light. Nevertheless, existing zero-index metamaterials grapple with substantial footprints, high losses, and limited flexibility. Here, we present low-loss nanoscale zero-index metawaveguides enabled by quasi-bound states in the continuum, formed through destructive interferences along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This metawaveguide's propagation loss is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the state-of-the-art zero-index waveguide. Leveraging the low loss and flexibility of this metawaveguide, we realized a zero-index metaring for the first time. This low-loss zero-index metawaveguide offers a versatile platform for integrated photonic circuits with minimal phase errors for classical and quantum information processing.

TI Steady-state subradiance manipulated by the two-atom decay
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate theoretically the collective radiance characteristics of an atomic ensemble with the simultaneous decay of two atoms. We show that the two-atom decay can significantly suppress the steady-state collective radiance of the atoms, expanding the region of subradiance. In the steady-state subradiance regime, the system is in an entangled state, and the mean populations of the system in the excited state and ground state of the atoms are almost equal. The processes of the two-atom decay can be demonstrated by the population distribution of the system state on the Dicke ladder. Moreover, we show the correlation property of the emitted light from the atomic ensemble, where the correlation function is rewritten in the presence of the two-atom decay. We find that the emitted photons of steady state only show bunching in the case of two-atom decay. This work broadens the realm of collective radiance, with potential applications for quantum information processing.

TI InAs/MoRe Hybrid Semiconductor/Superconductor Nanowire Devices
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Implementing superconductors capable of proximity-inducing a large energy gap in semiconductors in the presence of strong magnetic fields is a major goal toward applications of semiconductor/superconductor hybrid materials in future quantum information technologies. Here, we study the performance of devices consisting of InAs nanowires in electrical contact with molybdenum-rhenium (MoRe) superconducting alloys. The MoRe thin films exhibit transition temperatures of similar to 10 K and critical fields exceeding 6 T. Normal/superconductor devices enabled tunnel spectroscopy of the corresponding induced superconductivity, which was maintained up to similar to 10 K, and MoRebased Josephson devices exhibited supercurrents and multiple Andreev reflections. We determine an induced superconducting gap lower than expected from the transition temperature and observe gap softening at finite magnetic field. These may be common features for hybrids based on large-gap, type II superconductors. The results encourage further development of MoRe-based hybrids.

TI Nonadiabatic quantum control of valley states in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Nonadiabatic quantum effects, often experimentally observed in semiconductor nanodevices such as single-electron pumps operating at high frequencies, can result in undesirable and uncontrollable behavior. However, when combined with the valley degree of freedom inherent to silicon, these unfavourable effects may be leveraged for quantum information processing schemes. By using an explicit time evolution of the Schrodinger equation, we study numerically nonadiabatic transitions between the two lowest valley states of an electron in a quantum dot formed in a SiGe/Si heterostructure. The presence of a single-atomic layer step at the top SiGe/Si interface opens an anticrossing in the electronic spectrum as the center of the quantum dot is varied. We show that an electric field applied perpendicularly to the interface allows tuning of the anticrossing energy gap. As a result, by moving the electron through this anticrossing, and by electrically varying the energy gap, it is possible to electrically control the probabilities of the two lowest valley states.

TI Reprogrammable and high-precision holographic optical addressing of
   trapped ions for scalable quantum control
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-precision, individually programmable manipulation of quantum particles is crucial for scaling up quantum information processing (QIP) systems such as laser-cooled trapped-ions. However, restricting undesirable "crosstalk" in optical manipulation of ion qubits is fundamentally challenging due to micron-level inter-ion separation. Further, inhomogeneous ion spacing and high susceptibility to aberrations at UV wavelengths suitable for most ion-species pose severe challenges. Here, we demonstrate high-precision individual addressing (lambda =369.5 nm) of Yb+ using a reprogrammable Fourier hologram. The precision is achieved through in-situ aberration characterization via the trapped ion, and compensating (to lambda /20) with the hologram. Using an iterative Fourier transformation algorithm (IFTA), we demonstrate an ultra-low (<10(-4)) intensity crosstalk error in creating arbitrary pair-wise addressing profiles, suitable for over fifty ions. This scheme relies on standard commercial hardware, can be readily extended to over a hundred ions, and adapted to other ion-species and quantum platforms.

TI Room-temperature valley-selective emission in Si-MoSe2
   heterostructures enabled by high-quality-factor chiroptical cavities
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides possess valley pseudospin, enabling coupling between photon spin and electron spin for classical and quantum information processing. However, rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission in MoSe2 monolayers independent of excitation polarization. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of similar to 13. Our work could facilitate the development of ultracompact chiral classical and quantum light sources.

TI Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm of quantum Monte Carlo to extract
   large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entanglement entropy (EE) plays a central role in the intersection of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. However, scanning the EE for two-dimensional and higher-dimensional systems still remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme capable of extracting large-scale data of R & eacute;nyi EE with high precision and low technical barrier. Its advantages lie in the following aspects: a single simulation can obtain the continuous variation curve of EE with respect to parameters, greatly reducing the computational cost; the algorithm implementation is simplified, and there is no need to alter the spacetime manifold during the simulation, making the code easily extendable to various many-body models. Additionally, we introduce a formula to calculate the derivative of EE without resorting to numerical differentiation from dense EE data. We then demonstrate the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points, critical exponents, and various phases.

TI Epitaxial integration of superconducting nitrides with cubic GaN
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Epitaxial combination of transition metal nitrides and group III-nitrides holds significant potential for novel device architectures, given their wide array of properties and similar lattice constants. However, the mixture of hexagonal and cubic crystals limits structural quality and has stymied development. This work will discuss the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of metastable cubic GaN on 3C-SiC templates and its integration with cubic ZrN and NbN superconductors in single and multilayer heterostructures. The fully cubic nature of GaN and the epitaxial nature of all layers are confirmed via in situ and ex situ techniques. The electrical transport properties of transition metal nitrides on cubic GaN (001) are compared to those grown directly on 3C-SiC (001) and c-plane hexagonal GaN templates. The determination of a similar growth window for cubic wide-bandgap and superconducting metal nitrides creates a platform for new epitaxial device architectures and potential applications in metamaterials, quantum information science, and condensed matter physics.

TI The quantum anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional hexagonal
   monolayers studied by first-principles calculations
SO ISCIENCE
AB The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) demonstrates the potential for achieving quantized Hall resistance without the need for an external magnetic field, making it highly promising for reducing energy loss in electronic devices. Its realization and research rely heavily on precise first-principles calculations, which are essential for analyzing the electronic structures and topological properties of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials. This review article explores the theoretical progress of QAHE in 2D hexagonal monolayers with strong spin-orbit coupling and internal magnetic ordering. We summarize current strategies and methods for realizing QAHE in these monolayers, focusing on material selection and fine-tuning to achieve stable QAHE at room temperature. We hope that this review will provide new perspectives for theoretical studies and enable researchers to more accurately predict materials with superior QAHE properties. Meanwhile, we anticipate that these theoretical advancements will further drive breakthroughs in experimental studies and promote its broader application in low-power electronic devices and quantum information technology.

TI When entanglement harvesting is not really harvesting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We revisit the entanglement harvesting protocol when two detectors are in causal contact. We study the role of field-mediated communication in generating entanglement between the two detectors interacting with a quantum field. We provide a quantitative estimator of the relative contribution of communication versus genuine entanglement harvesting. For massless scalar fields in flat spacetime, we show that when two detectors can communicate via the field, the detectors do not really harvest entanglement from the field, and instead they get entangled only via the field-mediated communication channel. In other words, in these scenarios the entanglement harvesting protocol is truly "harvesting entanglement" from the field only when the detectors are not able to communicate. In contrast, for massive scalar fields both communication and genuine harvesting contribute equally to the bipartite entanglement when the detectors are causally connected. These results emphasize the importance of taking into account the causal relationships between two parties involved in this relativistic quantum information protocol before we can declare that it is truly entanglement harvesting.

TI Optimized Detection of High-Dimensional Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement detection is one of the most conventional tasks in quantum information processing. While most experimental demonstrations of high-dimensional entanglement rely on fidelity-based witnesses, these are powerless to detect entanglement within a large class of entangled quantum states, the so-called unfaithful states. In this Letter, we introduce a highly flexible automated method to construct optimal tests for entanglement detection given a bipartite target state of arbitrary dimension, faithful or unfaithful, and a set of local measurement operators. By restricting the number or complexity of the considered measurement settings, our method outputs the most convenient protocol which can be implemented using a wide range of experimental techniques such as photons, superconducting qudits, cold atoms, or trapped ions. With an experimental quantum optics setup that can prepare and measure arbitrary highdimensional mixed states, we implement some three-setting protocols generated by our method. These protocols allow us to experimentally certify two- and three-unfaithful entanglement in four-dimensional photonic states, some of which contain well above 50% of noise.

TI Temporal shaping of single photons by engineering exciton dynamics in a
   single quantum dot
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The majority of photonic quantum information technologies rely on single photons that have high purity and indistinguishability. Although solid-state quantum emitters can serve such single photons on demand, their asymmetric temporal and spatial mode profiles limit the optimal efficiency and fidelity of quantum interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-photon pulses at a telecom wavelength with a Gaussian-like temporal mode profile from a cavity-coupled single quantum dot. Engineering the exciton dynamics via multi-exciton cascade recombination and cavity detuning enables us to modify the rise and decay dynamics of single excitons. Furthermore, the cascade recombination process temporally retards the single-exciton emission from the background emission, leading to possible purification of single photons at high excitation power. In addition, coupling quantum dots into a low Q cavity mode leads to a Gaussian-like spatial mode profile, which brings a high collection efficiency. This approach paves the way for producing single photons with an optimized temporal and spatial waveform.

TI Quantum tasks require islands on the brane
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB In recent work, it was argued that quantum computations with inputs and outputs distributed in spacetime, or quantum tasks, impose constraints on entanglement in holographic theories. The resulting constraint was named the connected wedge theorem and can be verified by a direct bulk proof using focusing arguments in general relativity. In this article we extend this work to the context of AdS/BCFT, where an end-of-the-world brane is present in the bulk. By considering quantum tasks which exploit information localized to the brane, we find a new connected wedge theorem. We apply this theorem to brane models of black holes, where it relates the formation of islands in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula to causal features of the ambient spacetime. In particular, we find that if the black hole interior is causally connected to the radiation system through the ambient spacetime, then an island forms. For constant tension branes in pure AdS the converse also holds.

TI Position-dependent chiral coupling between single quantum dots and cross
   waveguides
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Chiral light-matter interaction between photonic nanostructures with quantum emitters shows great potential to implement spin-photon interfaces for quantum information processing. Position-dependent spin momentum locking of the quantum emitter is important for these chiral coupled nanostructures. Here, we report the position-dependent chiral coupling between quantum dots (QDs) and cross waveguides both numerically and experimentally. Four quantum dots distributed at different positions in the cross section are selected to characterize the chiral properties of the device. Directional emission is achieved in a single waveguide and in both two waveguides simultaneously. In addition, the QD position can be determined with the chiral contrasts from four outputs. Therefore, the cross waveguide can function as a one-way unidirectional waveguide and a circularly polarized beam splitter by placing the QD at a rational position, which has potential applications in spin-to-path encoding for complex quantum optical networks at the single-photon level.

TI Femtosecond Laser Induced Resonant Tunneling in an Individual Quantum
   Dot Attached to a Nanotip
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Quantized nano-objects offer a myriad of exciting possibilities for manipulating electrons and light that impact photonics, nanoelectronics, and quantum information. In this context, ultrashort laser pulses combined with nanotips and field emission have permitted renewing nano-characterization and control electron dynamics with unprecedented space and time resolution reaching femtosecond and even attosecond regimes. A crucial missing step in these experiments is that no signature of quantized energy levels has yet been observed. We combine in situ nanostructuration of nanotips and ultrashort laser pulse excitation to induce multiphoton excitation and electron emission from a single quantized nano-object attached at the apex of a metal nanotip. Femtosecond induced tunneling through well-defined localized confinement states that are tunable in energy is demonstrated. This paves the way for the development of ultrafast manipulation of electron emission from isolated nano-objects including stereographically fixed individual molecules and high brightness, ultrafast, coherent single electron sources for quantum optics experiments.

TI Coherent phase control of orbital-angular-momentum light-induced torque
   in a double-tripod atom-light coupling scheme
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate a phase-controllable mechanism for generating optical torque in a five-level double-tripod (DT) atom-light coupling scheme interacting with four strong coherent control fields as well as two weak optical vortex probe beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The spatial phase gradients of the OAM-carrying probes induce a quantized torque that is transferred to the atoms, rotating them and generating a directed atomic flow within an annular geometry. Analytical solutions of the optical Bloch equations under steady-state conditions show that the induced torque and resulting rotational motion exhibit high sensitivity to phase variations. We show that the DT system coherently reconfigures into either coupled-A or double-A schemes depending on the relative phases, with each configuration exhibiting distinct quantized torque characteristics. This enables precise phase control of the atomic current flow, with potential applications in quantum control, precision measurement, and quantum information processing.

TI Longitudinal dynamics of optical vortices based on multi-spiral arrays
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Optical vortices, possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spiral wavefronts, have become indispensable carriers for high-dimensional classical and quantum information. While transverse vortex properties are extensively characterized, the longitudinal dynamics of vortex fields, crucial for understanding complex light propagation, remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we introduce a phase-encoded methodology utilizing multi-spiral arrays (MSAs) to enable systematic spatial control and analysis of longitudinal vortex dynamics. Through a comprehensive theoretical framework, we derive vortex field expressions across ultra-near-field, near-field, and far-field regimes, and establish analytic formulations for longitudinal properties. Numerical simulations reveal fundamental longitudinal dynamics, as a monotonic decay of OAM coupled with progressive attenuation of Poynting vector. Quantitative analysis via circumferential averaging at intensity maxima conclusively reveals the dual dependence of vortex dynamics on spiral structure and propagation depth. The MSA-based modulation paradigm provides a fundamental theoretical framework essential for advancing structured light applications demanding precise spatial control over optical vortices.

TI Precise detection of tiny birefringence with accuracy reaching
   10-11 level
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-precision birefringence detection is crucial in many fundamental and applied research fields such as chirality detection, optical clocks and quantum information. Although numerous techniques have been demonstrated to detect birefringence in optical materials, the current detection precision typically remains at 10-8. Here we introduce a different physical mechanism for birefringence detection in the classical regime, achieving an accuracy at the 10-11 level. Our technique uses an effective photonic two-level system, dynamically driven by a birefringence-sensitive synthetic magnetic field created by propagation-invariant spin-orbit-coupled structured light in the subwavelength regime. The magnetic field equivalent induces the Rabi oscillation of photonic state, manifested as a nontrivial periodic spin-orbital angular momentum conversion. The ultrahigh detection precision arises from high-birefringence-sensitive topological transition between different oscillatory modes with high Rabi frequencies. The detection precision is tunable by controlling envelope size of structured light at the subwavelength scale. Our technique benefits a broad range of applications involving optical birefringence.

   Optical Fibers
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We report an all-fiber-based experimental setup to generate a correlated photon-pair comb using Four Wave Mixing (FWM) in Highly non-linear fiber (HNLF). Temporal correlations of the generated photons were confirmed through coincidence measurements. We observed a maximum of 32 kcps, with a coincidence to accidental ratio of 17 +/- 1. To further understand the underlying processes, we also simulated a generalized FWM event involving the interaction between an arbitrary frequency comb and a Continuous Wave (CW) pump. non-linear dynamics through the HNLF were modelled using Schr & ouml;dinger propagation equations, with numerical predictions agreeing with our experimental results.

TI Precision measurement of the topological charge of a fractional vortex
   beam based on angular-grating-diffraction OAM spectrum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vortex light beams carrying fractional vortices have shown promising applications in many fields such as optical communications, optical encryption, and quantum information processing. Accurate detection of the topological charge of a fractional vortex phase is essential for these applications. In this paper, a simple yet effective method for measuring the fractional topological charge is proposed, which is based on the detection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of a fractional vortex beam diffracted by an angular grating. When the fractional vortex beam passes through an angular grating, the OAM spectrum broadens, increasing the number of detectable OAM components. By applying nonlinear least squares fitting to the broadened spectrum, the topological charge can be detected with high precision. Experimental results demonstrate the detection range for fractional topological charges is from -6 to 6, with a resolution of 0.01 and an error of less than 0.005. Our protocol offers significant potential for high-capacity information transfer.

TI Large-Area Bright Emission of Plasmon-Coupled Dark Excitons at Room
   Temperature
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Brightening dark excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers (MLs) can provide large-area ultrathin devices for applications in quantum information science and optoelectronics. For practical applications of dark excitons, a robust and bright emission over a wide area at room temperature is desirable; however, no reliable approach has been demonstrated thus far. In this study, an efficient approach is presented for brightening dark excitons at room temperature over a large area of a WSe2 ML via coupling between plasmons and dark excitons. When a WSe2 ML is placed on gold micropillars (Au MPs), dark excitons are efficiently coupled to strongly localized surface plasmons at the edges of the Au MPs, along with a strong photoluminescence (PL) emission. Room-temperature dark exciton emission is confirmed via energy-, angle-, and time-resolved spectroscopy experiments, as well as confocal PL mapping. This study provides a generalizable method for the practical application of dark exciton.

TI Color-Tunable Lead Halide Perovskite Single-Mode Chiral Microlasers with
   Exceptionally High g lum
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Chiral microlasers hold great promise for optoelectronics from integrated photonic devices to high-density quantum information processing. Despite significant progress in lead-halide perovskite emitters, chiral lasing with high dissymmetry factors (g(lum)) has not yet been realized. Here, we demonstrate chiral single-mode microlasers with exceptional stability and tunable emission across the visible range by combining CsPbClxBr3-x perovskite microrods (MRs) with a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) layer. The MRs lase via a whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavity and confer chirality through the encapsulated CLC layer, thus exhibiting circularly polarized lasing with dissymmetry factors reaching 1.62. Importantly, we demonstrate wavelength-tunable high dissymmetry chiral lasers in a broad spectral range by tuning the halide composition and using CLC layers with the desired photonic bandgap (PBG). This facile approach to generate chiral lasing not only is applicable to semiconductor nano- and microcrystals but also paves the way for potential integration into nanoscale photonic devices.

TI Preparation and properties of a non-Gaussian state by quantum catalysis
   with thermal state input
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We theoretically introduce a new kind of non -Gaussian state, namely, the mixture of multiphoton added thermal states, achieved through multiphoton measurements at one output port of the beam splitter (termed multiphoton catalysis) for thermal state input. We discuss the success probabilities of detection (the normalization factors). Furthermore, we investigate their nonclassical properties based on the nonclassical depth, photon number distribution, and photocount distribution. It is shown that the multiphoton catalysis presents a better nonclassical performance by controlling the thermal parameter, catalyzed photon number and the transmissivity of the beam splitter. In addition, the nonclassicality is further examined through the partial negativity of the Wigner function, which reveals that multiphoton catalysis operation can prepare highly nonclassical quantum states. These results indicate that the preparation of a non -Gaussian states may have potential applications in the realms of quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

AB The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic-scale material-manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic-scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic-scale structure and chemistry of a few "active sites" can have a dramatic impact on larger-scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic-scale processes can help point the way to larger-scale synthesis approaches.

TI Anisotropic flows into black holes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We consider anisotropic black holes in the context of holographic renormalization group (RG) flows. We construct an a-function that is stationary at the boundary and the horizon and prove that it is also monotonic in both the exterior and the interior of the black hole. In spite of the reduced symmetry, we find that the "radial " null energy condition is sufficient to ensure the existence of this monotonic a-function. After constructing the a-function, we explore a holographic anisotropic p-wave superfluid state as a concrete example and numerical testing grounds. In doing so, we find that the a-function exhibits nontrivial oscillations in the trans-IR regime while preserving monotonicity. We find evidence that such oscillations appear to drive the trans-IR flow into nontrivial fixed points. We conclude by briefly discussing how our work fits into both the broader program of holographic RG flow and quantum information approaches to probing the black hole interior.

TI Selectively Addressing Plasmonic Modes and Excitonic States in a
   Nanocavity Hosting a Quantum Emitter
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Controlling the interaction between the excitonic states of a quantum emitter and the plasmonic modes of a nanocavity is key for the development of quantum information processing devices. In this Letter we demonstrate that the tunnel electroluminescence of electrically insulated C60 nanocrystals enclosed in the plasmonic nanocavity at the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope can be switched from a broad emission spectrum, revealing the plasmonic modes of the cavity, to a narrow band emission, displaying only the excitonic states of the C60 molecules by changing the bias voltage applied to the junction. Interestingly, excitonic emission dominates the spectra in the high-voltage region in which the simultaneously acquired inelastic rate is low, demonstrating that the excitons cannot be created by an inelastic tunnel process. These results point toward new possible mechanisms for tunnel electroluminescence of quantum emitters and offer new avenues to develop electrically tunable nanoscale light sources.

TI Discretized continuous quantum-mechanical observables that are neither
   continuous nor discrete
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Most of the fundamental characteristics of quantum mechanics, such as nonlocality and contextuality, are manifest in discrete, finite-dimensional systems. However, many quantum information tasks that exploit these properties cannot be directly adapted to continuous variable systems. To access these quantum features, continuous quantum variables can be made discrete by binning together their different values, resulting in observables with a finite number, d, of outcomes. While direct measurement indeed confirms their manifestly discrete character, here we employ a salient feature of quantum physics known as mutual unbiasedness to show that such coarse-grained observables are in a sense neither continuous nor discrete. Depending on d, the observables can reproduce either the discrete or the continuous behavior, or neither. To illustrate these results, we present an example for the construction of such measurements and employ it in an optical experiment confirming the existence of four mutually unbiased measurements with d = 3 outcomes in a continuous variable system, surpassing the number of mutually unbiased continuous variable observables.

TI Designing locally maximally entangled quantum states with arbitrary
   local symmetries
SO QUANTUM
AB One of the key ingredients of many LOCC protocols in quantum information is a multi-particle (locally) maximally entangled quantum state, aka a critical state, that possesses local symmetries. We show how to design critical states with arbitrarily large local unitary symmetry. We explain that such states can be realised in a quantum system of distinguishable traps with bosons or fermions occupying a finite number of modes. Then, local symmetries of the designed quantum state are equal to the unitary group of local mode operations acting diagonally on all traps. Therefore, such a group of symmetries is naturally protected against errors that occur in a physical realisation of mode operators. We also link our results with the existence of so-called strictly semistable states with particular asymptotic diagonal symmetries. Our main technical result states that the Nth tensor power of any irreducible representation of SU(N) contains a copy of the trivial representation. This is established via a direct combinatorial analysis of Littlewood-Richardson rules utilising certain combinatorial objects which we call telescopes.

TI Unified framework for calculating convex roof resource measures
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a comprehensive and practical framework for the analysis of diverse quantum phenomena. A fundamental task within QRTs is the quantification of resources inherent in a given quantum state. In this work, we introduce a unified computational framework for a class of widely utilized quantum resource measures, derived from convex roof extensions. We establish that the computation of these convex roof resource measures can be reformulated as an optimization problem over a Stiefel manifold, which can be further unconstrained through polar projection. Compared to existing methods employing semi-definite programming (SDP), gradient-based techniques or seesaw strategy, our approach not only demonstrates satisfying computational efficiency but also maintains applicability across various scenarios within a unified framework. We substantiate the efficacy of our method by applying it to several key quantum resources, including entanglement, coherence, and magic states. Moreover, our methodology can be readily extended to other convex roof quantities beyond the domain of resource theories, suggesting broad applicability in the realm of quantum information theory.

TI Cooper-pair beam splitter as a feasible source of entangled electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the generation of an entangled electron pair emerging from a system composed of two quantum dots attached to a superconductor Cooper-pair beam splitter. We take into account three processes: crossed Andreev reflection, cotunneling, and Coulomb interaction. Together, these processes play crucial roles in the formation of entangled electronic states, with electrons being in spatially separated quantum dots. By using perturbation theory, we derive an analytical effective model that allows a simple picture of the intricate process behind the formation of the entangled state. Several entanglement quantifiers, including quantum mutual information, negativity, and concurrence, are employed to validate our findings. Finally, we define and calculate the covariance associated with the detection of two electrons, each originating from one of the quantum dots with a specific spin value. The time evolution of this observable follows the dynamics of all entanglement quantifiers, thus suggesting that it can be a useful tool for mapping the creation of entangled electrons in future applications within quantum information protocols.

TI Optimization of Time-Ordered Processes in the Finite and Asymptotic
   Regimes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Many problems in quantum information theory can be formulated as optimizations over the sequential outcomes of dynamical systems subject to unpredictable external influences. Such problems include many-body entanglement detection through adaptive measurements, computing the maximum average score of a preparation game over a continuous set of target states, and limiting the behavior of a (quantum) finite-state automaton. In this work, we introduce tractable relaxations of this class of optimization problems. To illustrate their performance, we use them to: (a) compute the probability that a finite-state automaton outputs a given sequence of bits; (b) develop a new many-body entanglement-detection protocol; and (c) let the computer invent an adaptive protocol for magic state detection. As we further show, the maximum score of a sequential problem in the limit of infinitely many time steps is in general incomputable. Nonetheless, we provide general heuristics to bound this quantity and show that they provide useful estimates in relevant scenarios.

TI Emergence and inversion of chirality in hierarchical assemblies of CdS
   nanocrystal fibers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Arranging semiconducting nanocrystals into ordered superstructures is a promising platform to study fundamental light-matter interactions and develop programmable optical metamaterials. We investigated how the geometrical arrangement of CdS nanocrystals in hierarchical assemblies affects chiroptical properties. To create these structures, we controlled the evaporation of a colloidal CdS nanocrystal solution between two parallel plates. We combined in situ microscopy and computational modeling to establish a formation mechanism involving the shear-induced alignment of nanocrystal fibers and the subsequent mechanical relaxation of the stretched fibers to form Raman noodle-type band textures. The high linear anisotropy in these films shares many similarities with cholesteric liquid crystals. The films deposited on top and bottom surfaces exhibit opposite chirality. The mechanistic insights from this study are consequential to enable future advances in the design and fabrication of programmable optical metamaterials for further development of polarization-based optics toward applications in sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and quantum information technology.

TI Graph isomorphism: physical resources, optimization models, and
   algebraic characterizations
SO MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING
AB In the (G, H)-isomorphism game, a verifier interacts with two non-communicating players (called provers), by privately sending each of them a random vertex from either G or H. The goal of the players is to convince the verifier that the graphs G and H are isomorphic. In recent work along with Atserias et al. (J Comb Theory Ser B 136:89-328, 2019) we showed that a verifier can be convinced that two non-isomorphic graphs are isomorphic, if the provers are allowed to share quantum resources. In this paper we model classical and quantum graph isomorphism by linear constraints over certain complicated convex cones, which we then relax to a pair of tractable convex models (semidefinite programs). Our main result is a complete algebraic characterization of the corresponding equivalence relations on graphs in terms of appropriate matrix algebras. Our techniques are an interesting mix of algebra, combinatorics, optimization, and quantum information.

TI Modeling spin relaxation in complex radical systems using MolSpin
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB Spin relaxation is an important aspect of the spin dynamics of free radicals and can have a significant impact on the outcome of their spin-selective reactions. Examples range from the use of radicals as spin qubits in quantum information processing to the radical pair reactions in proteins that may allow migratory birds to sense the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. Accurate modeling of spin relaxation, however, is non-trivial. Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness theory derives a quantum mechanical master equation from system-bath interactions in the Markovian limit that provides a comprehensive framework for describing spin relaxation. Unfortunately, the construction of the master equation is system-specific and often resource-heavy. To address this challenge, we introduce a generalized and efficient implementation of BRW theory as a new feature of the spin dynamics toolkit MolSpin which offers an easy-to-use approach for studying systems of reacting radicals of varying complexity.

TI Interplay between Non-Markovianity of Noise and Dynamics in Quantum
   Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB The non-Markovianity of open quantum system dynamics is often associated with the bidirectional interchange of information between the system and its environment, and it is thought to be a resource for various quantum information tasks. We have investigated the non-Markovianity of the dynamics of a two-state system driven by continuous time random walk-type noise, which can be Markovian or non-Markovian depending on its residence time distribution parameters. Exact analytical expressions for the distinguishability as well as the trace distance and entropy-based non-Markovianity measures are obtained and used to investigate the interplay between the non-Markovianity of the noise and that of dynamics. Our results show that, in many cases, the dynamics are also non-Markovian when the noise is non-Markovian. However, it is possible for Markovian noise to cause non-Markovian dynamics and for non-Markovian noise to cause Markovian dynamics but only for certain parameter values.

TI Two-particle time-domain interferometry in the fractional quantum Hall
   effect regime
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quasi-particles are elementary excitations of condensed matter quantum phases. Demonstrating that they keep quantum coherence while propagating is a fundamental issue for their manipulation for quantum information tasks. Here, we consider anyons, the fractionally charged quasi-particles of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect occurring in two-dimensional electronic conductors in high magnetic fields. They obey anyonic statistics, intermediate between fermionic and bosonic. Surprisingly, anyons show large quantum coherence when transmitted through the localized states of electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers, but almost no quantum interference when transmitted via the propagating states of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Here, using a novel interferometric approach, we demonstrate that anyons do keep quantum coherence while propagating. Performing two-particle time-domain interference measurements sensitive to the two-particle Hanbury Brown Twiss phase, we find 53 and 60% visibilities for anyons with charges e/5 and e/3. Our results give a positive message for the challenge of performing controlled quantum coherent braiding of anyons.

TI Probing the entanglement of operator growth
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB In this work we probe the operator growth for systems with Lie symmetry using tools from quantum information. Namely, we investigate the Krylov complexity, entanglement negativity, entanglement entropy, and capacity of entanglement for systems with SU(1,1) and SU(2) symmetry. Our main tools are two-mode coherent states, whose properties allow us to study the operator growth and its entanglement structure for any system in a discrete series representation of the groups under consideration. Our results verify that the quantities of interest exhibit certain universal features in agreement with the universal operator growth hypothesis. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of this approach relying on symmetry as it significantly facilitates the calculation of quantities probing operator growth. In particular, we argue that the use of the Lanczos algorithm, which has been the most important tool in the study of operator growth so far, can be circumvented and all the essential information can be extracted directly from symmetry arguments.

TI Visualization of Plasmonic Couplings Using Ultrafast Electron Microscopy
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Hybrids of graphene and metal plasmonic nanostructures are promising building blocks for applications in optoelectronics, surface-enhanced scattering, biosensing, and quantum information. An understanding of the coupling mechanism in these hybrid systems is of vital importance to its applications. Previous efforts in this field mainly focused on spectroscopic studies of strong coupling within the hybrids with no spatial resolution. Here we report direct imaging of the local plasmonic coupling between single Au nanocapsules and graphene step edges at the nanometer scale by photon-induced near-field electron microscopy in an ultrafast electron microscope for the first time. The proximity of a step in the graphene to the nanocapsule causes asymmetric surface charge density at the ends of the nanocapsules. Computational electromagnetic simulations confirm the experimental observations. The results reported here indicate that this hybrid system could be used to manipulate the localized electromagnetic field on the nanoscale, enabling promising future plasmonic devices.

TI Computable measures of non-Markovianity for Gaussian free fermion
   systems
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB We investigate measures of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems governed by Gaussian free fermionic dynamics. Standard indicators of non-Markovian behavior, such as the BLP and LFS measures, are revisited in this context. We show that for Gaussian states, trace-based distances-specifically the Hilbert-Schmidt norm-and second-order R & eacute;nyi mutual information can be efficiently expressed in terms of two-point correlation functions, enabling practical computation even in systems where the full-density matrix is intractable. Crucially, this framework remains valid even when the density matrix of the system is an average over stochastic Gaussian trajectories, yielding a non-Gaussian state. We present efficient numerical protocols based on this structure and demonstrate their feasibility through a small-scale simulation. Our approach opens a scalable path to quantifying non-Markovianity in interacting or measured fermionic systems, with applications in quantum information and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.

TI Decidabilities of local unitary equivalence for entanglement witnesses
   and states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The problem of determining whether two states are equivalent by local unitary (LU) operations is important for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose an alternative perspective to study this problem by comparing the decidabilities of LU equivalence (also known as LU decidabilities for short) between entanglement witnesses and states. We introduce a relation between sets of Hermitian operators in terms of the LU decidability. Then, we compare the LU decidability for the set of entanglement witnesses to the LU decidabilities for several sets of states. By comparison, we establish a hierarchy of these sets in terms of LU decidabilities. Moreover, we realize that the simultaneous LU (SLU) equivalence between tuples of mutually orthogonal projectors is crucial to LU equivalent operators. We reveal by examples that for two tuples of projectors, the partial SLU equivalence cannot ensure the overall SLU equivalence. Generally, we present a necessary and sufficient condition such that two tuples of states are SLU equivalent.

TI Multi-modality deep learning for pulse prediction in homogeneous
   nonlinear systems via parametric conversion
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In this Letter, we introduce FusionNet, a multi-modality deep learning framework designed to predict and analyze output pulses in high-power rare-earth-doped laser systems driving parametric conversion in homogeneous guided nonlinear media. FusionNet integrates temporal, spectral, and physical experimental conditions to model ultrafast nonlinear phenomena, including parametric nonlinear frequency conversion, self-phase modulation, and cross-phase modulation in homogeneous guided systems such as gas-filled hollow-core fibers. These systems bridge physical models with experimental data, advancing our understanding of light-guiding principles and nonlinear interactions while expediting the design and optimization of on-demand high-power, high-brightness systems. Our results demonstrate a 73% reduction in prediction error and an 83% improvement in computational efficiency compared to conventional neural networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric simulations and optimizing experimental designs in high-power laser systems, with further implications for high-precision spectroscopy, quantum information science, and distributed entangled interconnects.

TI Quantum interference of concurrent nonlinear processes in a single
   silicon waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical nonlinearity provides a key resource for quantum information processing and the interference of quanta lies at the heart of quantum physics as well. As an interesting combination, the nonlinear interference can extend the scalability and flexibility of quantum manipulations as well as what we believe to be novel applications. In this manuscript, we propose and experimentally demonstrate what we believe to be a new nonlinear interferometer on a silicon chip between a degenerate and a non-degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing process in the same waveguide. We observed the interference in the pairs generation rate and obtained broadband interference visibility up to 96%. Furthermore, we also provide a feasible scheme for observing four-photon nonlinear interference in a single waveguide. This work provides a novel method for realizing and controlling optical nonlinear interference, and enriches the toolbox of quantum state preparation and quantum manipulation by nonlinear processes.

TI Size-dependent magnon thermal transport in a nanostructured quantum
   magnet
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Magnons are fundamental excitations of spin waves in magnetic materials, which are able to carry both heat and spin information. Examining magnon thermal transport is essential for advancing energy -efficient spintronics and novel energy conversion technologies. Unlike the well -established thermal properties of phonons and electrons, the size effect on magnon thermal transport remains elusive. Here, we quantitatively measure the role of grain size on magnon thermal transport in the nanostructured quantum magnet La 2 CuO 4 . Samples with controlled grain sizes are synthesized using a bottom -up method. The measured magnon thermal conductivity decreases as the grain size is reduced. Analysis using a two-dimensional magnon transport kinetic model, combined with optical and electrical measurements, suggests that magnon-boundary scattering effectively restricts the magnon mean free path, suppressing magnon thermal conductivity. These results offer valuable insights into the prediction and control of magnon transport at the nanoscale, especially for applications in quantum information processing and energy conversion.

TI Entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements assigned with
   biased weights
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The entropic way of formulating Heisenberg's uncertainty principle not only plays a fundamental role in applications of quantum information theory but also is essential for manifesting genuine nonclassical features of quantum systems. In this paper we investigate Renyi entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in the scenario where measurements on individual copies of a quantum system are selected with nonuniform probabilities. In contrast with EURs that characterize an observer's overall lack of information about outcomes with respect to a collection of measurements, we establish state -dependent lower bounds on the weighted sum of entropies over multiple measurements. Conventional EURs thus correspond to the special cases when all weights are equal, and in such cases we show our results are generally stronger than previous ones. Moreover, taking the entropic steering criterion as an example, we numerically verify that our EURs could be advantageous in practical quantum tasks by optimizing the weights assigned to different measurements. Importantly, this optimization does not require quantum resources and is efficiently computable on classical computers.

TI Accessing inaccessible information via quantum indistinguishability
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper we present and analyze an information-theoretic task that consists in learning a bit of information by spatially moving the 'target' particle that encodes it. We show that, on one hand, the task can be solved with the use of additional independently prepared quantum particles, only if these are indistinguishable from the target particle. On the other hand, the task can be solved with the use of distinguishable quantum particles, only if they are entangled with the target particle. Our task thus provides a new example in which the entanglement apparently inherent to independently prepared indistinguishable quantum particles is put into use for information processing. Importantly, a novelty of our protocol lies in that it does not require any spatial overlap between the involved particles. Besides analyzing the class of quantum-mechanical protocols that solve our task, we gesture towards possible ways of generalizing our results and of applying them in cryptography.

TI Electric control of spin states in frustrated triangular molecular
   magnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Frustrated triangular molecular magnets are a very important class of magnetic molecules since the absence of inversion symmetry allows an external electric field to couple directly with the spin chirality that characterizes their ground state. The spin-electric coupling in these molecular magnets leads to an efficient and fast method of manipulating spin states, making them an exciting candidate for quantum information processing. The efficiency of the spin-electric coupling depends on the spin-induced electric-dipole moment of the frustrated spin configurations contributing to the chiral ground state. In this paper, we report on first-principles calculations of spin-electric coupling in a {V3} triangular magnetic molecule. We have explicitly calculated the spin-induced charge redistribution within the magnetic centers that is responsible for the spin-electric coupling. Furthermore, we have generalized the method of calculating the strength of the spin-electric coupling to calculate any triangular spin-1/2 molecule with C3 symmetry and have applied it to calculate the coupling strength in {V15} molecular magnets.

TI Hybridized Propagation of Spin Waves and Surface Acoustic Waves in a
   Multiferroic-Ferromagnetic Heterostructure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Coherent coupling in magnon-based hybrid systems has many potential applications in quantum information processing. Magnons can propagate in magnetically ordered materials without any motion of electrons, offering a unique method to build low-power-consumption devices and information chan-nels free of heat dissipation. In this paper, we demonstrate the coherent propagation of hybridized modes between spin waves and Love surface acoustic waves in a multiferroic BiFeO3 and ferromag-netic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3-based heterostructure. The magnetoelastic coupling enables a giant enhancement of the strength of the hybridized mode by a factor of 26 compared to that of the pure spin waves. A short wavelength down to 250 nm is demonstrated for the hybridized mode, which is desirable for nanoscale acoustomagnonic applications. Our combined experimental and theoretical analyses represent a step towards the coherent control in hybrid magnonics, which may inspire the study of magnon-phonon hybrid systems for coherent information processing and manipulation.

TI Few generalized entropic relations related to Rydberg atoms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We calculate the analytical and numerical values of the position space Shannon entropy, momentum space Shannon entropy, and total Shannon entropy, S-rho, S-gamma, and S-T, respectively, of free and trapped Rydberg hydrogen-like atoms. The influence of atomic number Z, the principal quantum number n, and energy E on the Shannon entropy of the Rydberg atoms are illustrated. The scaling properties of Shannon entropy with energy of states E and the principal quantum number n have been reported for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our work explains how Shannon entropy indicates localization-delocalization of the wavefunction. The total Shannon entropy as a measure of the number of nodes in the trapped Rydberg atom's wavefunction is also discussed. We show why an uncertainty relation based on Shannon entropy is superior to Heisenberg uncertainty for Rydberg atoms.

TI Topological edge modes without symmetry in quasiperiodically driven spin
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We construct an example of a 1d quasiperiodically driven spin chain whose edge states can coherently store quantum information, protected by a combination of localization, dynamics, and topology. In a sharp departure from topological phases in static and periodically driven (Floquet) spin chains, this model does not rely upon microscopic symmetry protection: Instead, the edge states are protected purely by emergent dynamical symmetries. We explore the dynamical signatures of this emergent dynamical symmetry-protected topological (EDSPT) order through exact numerics, time evolving block decimation, and analytic high-frequency expansion, finding evidence that the EDSPT is a stable dynamical phase protected by bulk many-body localization up to (at least) stretched-exponentially long timescales, and possibly beyond. We argue that EDSPTs are special to the quasiperiodically driven setting, and cannot arise in Floquet systems. Moreover, we find evidence of a type of boundary critical with no known static or Floquet analogue, in which the edge spin dynamics transition from quasiperiodic to chaotic, leading to bulk thermalization.

TI Degree of unpolarization (DoUP): a single metric for all possible
   unpolarized beams
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Unpolarized light is foundational in many optical technologies, yet current metrics fail to fully capture its complexity, especially when considering hidden or nonuniform polarization states. To overcome this, we introduce the degree of unpolarization (DoUP), a single, comprehensive metric that quantifies unpolarized beams across various sources. The DoUP is developed within a newly conceptualized normalized polarization probability space, termed J-space. This framework allows for precise comparisons of unpolarized beams and standardizes their quantification. Our findings reveal that fully unpolarized beams achieve a DoUP value of unity, while other beams deviate from this ideal, offering critical insights into their polarization behavior. By resolving these nuances, the DoUP metric opens up new avenues for optical technologies, from advanced photonic systems to quantum information science. This advancement promises a deeper understanding of polarization and broader applications in fields that rely on the precise manipulation of light.

TI Generation of structure light in probe absorption spectrum via
   microwave-driven Y-type atomic system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Behavior of structure light is investigated by monitoring probe absorption using a microwave-driven Y-type atomic media configuration. The system under consideration is driven by one of the control vortex beams as well as an extra non-vortex control beam to ensure electromagnetically induced transparency. The significant aspect in the generation of structured light is the azimuthal phase-dependent modification for probe absorption. Further intensity distribution for absorption spectra is examined for simultaneously evaluating both the control vortex beams. We also go through the radial distribution of intensity for various orbital angular momentum values. Different modes of structural beams may be distinguished using the suggested approach. Our research gives us a way for rapidly transferring vortex wavefronts from control field to probe absorption profile. This could be useful in quantum information processing.

TI The nonlinear effects and applications of gain doped whispering-gallery
   mode cavities
SO EPL
AB Whispering-gallery mode (WGM) cavities formed by dielectric structures have attracted intensive interest in various fields. The high-quality factor and smaller mode volume associated with the optical modes have inspired experiments in nonlinear optics, nanophotonics, and quantum information science. Moreover, they are also used in optical biosensors and other significant applications. To further reduce the material loss of the resonator, optical gain materials, such as erbium and ytterbium, are doped into the dielectric structure to increase the nonlinear effect and enhance the interaction between light and matter. Here in this review, we outline the most recent advancements in gain-doped optical WGM microcavities. Moreover, we introduce the dynamics of the gain in WGM resonators, the integration of gain media into WGM microcavities with various shapes, and the fabrication and applications of the gain microcavities. Also, the applications of the gain cavity based on the whispering-gallery mode have been introduced, e.g., ultra-sensitive sensors, low-threshold lasers, and high-performance optical systems.

TI Dimers of Plasmonic Nanocubes to Reach Single-Molecule Strong Coupling
   with High Emission Yields
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Reaching reproducible strong coupling between a quantum emitter and a plasmonic resonator at room temperature, while maintaining high emission yields, would make quantum information processing with light possible outside of cryogenic conditions. We theoretically propose to exploit the high local curvatures at the tips of plasmonic nanocubes to reach Purcell factors of >106 at visible frequencies, rendering single-molecule strong coupling more easily accessible than with the faceted spherical nanoparticles used in recent experimental demonstrations. In the case of gold nanocube dimers, we highlight a trade-off between coupling strength and emission yield that depends on the nanocube size. Electrodynamic simulations on silver nanostructures are performed using a realistic dielectric constant, as confirmed by scattering spectroscopy performed on single nanocubes. Dimers of silver nanocubes feature Purcell factors similar to those of gold while allowing emission yields of >60%, thus providing design rules for efficient strongly coupled hybrid nanostructures at room temperature.

TI Low Index Contrast Valley Hall Topological Photonics for Robust
   Transport in the Visible Spectrum
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Topological photonics is an emerging platform to study light-matter interactions with promising features such as robust edge state transmission that could be advantageous for quantum information applications. However, applying common topological photonic designs for visible wavelength light-matter interactions is challenging because materials compatible with the visible spectrum have lower refractive index contrasts. We design and demonstrate a novel valley Hall topological photonic crystal that can support a complete topological band gap in the visible spectrum. We also show an overetch procedure can be used to reduce the leakage loss common for low index contrast materials. To demonstrate these advantages, we fabricate topological photonic devices following these design principles and show that edge states at energies in the complete band gap have robust transmission around sharp corners. The compatibility of this photonic structure with straightforward fabrication methods will facilitate the study of interactions between topologically nontrivial photons and nanomaterials active in the visible spectrum.

TI New Schiff base copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes for biomedical
   applications with reference to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A series of nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes viz. [Ni(L1)2](1), [Cu(L1)2](2), [Ni(L2)2](3) and [Cu(L2)2](4) (where L1H=(E)-N-phenyl-2-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)hydrazine-1-carboxamide, L2H=(E)-2-((3-methylthiophen-2-yl) methylene)-N-phenylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide), have been synthesized and designed as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 virus. The quantum computational calculations are used for structure-property relationship. A detailed structural and non-covalent supramolecular interaction in the ligand (L1H) is investigated by single crystal structure analysis and computational approaches. Hirshfeld surface analysis is done in the crystal structure of the ligand (L1H), while 3D topology of the crystal packing is visualized through an energy framework. To find potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 and HIV -1 virus, molecular docking of the ligands and their corresponding metal complexes with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 virus is performed. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 7VNB) and HIV-1 virus (PDB ID: 1REV) is retrieved from the protein data bank and used as receptor proteins. The molecular docking results has shown that Schiff bases and their complexes with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 virus exhibited good binding affinity at binding site of receptor protein. It is also observed that the binding affinities of the Schiff bases and metal complexes towards SARS-CoV-2 are comparatively higher than the HIV virus. This study may offer the new antivirus drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 virus.

TI Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

TI Generation of polarization-multiplexed terahertz orbital angular
   momentum combs via all-silicon metasurfaces
SO LIGHT-ADVANCED MANUFACTURING
AB Electromagnetic waves carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), namely OAM beams, are important in various fields including optics, communications, and quantum information. However, most current schemes can only generate single or several simple OAM modes. Multi-mode OAM beams are rarely seen. This paper proposes a scheme to design metasurfaces that can generate multiple polarization-multiplexed OAM modes with equal intervals and intensities (i.e., OAM combs) working in the terahertz (THz) range. As a proof of concept, we first design a metasurface to generate a pair of polarization-multiplexed OAM combs with arbitrary mode numbers. Furthermore, another metasurface is proposed to realize a pair of polarization-multiplexed OAM combs with arbitrary locations and intervals in the OAM spectrum. Experimental results agree well with full-wave simulations, verifying a great performance of OAM combs generation. Our method may provide a new solution to designing high-capacity THz devices used in multi-mode communication systems.

TI Triple Fano resonance-induced slow light in multiple-mode coupling
   nanomechanical resonators
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose a multiple-mechanical-mode-coupling nanomechanical system comprising three nanomechanical resonators (NRs) with different frequencies and each two NRs able to interact with each other. By weaving different NRs and controlling the coupling of NRs, the nanomechanical system can be series-, parallel-, or network-coupled nanoresonators network. Using two-tone fields to drive quantum dot implanted in one NR, we investigate the coherence optical responses and absorption spectrum manifested as a triple Fano resonance. Furthermore, each Fano resonance peak of the triple Fano resonance that induced the coherent optical propagation were demonstrated. The numerical results indicate that the slow light and the slow-to-fast light transition can be obtained by manipulating the interaction of NRs. These findings imply that the multiple -mechanical-mode coupling system can be a promising integration platform to achieve chip-scale applications in quantum information processing.

TI Enhancing the teleportation of quantum Fisher information under
   correlated amplitude damping decoherence
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB From the perspective of quantum information transmission, one may be interested in the teleportation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) which provides the optimal precision of parameter estimation. In this paper, we investigate the teleportation of QFI under the correlated amplitude damping (CAD) decoherence. It is found that the correlated effects play a positive role in improving the teleported QFI, but the impact of decoherence is still serious. Therefore, we propose two schemes, which are based on weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM), to enhance the teleportation of QFI under the CAD decoherence. The results show that both schemes can significantly improve the teleported QFI with a certain success probability. The findings of our study suggest that the correlated effects can significantly increase the success probabilities of these two schemes. A detailed comparison confirms that the EAM scheme is more efficient than the WM scheme in improving the teleportation of QFI.

TI Slowing magnetic relaxation with open-shell diluents
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Strategies for slowing magnetic relaxation via local environmental design are vital for developing next-generation spin-based technologies (e.g., quantum information processing). Herein, we demonstrate a technique to do so via chemical design of a local magnetic environment. We show that embedding the open-shell complex (Ph4P)(2)[Co(SPh)(4)] in solid-state matrices of the isostructural, open-shell species (Ph4P)(2)[M(SPh)(4)] (M = Ni2+, S = 1; M = Fe2+, S = 2; M = Mn2+, S = 5/2) will slow magnetic relaxation for the embedded [Co(SPh)(4)](2-) ion by three orders of magnitude. Magnetometry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and computational analyses reveal that integer spin and large, positive zero-field splitting (D) values for the diluent produce a quiet, local magnetic field that slows relaxation rates for the embedded Co molecules. These results will enable the investigation of magnetic systems for which strictly diamagnetic congeners are either synthetically inaccessible or are not isostructural.

In recent decades, to bring these applications into reality, various configurations such as conventional spiral phase plates, computer-generated holograms, metasurface-based setups, and on-chip devices have been explored for twisted light generation.

TI Multilevel effects in quantum dot based parity-to-charge conversion of
   Majorana box qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum dot based parity-to-charge conversion is a promising method for reading out quantum information encoded nonlocally into pairs of Majorana zero modes. To obtain a sizable parity-to-charge visibility, it is crucial to tune the relative phase of the tunnel couplings between the dot and the Majorana modes appropriately. However, in the presence of multiple quasidegenerate dot orbitals, it is in general not experimentally feasible to tune all couplings individually. This paper shows that such configurations could make it difficult to avoid a destructive multiorbital interference effect that substantially reduces the readout visibility. We analyze this effect using a Lindblad quantum master equation. This exposes how the experimentally relevant system parameters enhance or suppress the visibility when strong charging energy, measurement dissipation, and, most importantly, multiorbital interference is accounted for. In particular, we find that an intermediate-time readout could mitigate some of the interference-related visibility reductions affecting the stationary limit.

TI Convex cones in mapping spaces between matrix algebras
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We introduce the notion of one-sided mapping cones of positive linear maps between matrix algebras. These are convex cones of maps that are invariant under compositions by completely positive maps from either the left or right side. The duals of such convex cones can be characterized in terms of ampliation maps, which can also be used to characterize many notions from quantum information theory-such as separability, entanglement-breaking maps, Schmidt numbers, as well as decomposable maps and k-positive maps in functional analysis. In fact, such characterizations hold if and only if the involved cone is a one-sided mapping cone. Through this analysis, we obtain mapping properties for compositions of cones from which we also obtain several equivalent statements of the PPT (positive partial transpose ) square conjecture.

TI Sn-InAs Nanowire Shadow-Defined Josephson Junctions
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor platforms are foundational to advancing quantum information technologies, motivating the integration of materials with clean interfaces, robust superconductivity, and scalable architectures. Here, we report the synthesis and analysis of inclined InAs nanowires, conformally coated with beta-Sn shells. These nanowires extend in opposite in-plane directions, forming a self-aligned, criss-cross network. This enables the deterministic formation of nanowire-shadow Josephson junctions through angle-controlled, low-temperature Sn deposition. Structural characterization shows uniform polycrystalline beta-Sn shells forming a sharp, diffusion-free interface with InAs. Low-temperature transport measurements reveal a hard induced superconducting gap approximate to 600 mu eV, switching currents up to approximate to 500 nA, and parallel magnetic field resilience beyond 1T. These results establish beta-Sn/InAs nanowire networks as a promising platform for superconducting qubits, low-noise microwave devices, and the exploration of exotic superconducting phases including triplet pairing and topological superconductivity.

TI Singularities of Radial Gradient Perfect Vortex Beams Generated by
   Pancharatnam-Berry Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Perfect vortex beams (PVBs) have recently attracted much attention because they can maintain donut-like intensity profiles with sizes that do not depend on topological charges (TCs). The superposition of them can further expand the potential applications. However, the conventional superposition method is limited to PVBs with identical donut sizes and discrete TCs, which reduces the degrees of freedom for flexible manipulation of light. A compact metasurface approach for superposed PVBs with radial gradient sequential integer TCs and numerical aperture is proposed in this paper. This method achieves radial gradient PVBs (RGPVBs) with asymmetric intensity singularity distribution, and the singularity positions can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase in the metasurface design. Additionally, an array of RGPVBs can be realized. This kind of singularity beams of RGPVBs is expected to be used in optical trapping, optical communications, and quantum information.

TI Spectral Signatures of Nontrivial Topology in a Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of intrinsic nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram, which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.

TI Quantum nature of black hole and the superposition of fermionic field
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The operational framework for the superposition of spacetime is fundamentally important in developing a comprehensive description of quantum gravity (Foo et al. in Phys Rev Lett 129:181301, 2022). As a "bottom-up" unifying theory of quantum gravity, it allows us to investigate how mass superposition of spacetime influences the performance of quantum information processing. In this paper, we study how the quantum-gravitational effects produced by the mass superposition of a black hole influence the quantum coherence of fermionic fields. It is shown that the spacetime effects associated with a classical black hole lead to inevitable decoherence. Notably, compared to classical black hole spacetime scenarios, fermionic fields near a black hole with superposed masses can retain more quantum coherence. This suggests that the quantum properties of spacetime may serve as resources to mitigate coherent degradation caused by gravitational effects. The bottom-up perspective on spacetime superposition proposed in this work serves as an indication of quantum-gravitational effects and holds significant theoretical implications.

TI Auxiliary-Cavity-Assisted Slow and Fast Light in a Photonic Molecule
   Spinning Optomechanical System
SO MICROMACHINES
AB We investigate the coherent optical propagation in a photonic molecule spinning optomechanical system consisting of two whispering gallery microcavities in which one of the optical cavities is a spinning optomechanical cavity and the other one is an ordinary auxiliary optical cavity. As the optomechanical cavity is spinning along the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the cavity field can undergo different Sagnac effects, which accompanies the auxiliary optical cavity, together influencing the process of the evolution of optomechanically induced transparency and its related propagation properties, such as fast and slow light effects. The numerical results indicate that the enhanced slow and fast light and the conversion from fast to slow light (or slow to fast light) are determined by the spinning direction of the optomechanical cavity and the coupling of the two optical cavities. The study affords further insight into the photonic molecule spinning optomechanical systems and also indicates promising applications in quantum information processing.

TI Observation of the hyperfine structure and anticrossings of hyperfine
   levels in the luminescence spectra of LiYF4:Ho3+
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Resolved hyperfine structure and narrow inhomogeneously broadened lines in the optical spectra of a rare-earth-doped crystal are favorable for the implementation of various sensors. Here, a well-resolved hyperfine structure in the photoluminescence spectra of LiYF4:Ho single crystals and the anticrossings of hyperfine levels in a magnetic field are demonstrated using a self-made setup based on a Bruker 125HR high-resolution Fourier spectrometer. This is the first observation of the resolved hyperfine structure and anticrossing hyperfine levels in the luminescence spectra of a crystal. The narrowest spectral linewidth is only 0.0022 cm(-1). This fact together with a large value of the magnetic g factor of several crystal-field states creates prerequisites for developing magnetic field sensors, which can be in demand in modern quantum information technology devices operating at low temperatures. Very small random lattice strains characterizing the quality of a crystal can be detected using anticrossing points.

TI Spin-induced linear polarization of photoluminescence in
   antiferromagnetic van der Waals crystals
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Antiferromagnets are promising components for spintronics due to their terahertz resonance, multilevel states and absence of stray fields. However, the zero net magnetic moment of antiferromagnets makes the detection of the antiferromagnetic order and the investigation of fundamental spin properties notoriously difficult. Here, we report an optical detection of Neel vector orientation through an ultra-sharp photoluminescence in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3 from bulk to atomically thin flakes. The strong correlation between spin flipping and electric dipole oscillator results in a linear polarization of the sharp emission, which aligns perpendicular to the spin orientation in the crystal. By applying an in-plane magnetic field, we achieve manipulation of the photoluminescence polarization. This correlation between emitted photons and spins in layered magnets provides routes for investigating magneto-optics in two-dimensional materials, and hence opens a path for developing opto-spintronic devices and antiferromagnet-based quantum information technologies.
   The polarization of photoluminescence is found to depend on spin orientation in a van der Waals antiferromagnet.

TI Efficient single-photon emission via quantum-confined charge funneling
   to quantum dots
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Quantum light sources, particularly single-photon emitters (SPEs), are critical for quantum communications and computing. Among them, III-V semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated superior SPE metrics, including near-unity brightness, high photon purity, and indistinguishability, making them especially suitable for quantum applications. However, their overall quantum efficiency-determined by a product of the internal, excitation, and outcoupling efficiencies-remains limited, primarily due to low (typically below 0.1%) excitation efficiency. To mitigate the low efficiency under non-resonant pumping, here we realize liquid droplet etched GaAs QDs in a microscale 3D AlGaAs charge-carrier funnel. The funnel channels charge carriers to the QD and enhances the overall emission efficiency by over one order of magnitude while preserving the SPE behavior. We reveal that a modified energy landscape around the QD leads to the excitation efficiency improvement. These energy landscape-modified QDs can be operated with optical excitation up to 10 mu m away, raising the promise of efficient electrically driven QD SPEs for quantum information systems.

TI Charge State Transition of Spectrally Stabilized Tin-Vacancy Centers in
   Diamond
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters are important platforms for quantum information processing. The fabrication of the emitters with stable photon frequency and narrow line width is a fundamental issue, and it is essential to understand optical conditions under which the emitter keeps a bright charge state or transitions to a dark state. For these purposes, in this study, we investigate the spectral stability and charge state transition of tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond. The photoluminescence excitation spectra of multiple SnV centers are basically stable over time with nearly transform-limited line widths under resonant excitation, while simultaneous irradiation of resonant and nonresonant lasers makes spectra from the SnV centers unstable. We find that the instability occurs due to the charge state transition to a dark state. The charge state transition rates are quantitatively investigated depending on the laser powers. Lastly, with first-principles calculations, we model the charge state transition of the SnV center under laser irradiation.

TI Bosonic and fermionic coherence of N-partite states in the background of
   a dilaton black hole
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the N-partite coherences of GHZ and W states for free bosonic and fermionic fields when any n observers hover near the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. We derive the more general analytical expressions for N-partite coherence, encompassing both physically accessible and inaccessible coherences in the context of the dilaton black hole. It has been found that the coherence of the bosonic field is greater than that of the fermionic field, while the entanglement of the fermionic field is greater than that of the bosonic field in dilaton spacetime. Additionally, the coherence of the W state is greater than that of the GHZ state, whereas the entanglement of the GHZ state is greater than that of the W state in curved spacetime. These results suggest that we should utilize suitable quantum resources and different types of particles for relativistic quantum information tasks.

TI Electrically engineering synthetic magnetic fields for polarized photons
SO OPTICA
AB Polarized photons are, in essence, neutral particles and therefore do not couple directly to external fields, thus hampering the effective interaction of photons with external fields. Here, we theoretically identify an equivalent spin-1/2 model for polarized photons and synthesize a magnetization vector for coupling differently polarized photons in an engineered anisotropic medium. The synthetic magnetic field can be electrically engineered to manipulate the magnetic moments of the pseudo-spin-1/2 photons, leading to observation of the Lorentz force and analogous Stern-Gerlach effect. We experimentally demonstrate these fundamental effects by using different spins, including purely single-polarization spins and mutually two-polarization mixing spins. We also demonstrate the higher-order Stern-Gerlach effect by using spins having nontrivial topological structures. Our findings could enable polarization-based elements with potential applications in polarization selection and conversion, benefiting classical and quantum information processing.

TI Dilute Measurement-Induced Cooling into Many-Body Ground States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Cooling a quantum system to its ground state is important for the characterization of nontrivial interacting systems and in the context of a variety of quantum information platforms. It can be achieved by employing measurement-based passive steering protocols, where the steering steps are predetermined and are not based on measurement readouts. However, measurements realized by coupling the system to auxiliary quantum degrees of freedom ("detectors") are rather costly and protocols in which the number of detectors scales with system size will have limited practical applicability. Here, we identify conditions under which measurement-based cooling protocols can be taken to the ultimate dilute limit where the number of detectors is independent of system size. For two examples of frustration-free one-dimensional spin chains, we show that steering on a single link is sufficient to cool these systems into their unique ground states. We corroborate our analytical arguments with finite-size numerical simulations and discuss further applications of dilute cooling.

TI Theory predicts 2D chiral polaritons based on achiral Fabry-Pérot
   cavities using apparent circular dichroism
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing polariton states with high levels of chirality offers exciting prospects for quantum information, sensing, and lasing applications. Such chirality must emanate from either the involved optical resonators or the quantum emitters. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a rare opportunity for realizing polaritons with so-called 2D chirality by strong coupling of the optical modes of (high finesse) achiral Fabry-Perot cavities with samples exhibiting "apparent circular dichroism" (ACD). ACD is a phenomenon resulting from an interference between linear birefringence and dichroic interactions. By introducing a quantum electrodynamical theory of ACD, we identify the design rules based on which 2D chiral polaritons can be produced, and their chirality can be optimized.
   2D chiral polaritons are light-matter states with select angular momentum holding technological promise. Here, the authors present the theory of such states, and propose their realisation based on a phenomenon called "apparent circular dichroism".

TI Spectral kissing and its dynamical consequences in the squeeze-driven
   Kerr oscillator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Transmon qubits are the predominant element in circuit-based quantum information processing, such as existing quantum computers, due to their controllability and ease of engineering implementation. But more than qubits, transmons are multilevel nonlinear oscillators that can be used to investigate fundamental physics questions. Here, they are explored as simulators of excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs), which are generalizations of quantum phase transitions to excited states. We show that the spectral kissing (coalescence of pairs of energy levels) experimentally observed in the effective Hamiltonian of a driven SNAIL-transmon is an ESQPT precursor. We explore the dynamical consequences of the ESQPT, which include the exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlators, followed by periodic revivals, and the slow evolution of the survival probability due to localization. These signatures of ESQPT are within reach for current superconducting circuits platforms and are of interest to experiments with cold atoms and ion traps.

TI Topological on-chip lasers
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB A miniature on-chip laser is an essential component of photonic integrated circuits for a plethora of applications, including optical communication and quantum information processing. However, the contradicting requirements of small footprint, robustness, single-mode operation, and high output power have led to a multi-decade search for the optimal on-chip laser design. During this search, topological phases of matter-conceived initially in electronic materials in condensed matter physics-were successfully extended to photonics and applied to miniature laser designs. Benefiting from the topological protection, a topological edge mode laser can emit more efficiently and more robustly than one emitting from a trivial bulk mode. In addition, single-mode operation over a large range of excitation energies can be achieved by strategically manipulating topological modes in a laser cavity.

TI THE CONNES EMBEDDING PROBLEM: A GUIDED TOUR
SO BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY
AB The Connes embedding problem (CEP) is a problem in the theory of tracial von Neumann algebras and asks whether or not every tracial von Neumann algebra embeds into an ultrapower of the hyperfinite II1 factor. The CEP has had interactions with a wide variety of areas of mathematics, including C degrees-algebra theory, geometric group theory, free probability, and noncommutative real algebraic geometry, to name a few. After remaining open for over 40 years, a negative solution was recently obtained as a corollary of a landmark result in quantum complexity theory known as MIP degrees " RE. In these notes, we introduce all of the background material necessary to understand the proof of the negative solution of the CEP from MIP degrees " RE. In fact, we outline two such proofs, one following the "traditional" route that goes via Kirchberg's QWEP problem in C degrees -algebra theory and Tsirelson's problem in quantum information theory and a second that uses basic ideas from logic.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in two-sided sequential measurements
   with one entangled pair
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocality and quantum measurement are two fundamental topics in quantum theory and their interplay attracts intensive focuses since the discovery of Bell theorem. Recently, nonlocality sharing among multiple observers with one entangled pair has been predicted and experimentally observed by generalized quantum measurement-weak measurement. However, only the one-sided sequential case, i.e., one Alice and multiple Bobs, is widely discussed and little is known about the two-sided case. Here, we theoretically and experimentally explore the nonlocality sharing in the two-sided sequential measurements case in which one entangled pair is distributed to multiple Alices and Bobs. We experimentally observed double Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering among four observers in a photonic system. In the case that all observers adopt the same measurement strength of the weak measurement, it is observed that double EPR steering can be demonstrated simultaneously. The results not only deepen our understanding of relation between sequential measurements and nonlocality but also may find important applications in many quantum information tasks, such as randomness certification.

TI Spin Hall effect of light based on a surface plasmonic platform
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB In recent years, the spin Hall effect of light (SHE), also called the photonic spin Hall effect has received extensive research attention, and a series of interesting results have been achieved. This phenomenon has potential applications in nanooptics, quantum information, and optoelectronic devices. In contrast to the pure photon SHE, the photonic spin Hall effect in the surface plasmonic platform exhibits unique properties due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of noble metal material and establishes the connection between photons and electrons. Therefore, the SHE of light in a surface plasmonic platform is expected to be applied to integrated optical devices to create a novel means of developing communication devices. In this paper, we review the progress on the SHE of light based on the plasmonic platform in recent years, and we discuss the future directions of research and prospects for its applications.

TI Optical Amplification and Fast-Slow Light in a Three-Mode Cavity
   Optomechanical System without Rotating Wave Approximation
SO PHOTONICS
AB We investigate the optical amplification of the output field and fast-slow light effect in a three-mode cavity optomechanical system without rotating wave approximation and discuss two ways of realizing the optical amplification effect. Resorting to the Coulomb coupling between the nanomechanical resonators, the asymmetric double optomechanically induced amplification effect can be achieved by utilizing the counterrotating term. Moreover, we find a remarkable optical amplification effect and observe the prominent fast-slow light effect at the singular point since the introduction of mechanical gain. Meanwhile, the transmission rate of the output field is increased by four orders of magnitude and the group delay time can reach in the order of 10(5) mu s. Our work is of great significance for the potential applications of optomechanically induced amplification in quantum information processing and quantum precision measurement.

TI Piezoacoustics for precision control of electrons floating on helium
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Piezoelectric surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are powerful for investigating and controlling elementary and collective excitations in condensed matter. In semiconductor two-dimensional electron systems SAWs have been used to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of electronic states, produce quantized charge pumping, and transfer quantum information. In contrast to semiconductors, electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium form an ultra-high mobility, two-dimensional electron system home to strongly-interacting Coulomb liquid and solid states, which exhibit non-trivial spatial structure and temporal dynamics prime for SAW-based experiments. Here we report on the coupling of electrons on helium to an evanescent piezoelectric SAW. We demonstrate precision acoustoelectric transport of as little as similar to 0.01% of the electrons, opening the door to future quantized charge pumping experiments. We also show SAWs are a route to investigating the high-frequency dynamical response, and relaxational processes, of collective excitations of the electronic liquid and solid phases of electrons on helium.

TI ENTANGLEABILITY OF CONES
SO GEOMETRIC AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
AB We solve a long-standing conjecture by Barker, proving that the minimal and maximal tensor products of two finite-dimensional proper cones coincide if and only if one of the two cones is generated by a linearly independent set. Here, given two proper cones C-1, C-2, their minimal tensor product is the cone generated by products of the form x(1) circle times x(2), where x(1) is an element of C-1 and x(2) is an element of C-2, while their maximal tensor product is the set of tensors that are positive under all product functionals phi(1) circle times phi(2), where phi(1)vertical bar C-1 >= 0 and phi(2)vertical bar C-2 >= 0. Our proof techniques involve a mix of convex geometry, elementary algebraic topology, and computations inspired by quantum information theory. Our motivation comes from the foundations of physics: as an application, we show that any two non-classical systems modelled by general probabilistic theories can be entangled.

TI A micro-optical module for multi-wavelength addressing of trapped ions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The control of large-scale quantum information processors based on arrays of trapped ions requires a means to route and focus multiple laser beams to each of many trapping sites in parallel. Here, we combine arrays of fibres, 3D laser-written waveguides and diffractive microlenses to demonstrate the principle of a micro-optic interconnect suited to this task. The module is intended for use with an ion microtrap of 3D electrode geometry. It guides ten independent laser beams with unique trajectories to illuminate a pair of spatially separated target points. Three blue and two infrared beams converge to overlap precisely at each desired position. Typical relative crosstalk intensities in the blue are 3.6 x 10(-3) and the average insertion loss across all channels is 8 dB. The module occupies similar to 10(4) times less volume than a conventional bulk-optic equivalent and is suited to different ion species.

TI Advances in optical bistability: Theory, devices, and emerging
   applications
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB The nonlinear phenomenon known as optical bistability, which enables optical systems to maintain two stable output states for a single input, is thoroughly examined in this review article. Through a detailed analysis of two important devices-the Simple Fiber Ring (SFR) resonator and the Nonlinear Optical Loop Mirror (NOLM)-it investigates the basic concepts of optical bistability, namely nonlinearity and feedback. Numerical simulations demonstrating dynamic dynamics and stability conditions bolster a strong theoretical framework. Recent advancements in bistable optical technologies, including developments in epsilon-near-zero materials, silicon photonics, hybrid plasmonic structures, neuromorphic photonics, and AI-driven photonic processors are also discussed. Furthermore, this review highlights emerging applications of optical bistability in optical logic circuits, high-speed communication, and quantum information processing. This review work is a useful tool for researchers and engineers creating next-generation optical systems because it connects theoretical insights with cutting-edge technological developments.

TI Entanglement Asymmetry in Conformal Field Theory and Holography
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called the Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the anti-de-Sitter bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.

TI Protocol for nearly deterministic parity projection on two photonic
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Photonic parity projection plays an important role in photonic quantum information processing. Nondestructive parity projections normally require high-fidelity controlled-Z gates between photonic and matter qubits, which can be experimentally demanding. In this paper, we propose a nearly deterministic parity projection protocol on two photonic qubits which only requires stable matter-photon controlled-phase gates. We also demonstrate that our protocol can tolerate moderate Gaussian phase errors in the controlled-phase gates as well as Pauli errors on the matter qubits. The fact that our protocol does not require perfect controlled-Z gates makes it more amenable to experimental implementation. Although we focus on photonic qubits, our protocol can be applied to any physical system or circuit with imperfect controlled-Z gates. Our protocol also provides a new optimization space for parity projection operations on various physical platforms, which is potentially beneficial for achieving high-fidelity parity projection operations.

TI High-Fidelity, Multiqubit Generalized Measurements with Dynamic Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Generalized measurements, also called positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), can offer advantages over projective measurements in various quantum information tasks. Here, we realize a generalized measurement of one and two superconducting qubits with high fidelity and in a single experimental setting. To do so, we propose a hybrid method, the "Naimark-terminated binary tree," based on a hybridization of Naimark's dilation and binary tree techniques that leverages emerging hardware capabilities for midcircuit measurements and feed-forward control. Furthermore, we showcase a highly effective use of approximate compiling to enhance POVM fidelity in noisy conditions. We argue that our hybrid method scales better toward larger system sizes than its constituent methods and demonstrate its advantage by performing detector tomography of symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC POVM). Detector fidelity is further improved through a composite error-mitigation strategy that incorporates twirling and a newly devised conditional readout error mitigation. Looking forward, we expect improvements in approximate compilation and hardware noise for dynamic circuits to enable generalized measurements of larger multiqubit POVMs on superconducting qubits.

TI Universality of quantum time dilation
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Time dilation is a difference in measured time between two clocks that either move with different velocities or experience different gravitational potentials. Both of these effects stem from the theory of relativity and are usually associated with classically defined trajectories, characterized by position, momentum, and acceleration. However, when spatial degrees of freedom are treated in a quantum way and a clock is allowed to be in a coherent superposition of either two momenta or two heights, additional quantum corrections to classical time dilation appear, called kinematic and gravitational quantum time dilations, respectively. We show that similarly to its classical counterpart, kinematic quantum time dilation is universal for any clock mechanism, while gravitational quantum time dilation is not. We also show that although both of these effects reduce to incoherent averaging of different classical time dilation contributions, there exists an additional quantum time dilation effect that has no classical analog and can be extracted from higher-order corrections to the system's Hamiltonian.

TI Fundamental quantum limits of magnetic nearfield measurements
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Major advances in the precision of magnetic measurements bring us closer to quantum detection of individual spins at the single-atom level. On the quest for reducing both classical and quantum measurement noise, it is intriguing to look forward and search for precision limits arising from the fundamental quantum nature of the measurement process itself. Here, we present the limits of magnetic quantum measurements arising from quantum information considerations, and apply these limits to a concrete example of magnetic force microscopy (MFM). We show how such microscopes have a fundamental limit on their precision arising from the theory of imperfect quantum cloning, manifested by the entanglement between the measured system and the measurement probe. We show that counterintuitively, increasing the probe complexity decreases both the measurement noise and back action, and a judicious design of the magnetic interaction reveals optimal schemes already at spin-1 probes.

SO NANOSCALE
AB Magnetic hybrid metal-organic interfaces possess a great potential in areas such as organic spintronics and quantum information processing. However, tuning their carrier injection barriers on-demand is fundamental for the implementation in technological devices. We have prepared hybrid metal-organic interfaces by the adsorption of copper phthalocyanine CuPc on REAu2 surfaces (RE = Gd, Ho and Yb) and studied their growth, electrostatics and electronic structure. CuPc exhibits a long-range commensurability and a vacuum level pinning of the molecular energy levels. We observe a significant effect of the RE valence of the substrate on the carrier injection barrier of the hybrid metal-organic interface. CuPc adsorbed on trivalent RE-based surfaces (HoAu2 and GdAu2) exhibits molecular level energies that may allow injection carriers significantly closer to an ambipolar injection behavior than in the divalent case (YbAu2).

TI Optimal Frobenius light cone in spin chains with power-law interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In many-body quantum systems with spatially local interactions, quantum information propagates with a finite velocity, reminiscent of the "light cone" of relativity. In systems with long-range interactions which decay with distance r as 1/r(alpha), however, there are multiple light cones which control different information theoretic tasks. We show an optimal (up to logarithms) "Frobenius light cone" obeying t similar to r(min(alpha-1,1)) for alpha > 1 in one-dimensional power-law interacting systems with finite local dimension: this controls, among other physical properties, the butterfly velocity characterizing many-body chaos and operator growth. We construct an explicit random Hamiltonian protocol that saturates the bound and settles the optimal Frobenius light cone in one dimension. We partially extend our constraints on the Frobenius light cone to a several operator p-norms, and show that Lieb-Robinson bounds can be saturated in at most an exponentially small e(-Omega(r)) fraction of the many-body Hilbert space.

TI Electrothermoplasmonic Trapping and Dynamic Manipulation of Single
   Colloidal Nanodiamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Low-power trapping of nanoscale objects can be achieved by using the enhanced fields near plasmonic nanoantennas. Unfortunately, in this approach the trap site is limited to the position of the plasmonic hotspots and continuous dynamic manipulation is not feasible. Here, we report a low-frequency electrothermoplasmonic tweezer (LFET) that provides low-power, high-stability and continuous dynamic manipulation of a single nanodiamond. LFET harnesses the combined action of the laser illumination of a plasmonic nanopillar antenna array and low-frequency alternating current (ac) electric field to establish an electrohydrodynamic potential capable of the stable trapping and dynamic manipulation of single nanodiamonds. We experimentally demonstrate the fast transport, trapping, and dynamic manipulation of a single nanodiamond using a low-frequency ac field below 5 kHz and low-laser power of 1 mW. This nanotweezer platform for nanodiamond manipulation holds promise for the scalable assembly of single photon sources for quantum information processing and low noise quantum sensors.

TI Exact analytical treatment of multiqubit noisy dynamics in
   exchange-coupled semiconductor spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Charge noise remains the primary obstacle to the development of quantum information technologies with semiconductor spin qubits. We use an exact analytical calculation to determine the effects of quasistatic charge noise on a ring of three equally spaced exchange-coupled quantum dots. We calculate the disorder-averaged return probability from a specific initial state and use it to determine the coherence time T-2* and show that it depends on only the disorder strength and not the mean interaction strength. We also use a perturbative approach to investigate other arrangements of three or four qubits, finding that the return probability contains multiple oscillation frequencies. These oscillations decay in a Gaussian manner, determined by differences in energy levels of the Hamiltonian. We give quantitative values for gate times resulting in several target fidelities. We find that the decoherence time decreases with an increasing number of qubits. Our work provides useful analytical insight into the charge noise dynamics of coupled spin qubits.

TI Coherent phonon flatband generated in GaAs/AlAs superlattices via
   layer-selective optical pumping
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Flatbands, characterized by their dispersionless energy levels in electronic, magnetic, and phononic systems, hold substantial potential for advancements in electronics and quantum information processing. Most flatbands exist in thermal equilibrium and cannot be easily created or annihilated externally, limiting their flexibility as switchable knobs for use in microelectronics and quantum applications. In our work, we demonstrate the generation of a coherent phonon flatband in a GaAs/AlAs superlattice using 800 nm femtosecond laser pulses. This coherent phonon flatband does not correspond to a phonon eigenmode at equilibrium and exhibits strong coupling with two branches of coherently excited longitudinal phonon modes. With molecular dynamics simulations, we show more generally that the coherent phonon flatband can be induced by coherently and spatially modulated optical excitations of superlattice structures. Our results highlight a pathway for coherent phonon flatband creation in the time domain that can be generalized to various superlattice systems, potentially inspiring the realization of coherent flatband generation of other quasiparticles.

TI A LiNbO3 Platform with Tailored Thickness Bridging Bulk and
   Thin Film: Application to Broadband Frequency Conversion
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We introduce a monolithic LiNbO3 membrane platform that bridges bulk and thin-film approaches, enabling custom-tailored waveguide cross sections. Using a combination of saw dicing and reactive ion etching (RIE), we fabricate LiNbO3 structures with adaptable thicknesses ranging from 400 nm to several microns, identifying 2 mu m as an optimal value for addressing key challenges in frequency conversion. Our platform demonstrates robust second harmonic generation (SHG) with a broad pump wavelength response of up to 150 nm within the C-band at room temperature, achieved by tuning the waveguide thickness, while maintaining low coupling losses of 0.8 dB/facet. These results represent a significant step toward versatile integrated photonic systems, advancing applications in broadband spectroscopy, quantum information processing, and sensing through efficient and spectrally agile nonlinear frequency conversion.

TI Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler
   invariant
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.

TI Phase-matched five-wave mixing in zinc oxide microwire
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB High-order wave mixing in solid-state platforms gather increasing importance due to the development of advanced lasers and integrated photonic circuit for both classical and quantum information. However, the high-order wave mixing is generally inefficient in solids under weak pump. Here, we observed the presence of phase matching of five-wave mixing (5WM) propagating in a zinc oxide (ZnO) microwire. The 5WM signal is enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude under the phase matching conditions, reaching an absolute conversion efficiency of 1.7 x 10-13 when the peak pumping power density is about 106 W/cm2. The propagation of multiple nonlinear signals, including sum frequency generation, third harmonic generation, four-wave mixing etc., benefited from both the large nonlinear coefficients and the wide transparent window of ZnO, implies the possibility of developing cascaded nonlinear process under higher pumping. This study enriches the ZnO platform for integrated nonlinear nanophotonics.

TI Millisecond-Scale Charge-Carrier Recombination Dynamics in the
   CsPbBr3 Perovskite
SO ADVANCED ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY RESEARCH
AB Understanding the recombination lifetime of charge carriers (tau(c)) is essential for the diverse applications of photovoltaic materials, such as perovskites. The study on the inorganic perovskite, CsPbBr3, reveals recombination dynamics exceeding 1 ms below 200 K and tau(c) approaching 100 mu s at room temperature. Utilizing time-resolved microwave-detected photoconductivity decay in conjunction with injection dependence, it is found that tau(c) is dominated by impurity charge trapping. The observed injection dependence is well corroborated by modeling of the trap mechanism. The ultralong decay time is also consistent with photoconductivity measurements with a continuous-wave excitation at powers corresponding to around 1 Sun irradiation. While charge-carrier trapping may, in theory, impose limitations on the photovoltaic efficiency of single-cell devices, it can also contribute to increased efficiency in tandem cells and find applications in photodetection, photocatalysis, and quantum information storage.

TI Frustrated mixed-spin ladders: Evidence for a bond-order wave phase
   between rung-singlet and Haldane phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In frustrated spin ladders, the interplay of frustration and correlations leads to the familiar Haldane (H) and rung-singlet (RS) phases. The nature of the transition between these two phases is still under debate. In this paper we tackle this issue using tools of quantum information theory. We consider frustrated mixed-spin-(1, 1/2) ladders with antiferromagnetic leg, rung and diagonal couplings, and calculate various quantities, such as the entanglement entropy (EE), the Schmidt gap, and the level degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum (ES). We use two numerical techniques, the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We demonstrate that there exists an intermediate phase in which the ES levels do not exhibit the characteristic degeneracies of the H and RS phases. To understand the underlying physics in this phase, we investigate short-range spin correlations along legs, rungs and diagonals and show that in this intermediate phase long-wavelength modulations occur, akin to bond-order waves.

TI Phase estimation of an SU(1,1) interferometer with a coherent
   superposition squeezed vacuum in a realistic case
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The phase sensitivity of SU(1,1) interferometer is investigated using a coherent state and an m-coherent superposition squeezed vacuum states as inputs and the intensity detection. Photon-subtraction, photon-addition and photon superposition are three special cases. Both ideal and realistic cases are considered. It is shown that the coefficient s of coherent superposition can modulate the performance of phase sensitivity, especially in a small squeezing region. Even in the presence of photon losses, the three-kind of non-Gaussian operations can achieve the improvement of measure precision, and the photon addition presents the best robustness compared to the photon subtraction and coherent superposition. For small squeezing, the first-order non-Gaussian operation may be the most preferred in improving phase sensitivity if considering the limitations of experimental conditions. Our results may be helpful for the practical application of quantum information.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Retrieving High-Dimensional Quantum Steering from a Noisy Environment
   with N Measurement Settings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB One of the most often implied benefits of high-dimensional (HD) quantum systems is to lead to stronger forms of correlations, featuring increased robustness to noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the n-setting linear HI) quantum steering criterion. We verify the large violation of the steering inequalities without full-state tomography. The lower bound of the violation is 2.24 +/- 0.01 in 11 dimensions, exceeding the bound (V < 2) of two-setting criteria. Hence, a higher strength of steering has been revealed. Moreover, we demonstrate the method for enhancing the noise robustness without increasing dimension, alternatively, by increasing measurement settings. Using the entanglement in 11 dimensions, we experimentally retrieve steering nonlocality with 63.4 +/- 1.4% isotropic noise fraction, surpassing the 50% limitation of two-setting criteria. Our Letter offers the potential for practical one-sided device-independent quantum information processing that tolerates the noisy environment, lossy detection, and transcends the present transmission distance limitation.

TI Relativistic motion on Gaussian quantum steering for two-mode localized
   Gaussian states
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Realistic quantum systems always exhibit gravitational and relativistic features. In this paper, we investigate the properties of Gaussian steering and its asymmetry by the localized two-mode Gaussian quantum states, instead of the traditional single-mode approximation method in the relativistic setting. We find that the one-side Gaussian quantum steering will monotonically decrease with increasing observers of acceleration. Meanwhile, our results also reveal the interesting behavior of the Gaussian steering asymmetry, which increases for a specific range of accelerated parameter and then gradually approaches to a finite value. Such finding is well consistent and explained by the well-known Unruh effect, which could significantly destroy the one-side Gaussian quantum steering. Finally, our results could also be applied to the dynamical studies of Gaussian steering between the Earth and satellites, since the effects of acceleration are equal to the effects of gravity according to the equivalence principle.

AB We experimentally demonstrate a polarization-entangled photon source at 810 nm using a type-II phase-matched periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal pumped by a low-cost, broadband laser diode with a central wavelength of 405 nm and a typical bandwidth of 0.53 nm. The PPKTP crystal is placed in a Sagnac loop to realize the compact size and high stability. The downconverted biphotons, the signal and the idler, have typical bandwidths of 5.57 and 7.32 nm. We prepare two Bell states vertical bar Psi(+)> and vertical bar Psi(-)> with the fidelities of 0.948 +/- 0.004 and 0.963 +/- 0.002. In the polarization correlation measurement, the visibilities are all higher than 96.2%, and in the Bell inequality test, the S value can achieve 2.78 +/- 0.01.

TI A high-SNR resonant balanced photodetector with LC notch filter for the
   pulsed light
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB The pulsed squeezed state plays a pivotal role in quantum information processing and precision measurement. In the detection of the pulsed squeezed state, the high noise power at its repetition rate prevents the achievement of a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, a high-SNR detector that can suppress the high noise power of the repetition rate of pulsed light is very crucial. In this paper, we present a high-SNR resonant balanced photodetector that filters out the noise power of the repetition rate by introducing an LC series notch filter. A 24.37 dB attenuation is obtained at the 80 MHz repetition rate by finely adjusting the capacitance of the LC series notch filter. Consequently, the photodetector's maximum SNR is improved to 19.60 dB, which is 5 dB higher than previous studies. Our work provides a key detection tool for the measurement of the pulsed squeezed state.

AB Phase and amplitude modes, also called polariton modes, are emergent phenomena that manifest across diverse physical systems, from condensed matter and particle physics to quantum optics. We study their behavior in an anisotropic Dicke model that includes collective matter interactions. We study the low-lying spectrum in the thermodynamic limit via the Holstein-Primakoff transformation and contrast the results with the semi-classical energy surface obtained via coherent states. We also explore the geometric phase for both boson and spin contours in the parameter space as a function of the phases in the system. We unveil novel phenomena due to the unique critical features provided by the interplay between the anisotropy and matter interactions. We expect our results to serve the observation of phase and amplitude modes in current quantum information platforms.

AB We design and fabricate shallow -etched periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides to realize highly efficient broadband spontaneous parametric down -conversion (SPDC) on nanophotonic chips. The shallow -etched waveguide can tolerate the non -uniformities of waveguide width induced by fabrication imperfections, enabling the generation of photon pairs with high count rate and bandwidth. We demonstrate photon -pair generation with a high brightness of 11.7 GHz/mW and bandwidth of 22 THz in a 5.7 -mm -long PPLN waveguide. The generated photon pairs exhibit a strong temporal correlation with a coincidence -to -accidental ratio of up to 16262 +/- 850. Our results confirm the feasibility of shallow etching in the fabrication of an efficient SPDC device on the platform of lithium niobate on an insulator, and benefit quantum information processing with a broadband photon source.

TI Unveiling and veiling an entangled light-matter quantum state from the
   vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ground state of an atom interacting with the electromagnetic field in the ultrastrong coupling regime is composed of virtual photons entangled with the atom. We propose a method to promote to real the entire photonic state, while preserving the entanglement with the atom. The process can be reversed, and the entangled state can be restored in the vacuum. We consider a four-level atom, with two of these levels ultrastrongly coupled to a cavity mode. The process is obtained by making use of either an ideal ultrafast pulse or a more realistic multitone pi pulse that drives only the atom. An experimental realization of this proposal will not only enable the investigation of the exotic phenomena of emission of particles from the vacuum, but will also prove that quantum superposition states can be extracted from the vacuum. Moreover, it will allow one to inspect the ground state in the ultrastrong coupling regime, and to generate on-demand entangled states for quantum information processing.

TI Information geometry of operator scaling
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Matrix scaling is a classical problem with a wide range of applications. It is known that the Sinkhorn algorithm for matrix scaling is interpreted as alternating e-projections from the viewpoint of classical information geometry. Recently, a generalization of matrix scaling to completely positive maps called operator scaling has been found to appear in various fields of mathematics and computer science, and the Sinkhorn algorithm has been extended to operator scaling. In this study, the operator Sinkhorn algorithm is studied from the viewpoint of quantum information geometry through the Choi representation of completely positive maps. The operator Sinkhorn algorithm is shown to coincide with alternating e-projections with respect to the symmetric logarithmic derivative metric, which is a Riemannian metric on the space of quantum states relevant to quantum estimation theory.

TI Proposal for a Bell test in cavity optomagnonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a proposal to test the Bell inequality in the emerging field of cavity optomagnonics, where a sphere of ferromagnetic crystal supports two optical whispering gallery modes and one magnon mode. The two optical modes are driven by two laser pulses, respectively. Entanglement between the magnon mode and one of the two optical modes will be generated by the first pulse, and the state of the magnon mode is subsequently mapped into another optical mode via the second pulse. Hence correlated photon-photon pairs are created out of the cavity. A Bell test can be implemented by using these pairs, which enables us to test the local hiddenvariable models at macroscopic scales. Our results show that a significant violation of the Bell inequality can be obtained in the weak-coupling regime. The violation of the Bell inequality not only verifies the entanglement between magnons and photons, but also implies that cavity optomagnonics is a promising platform for quantum information processing tasks.

TI Generation and Detection of Structured Light: A Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Structured light beams have rapidly advanced over the past few years, from specific spatial-transverse/longitudinal structure to tailored spatiotemporal structure. Such beams with diverse spatial structures or spatiotemporal structures have brought various breakthroughs to many fields, including optical communications, optical sensing, micromanipulation, quantum information processing, and super-resolution imaging. Thus, plenty of methods have been proposed, and lots of devices have been manufactured to generate structured light beams by tailoring the structures of beams in the space domain and the space-time domain. In this paper, we firstly give a brief introduction of different types of structured light. Then, we review the recent research progress in the generation and detection of structured light on different platforms, such as free space, optical fiber, and integrated devices. Finally, challenges and perspectives are also discussed.

TI Fluorescence enhancement of a single germanium vacancy center in a
   nanodiamond by a plasmonic Bragg cavity
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Germanium vacancy (GeV) centers in diamonds constitute a promising platform for single-photon sources to be used in quantum information technologies. Emission from these color centers can be enhanced by utilizing a cavity that is resonant at the peak emission wavelength. We investigate circular plasmonic Bragg cavities for enhancing the emission from single GeV centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) at the zero phonon line. Following simulations of the enhancement for different configuration parameters, the appropriately designed Bragg cavities together with out-coupling gratings composed of hydrogen silsesquioxane ridges are fabricated around the NDs containing nitrogen vacancy centers deposited on a silica-coated silver surface. We characterize the fabricated configurations and finely tune the cavity parameters to match the GeV emission. Finally, we fabricate the cavity containing a single GeV-ND and compare the total decay-rate before and after cavity fabrication, finding a decay-rate enhancement of similar to 5.5 and thereby experimentally confirming the feasibility of emission enhancement with circular plasmonic cavities.

TI Gravitational interactions with information dynamics
SO FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
AB Introduction Unifying gravity with quantum mechanics remains a cornerstone challenge in physics, with information theory providing a transformative perspective through concepts like the holographic principle and entropic gravity.Methods We derive an observer-independent information density field from coarse-grained Shannon entropy of classical matter configurations at nuclear scales, establish thermodynamically motivated coupling constants using hadronic physics, prove gauge invariance including novel information symmetries, and enhance experimental designs with detailed error budgets and theory differentiation.Results The framework predicts modified gravitational lensing corrections ( delta similar to 1 0 - 8 ) and quantum phase shifts ( Delta phi similar to 1 0 - 12 rad), verifiable within 1-5 years using precision astrometry and matter-wave interferometry, supported by comprehensive derivations, Python verification code, and professional diagrams.Discussion This work positions information-theoretic gravity as a rigorous, testable paradigm that bridges classical relativity and quantum information, with potential extensions to broader unification while maintaining focus on gravitational interactions.

TI Research Progress on Silicon Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB The silicon vacancy (SiV) color centers in diamond have significant potential in the fields of quantum information, nanophotonics, bioimaging and sensing, due to its good structural stability at room temperature, strong photostability, short luminescence lifetime, narrow zero-phonon line bandwidth, and avoidance of biological autofluorescence. They have attracted extensive attention and in-depth research from researchers. The applications of SiV color centers in the above areas require addressing key issues such as control over the number and charge state of SiV color centers in diamond, as well as improving the luminous efficiency. Therefore, this review summarizes some recent relevant research progress, including common methods for preparing SiV color centers, control over their luminescence intensity, preparation of SiV single-photon sources, and research on the control of SiV color center charge states. Based on these, an outlook is provided for the preparation and application of SiV color centers in diamond.

TI Loss resilience of driven-dissipative remote entanglement in chiral
   waveguide quantum electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Establishing limits of entanglement in open quantum systems is a problem of fundamental interest, with strong implications for applications in quantum information science. Here, we study the limits of entanglement stabilization between remote qubits. We theoretically investigate the loss resilience of driven-dissipative entanglement between remote qubits coupled to a chiral waveguide. We find that by coupling a pair of storage qubits to the two driven qubits, the steady state can be tailored such that the storage qubits show a degree of entanglement that is higher than what can be achieved with only two driven qubits coupled to the waveguide. By reducing the degree of entanglement of the driven qubits, we show that the entanglement between the storage qubits becomes more resilient to waveguide loss. Our analytical and numerical results offer insights into how waveguide loss limits the degree of entanglement in this driven-dissipative system, and they offer important guidance for remote entanglement stabilization in the laboratory, for example using superconducting circuits.

TI Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in B → φφ Decays
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The decays of the B meson into vector mesons, observed during the LHCb experiment, provide an ideal laboratory to investigate particle physics phenomena with quantum information theory methods. In this article, we focus on the decays yielding a pair of phi mesons to investigate the presence of entanglement in the spin correlations of the system and quantify the amount of Bell inequality violation it entails. Our results show that the present LHCb data allow access to entanglement and to the Bell inequality violation with a significance exceeding the 5 sigma threshold in both the cases. This demonstrates that the strong and electroweak interactions responsible for the B meson decay act as a source of entanglement and the quantum mechanics nature of high-energy phenomena. Particular attention is paid to the assessment of loopholes: deficiencies in the experimental setup which could invalidate the results of the Bell test.

TI Double holography of entangled universes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We employ double holography to examine a system of two entangled gravitating universes that live on two codimension-one branes in an asymptotically AdS3 spacetime with two disjoint conformal boundaries. There are distinct brane configurations depending on the temperature of the thermofield double (TFD) state between the left and right systems. The topology transition between two branes is naturally identified with the emergence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the two entangled universes. This doubly holographic construction offers a holographic perspective on gravitational collapse and black hole formation in brane universes. Through this holographic framework, we analyze the quantum information structure of the two gravitating universes. Specifically, we calculate the mutual information between defects present in the boundary theories on the left and right sides. Furthermore, we investigate the decoupling process in the Hayden-Preskill protocol applied to the two copies of the defect field theory and discuss the interpretation of the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding protocol.

TI Spatiotemporal vortex strings
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) holds unique properties and boosts myriad applications in diverse fields. However, the generation of an ultrafast wave packet carrying numerous vortices with various transverse OAM modes, i.e., vortex string, remains challenging, and the corresponding detection method is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a vortex string with 28 spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) with customizable topological charge (TC) arrangements can be generated in one wave packet. The diffraction rules of STOV strings are revealed theoretically and experimentally. Following these rules, the TC values and positions of all STOVs in a vortex string can be simultaneously recognized from the diffraction pattern. Such STOV strings facilitate STOV-based optical communication. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, the transmission of an image is realized with 16-STOV strings. This work provides guidance for revealing the underlying properties of the transverse OAM light and opens up opportunities for applications of the structured light in optical communication, quantum information processing, etc.

TI Observing Schrödinger's cat with artificial intelligence: emergent
   classicality from information bottleneck
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We train a generative language model on the randomized local measurement data collected from Schrodinger's cat quantum state. We demonstrate that the classical reality emerges in the language model due to the information bottleneck: although our training data contains the full quantum information about Schrodinger's cat, a weak language model can only learn to capture the classical reality of the cat from the data. We identify the quantum-classical boundary in terms of both the size of the quantum system and the information processing power of the classical intelligent agent, which indicates that a stronger agent can realize more quantum nature in the environmental noise surrounding the quantum system. Our approach opens up a new avenue for using the big data generated on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to train generative models for representation learning of quantum operators, which might be a step toward our ultimate goal of creating an artificial intelligence quantum physicist.

TI Transition to chaos in extended systems and their quantum impurity
   models
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Chaos sets a fundamental limit to quantum-information processing schemes. We study the onset of chaos in spatially extended quantum many-body systems that are relevant to quantum optical devices. We consider an extended version of the Tavis-Cummings model on a finite chain. By studying level-spacing statistics, adjacent gap ratios, and spectral form factors, we observe the transition from integrability to chaos as the hopping between the Tavis-Cummings sites is increased above a finite value. The results are obtained by means of exact numerical diagonalization which becomes notoriously hard for extended lattice geometries. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, we identify a minimal single-site quantum impurity model that successfully captures the spectral properties of the lattice model. This approach is intended to be adaptable to other lattice models with large local Hilbert spaces.

TI Propagation-induced revival of entanglement in the angle-OAM bases
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Although the continuous-variable position-momentum entanglement of photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion has applicability in several quantum information applications, it is not suitable for applications involving long-distance propagation. This is because entanglement in the position-momentum bases, as seen through Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-correlation measurements, decays very rapidly with photons propagating away from the source. In contrast, in this article, we show that in the continuous-variable bases of angleorbital angular momentum (OAM), the entanglement, as seen through EPR-correlation measurements, exhibits a remarkably different behavior. As with the position-momentum bases, initially, the entanglement in the angleOAM bases also decays with propagation, and after a few centimeters of propagation, there is no angle-OAM entanglement left. However, as the photons continue to travel further away from the source, the entanglement in the angle-OAM bases revives. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate this behavior and show that angle-OAM entanglement revives even in the presence of strong turbulence.

TI Analysis of the effects of nonextensivity for a generalized dissipative
   system in the SU(1,1) coherent states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The characteristics of nonextensivity for a general quantum dissipative oscillatory system in the SU(1,1) coherent states are investigated using the invariant operator method. We consider a deformed Caldirola-Kanai oscillator represented in terms of a parameter q which is a measure of the degree of nonextensivity. The nonextensivity effects on the parametric evolution of the SU(1,1) coherent states are elucidated. We compare our results with those of previous researches and address the advantage of our methodology which adopts the linear invariant operator. In particular, the nonextensive behaviors associated with the fluctuations of canonical variables and the dissipation of quantum energy are analyzed in detail regarding their dependence on q. The properties of SU(1,1) coherent states that we adopt here can be utilized in quantum-information processes such as cloning, swapping, and teleportation of state information.

TI Quantum Emission Assisted by Energy Landscape Modification in
   Pentacene-Decorated Carbon Nanotubes
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Photoluminescent carbon nanotubes are expected to become versatile single-photon sources that have applications in quantum information processing. Quantum emission from carbon nanotubes is often induced by localization of excitons or exciton-exciton annihilation. Here, we modify the local energy landscape of excitons by decorating nanoscale pentacene particles onto airsuspended single-walled carbon nanotubes. Directional exciton transfer from the undecorated region to the decorated site is demonstrated, suggesting exciton trapping induced by local dielectric screening from pentacene particles. Photoluminescence and photon correlation measurements on a representative carbon nanotube reveal enhanced exciton-exciton annihilation and single-photon emission at room temperature. Pentacene particles are shown to promote strong photon antibunching at the decorated site, indicating that noncovalent functionalization using molecules can be an effective approach for energy landscape modification and quantum emission in carbon nanotubes.

TI Research Progress in Optical Lateral Force and Optical Pulling Force
   (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Optical manipulation technology has rapidly developed into a significant research area in recent years, which utilizes light-matter interactions to capture and control objects. Due to its non-contact, non-destructive, and high-precision manipulation, this technology exhibits substantial potential in fields such as life science, quantum information, and precision measurement. Notably, optical pulling and lateral forces, as critical mechanical effects that transcend traditional limitations of optical manipulation, have garnered considerable research in light manipulation. This article reviews the progress in optical pulling and lateral forces by analyzing their generation mechanisms, implementation approaches, and application potential in areas like optical sorting, micro-nano robotics driven, and life science. Additionally, it systematically reviews and discusses the development histories of optical lateral and pulling forces, and explores future prospects and challenges within this dynamic field.

TI Amplified multipartite entanglement witnessed in a quantum critical
   metal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strong correlations in matter promote a landscape of quantum phases and associated quantum critical points. For metallic systems, there is increasing recognition that the quantum criticality goes beyond the Landau framework and, thus, further means are needed to characterize the quantum critical fluid. Here we do so by studying an entanglement quantity, the quantum Fisher information, in a strange metal system, focusing on the exemplary case of an Anderson/Kondo lattice model near its Kondo destruction quantum critical point. The spin quantum Fisher information peaks at the quantum critical point and indicates a strongly entangled ground state. Our results are supported by the quantum Fisher information extracted from inelastic neutron scattering measurements in heavy fermion metals. Our work elucidates the loss of quasiparticles in strange metals, opens a quantum information avenue to advance the understanding of metallic quantum criticality in a broad range of strongly correlated systems, and points to a regime of quantum matter to realize amplified entanglement.

TI Dynamics of Photoinduced Charge Carriers in Metal-Halide Perovskites
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The measurement and description of the charge-carrier lifetime (tau c) is crucial for the wide-ranging applications of lead-halide perovskites. We present time-resolved microwave-detected photoconductivity decay (TRMCD) measurements and a detailed analysis of the possible recombination mechanisms including trap-assisted, radiative, and Auger recombination. We prove that performing injection-dependent measurement is crucial in identifying the recombination mechanism. We present temperature and injection level dependent measurements in CsPbBr3, which is the most common inorganic lead-halide perovskite. In this material, we observe the dominance of charge-carrier trapping, which results in ultra-long charge-carrier lifetimes. Although charge trapping can limit the effectiveness of materials in photovoltaic applications, it also offers significant advantages for various alternative uses, including delayed and persistent photodetection, charge-trap memory, afterglow light-emitting diodes, quantum information storage, and photocatalytic activity.

TI Phonon transport manipulation in TiSe2 via reversible charge
   density wave melting
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Titanium diselenide (TiSe2) is a layered material that under a critical temperature of Tc approximate to 200 K features a periodic modulation of the electron density, known as charge density wave (CDW), which finds applications in quantum information and emerging electronic devices. Here, we present first-principles calculations showing the suppression of the CDW via photoexcitation and consequent stabilization of the undistorted high-temperature phase, in agreement with experimental observations. Interestingly, the unfolded CDW melting is accompanied by a sizable reduction in the thermal conductivity, kappa, of up to 25% and a large entropy increase of similar to 10 J K-1 kg(-1). The significant kappa variation is almost entirely originated from photoinduced changes in the phonon-phonon scattering processes involving a high-symmetry soft phonon mode. Our results open new possibilities in the design of devices for thermal management and phonon-based logic, and suggest original applications in the of context solid-state cooling.
