TI Nuclear shell-model simulation in digital quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The nuclear shell model is one of the prime many-body methods to study the structure of atomic nuclei, but it is hampered by an exponential scaling on the basis size as the number of particles increases. We present a shell-model quantum circuit design strategy to find nuclear ground states by exploiting an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. Our circuit implementation is in excellent agreement with classical shell-model simulations for a dozen of light and medium-mass nuclei, including neon and calcium isotopes. We quantify the circuit depth, width and number of gates to encode realistic shell-model wavefunctions. Our strategy also addresses explicitly energy measurements and the required number of circuits to perform them. Our simulated circuits approach the benchmark results exponentially with a polynomial scaling in quantum resources for each nucleus. This work paves the way for quantum computing shell-model studies across the nuclear chart and our quantum resource quantification may be used in configuration-interaction calculations of other fermionic systems.

AB The inherent complexity of quantum programs, due to features such as superposition and entanglement, makes their testing particularly challenging. To tackle these challenges, we present a search-based approach, called Quantum Search-Based Testing (QuSBT), for automatically generating test suites of a given size that possibly expose failures of the quantum program under test. QuSBT encodes a test suite as a search individual, and tries to maximize the objective function that counts the number of failing tests in the test suite. Due to non-deterministic nature of quantum programs, the approach repeats the execution of each test multiple times, and uses suitable statistical tests to assess if a test passes or fails. QuSBT employs a genetic algorithm to perform the search. Experiments on 30 faulty quantum programs show that QuSBT is statistically better than random search, and is able to efficiently generate maximal failing test suites.

TI On-Chip Nanoscale Light Source Based on Quantum Tunneling: Enabling
   Ultrafast Quantum Device and Sensing Applications
SO APPLIED SCIENCE AND CONVERGENCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Light sources are ubiquitous in our lives. Common light sources include sunlight and incandescent lamps, which emit visible spectrum to help us to see surrounding objects via blackbody radiation. Further understanding and control on the quanta of light, called photons, have led to numerous advances in nanophotonics and related research fields, but recently their impact has been most notable in quantum computing, communications, biosensing, and imaging technology. Most of these applications have been made possible through the development of ultrasmall and ultrafast light sources based on advanced nanotechnology. In this review, we aim to give a clear picture of the historical achievements regarding light sources and how recent studies have developed the field of ultrasmall light sources, especially in relation to quantum electron tunneling mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the potential applications for emerging quantum devices and sensing technologies.

TI Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free
   widely tunable external cavity laser
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Precision applications including quantum computing and sensing, mmWave/RF generation, and metrology, demand widely tunable, ultra-low phase noise lasers. Today, these experiments employ table-scale systems with bulk-optics and isolators to achieve requisite noise, stability, and tunability. Photonic integration will enable scalable, reliable and portable solutions. Here we report a hybrid-integrated external cavity widely tunable laser stabilized to a 10 m-long integrated coil-resonator, achieving record-low 3 - 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidth with 1.8E-13 ADEV at 6.4 ms across 40 nm, delivering orders of magnitude frequency noise and integral linewidth reduction over state of the art. Stabilization is achieved without an optical isolator, leveraging resilience to optical feedback of 30 dB beyond that of commercial DFB lasers. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same Si3N4 CMOS-compatible process, unlocking a path towards fully integrated visible to ShortWave-IR frequency-stabilized lasers.

TI Evaluating Variational Quantum Eigensolver Approaches for Simplified
   Models of Molecular Systems: A Case Study on Protocatechuic Acid
SO MOLECULES
AB The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum and classical computing to determine the ground-state energy of molecular systems. In this context, this study applies VQE to investigate the ground state of protocatechuic acid, analyzing its performance with various Ansatzes and active spaces. Subsequently, all VQE results were compared to those obtained with the CISD and FCI methods. The results demonstrate that Ansatzes, like Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) and variations of Hardware-Efficient Ansatzes, generally achieve accuracy close to that of FCI. In conclusion, this study highlights the effectiveness of VQE as a robust method for investigating molecular ground-state energies. Additionally, the findings emphasize the pivotal role of Ansatz design and active space selection in optimizing VQE performance, offering meaningful insights into its capabilities and constraints.

TI CARAF: Crypto Agility Risk Assessment Framework
SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY
AB Crypto agility refers to the ability of an entity to replace existing crypto primitives, algorithms, or protocols with a new alternative quickly, inexpensively, with no or acceptable risk exposure. These changes may be driven by regulatory action, advances in computing, or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Yet everyday operational needs may put crypto agility considerations on the back burner when deploying technology, designing processes, or developing products/services. Consequently, changes are often performed in an ad hoc manner. Transition from one crypto solution to another can then take a long time and expose organizations to unnecessary security risk. This paper presents a framework to analyze and evaluate the risk that results from the lack of crypto agility. The proposed framework can be used by organizations to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy commensurate with their risk tolerance. We demonstrate the application of this framework with a case study of quantum computing and related threats to cryptography in the context of TLS for Internet of Things.

TI Quantum Transport of the 2D Surface State in a Nonsymmorphic Semimetal
SO NANO LETTERS
AB In a topological semimetal with Dirac or Weyl points, the bulk-boundary correspondence principle predicts a gapless edge mode if the essential symmetry is still preserved at the surface. The detection of such topological surface state has been considered as the fingerprint prove for crystals with nontrivial topological bulk band. On the contrary, it has been proposed that even with symmetry broken at the surface, a new surface band can emerge in nonsymmorphic topological semimetals. The symmetry reduction at the surface lifts the bulk band degeneracies and produces an unusual "floating" surface band with trivial topology. Here, we first report quantum transport probing to ZrSiSe thin flakes and directly reveal transport signatures of this new surface state. Remarkably, though topologically trivial, such a surface band exhibits substantial two-dimensional Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations with high mobility, which signifies a new protection mechanism and may open applications for quantum computing and spintronic devices.

AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a widely used method for estimating the average fidelity of gates implemented on a quantum computing device. The stochastic error of the average gate fidelity estimated by RB depends on the sampling strategy (i.e., how to sample sequences to be run in the protocol). The sampling strategy is determined by a set of configurable parameters (an RB configuration) that includes Clifford lengths (a list of the number of independent Clifford gates in a sequence) and the number of sequences for each Clifford length. The RB configuration is often chosen heuristically and there has been little research on its best configuration. Therefore, we propose a method for fully optimizing an RB configuration so that the confidence interval of the estimated fidelity is minimized while not increasing the total execution time of sequences. By experiments on real devices, we demonstrate the efficacy of the optimization method against heuristic selection in reducing the variance of the estimated fidelity.

TI Quantum Selection for Genetic Algorithms Applied to Electromagnetic
   Design Problems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Optimization has always been viewed as a central component of many electrical engineering techniques, where it involves designing a complex system with various constraints and competing objectives. The method described in this work proposes a hybrid quantum-classical evolutionary optimization algorithm targeting high-frequency electromagnetic problems. A genetic algorithm with a quantum selection operator that applies high selection pressure while preserving selection diversity is introduced. This change means that stagnation can be reduced without compromising the speed of convergence. This was used on both real quantum hardware as well as quantum simulators. The results demonstrate that the performance of the real quantum devices was deteriorated by the noise in these devices and that simulators would be a useful option. We provide a description of the operation of the proposed evolutionary optimization method with mathematical benchmarks and electromagnetic design problems that show that it outperforms conventional evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence behavior and robustness.

The proposed architecture includes a unified memory arrangement and dedicated ALUs for Kyber and Dilithium, capable of accelerating several polynomial operations such as Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), Inverse NTT, Coefficient-Wise Multiplication (CWM), modular addition and subtraction, modular reduction, and the multiply-accumulate operation. CRYPHTOR has been integrated into two SoCs: one based on a 64-bit RISC-V processor and the other on a 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller. In these configurations, up to 26x and 300x of speedup has been obtained for the NTT, and up to 30x and 140x of speedup for the matrix-vector multiplication compared to the software implementation running on the RISC-V processors.

TI Efficient design of a quantum absolute-value circuit using Clifford plus
   T gates
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Current quantum computers have a limited number of resources and are heavily affected by internal and external noise. Therefore, small, noise-tolerant circuits are of great interest. With regard to circuit size, it is especially important to reduce the number of required qubits. Concerning to fault-tolerance, circuits entirely built with Clifford+T gates allow the use of error correction codes. However, the T-gate has an excessive cost, so circuits with a high number of T-gates should be avoided. This work focuses on optimising in such terms an operation that is widely used in larger circuits and algorithms: the calculation of the absolute-value of two's complement encoded integers. The proposed circuit halves the number of required T gates with respect to the best circuit currently available in the literature. Moreover, our circuit requires at least 2 qubits less than the other circuits for such an operation.

TI Development of an Undergraduate Quantum Engineering Degree
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing, communications, sensing, and simulations are radically transformative technologies, with great potential to impact industries and economies. Worldwide, national governments, industries, and universities are moving to create a new class of workforce-the Quantum Engineers. Demand for such engineers is predicted to be in the tens of thousands within a five-year timescale, far exceeding the rate at which the world's universities can produce Ph.D. graduates in the discipline. How best to train this next generation of engineers is currently a matter of debate. Quantum mechanics-long a pillar of traditional physics undergraduate degrees-must now be merged with traditional engineering offerings. This article discusses the history, development, and the first year of operation of the world's first undergraduate degree in quantum engineering to be grown out of an engineering curriculum. The main purpose of this article is to inform the wider discussion, now being held by many institutions worldwide, on how best to formally educate the Quantum Engineer.

TI Deterministic fabrication of highly reproducible monochromatic quantum
   emitters in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NANOSCALE
AB Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride are important room temperature single-photon sources. However, conventional fabrication methods yield quantum emitters with dispersed and inconsistent spectral profiles, limiting their potential for practical quantum applications, which demand reproducible high quality single-photon sources. Here, we report the deterministic creation of highly reproducible monochromatic quantum emitters by applying carbon-ion implantation on freestanding hexagonal boron nitride flakes, while a carbon mask with suitable thickness was adapted to optimize the implantation results. Quantum emitters fabricated using this approach exhibited thermally limited monochromaticity, with an emission center wavelength of 590.7 +/- 2.7 nm, a narrow full width at half maximum of 7.1 +/- 1.7 nm, an emission rate of 1 MHz without optical engineering, and exceptional stability under ambient conditions. Density functional theory calculations and scanning transmission electron microscopy suggest that these emitters are comprised of boron centered carbon tetramers. This method provides a reliable single-photon source for optical quantum computing and potential future industry-scale applications.

TI Understanding the anisotropic growth of vapor-solid grown
   Pb1-xSnxTe nanowires
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Pb0.5Sn0.5Te is a topological crystalline insulator, which holds promise for scattering-free transport channels and fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the topologically non-trivial states live on the surface, the nanowire (NW) geometry, with a high surface-to-volume ratio, is ideal for probing these states. The controlled growth of Pb0.5Sn0.5Te NWs using molecular beam epitaxy has been shown before, but an understanding of the anisotropic growth and the resulting morphology is lacking. Here, based on experimental observations, we develop a model that describes the evolution of NW morphology as a function of growth time. It is found that the anisotropic morphology can be described by a combination of direct impingement, mask diffusion and facet diffusion which results in a transition from a Te-limited growth regime to a group IV-limited growth regime. This growth model allows us to design more targeted experiments which could lead to a higher flexibility in device design.

TI Visible-Telecom Entangled-Photon Pair Generation with Integrated
   Photonics: Guidelines and a Materials Comparison
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Correlated photon-pair sources are key components for quantum computing, networking, synchronization, and sensing applications. Integrated photonics has enabled chip-scale sources using nonlinear processes, producing high-rate time-energy and polarization entanglement at telecom wavelengths with sub-100 microwatt pump power. Many quantum systems operate in the visible or near-infrared ranges, necessitating visible-telecom entangled-pair sources for connecting remote systems via entanglement swapping and teleportation. This study evaluates biphoton pair generation and time-energy entanglement through spontaneous four-wave mixing in various nonlinear integrated photonic materials, including silicon nitride, lithium niobate, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and gallium nitride. We demonstrate how geometric dispersion engineering facilitates phase-matching for each platform and reveals unexpected results, such as robust designs to fabrication variations and a Type-1 cross-polarized phase-matching condition for III-V materials that expands the operational wavelength range.

AB Miniaturization has been the driving force in contemporary technologies. However, two main obstacles limit further progress: additional reduction in size has reached its quantum limit, and lithography has reached its threshold. Future progress requires tackling three challenges: chemical synthesis of a complete device, active cooling for exploiting quantum characteristics, and quantum coherent control for operation. Chemical synthesis replaces the current top-bottom approach to manufacturing with bottom-up synthesis from elementary building blocks. New ultracold synthetic methods should be developed. An additional challenge is the active cooling of molecules, where the bottleneck is entropy removal. Notably, the current solution, namely, diffusion, is too slow. A coherent approach offers a possible solution; specifically, quantum coherent control is the method of choice for manipulating ultracold matter. Finally, the many degrees of freedom of molecules should be an asset that allows the design and implementation of complex tasks such as sensing communication and computing.

TI Visualization of quantized vortex reconnection enabled by laser ablation
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Impurity injection into superfluid helium is a simple and appealing method with diverse applications, including high-precision spectroscopy, quantum computing with surface electrons, nano/micromaterial synthesis, and flow visualization. Quantized vortices play a major role in the interaction between superfluid helium and light impurities. However, the basic principle governing this interaction is still unclear for dense (high mass density and refractive index) materials, such as semiconductor and metal impurities. Here, we provide experimental evidence of the dense silicon nanoparticle attraction to the quantized vortex cores. We prepared the silicon nanoparticles via in situ laser ablation. Following laser ablation, we observed that the silicon nanoparticles formed curved filamentlike structures, indicative of quantized vortex cores. We also observed that two accidentally intersecting quantized vortices exchanged their parts, a phenomenon called quantized vortex reconnection. This behavior closely matches the dynamical scaling of reconnections. Our results provide a previously unexplored method for visualizing and studying impurity-quantized vortex interactions.

TI Improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of Photonic Frequency Conversion
   from 852 nm to 1560 nm Based on a Long-Wavelength Laser-Pumped PPLN
   Waveguide Module
SO PHOTONICS
AB The storage wavelength of quantum nodes based on atomic systems does not match the wavelength of optical fiber communication, which requires the establishment of an efficient conversion system between flying bits and storage bits. In this paper, based on the nonlinear wavelength conversion technology of the periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide, a low-noise conversion of 852-nm photons to 1560-nm photons was achieved by a 1878-nm pump laser. The generation mechanism and transmission mechanism of noise due to nonlinear process are analyzed theoretically. The noise photons introduced by the spontaneous parameter downconversion and spontaneous Raman scattering process of a strong pump laser are experimentally studied. The noise suppression near 1560 nm is realized by the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) filter. In the experiment, when the FBG bandwidth is reduced from 0.257 nm to 0.130 nm, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases from 52 to 90. Our results show that the SNR can be greatly improved by using a narrower band filter. Therefore, the quantum node is connected to the fiber channel, and the signal can be transmitted over long distances with low loss and high fidelity.

AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are among the brightest emission centers known, yet the origins of these emission centers are not well understood. Here, using first-principles calculations in combination with the generating function method, we systematically elucidate the coupling of specific defects to the vibrational degrees of freedom. We show that the line shape of many defects exhibits strong coupling to high frequency phonon modes and that C-N, C-B, C-B-C-N dimer, and V-B can be associated with experimental line shapes. Our detailed theoretical study serves as a guide to identify optically active defects in h-BN that can suit specific applications in photonic-based quantum technologies, such as single photon emitters, hybrid spin-photon interfaces, or spin-mechanics interfaces.

TI Chemical Origins of Optically Addressable Spin States in
   Eu2(P2S6) and
   Eu2(P2Se6)
SO ACS MATERIALS AU
AB Lanthanide materials with a 4f7 electron configuration (8S7/2) offer an exciting system for realizing multiple addressable spin states for qubit design. While the 8S7/2 ground state of 4f7 free ions displays an isotropic character, breaking degeneracy of this ground state and excited states can be achieved through local symmetry of the lanthanide and the choice of ligands. This makes Eu2+ attractive as it mirrors Gd3+ in exhibiting the 8S7/2 ground state, capable of seven spin-allowed transitions. In this work, we identify Eu2(P2S6) and Eu2(P2Se6) as viable candidates for optically addressable spin states. The materials feature paramagnetic behavior at 2.0 <= T <= 400 K and mu 0 H = 0.01 and 7 T. The field-dependent magnetization M(H) curve reveals a single-ion spin with effective magnetic moments comparable to the expected magnetic moment of Eu2+. Seven well-defined narrow peaks in the excitation and emission spectra of Eu2+ are resolved. Phonon contributions to the Eu2+ spin environment are evaluated through heat capacity measurements. Insights into how the spin-polarized band structure and density of states of the materials influence the physical properties are described by using density functional theory calculations. These results present a foundational study of Eu2(P2S6) and Eu2(P2Se6) as a feasible platform for harnessing the spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom of Eu2+ for qubit design.

TI Quantum Gate Generation in Two-Level Open Quantum Systems by Coherent
   and Incoherent Photons Found with Gradient Search
SO PHOTONICS
AB In this work, we consider an environment formed by incoherent photons as a resource for controlling open quantum systems via an incoherent control. We exploit a coherent control in the Hamiltonian and an incoherent control in the dissipator which induces the time-dependent decoherence rates gamma k(t) (via time-dependent spectral density of incoherent photons) for generation of single-qubit gates for a two-level open quantum system which evolves according to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation with time-dependent coefficients determined by these coherent and incoherent controls. The control problem is formulated as minimization of the objective functional, which is the sum of Hilbert-Schmidt norms between four fixed basis states evolved under the GKSL master equation with controls and the same four states evolved under the ideal gate transformation. The exact expression for the gradient of the objective functional with respect to piecewise constant controls is obtained. Subsequent optimization is performed using a gradient type algorithm with an adaptive step size that leads to oscillating behaviour of the gradient norm vs. iterations. Optimal trajectories in the Bloch ball for various initial states are computed. A relation of quantum gate generation with optimization on complex Stiefel manifolds is discussed. We develop methodology and apply it here for unitary gates as a testing example. The next step is to apply the method for generation of non-unitary processes and to multi-level quantum systems.

TI Achieving the best RNA quality in urologic tumor samples intended for
   transcriptome analysis
SO UROLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Purpose: To conduct research on the molecular oncology, physiology, and immunology of urologic tumors requires dissociated viable samples. Improper collection compromises the quality of data attained in molecular and functional assays due to the increased quantities of degraded proteins and RNA. We sought to improve the methods for tissue collection which can avoid generating considerable loss in the viability of cells for further analyses. Materials and Methods: Fifty resected tumor samples from 35 patients were obtained with different surgical techniques and at various time points for viability and RNA quality evaluation. The degradation of RNA was evaluated by its Qubit IQ score, OD 260/280 ratio, total yield, and quantity of beta-actin. Results: Snap-frozen tissue samples obtained within 30 min showed better cell viability (P < 0.0001), RNA total yield (P = 0.0081), Qubit ratio (P = 0.003), OD 260/280 ratio (P = 0.4213), and quantity of beta-actin (P = 0.0015). Moreover, the bladder tumor samples collected from transurethral biopsy presented more satisfied cell viability results than the ones resected by transurethral electroresection (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Tumor samples should be processed or frozen freshly within 30 min once removed from human body. Furthermore, transurethral biopsy of bladder tumor is considered a better method for collecting samples for further molecular oncology studies. The high-quality RNA produced enable researchers to conduct more reliable studies by avoiding the experimental artifacts due to the presence of cellular debris or dead cells.

TI A preconditioned inexact infeasible quantum interior point method for
   linear optimization
SO COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum Interior Point Methods (QIPMs) have been attracting significant interests recently due to their potential of solving optimization problems substantially faster than state-of-the-art conventional algorithms. In general, QIPMs use Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to substitute classical linear system solvers. However, the performance of QLSAs depends on the condition numbers of the linear systems, which are typically proportional to the square of the reciprocal of the duality gap in QIPMs. To improve conditioning, a preconditioned inexact infeasible QIPM (II-QIPM) based on optimal partition estimation is developed in this work. We improve the condition number of the linear systems in II-QIPMs from quadratic dependence on the reciprocal of the duality gap to linear, and obtain better dependence with respect to the accuracy when compared to other II-QIPMs. Our method also attains better dependence with respect to the dimension when compared to other inexact infeasible Interior Point Methods.

TI Quantum-Assisted Resilience Enhancement for Distribution Systems With
   Networked Microgrids Considering Full-Potential Failure Risks
SO IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION
AB Effective pre- and post-disaster strategies are crucial for mitigating the impacts of extreme events and enhancing the resilience of networked microgrids (NMGs). However, traditional methods often fail to comprehensively and efficiently consider fault scenarios before disasters, and the inefficient challenge of addressing large-scale post-disaster recovery problems necessitate advanced computational approaches. This paper proposes a quantum-assisted resilience enhancement framework for power distribution systems with NMGs, fully accounting for potential failure risks. The main contributions include a two-stage quantum-assisted resilience enhancement framework that integrates quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) for quantifying failure risks, and generating scenarios, the quantum-encoded model establishment, and the proposed quantum surrogate absolute-value Lagrangian relaxation (Q-SAVLR) algorithm for achieving quantum-accelerated parallel optimization. Numerical tests on a modified IEEE system show that our approach reduces computation time by roughly 40%-75% relative to the classical solver, enabling faster repair resource deployment and more efficient resilience optimization for NMGs.

TI Observing magnetoanisotropic weak antilocalization in near-surface
   quantum wells
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the effects of an in-plane magnetic field on the weak antilocalization signature of near-surface quantum wells lacking bulk and inversion symmetry. The measured magnetoconductivity, which is conductivity as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field, exhibits a strong anisotropy with respect to the direction of the inplane magnetic field. The twofold symmetry of the observed magnetoanisotropy originates from the competition between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. The high sensitivity of the weak antilocalization to the spin texture produced by the combined Zeeman and spin-orbit fields results in very large anisotropy ratios, reaching 100%. Using a semiclassical universal model in quantitative agreement with the experimental data, we uniquely determine the values of the Dresselhaus and Rashba parameters as well as the effective in-plane g-factor of the electrons. Understanding these parameters provides prospects for different applications ranging from spintronics to topological quantum computing.

The obtained results indicated that the new B-Cyt derivative could be stabilized without any imaginary frequency. Its orbital orbital-based electronic properties indicated that the structure could have a better interaction with the target than the singular Cyt ligand. The docking process results approved the trend, in which the value of binding energy was very much favorable regarding the singular models, and the number of interaction amino acids was increased. The idea of forming a Cyt derivative with efficient activity against COVID-19 main protease was approved here, which is very much important for protecting the patients with cancer or HIV against the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Chemically robust single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with sufficiently high blocking temperatures T-B are among the key building blocks for the realization of molecular spintronic or quantum computing devices. Such device applications require access to the magnetic system of a SMM molecule by means of electronic transport, which primarily depends on the interaction of magnetic orbitals with the electronic states of the metallic electrodes. Scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with ab initio calculations allows to directly address the unoccupied component of the single-electron molecular orbital that mediates the ferromagnetic exchange coupling between two 4f ions within a lanthanide endohedral dimetallofullerene deposited on a graphene surface. The single-electron metal-metal bond provides a direct access to the molecule's magnetic system in the transport experiments, paving the way for investigation and controlled manipulation of the spin system of individual dimetallofullerene SMMs, essential for molecular spintronics.

AB There has been much success recently in theoretically simulating parts of complex biological systems on the molecular level, with the goal of first-principles modeling of whole cells. However, there is the question of whether such simulations can be performed because of the enormous complexity of cells. We establish approximate equations to estimate computation times required to simulate highly simplified models of cells by either molecular dynamics calculations or by solving molecular kinetic equations. Our equations place limits on the complexity of cells that can be theoretically understood with these two methods and provide a first step in developing what can be considered biological uncertainty relations for molecular models of cells. While a molecular kinetics description of the genetically simplest bacterial cell may indeed soon be possible, neither theoretical description for a multicellular system, such as the human brain, will be possible for many decades and may never be possible even with quantum computing.

TI On density and dentability in Hilbert spaces

AB This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for density and dentability in infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces, demonstrating their fundamental connections to operator theory and optimization through a synthesis of spectral decomposition methods and compact operator approximations. The main result characterizes dentable closed convex subsets H0 & Iuml; H as precisely those whose extreme points form a weakly dense subset, leveraging the Radon-Nikod & yacute;m Property of Hilbert spaces, and proves the preservation of dentability under countable intersections, finite tensor products, and Cartesian products. The technical framework integrates geometric functional analysis with operator theory, showing that every dentable subset contains a dense separable subspace and that convex dentable operator sets are densely defined. Applications include convergence analysis of gradient-based optimization in function spaces, as well as implications for quantum computing architectures, high-dimensional data analysis, and computational geometry. These theoretical developments also open new directions for spatial modeling and astrophysical density analysis via Hilbert space methods.

TI Designing Quantum Spaces of Higher Dimensionality from a Tetranuclear
   Erbium-Based Single-Molecule Magnet
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The spin relaxation of an Er3+ tetranuclear single-molecule magnet, [Er(hdcCOT)I](4), (hdcCOT = hexahydrodicyclopentacyclooctatetraenide dianion), is modeled as a near-tetrahedral arrangement of Ising-type spins. Combining evidence from single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and computational techniques, the slow spin relaxation is interpreted as a consequence of symmetry restrictions imposed on quantum tunneling within the cluster core. The union of spin and spatial symmetries describe a ground state spin-spin coupled manifold wherein 16 eigenvectors generate the 3D quantum spin-space described by the vertices of a rhombic dodecahedron. Analysis of the experimental findings in this context reveals a correlation between the magnetic transitions and edges connecting cubic and octahedral subsets of the eigenspace convex hull. Additionally, the model is shown to map to a theoretically proposed quantum Cayley network, indicating an underexplored synergy between mathematical descriptions of molecular spin interactions and quantum computing configuration spaces.

AB A graph H is a minor of a second graph G if G can be transformed into H by two operations: 1) deleting nodes and/or edges, or 2) contracting edges. Coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) application mapping is closely related to the graph minor problem, where H is the application's dataflow graph and G is the CGRA's device-model graph. A heuristic algorithm to find graph minors has proven to be practical for sparse graphs with hundreds of vertices in a quantum computing application. In this work, we adapt the heuristic to CGRA application mapping, where the graphs have directed edges, and the vertices have unique types (e.g., representing ALUs or interconnect). Additionally, we alter the original cost function, taking inspiration from PathFinder, an iterative negotiated-congestion routing algorithm. In an experimental study comparing with a CGRA mapper based on integer linear programming, we demonstrate a higher rate of successful mappings and from 80x to up to orders of magnitude lower runtime.

TI A quantum approach to synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The paper proposes the Quantum-SMOTE method, a novel solution that uses quantum computing techniques to solve the prevalent problem of class imbalance in machine learning datasets. Quantum-SMOTE, inspired by the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), generates synthetic data points using quantum processes such as swap tests and quantum rotation. The process varies from the conventional SMOTE algorithm's usage of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Euclidean distances, enabling synthetic instances to be generated from minority class data points without relying on neighbor proximity. The algorithm asserts greater control over the synthetic data generation process by introducing hyperparameters such as rotation angle, minority percentage, and splitting factor, which allow for customization to specific dataset requirements. Due to the use of a compact swap test, the algorithm can accommodate a large number of features. Furthermore, the approach is tested on a public dataset of TelecomChurn and evaluated alongside two prominent classification algorithms, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to determine its impact along with varying proportions of synthetic data.

AB In the foreseeable future, toolchains for quantum computing should offer automatic means of transforming a high level problem formulation down to a hardware executable form. Thereby, it is crucial to find (multiple) transformation paths that are optimised for (hardware specific) metrics. We zoom into this pictured tree of transformations by focussing on k-SAT instances as input and their transformation to QUBO, while considering structure and characteristic metrics of input, intermediate and output representations. Our results can be used to rate valid paths of transformation in advance-also in automated (quantum) toolchains. We support the automation aspect by considering stability and therefore predictability of free parameters and transformation paths. Moreover, our findings can be used in the manifesting era of error correction (since considering structure in a high abstraction layer can benefit error correcting codes in layers below). We also show that current research is closely linked to quadratisation techniques and their mathematical foundation.

TI Quantum phase transitions and cat states in cavity-coupled quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study double quantum dots coupled to a quasistatic cavity mode with high mode-volume compression allowing for strong light-matter coupling. Besides the cavity-mediated interaction, electrons in different double quantum dots interact with each other via dipole-dipole (Coulomb) interaction. There is a first-order cavityinduced ferroelectric quantum phase transition when the attractive dipolar interaction is smaller than the critical value defined by the energy splitting in DQDs and a smooth transition, otherwise. We show that, in the smooth transition region, both the ground and the first excited states of an array of double quantum dots are cat states. Such states are actively discussed as high-fidelity qubits for quantum computing, and thus our proposal provides a platform for semiconductor implementation of such qubits. We also calculate gauge-invariant observables such as the net dipole moment, the optical conductivity, and the absorption spectrum beyond the semiclassical approximation. The results are robust against cavity losses and variations of system parameters.

TI Estimating Quantum Hamiltonians via Joint Measurements of Noisy
   Noncommuting Observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Estimation of expectation values of incompatible observables is an essential practical task in quantum computing, especially for approximating energies of chemical and other many-body quantum systems. In this Letter, we introduce a method for this purpose based on performing a single joint measurement that can be implemented locally and whose marginals yield noisy (unsharp) versions of the target set of noncommuting Pauli observables. We derive bounds on the number of experimental repetitions required to estimate energies up to a certain precision. We compare this strategy to the classical shadow formalism and show that our method yields the same performance as the locally biased classical shadow protocol. We also highlight some general connections between the two approaches by showing that classical shadows can be used to construct joint measurements and vice versa. Finally, we adapt the joint measurement strategy to minimise the sample complexity when the implementation of measurements is assumed noisy. This can provide significant efficiency improvements compared to known generalizations of classical shadows to noisy scenarios.

TI Deterministic and Entanglement-Efficient Preparation of
   Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Registers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum computing promises to provide exponential speed-ups to certain classes of problems. In many such algorithms, a classical vector b is encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state |b). However, efficiently preparing |b) is known to be a difficult problem because an arbitrary state of Q qubits generally requires approximately 2Q entangling gates, which results in significant decoherence on today???s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We present a deterministic (nonvariational) algorithm that allows us to flexibly reduce the quantum resources required for state preparation in an entanglementefficient manner. Although this comes at the expense of reduced theoretical fidelity, actual fidelities on current NISQ computers might actually be higher due to reduced decoherence. We show this to be true for various cases of interest, such as the normal and log-normal distributions. For low-entanglement states, our algorithm can prepare states with more than an order of magnitude fewer entangling gates as compared with isometric decomposition.

AB There is no doubt that the body of knowledge spanned by the computing disciplines has gone through an unprecedented expansion, both in depth and breadth, over the last century. In this position paper, we argue that this expansion has led to a crisis in computing education: quite literally the vast majority of the topics of interest of this conference are not taught at the undergraduate level and most graduate courses will only scratch the surface of a few selected topics. But alas, industry is increasingly expecting students to be familiar with emerging topics, such as neuromorphic, probabilistic, and quantum computing, AI, and deep learning. We provide evidence for the rapid growth of emerging topics, highlight the decline of traditional areas, muse about the failure of higher education to adapt quickly, and delineate possible ways to avert the crisis by looking at how the field of physics dealt with significant expansions over the last centuries.

TI Collective multimode strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Plasmonic nanocavities enable access to the quantum properties of matter but are often simplified to single mode models despite their complex multimode structure. Here, we show that off-resonant plasmonic modes in fact play a crucial role in strong coupling and determine the onset of a novel collective interaction. Our analysis reveals that n strongly coupled plasmonic modes introduce up to n(n + 1)/2 oscillation frequencies that depend on their coupling strengths and detuning's from the quantum emitter. Furthermore, we identify three distinct regions as the coupling strength increases: (1) single mode, (2) multimode and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our findings enhance the understanding of quantum dynamics in realistic plasmonic environments and demonstrate their potential to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer in light-driven quantum technologies.

TI Entanglement-induced provable and robust quantum learning advantages
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing holds unparalleled potentials to enhance machine learning. However, a demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. We make a step forward by rigorously establishing a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local tasks. In particular, we design a task that can be solved with certainty by quantum models with a constant number of parameters using entanglement, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale linearly to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We show that the quantum model is trainable with constant resources and robust against constant noise. Through numerical and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, we demonstrate the desired advantage. Our results provide valuable guidance for demonstrating quantum learning advantages with current noisy intermediate-scale devices.

TI Nematically Templated Vortex Lattices in Superconducting FeSe
SO NANO LETTERS
AB New pathways to controlling the morphology of superconducting vortex lattices-and their subsequent dynamics-are required to guide and scale vortex world-lines into a computing platform. We have found that the nematic twin boundaries align superconducting vortices in the adjacent terraces due to the incommensurate potential between vortices surrounding twin bounda-ries and those trapped within them. With the varying density and morphology of twin boundaries, the vortex lattice assumes several distinct structural phases, including square, regular, and irregular one-dimensional lattices. Through concomitant analysis of vortex lattice models, we have inferred the characteristic energetics of the twin boundary potential and furthermore predicted the existence of geometric size effects as a function of increasing confinement by the twin boundaries. These findings extend the ideas of directed control over vortex lattices to intrinsic topological defects and their self-organized networks, which have direct implications for the future design and control of strain-based topological quantum computing architectures.

   tunnel coupling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Recent demonstrations using electron spins stored in quantum dot array as qubits are promising for developing a scalable quantum computing platform. An ongoing effort is, therefore, aiming at the precise control of the quantum dot parameters in larger and larger arrays which represents a complex challenge. Partitioning of the system with the help of the inter-dot tunnel barriers can lead to a simplification for tuning and offers a protection against unwanted charge displacement. In a triple quantum dot system, we demonstrate a nanosecond control of the inter-dot tunnel rate permitting to reach the two extreme regimes, large GHz tunnel coupling, and sub-Hz isolation between adjacent dots. We use this development to isolate a subpart of the array in a metastable configuration while performing charge displacement and readout in the rest of the system. The degree of control over tunnel coupling achieved in a unit cell should motivate future protocol development for tuning, manipulation, and readout including this capability.

TI Cyclicity of interaction-frame transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the structure of rotation sequences composed of piecewise displacements by an angle beta about arbitrary axes in three dimensions. We find that when beta = 2 pi /m, repeated toggling-frame transformations return the sequence to its original form after m applications. We develop this cyclicity property to unify several families of error-tuned control sequences used across quantum technologies, including NMR, MRI, atomic clocks, and atom-scale computing. For the m = 2 case, we show a duality between narrowband and broadband pi-element sequences. Form > 2, we relate the cyclic structure to polyhedral symmetry, leading to original sequence designs based on m-fold rotational axes. The result may guide the construction of robust control protocols grounded in geometric and group-theoretic principles.

   resonators: Distributed current ABCD-matrix model
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In this work, we experimentally investigated the nonlinear microwave response of YBa2Cu3O7-x Hilbert fractal superconducting microstrip resonators with sharp and rounded corners. We developed a resonator model that incorporates a distributed current-dependent nonlinear propagation parameter, gamma(I), and used the ABCD matrix method for numerical simulations. Our findings demonstrated that the nonlinear response of the resonators can be effectively modeled with a current-proportional propagation parameter, gamma similar to I. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in the nonlinear response when transitioning from sharp to rounded corners in the resonator design. This work provides valuable insights into improving the design of superconducting resonators by minimizing their nonlinearities, which is crucial for advancing applications in microwave and quantum technologies.

TI Optical nuclear electric resonance in LiNa: selective addressing of
   nuclear spins through pulsed lasers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER), a recently proposed protocol for nuclear spin manipulation in atomic systems via short laser pulses with MHz repetition rate, exploits the coupling between the nuclear quadrupole moment of a suitable atom and the periodic modulations of the electric field gradient generated by an optically stimulated electronic excitation. In this theory paper, we extend the scope of ONER from atomic to molecular systems and show that molecular vibrations do not interfere with our protocol. Exploring the diatomic molecule LiNa as a first benchmark system, our investigation showcases the robustness with respect to molecular vibration, and the ability to address and manipulate each of the two nuclear spins independently, simply by adjusting the repetition rate of a pulsed laser. Our findings suggest that it might be possible to shift complicated spin manipulation tasks required for quantum computing into the time domain by pulse-duration encoded laser signals.

TI Strain-induced topological phase transition in ferromagnetic Janus
   monolayer MnSbBiS2Te2
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate a strain-induced topological phase transition in the ferromagnetic Janus monolayer MnSbBiS2Te2 using first-principles calculations. The electronic, magnetic, and topological properties are studied under biaxial strain within the range of -8 to +8%. The ground state of monolayer MnSbBiS2Te2 is metallic with an out-of-plane magnetic easy axis. A band gap is opened when a compressive strain between -4% and -7% is applied. We observe a topological phase transition at a biaxial strain of -5%, where the material becomes a Chern insulator exhibiting a quantum anomalous hall (QAH) effect. We find that biaxial strain and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are responsible for the topological phase transition in MnSbBiS2Te2. In addition, we find that biaxial strain can alter the direction of the magnetic easy axis of MnSbBiS2Te2. The Curie temperature is calculated using the Heisenberg model and is found to be 24 K. This study could pave the way to the design of topological materials with potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing, and dissipationless electronics.

AB Moire patterns, emerging from the overlay of periodic structures, produce distinctive interference effects. Hexagonal Moire patterns formed by superimposing hexagonal lattices with rotational misalignment or varying lattice constants are particularly notable. These patterns have unveiled extraordinary electronic properties in two-dimensional materials like graphene, significantly impacting fields such as quantum computing and nanoelectronics, while also holding promise in materials engineering for filtration purposes. This study employs machine learning to achieve inverse design of hexagonal Moire lattices, predicting lattice configurations for specific pore characteristics. Using computational modeling, datasets of simulated lattices are generated, and pore size distribution data are extracted. Neural networks are trained on these datasets to predict the baseline mesh width while also classifying the number of meshes required for the desired pore size distribution. The results, evaluated through accuracy metrics and ROC curves, are compared to well-known classifiers, highlighting the approach's potential to revolutionize materials design with tunable properties and advance materials science.

TI Perspectives of Organic and Perovskite-Based Spintronics
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Spin-related phenomena in optoelectronic materials can revolutionize several technological applications in the areas of data processing and storage, quantum computing, lighting, energy harvesting, sensing, and healthcare. A fundamental boost to this promising field can be envisaged thanks to the use of two emerging materials, which have recently been receiving increasing scientific attention: organic semiconductors (OSCs) and halide perovskites (HPs). Here, the first progress in the resulting fields, organic- and perovskite-based spintronics, is reviewed, which will enable the manipulation of spin, charges, and photons in spin/optoelectronic devices. A link between these two classes of materials is created by highlighting the pros and cons of each technology, and their potential applications in new multifunctional spintronic devices are discussed. Current challenges in the field are also outlined, and convenient approaches to overcome them are proposed.

TI Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein
   effect in carbon nanotubes
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.

TI No-Signaling in Steepest Entropy Ascent: A Nonlinear, Non-Local,
   Non-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Composite Systems Strongly
   Compatible with the Second Law
SO ENTROPY
AB Lindbladian formalism models open quantum systems using a 'bottom-up' approach, deriving linear dynamics from system-environment interactions. We present a 'top-down' approach starting with phenomenological constraints, focusing on a system's structure, subsystems' interactions, and environmental effects and often using a non-equilibrium variational principle designed to enforce strict thermodynamic consistency. However, incorporating the second law's requirement-that Gibbs states are the sole stable equilibria-necessitates nonlinear dynamics, challenging no-signaling principles in composite systems. We reintroduce 'local perception operators' and show that they allow to model signaling-free non-local effects. Using the steepest-entropy-ascent variational principle as an example, we demonstrate the validity of the 'top-down' approach for integrating quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in phenomenological models, with potential applications in quantum computing and resource theories.

TI Compactness and Separability in MR-Metric Spaces with Applications to
   Deep Learning
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB This paper establishes fundamental topological properties of MR-metric spaces, a significant generalization of conventional metric spaces characterized by an R-scaled tetrahedral inequality. We prove several key results including: (1) a complete characterization of compactness through three equivalent conditions, (2) the Lebesgue number lemma adaptation, (3) equivalence between separability and the Lindelo<spacing diaeresis>f property, and (4) automatic paracompactness. The theoretical framework is applied to four domains: (i) global optimization in Euclidean spaces, (ii) neural network weight space analysis, (iii) fractal geometry, and (iv) quantum state spaces. The proofs leverage the unique properties of MR-metrics, particularly the R-scaling factor in the tetrahedral inequality, to extend classical metric space results to this broader setting. Applications demonstrate the utility of these theoretical advances in computational and machine learning contexts.

AB Security Orchestration (SO) plays a pivotal role in ensuring robust, scalable, and efficient management of security mechanisms in next-generation 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the technical challenges related to Security Orchestration (SO) in these advanced network technologies, focusing on key areas such as network security monitoring, interface standardization, privacy, scalability, multi-domain orchestration, and policy implementation. Additionally, we discuss lessons learned from existing works, identify remaining research gaps, and propose future directions for enhancing SO in 5G and B5G environments. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, quantum computing and trusted execution environments (TEE) are also examined for their potential to address these challenges. The paper provides a taxonomy of SO-related issues and offers a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate the evolving landscape of security in 5G and B5G networks.

TI A quantum artificial bee colony algorithm based on quantum walk for the
   0-1 knapsack problem
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Based on the characteristics of the quantum mechanism, a novel quantum walk artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed to promote performance. Firstly, the discrete quantum walk is an approach taken to search for new food sources in the updated phase for employed bees and onlooker bees, which can enhance the probability of the target solution to extend the exploration capability. Secondly, the food source selection policy of the onlooker bees changes, from roulette selection to tournament selection, to boost exploitation and convergence speed. Finally, the novel algorithm is brought forward, along with the approach to analyze 0-1 knapsack problems. The experimental results prove that our algorithm can overcome the premature phenomenon and perform better in the areas of search capability, convergence speed, and stability performance. The performance is superior to that of the conventional artificial bee colony algorithm, as well as the genetic algorithm, in a set of 0-1 knapsack problems.

AB First quantum computers very recently have demonstrated "quantum supremacy" or "quantum advantage": Executing a computation that would have been impossible on a classical machine. Today's quantum computers follow the NISQ paradigm: They exhibit error rates that are much higher than in conventional electronics and have insufficient quantum resources to support powerful error correction protocols. This raises questions which relevant computations are within the reach of NISQ architectures. Several "NISQ-era algorithms" are assumed to match the specifics of such computers; for instance, variational optimisers are based on intertwining relatively short quantum and classical computations, thus maximizing the chances of success. This paper will critically assess the promise and challenge of NISQ computing. What has this field achieved so far, what are we likely to achieve soon, where do we have to be skeptical and wait for the advent of larger-scale fully error-corrected architectures?

TI Entanglement Dynamics via Geometric Phases in Trapped-ions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this work, we propose leveraging the geometric phase (GP) as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the GP is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that GP measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.

SO FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB This paper compares three finite element-based methods used in a physics-based non-rigid registration approach and reports on the progress made over the last 15 years. Large brain shifts caused by brain tumor removal affect registration accuracy by creating point and element outliers. A combination of approximation- and geometry-based point and element outlier rejection improves the rigid registration error by 2.5 mm and meets the real-time constraints (4 min). In addition, the paper raises several questions and presents two open problems for the robust estimation and improvement of registration error in the presence of outliers due to sparse, noisy, and incomplete data. It concludes with preliminary results on leveraging Quantum Computing, a promising new technology for computationally intensive problems like Feature Detection and Block Matching in addition to finite element solver; all three account for 75% of computing time in deformable registration.

TI Extensively Microtwinned Diamond with Nanolaminates of Lonsdaleite
   Formed by Flash Laser Heating of Glassy Carbon
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Diamond's unique properties on the nanoscale make it one of the most important materials for use in biosensors and quantum computing and for components that can withstand the harsh environments of space. We synthesize oriented, faceted diamond particles by flash laser heating of glassy carbon at 16 GPa and 2300 K. Detailed transmission electron microscopy shows them to consist of a mosaic of diamond nanocrystals frequently joined at twin boundaries forming microtwins. Striking 3-fold translational periodicity was observed in both imaging and diffraction. This periodicity was shown to originate from nanodimensional wedge-shaped overlapping regions of twinned diamond and not from a possible 9R polytype, which has also been reported in other group IVa elements and water ice. Extended bilayers of hexagonal layer stacking were observed, forming lonsdaleite nanolaminates. The particles exhibited optical fluorescence with a rapid quench time (<1 ns) attributed to their unique twinned microstructure.

   systems
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB We present an open-system quantum-mechanical real-space study of the conductive properties and size quantization in phosphorus 6-layers systems, interesting for their beyond-Moore and quantum computing applications. Recently it has been demonstrated that an open-system quantum mechanical treatment provides a much more accurate match to ARPES measurements in highly-conductive, highly-confined systems than the traditional approaches (i.e. periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions) and, furthermore, it allows accurate predictions of conductive properties of such systems from the first principles. Here we reveal that quantization effects are strong for device widths W < 10 nm, and we show, for the first time, that the number of propagating modes determines not only the conductivity, but the distinctive spatial distribution of the current-carrying electron states. For W > 10 nm, the quantization effects practically vanish and the conductivity tends to the infinitely-wide device's values.

TI Self-heating of cryogenic high electron-mobility transistor amplifiers
   and the limits of microwave noise performance
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The fundamental limits of the microwave noise performance of high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are of scientific and practical interest for applications in radio astronomy and quantum computing. Self-heating at cryogenic temperatures has been reported to be a limiting mechanism for the noise, but cryogenic cooling strategies to mitigate it, for instance, using liquid cryogens, have not been evaluated. Here, we report microwave noise measurements of a packaged two-stage amplifier with GaAs metamorphic HEMTs immersed in normal and superfluid 4He baths and in vacuum from 1.6 to 80 K. We find that these liquid cryogens are unable to mitigate the thermal noise associated with self-heating. Considering this finding, we examine the implications for the lower bounds of cryogenic noise performance in HEMTs. Our analysis supports the general design principle for cryogenic HEMTs of maximizing gain at the lowest possible power. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Quantum Confinement of Electron-Phonon Coupling in Graphene Quantum Dots
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB On the basis of first-principles calculations and the special displacement method, we demonstrate the quantum confinement scaling law of the phonon-induced gap renormalization of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). We employ zigzag-edged GQDs with hydrogen passivation and embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. Our calculations for GQDs in the sub-10 nm region reveal strong quantum confinement of the zero-point renormalization ranging from 20 to 250 meV. To obtain these values we introduce a correction to the Allen-Heine theory of temperature-dependent energy levels that arises from the phonon-induced splitting of 2-fold degenerate edge states. This correction amounts to more than 50% of the gap renormalization. We also present momentum-resolved spectral functions of GQDs, which are not reported in previous contributions. Our results lay the foundation to systematically engineer temperature-dependent electronic structures of GQDs for applications in solar cells, electronic transport, and quantum computing devices.

TI Dielectric performance and cryogenic stability of CdPS3 for
   quantum device applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB One of the critical challenges in advancing quantum computing is mitigating material defects, particularly at the interfaces of superconducting layers and circuits. High dielectric losses further limit performance, necessitating stable high-kappa materials. In this work, we introduce Cadmium Trithiophosphate (CdPS3) as a promising high-kappa material at the nanoscale with a dielectric constant up to 10 at 44.07 nm thickness and a breakdown voltage surpassing traditional SiO2. Capacitance measurements in a Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) structure across 50-150 kHz reveal stable dielectric behavior, particularly in thinner flakes. Dielectric constants averaged 9.8 for 40-44 nm thick CdPS3 and 8.5 for 115-119 nm thick CdPS3, respectively. The breakdown voltage analysis was conducted up to 200 V, and cryogenic testing at 4 K confirms its robustness under extreme conditions. These findings position CdPS3 as a stable high-kappa dielectric material suitable for energy storage, sensors, and quantum devices, where minimizing dielectric loss is crucial for maintaining coherence and device efficiency.

TI Orientation-selective spin-polarized edge states in monolayer
   NiI2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-polarized edge states in two-dimensional materials hold promise for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Constructing stable edge states by tailoring two-dimensional semiconductor materials with bulk-boundary correspondence is a feasible approach. Recently layered NiI2 is suggested as a two-dimensional type-II multiferroic semiconductor with intrinsic spiral spin ordering and chirality-induced electric polarization. However, the one-dimensional spin-polarized edge states of multiferroic materials down to monolayer limit has not yet been studied. We report here that monolayer NiI2 was successfully synthesized on Au(111) by molecular beam epitaxy. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy experiments visualize orientation-selective spin-polarized edge states in monolayer NiI2 islands. By performing first-principles calculations, we further confirm that spin-polarized edge states are selectively aligning along the Ni-terminated edges rather than the I-terminated edges. Our result will provide the opportunity to tune edge states by selected orientation and to develop spintronic devices in two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors.

TI Observation of the planar Hall effect in the quasi-two-dimensional
   topological insulator candidate
   Ni3Bi2Se2
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The observation of the planar Hall effect (PHE) sheds light on the spin textures and topological characteristics of materials, indicating potential applications in quantum computing and electronic devices. However, in bulk single crystals of topological insulators (TIs), where chiral anomaly is absent and the contribution of topological surface states can be overlooked, the origin of the PHE remains elusive. Here, we have obtained high-quality single crystals of Ni3Bi2Se2 and systematically investigated their magneto-electric transport properties. The ordinary Hall resistivity reveals the simultaneous presence of electrons and holes. A pi-period PHE, which depends on the relative angle with the driving electric and magnetic fields, has been observed, indicating the breaking of mirror reflection symmetry. The angular dependence of in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance and the field-dependent PHE signal underscore the critical role of anisotropic orbital magnetoresistance. Our findings offer a platform for deepening our understanding of the PHE and its underlying mechanisms in TIs.

AB Optical and acoustic resonators utilizing distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are pivotal in advancing technologies ranging from lasers to quantum computing. Under ideal, smooth interface conditions, the efficiency of these resonators, quantified by their quality factor, primarily depends on the number of DBR pairs. However inhomogeneities of the top layer thickness commonly occur, either during growth or fabrication, and is even more severe when a dielectric material is deposited on the top of the samples, for example in responsive resonators. This study analyzes the effects of such inhomogeneities on the resonators' quality factor in the case where the nanometer-scale vertical dimension of the inhomogeneities is significantly shorter than their lateral scale. Employing an analytical approach, we demonstrate that such inhomogeneities can significantly degrade the quality factor, imposing a practical limit to its enhancement irrespective of the DBR pairs added.

TI Epitaxially Driven Phase Selectivity of Sn in Hybrid Quantum Nanowires

AB Hybrid semiconductor-superconductornanowires constitutea pervasive platform for studying gate-tunable superconductivity andthe emergence of topological behavior. Their low dimensionality andcrystal structure flexibility facilitate unique heterostructure growthand efficient material optimization, crucial prerequisites for accuratelyconstructing complex multicomponent quantum materials. Here, we presentan extensive study of Sn growth on InSb, InAsSb, and InAs nanowiresand demonstrate how the crystal structure of the nanowires drivesthe formation of either semimetallic & alpha;-Sn or superconducting & beta;-Sn. For InAs nanowires, we observe phase-pure superconducting & beta;-Sn shells. However, for InSb and InAsSb nanowires, an initialepitaxial & alpha;-Sn phase evolves into a polycrystalline shell ofcoexisting & alpha; and & beta; phases, where the & beta;/& alpha; volumeratio increases with Sn shell thickness. Whether these nanowires exhibitsuperconductivity or not critically relies on the & beta;-Sn content.Therefore, this work provides key insights into Sn phases on a varietyof semiconductors with consequences for the yield of superconductinghybrids suitable for generating topological systems.

TI Fragility of surface states in topological superfluid 3He
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superfluid He-3, with unconventional spin-triplet p-wave pairing, provides a model system for topological superconductors, which have attracted significant interest through potential applications in topologically protected quantum computing. In topological insulators and quantum Hall systems, the surface/edge states, arising from bulk-surface correspondence and the momentum space topology of the band structure, are robust. Here we demonstrate that in topological superfluids and superconductors the surface Andreev bound states, which depend on the momentum space topology of the emergent order parameter, are fragile with respect to the details of surface scattering. We confine superfluid He-3 within a cavity of height D comparable to the Cooper pair diameter xi(0). We precisely determine the superfluid transition temperature T-c and the suppression of the superfluid energy gap, for different scattering conditions tuned in situ, and compare to the predictions of quasiclassical theory. We discover that surface magnetic scattering leads to unexpectedly large suppression of T-c, corresponding to an increased density of low energy bound states.

TI Charge-Impurity Effects in Hybrid Majorana Nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We address an outstanding problem that represents a critical roadblock in the development of the Majorana-based topological qubit using semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: the quantitative characterization of disorder effects generated by the unintentional presence of charge impurities within the hybrid device. Given that disorder can have far-reaching consequences for the Majorana physics but is intrinsically difficult to probe experimentally in a hybrid structure, providing a quantitative theoretical description of disorder effects becomes essential. To accomplish this task, we develop a microscopic theory that (i) provides a quantitative characterization of the effective potential generated by a charge impurity embedded inside a semiconductor wire proximity coupled to a superconductor layer by solving selfconsistently the associated three-dimensional Schrodinger-Poisson problem, (ii) describes the low-energy physics of the hybrid structure in the presence of s-wave superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman splitting, and disorder arising from multiple charge impurities by using the results of (i) within a standard free-fermion approach, and (iii) links the microscopic results to experimentally observable features by generating tunneling differential-conductance maps as a function of the control parameters (e.g., Zeeman field and chemical potential). We find that charge impurities lead to serious complications regarding the realization and observation of Majorana zero modes, which have direct implications for the development of Majorana-based qubits. More importantly, our work provides a clear direction regarding what needs to be done for progress in the field, including specific materials-quality and semiconductor-purity targets that must be achieved to create a topological qubit.

TI On quantum states over time
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB In 2017, D. Horsman, C. Heunen, M. Pusey, J. Barrett and R. Spekkens proved that there is no physically reasonable assignment that takes a quantum channel and an initial state and produces a joint state on the tensor product of the input and output spaces. The interpretation was that there is a clear distinction between space and time in the quantum setting that is not visible classically, where in the latter, one can freely use Bayes' theorem to go between joint states and marginals with noisy channels. In this paper, we prove that there actually is such a physically reasonable assignment, bypassing the no-go result of Horsman et al., and we illustrate that this is achievable by restricting the domain of their assignment to a domain which represents the given data more faithfully.

TI Enhancing quantum metrology for multiple frequencies of oscillating
   magnetic fields by quantum control
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum multi-parameter estimation has recently attracted increased attention due to its wide applications, with a primary goal of designing high-precision measurement schemes for unknown parameters. While existing research has predominantly concentrated on time-independent Hamiltonians, little has been known about quantum multi-parameter estimation for time-dependent Hamiltonians due to the complexity of quantum dynamics. This work bridges the gap by investigating the precision limit of multi-parameter quantum estimation for a qubit in an oscillating magnetic field model with multiple unknown frequencies. As the well-known quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound is generally unattainable due to the potential incompatibility between the optimal measurements for different parameters, we use the most informative bound instead which is always attainable and equivalent to the Holevo bound in the asymptotic limit. Moreover, we apply additional Hamiltonian to the system to engineer the dynamics of the qubit. By utilizing the quasi-Newton method, we explore the optimal schemes to attain the highest precision for the unknown frequencies of the magnetic field, including the simultaneous optimization of initial state preparation, the control Hamiltonian and the final measurement. The results indicate that the optimization can yield much higher precisions for the field frequencies than those without the optimizations. Finally, we study the robustness of the optimal control scheme with respect to the fluctuation of the interested frequencies, and the optimized scheme exhibits superior robustness to the scenario without any optimization.

TI Turbulence theories and statistical closure approaches
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB When discussing research in physics and in science more generally, it is common to ascribe equal importance to the three components of the scientific trinity: theoretical, experimental, and computational studies. This review will explore the future of modern turbulence theory by tracing its history, which began in earnest with Kolmogorov's 1941 analysis of turbulence cascade and inertial range [A.N. Kolmogorov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, 30, 299, (1941); 32, 19, (1941)]. The 80th Anniversary of Kolmogorov's landmark study is a welcome opportunity to survey the achievements and evaluate the future of the theoretical approach of turbulence research. Over the years, turbulence theories have been critically important in laying the foundation of our understanding of the nature of turbulent flows. In particular, the Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) [R.H. Kraichnan, J. Fluid Mech., 5, 497 (1959)] and its subsequent development, known as the statistical closure approach, can be identified as perhaps the most profound single advancement. The remarkable success of the statistical closure has furnished a platform to study such essential concepts as the energy transfer process and interacting scales, and the roles of the straining and sweeping motions. More recently, the quasi-Lagrangian formulation of V. L'vov & I. Procaccia and Kraichnan's solvable passive scalar model provided powerful ways to explore another fundamental aspect of turbulent flows, the phenomena of intermittency, and the associated anomalous scaling exponents. In the meantime, the theory of fluid equilibria has been developed to describe the large-scale structures that can emerge from turbulent cascades of two-dimensional and geophysical flows at a later time. And yet, despite all these successes, analytical treatments suffer from mathematical complexities. As a result, the utility of theoretical approaches has been limited to relatively idealized flows. On the other hand, in recent decades, computational abilities and experimental facilities have reached an unprecedented scale. Looking beyond the horizon, the imminent deployment of exascale supercomputers will generate complete datasets of the entire flow field of key benchmark flows, allowing researchers to extract additional measurements concerning fully developed, complex turbulent flow fields far beyond those available from the statistical closure theories. Some other developments that could potentially influence the future course of turbulence theories include the advancement of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science; likely disruptions arising from the advent of quantum computation; and the increasingly prominent role of turbulence research in providing more accurate climate scientific data. Turbulence theorists can leverage these developments by asking the right questions and developing advanced, sophisticated frameworks that will be able to predict and correlate vast amounts of data from the other two components of the trinity.

TI On the creation of a photon by an electromagnetic wave ball
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent literature has shown, theoretically as well as experimentally, that while a beam splitter does not split a single photon, it nonetheless divides the electromagnetic wave into transmitted and reflected, with both containing energies. This implies the existence of a spacetime of pure electromagnetic waves of energies but without particles; also, it prompts the question on how much energy a photon loses after coming out of a beam splitter, which impacts on interferometry and hence quantum communication. This paper shows that, by Gauss divergence theorem, the gravitational force inside an electromagnetic wave ball results in a point energy that is three times as the wave energy; thus, a 50/50 beam splitter is to cause a photon to lose half of a quarter, or 1/8, of its initial wave energy.

AB Spin squeezing state is a critical physical resource for the realization of high-precision metrology. Here, using two ground states of atoms as pseudo spin degrees of freedom, we propose a simple scheme to create high squeezing via cavity-assisted non-resonant Raman transition. The numerical simulation results show that our scheme can achieve the same optimum squeezing and has the same advantages as the conventional two-axis counter twisting model. The scheme is robust against system dissipation and provides a feasible approach for the realization of Heisenberg limit squeezing within the reach of current experimental technologies.

TI Design space of quantum dot spin qubits
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Solid-state qubits can be implemented with electrostatically confined quantum dots in semiconductors, allowing gate voltages to independently control the electrochemical potentials of each quantum dot. Quantum dots offer high levels of reliability and scalability. In this paper, along with our proposed approach based on the Generalized Hubbard model followed by Fermi's Golden rule, the charge stability diagram of a double quantum dots system with two electrons has been studied extensively. The validity of the presented approach is confirmed by experimental data. Using Fermi's Golden rule for mapping the charge stability diagram, we have deeply studied the temperature effects arising from both the Hamiltonian and transport. In addition, spin-exchange, pair-hopping, and the occupation-modulated hopping parameters on the states of the charge stability diagram are deeply discussed. Furthermore, we incorporate the Zeeman energies in the Hubbard model in order to theoretically study the spin splitting caused by an external magnetic field applied to the quantum dots. In particular, the aim of this paper is to rely on fundamental physical concepts in order to model and optimize the singlet-triplet qubit in quantum dots. In this study, the probabilities associated with singlet and triplet states have been modeled and analyzed under the impacts of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. This will help us to find the optimal condition for coupling between double dots and provides us the design rules in terms of physical parameters to efficiently design, measure and sense, initialize, manipulate, and readout of the qubit state.

TI Transmission of optical communication signals through ring core fiber
   using perfect vortex beams
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Orbital angular momentum can be used to implement high capacity data transmission systems that can be applied for classical and quantum communications. Here we experimentally study the generation and transmission properties of the so-called perfect vortex beams and the Laguer re-Gaussian beams in ring-core optical fibers. Our results show that when using a single preparation stage, the perfect vortex beams present less ring-radius variation that allows coupling of higher optical power into a ring core fiber. These results lead to lower power requirements to establish fiber-based communications links using orbital angular momentum and set the stage for future implementations of high-dimensional quantum communication over space division multiplexing fibers.

TI Sum-frequency-based photon-number-resolving detector for telecom
   wavelengths
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The use of C-band wavelengths in the field of quantum communication has grown significantly, driving the need for versatile detection solutions, especially in the low intensity domain. Among the desirable features for such detectors, photon-number-resolving (PNR) capability is particularly valuable, since it can offer new possibilities for enhancing security of communication protocols. In this paper, we present the implementation of a receiver that combines low-cost PNR detectors with nonlinear optical interactions to achieve sensitivity at telecom wavelengths. In particular, we use this receiver to characterize the Poissonian nature of a femtosecond source at 1.5 mu m, produced via white light continuum generation followed by a single-stage amplification process. The obtained results encourage the exploitation of such a detector in more complex schemes.

TI Quantum weak measurement amplifies dispersion signal of Rydberg atomic
   system
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a scheme to amplify dispersion signal of Rydberg atomic microwave detection system, using a quantum weak measurement technique together with improved dimensionless pointer. The scheme effectively mitigates the impact of technical noise and can be used to achieve a measurement precision close to the limit set by atomic shot noise in theory. Compared with the superheterodyne method based on transmission detection, our scheme has been experimentally proved to have a sensitivity increase of 5 similar to 6 dB. In this work, the Rydberg dispersion signal amplification mechanism offers an approach to enhance microwave detection sensitivity, which also facilitates deeper investigations into its dynamic processes and further applications of this mechanism in quantum communication and quantum control.

TI Efficient learning of continuous-variable quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The characterization of continuous-variable quantum states is crucial for applications in quantum communication, sensing, simulation, and computing. However, a full characterization of multimode quantum states requires a number of experiments that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Here we propose an alternative approach where the goal is not to reconstruct the full quantum state, but rather to estimate its characteristic function at a given set of points. For multimode states with reflection symmetry, we show that the characteristic function at M points can be estimated using only O(log M) copies of the state, independently of the number of modes. When the characteristic function is known to be positive, as in the case of squeezed vacuum states, the estimation is achieved by an experimentally friendly setup using only beamsplitters and homodyne measurements.

TI Protecting Quantum Modes in Optical Fibers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Polarization-preserving fibers maintain the two polarization states of an orthogonal basis. Quantum communication, however, requires sending at least two nonorthogonal states and these cannot both be preserved. We present an alternative scheme that allows for using polarization encoding in a fiber not only in the discrete, but also in the continuous-variable regime. For the example of a helically twisted photonic crystal fiber, we experimentally demonstrate that using appropriate nonorthogonal modes, the polarization-preserving fiber does not fully scramble these modes over the full Poincare sphere, but that the output polarization will stay on a great circle; that is, within a one-dimensional protected subspace, which can be parametrized by a single variable. This allows for more efficient measurements of quantum excitations in nonorthogonal modes.

TI Correlated noise enhances performance of joint remote state preparation
   in quantum multi-hop network
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Joint remote state preparation (JRSP for short) can increase the security of quantum communication by distributing different parts of classical information to different senders. However, the communication efficiency in terms of fidelity decreases with the increase of intermediate nodes in multi-hop network. In this paper, we try to explore methods to improve fidelity of JRSP in multi-hop network presented by Zhang and Chen in 2023 Phys. Scr. 98 065107. Specifically, correlated Pauli noise with partial memory was introduced into the shared channel. We find that the fidelity increases with the increase of memory parameters, which compensates for the loss of fidelity caused by the increase of network nodes.

TI Temporal witnesses of non-classicality in a macroscopic biological
   system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Exciton transfer along a bio-polymer is essential for many biological processes, for instance, light harvesting in photosynthetic biosystems. Here we apply a new witness of non-classicality to this phenomenon, to conclude that, if an exciton can mediate the coherent quantum evolution of a photon, then the exciton is non-classical. We then propose a general qubit model for the quantum transfer of an exciton along a bio-polymer chain, also discussing the effects of environmental decoherence. The generality of our results makes them ideal candidates to design new tests of quantum features in complex bio-molecules.

TI End-point measurement approach to assess quantum coherence in energy
   fluctuations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We discuss the role of quantum coherence in the energy fluctuations of open quantum systems. To this aim, we introduce a protocol to which we refer as the end-point measurement scheme, allowing us to define the statistics of energy changes as a function of energy measurements performed only after the evolution of the initial state. At the price of an additional uncertainty on the initial energies, this approach prevents the loss of initial quantum coherences and enables the estimation of their effects on energy fluctuations. We demonstrate our findings by running an experiment on the IBM Quantum Experience superconducting qubit platform.

TI Quantum multicast based on joint remote state preparation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Effective propagation of information among multiple users is the purpose of realizing large-scale quantum communication networks. In this paper, multicast protocols for any single, two and three qubits with real amplitude and complex phase information are presented. They were realized using a composite of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states as shared channels. Joint remote state preparation was the main method for completing quantum multicast. At the same time, quantum state tomography of the schemes was carried out on the IBM Quantum platform. The obtained states were compared with the target states by fidelity. The analysis of communication efficiency and noise effects shows that our protocol has advantages in the case of complex coefficients.

TI Neural Error Mitigation of Near-Term Quantum Simulations
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB So-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices will be capable of a range of quantum simulation tasks, provided that the effects of noise can be sufficiently reduced. A neural error mitigation approach is developed that uses neural networks to improve the estimates of ground states and ground-state observables of molecules and quantum systems obtained using quantum simulations on near-term devices.
   Near-term quantum computers provide a promising platform for finding the ground states of quantum systems, which is an essential task in physics, chemistry and materials science. However, near-term approaches are constrained by the effects of noise, as well as the limited resources of near-term quantum hardware. We introduce neural error mitigation, which uses neural networks to improve estimates of ground states and ground-state observables obtained using near-term quantum simulations. To demonstrate our method's broad applicability, we employ neural error mitigation to find the ground states of the H-2 and LiH molecular Hamiltonians, as well as the lattice Schwinger model, prepared via the variational quantum eigensolver. Our results show that neural error mitigation improves numerical and experimental variational quantum eigensolver computations to yield low energy errors, high fidelities and accurate estimations of more complex observables such as order parameters and entanglement entropy without requiring additional quantum resources. Furthermore, neural error mitigation is agnostic with respect to the quantum state preparation algorithm used, the quantum hardware it is implemented on and the particular noise channel affecting the experiment, contributing to its versatility as a tool for quantum simulation.

TI Single- and two-photon absorption induced all-optical control of gallium
   selenide integrated silicon nitride photonic devices in the 700-800 nm
   wavelength range
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In this work, we report single- and two-photon absorption (TPA) induced transmission and resonance modulation in a multilayer gallium selenide (GaSe) integrated silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguide and ring resonator operating in the 700-800 nm wavelength range. Intensity dependent saturable absorption at low optical powers followed by TPA at higher power levels in GaSe integrated Si3N4 waveguides is observed at 785 nm pulsed laser excitation. A TPA coefficient of 0.117 cm/GW for the GaSe-Si3N4 composite waveguide and a three-photon absorption coefficient of 7.876 x 10(-6) cm(3)/GW(2) for the bare Si3N4 waveguide are extracted from intensity dependent transmission measurements. The single-photon absorption process induced by a blue laser incident on the multilayer GaSe transferred on top of the Si3N4 ring resonator is used for all-optical resonance tuning through the free-carrier refraction effect. A strong blue shift of the resonance by similar to 12.3 pm/mW combined with resonance broadening is observed due to the free-carrier induced refractive index and absorption modulation. The TPA in the GaSe integrated Si3N4 ring resonator is also shown to result in a blue shift of the resonances excited using a 785 nm pulsed laser. This work demonstrates the all-optical control of 2D material integrated Si3N4 guided-wave structures operating in the shorter near-infrared wavelength range with potential applications in integrated quantum photonics, miniaturized sensing devices, and biomedical imaging.

TI Tailoring Light-Matter Interactions in Overcoupled Resonator for
   Biomolecule Recognition and Detection
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Proposed a new paradigm for nanoantenna design using coupled-mode theory.Designed an OC-H mu resonator with excellent sensing performance.Using OC-H mu resonators for biomolecule recognition and detection.
   Plasmonic nanoantennas provide unique opportunities for precise control of light-matter coupling in surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy, but most of the resonant systems realized so far suffer from the obstacles of low sensitivity, narrow bandwidth, and asymmetric Fano resonance perturbations. Here, we demonstrated an overcoupled resonator with a high plasmon-molecule coupling coefficient (mu) (OC-H mu resonator) by precisely controlling the radiation loss channel, the resonator-oscillator coupling channel, and the frequency detuning channel. We observed a strong dependence of the sensing performance on the coupling state, and demonstrated that OC-H mu resonator has excellent sensing properties of ultra-sensitive (7.25% nm-1), ultra-broadband (3-10 mu m), and immune asymmetric Fano lineshapes. These characteristics represent a breakthrough in SEIRA technology and lay the foundation for specific recognition of biomolecules, trace detection, and protein secondary structure analysis using a single array (array size is 100 x 100 mu m2). In addition, with the assistance of machine learning, mixture classification, concentration prediction and spectral reconstruction were achieved with the highest accuracy of 100%. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of OC-H mu resonator for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These findings will promote the wider application of SEIRA technology, while providing new ideas for other enhanced spectroscopy technologies, quantum photonics and studying light-matter interactions.

We validate our results with an intentionally non-ideal measurement setup to show robustness, while also statistically testing our final output with four popular statistical test suites.

This constitutes a non-intensity quantity for robust, all-optical magnetic field sensing. We propose a fiber-based setup in which the excitation intensity is modulated in a frequency range up to 100MHz. The change in magnitude and phase of the fluorescence relative to B=0 is recorded where the phase shows a maximum in magnetic contrast of 5.8 circle at 13MHz. A lock-in amplifier-based setup utilizing the change in phase at this frequency shows a 100 times higher immunity to fluctuations in the optical path compared to the intensity-based approach. A noise floor of 20 mu T/Hz and a shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 0.95 mu T/Hz were determined.

TI Optimal parameter configurations for sequential optimization of the
   variational quantum eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid algorithm to find the minimum eigenvalue/vector of the given Hamiltonian by optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) using a classical computer. Sequential optimization methods, which are often used in quantum circuit tensor networks, are popular for optimizing the parameterized gates of PQCs. In this paper, we focus on the case where the components to be optimized are single-qubit gates, in which the analytic optimization of a single-qubit gate is sequentially performed. The analytical solution is given by diagonalization of a matrix whose elements are computed from the expectation values of observables specified by a set of predetermined parameters, which we refer to as the parameter configurations. In this paper, we first show that the optimization accuracy significantly depends on the choice of parameter configurations owing to the statistical errors in the expectation values. We then identify a metric that quantifies the optimization accuracy of a parameter configuration for all possible statistical errors, named configuration overhead/cost or C-cost. We theoretically provide the lower bound of C-cost and show that, for the minimum size of parameter configurations, the lower bound is achieved if and only if the parameter configuration satisfies the so-called equiangular line condition. Finally, we provide numerical experiments demonstrating that the optimal parameter configuration exhibits the best result in several VQE problems. We hope that this general statistical methodology will enhance the efficacy of sequential optimization of PQCs for solving practical problems with near-term quantum devices.

TI Dynamical approach to improving Majorana qubits and distinguishing them
   from trivial bound states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study a series of dynamical protocols which involve periodically driving a quantum dot coupled to a putative nanowire hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) to (i) reduce the hybridization between MZMs, (ii) improve the coherence of the Majorana qubit with respect to 1/f dephasing noise and quasiparticle poisoning, and (iii) provide a definitive test to differentiate Andreev bound states (ABSs) from MZMs. The protocols are based on the notion of draiding, exchanging a pair of Majoranas twice, repeatedly, at high frequency [I. Martin and K. Agarwal, PRX Quantum 1, 020324 (2020)]. In this process, the exchanged Majorana operators acquire a robust minus sign such that terms in the Hamiltonian, linear in either operator, vanish on average. The four protocols proposed implement draiding by coupling quantum dot(s) to the end(s) of the nanowire. They are treated using Floquet theory and numerical simulations. The hybridization energy and decoherence rate are shown to be reduced by several orders of magnitude, in accordance with theoretical expectations, when the protocols are implemented on nanowires described by experimentally relevant parameters. The tunneling conductance computed in this Floquet setting reveals zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) that become more centered at zero voltage bias. When these protocols are implemented on nanowires supporting ABSs that mimic MZMs in ZBP measurements, the qubit coherence deteriorates, in stark contrast to the case where the nanowire supports MZMs and the coherence drastically improves, thus serving as a dynamical test to distinguish MZMs from trivial bound states.

TI Reporter-Spin-Assisted T1 Relaxometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A single-spin quantum sensor can quantitatively detect and image fluctuating electromagnetic fields via their effect on the sensor spin's relaxation time, thus revealing important information about the target solid-state or molecular structures. However, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of spin relaxometry are often limited by the distance between the sensor and target. Here, we propose an alternative approach that leverages an auxiliary reporter spin in conjunction with a single-spin sensor, a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center. We show that this approach can realize a 100-fold measurement sensitivity improvement for realistic working conditions and we experimentally verify the proposed method using a single shallow N-V center. Our work opens up a broad path of inquiry into a range of possible spin systems that can serve as relaxation sensors without the need for optical initialization and readout capabilities.

TI Probing Surface-Bound Atoms with Quantum Nanophotonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum control of atoms at ultrashort distances from surfaces would open a new paradigm in quantum optics and offer a novel tool for the investigation of near-surface physics. Here, we investigate the motional states of atoms that are bound weakly to the surface of a hot optical nanofiber. We theoretically demonstrate that with optimized mechanical properties of the nanofiber these states are quantized despite phonon-induced decoherence. We further show that it is possible to influence their properties with additional nanofiber-guided light fields and suggest heterodyne fluorescence spectroscopy to probe the spectrum of the quantized atomic motion. Extending the optical control of atoms to smaller atom-surface separations could create opportunities for quantum communication and instigate the convergence of surface physics, quantum optics, and the physics of cold atoms.

TI Finite-Function-Encoding Quantum States
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce finite-function-encoding (FFE) states which encode arbitrary d-valued logic functions, i.e., multivariate functions over the ring of integers modulo d, and investigate some of their structural properties. We also point out some differences between polynomial and non-polynomial function encoding states: The former can be associated to graphical objects, that we dub tensor-edge hypergraphs (TEH), which are a generalization of hypergraphs with a tensor attached to each hyperedge encoding the coefficients of the different monomials. To complete the framework, we also introduce a notion of finite-function-encoding Pauli (FP) operators, which correspond to elements of what is known as the generalized symmetric group in mathematics. First, using this machinery, we study the stabilizer group associated to FFE states and observe how qudit hypergraph states introduced in Ref. [1] admit stabilizers of a particularly simpler form. Afterwards, we investigate the classification of FFE states under local unitaries (LU), and, after showing the complexity of this problem, we focus on the case of bipartite states and especially on the classification under local FP operations (LFP). We find all LU and LFP classes for two qutrits and two ququarts and study several other special classes, pointing out the relation between maximally entangled FFE states and complex Butson-type Hadamard matrices. Our investigation showcases also the relation between the properties of FFE states, especially their LU classification, and the theory of finite rings over the integers.

TI High-Speed NTT Accelerator for CRYSTAL-Kyber and CRYSTAL-Dilithium
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The efficiency of polynomial multiplication execution majorly impacts the performance of lattice-based post-quantum cryptosystems. In this research, we propose a high-speed hardware architecture to accelerate polynomial multiplication based on the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in CRYSTAL-Kyber and CRYSTAL-Dilithium. We design a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) architecture for modular multiplication in butterfly and Point-Wise Multiplication (PWM) operations. Our method reduces the critical path delay of an n -bit multiplier to that of a (2n -2)-bit adder, optimizing both area and speed. These dedicated DSPs are employed in butterfly and PWM operations, completely eliminating the pre-process and post-process of NTT transforms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel unified pipelined architecture for the NTT and Inverse NTT (INTT) transformations of Kyber and Dilithium, with corresponding high-speed (Radix-2) and ultra-high-speed (Radix-4) versions. Lastly, we construct a complete hardware accelerator for polynomial matrix-vector multiplication in Kyber. The Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation results have proven that our designs have significantly improved execution time by 3.4x -9.6x for the NTT transforms in Dilithium and 1.36x - 34.16x for Kyber polynomial multiplication, compared to previous studies reported to date. Additionally, the hardware footprint results indicate that our proposed architectures exhibit superior hardware performance in Area-Time-Product (ATP), corresponding to a 44%-96% improvement. The proposed architectures are efficient and well-suited for high-performance lattice-based cryptography systems.

TI An Efficient Hardware/Software Co-Design for FALCON on Low-End Embedded
   Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose in this paper an efficient FALCON accelerator called EFX based on a HW/SW co-design where FALCON is a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) scheme tailored as a digital signature algorithm (DSA). Our findings reveal that FALCON exhibits unique characteristics and structures which distinguish it from other PQC-DSAs. A key finding is that, unlike its counterparts, FALCON doesn't prioritize a single, time-consuming task; instead, it processes a variety of tasks with comparable execution times. Consequently, the conventional methods focusing on accelerating dominant few tasks, which are generally effective for other algorithms, prove less efficient for FALCON, especially concerning the minimization of the silicon area used. To overcome this, we strategically focus on the granular optimization of lower-level operations rather than on broader functional segments, aiming to boost performance while conserving hardware space. Moreover, to mitigate the potential degradation due to limitation of hardware resources, we have implemented a pipelined execution strategy for the FALCON functions and refined the sampling function-a critical task that is challenging to accelerate due to inherent sequential algorithm-enabling it to run concurrently on both software and hardware, thus reducing latency. Our hardware design, synthesized at 300MHz using Samsung's 28nm and 45nm process technologies, demonstrates superior performance in generating FALCON signatures, with a 3.58x improvement in clock cycles over an existing hardware accelerator. EFX occupies 38K um(2) and 74K um(2) for 28nm and 45nm processes, respectively, comparatively small compared to other PQC accelerators.

TI Measurement-induced entanglement and teleportation on a noisy quantum
   processor
SO NATURE
AB Measurement has a special role in quantum theory(1): by collapsing the wavefunction, it can enable phenomena such as teleportation(2) and thereby alter the 'arrow of time' that constrains unitary evolution. When integrated in many-body dynamics, measurements can lead to emergent patterns of quantum information in space-time(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) that go beyond the established paradigms for characterizing phases, either in or out of equilibrium(11,12,13). For present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors(14), the experimental realization of such physics can be problematic because of hardware limitations and the stochastic nature of quantum measurement. Here we address these experimental challenges and study measurement-induced quantum information phases on up to 70 superconducting qubits. By leveraging the interchangeability of space and time, we use a duality mapping(9,15,16,17) to avoid mid-circuit measurement and access different manifestations of the underlying phases, from entanglement scaling(3,4) to measurement-induced teleportation(18). We obtain finite-sized signatures of a phase transition with a decoding protocol that correlates the experimental measurement with classical simulation data. The phases display remarkably different sensitivity to noise, and we use this disparity to turn an inherent hardware limitation into a useful diagnostic. Our work demonstrates an approach to realizing measurement-induced physics at scales that are at the limits of current NISQ processors.

TI Quantum Hypothesis Testing for Exoplanet Detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Detecting the faint emission of a secondary source in the proximity of the much brighter one has been the most severe obstacle for using direct imaging in searching for exoplanets. Using quantum state discrimination and quantum imaging techniques, we show that one can significantly reduce the probability of error for detecting the presence of a weak secondary source, especially when the two sources have small angular separations. If the weak source has intensity epsilon << 1 relative to the bright source, we find that the error exponent can be improved by a factor of 1/epsilon. We also find linear-optical measurements that are optimal in this regime. Our result serves as a complementary method in the toolbox of optical imaging, with applications ranging from astronomy to microscopy.

AB MAGIS-100 is a long-baseline atom interferometer that operates as a quantum sensor. It will search for dark matter, probe fundamental quantum science, and serve as a prototype gravitational wave detector in the 0.3 to 3 Hz frequency range. The experiment uses light-pulse atom interferometry where pulses of light create the atom optics equivalents of beamsplitters and mirrors. Laser beam aberrations are a key source of systematic error for MAGIS-100, and accurately characterizing the laser beam spatial profile is therefore essential. In this paper, we describe a new and efficient beam profiling technique. We use a low-cost CMOS camera affixed to a translating and rotating optomechanical mount to image the beam, then employ computer vision and principal component analysis to minimize background noise and produce accurate beam profiles for a laser incident on a variety of aberration-inducing optical elements.

TI Probing Thermal Magnon Current Mediated by Coherent Magnon via
   Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Currently, thermally excited magnons are being intensively investigated, owing to their potential in computing devices and thermoelectric conversion technologies. We report the detection of a thermal magnon current propagating in a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet under a temperature gradient using a quantum sensor: electron spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers in diamond. A thermal magnon current is observed as modified Rabi-oscillation frequencies of N-V spins hosted in a beam-shaped bulk diamond that is resonantly coupled with coherent magnon propagating over a long distance. Additionally, using a nanodiamond, alteration in N-V spin-relaxation rates, depending on the applied temperature gradient, are observed under nonresonant N-V excitation conditions.

TI Thiolation and PEGylation of silicon carbide nanoparticles
SO RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY
AB In this study, we implement thiol termination on the surface of few-nanometer-sized silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles (NPs) to enable further applications, such as fluorescent biomarkers. Various spectroscopic techniques are employed to monitor the effectiveness of the surface treatment. A thiol-Michael addition reaction is performed by conjugating 4-arm PEGmaleimide molecules to the thiol groups of SiC NPs, further demonstrating the reactivity of thiol-terminated SiC NPs, which also acts as a protection layer against oxidation. These fluorescent thiolated SiC NPs, both with and without conjugated molecules, are directly applicable as bioinert probes. Since SiC NPs can potentially host room-temperature fluorescent defect quantum bits, our results are an important step to realize a bioinert, ultrasmall quantum sensor bioagents, which may open new avenues in biotechnology.

TI Optical widefield nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Microscopy enables detailed visualization and understanding of minute structures or processes. While cameras have significantly advanced optical, infrared, and electron microscopy, imaging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals on a camera has remained elusive. Here, we employ nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a quantum sensor, which converts NMR signals into optical signals that are subsequently captured by a high-speed camera. Unlike traditional magnetic resonance imaging, our method records the NMR signal over a wide field of view in real space. We demonstrate that our optical widefield NMR microscopy can image NMR signals in microfluidic structures with a similar to 10 mu m resolution across a similar to 235 x 150 mu m(2) area. Crucially, each camera pixel records an NMR spectrum providing multicomponent information about the signal's amplitude, phase, local magnetic field strengths, and gradients. The fusion of optical microscopy and NMR techniques enables multifaceted imaging applications in the physical and life sciences.

TI Nanodiamond-Based Sensing: A revolution for biosensors in capturing
   elusive bio-signals in living cells
SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB Cells constantly produce elusive bio-signals, such as cellular forces, free radicals, and molecular interactions, that are important for understanding diseases and treatment effects. However, detecting these signals is challenging because of issues with sensitivity, specificity, and the complexity of biological systems. Owing to their unique properties, nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising platform for detecting such elusive bio-signals, providing enhanced precision and effectiveness in diagnostics and therapies. In this review, we explore the detection of intracellular elusive bio-signals using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds, presenting case studies on their applications in cell force, free radicals, molecular interactions, and nanoscale thermometry. Moreover, we explore the design and applications of nanodiamonds as nanocarriers in quantum sensors and drug delivery systems.

TI Joint optimal measurement for locating two incoherent optical point
   sources near the Rayleigh distance
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Simultaneously optimizing the estimation of the centroid and separation of two incoherent optical point sources is constrained by a tradeoff relation determined by an incompatibility coefficient. At the Rayleigh distance, the incompatibility coefficient vanishes and thus the tradeoff relation no longer restricts the simultaneous optimization of measurement for a joint estimation. We construct such a joint optimal measurement by an elaborated analysis on the operator algebra of the symmetric logarithmic derivative. Our work not only confirms the existence of a joint optimal measurement for this specific imaging model, but also gives a promising method to characterize the condition on measurement compatibility for general multiparameter estimation problems.

AB High-resolution imaging is an important issue in various fields of scientific researches and engineering applications. Pseudothermal ghost imaging is one of the subfields of quantum imaging, providing new capabilities beyond conventional imaging methods. Also, it can provide a new viewpoint of imaging physical mechanisms. In this review, we explain the major ideas of pseudothermal ghost imaging, restricting the very important case of high-resolution imaging. We analyse the strategies which can significantly improve the image quality in pseudothermal ghost imaging. It may apply for merging it with common optical imaging methods in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) or X-ray spectral regime for driving the applications to a wider audience in bioscience and nano-physics.

TI Dispersion-engineered optical fibers for mid-infrared entangled
   single-photon generation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Near-infrared (NIR) single-photon sources have become the backbone of quantum technology. There is further potential to demonstrate the next-generation quantum technology applications by extending the wavelengths to the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region. This interest is driven by the extraordinary characteristics of the mid-IR wavelength spectrum. In this paper, we propose ger mania-doped and ZBLAN fibers that exploit spontaneous four-wave mixing (SpFWM) to generate a single photon-pair in the -2 mu m to -3.5 mu m wavelength range. The phase-matching conditions at different wavelengths can be achieved by employing both the same-mode and mixed-mode schemes (intra and inter modal) for the idler, pump, and signal wavelengths. For the intramodal scheme, we exploited the fiber's high NA to produce closely spaced non-degenerate modes (such as LP11a/LP11b and LP21a/LP21b) and then used combinations of these modes (from LP11a to LP11b or LP21a to LP21b) for all three signal, pump, and idler wavelengths to achieve the phase-matching. For the inter modal scheme, we borrowed different modes for the signal, pump (including different modes for both pump photons), and idler wavelengths. The mixed-mode schemes allow for a larger core and provide greater flexibility in tuning the idler and signal wavelengths to mitigate the effects of Raman scattering and residual pump photons (-20-25 THz from the pump frequency), albeit with increased complexity and reduced efficiency. We developed an understanding of the mixed-mode phase-matching scheme and built a model to optimize mode selection for phase-matching. Our investigations reveal, for the first time, the untapped potential of fiber-based mid-IR entangled single photon-pair generation.

TI ATHOS: A Hybrid Accelerator for PQC CRYSTALS-Algorithms Exploiting New
   CV-X-IF Interface
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB ATHOS (Accelerated Technology for Hardware Optimization with RISC-V) is introduced as a robust solution for enhancing cryptographic operations, explicitly designed for RISC-V architectures. Addressing the challenges of implementing cryptographic algorithms, ATHOS leverages a combination of both tightly and loosely coupled accelerators. A key innovation of ATHOS is its exploitation of the CV32E40X core via the novel Core-V eXtension InterFace (CV-X-IF). This pioneering work is one of the first to utilize this interface in real-world applications, offering a unique foundation for extensive exploration of acceleration approaches. Utilizing the CV-X-IF simplifies the insertion of new instructions into the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and streamlines the integration of tightly coupled accelerators without requiring modifications to the toolchain. This work focuses on the implementation and integration of various accelerators into the RISC-V microcontroller X-HEEP, adding new instructions and external IPs for the Numeric Theoretic Transform (NTT), its Inverse (INTT), and Keccak transformation. Our complete architecture is implemented on ASIC 65 mu m technology, resulting in a 1.47x area overhead for the microcontroller. Additionally, it improves CRYSTALS-Kyber's and CRYSTALS-Dilithium's total clock cycle respectively by up to 7.74x and to 4.12x compared to the baseline software implementation, demonstrating the potential of this hybrid system and marking one of the first real applications of the CV-X-IF interface.

TI All-optically untangling light propagation through multimode fibers
SO OPTICA
AB When light propagates through a complex medium, such as a multimode optical fiber (MMF), the spatial information it carries is scrambled. In this work we experimentally demonstrate an all -optical strategy to unscramble this light again. We first create a digital model capturing the way light has been scattered, and then use this model to inverse -design and build a complementary optical system-which we call an optical inverter-that reverses this scattering process. Our implementation of this concept is based on multi-plane light conversion, and can also be understood as a physical matrix preconditioner, or a linear diffractive optical neural network. We present three design strategies allowing different aspects of device performance to be prioritized. We experimentally demonstrate a prototype optical inverter capable of simultaneously unscrambling up to 30 spatial modes that have propagated through a 1 m long MMF, and show how this promises near instantaneous incoherent imaging, without the need for any beam scanning or computational processing. We also demonstrate the reconfigurable nature of this prototype, allowing it to adapt and deliver a new optical transformation if the MMF it is matched to changes configuration. Our work represents a step towards a new way to see through scattering media. Beyond imaging, this concept may also have applications to the fields of optical communications, optical computing and quantum photonics.

TI Cryptanalysis of the SHMW signature scheme
SO HELIYON
AB In recent research, Durandal, a signature scheme based on rank metrics following Schnorr's approach, was introduced to conceal secret key information by selectively manipulating the vector subspace of signatures. Later, an enhancement, namely the SHMW signature scheme, with smaller keys and signatures while maintaining EUF-CMA security, was proposed. Both Durandal and SHMW require adversaries to solve hard problems (i.e., Rank Support Learning, Rank Syndrome Decoding, and Affine Rank Syndrome Decoding) for secret key retrieval, in which the parameters are designed to withstand at least 128 -bit computational complexity. The authors claimed that the security of the SHMW scheme is deemed superior to that of the original Durandal scheme. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying weak keys within the Durandal framework to prove the superiority of the SHMW scheme. This approach exploits the extra information in the signature to compute an intersection space that contains the secret key. Consequently, a cryptanalysis of the SHMW signature scheme was carried out to demonstrate the insecurity of the selected keys within the SHWM scheme. In particular, we proposed an algorithm to recover an extended support that contains the secret key used in the signature schemes. Applying our approach to the SHMW scheme, we can recover its secret key with only 97 -bit complexity, although it was claimed that the proposed parameters achieve a 128 -bit security level. The results of our proposed approaches show that the security level of the SHMW signature scheme is inferior compared to that of the original Durandal scheme.

TI Detection of Few Hydrogen Peroxide Molecules Using Self-Reporting

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important role in various signal transduction pathways and regulates important cellular processes. However, monitoring and quantitatively assessing the distribution of H2O, molecules inside living cells requires a nanoscale sensor with molecular-level sensitivity. Herein, we show the first demonstration of sub-10 nm-sized fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs as catalysts for the decomposition of H2O2 and the production of radical intermediates at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors inside the NDs are employed to quantify the aforementioned radicals. We believe that our method of combining the peroxidase-mimicking activities of the NDs with their intrinsic quantum sensor showcases their application as self-reporting H2O2 sensors with molecular-level sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution. Given the robustness and the specificity of the sensor, our results promise a new platform for elucidating the role of H2O2 at the cellular level.

TI A Novel Framework for Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning with Edge
   Computing for Advanced Pain Assessment Using ECG Signals via Continuous
   Wavelet Transform Images
SO SENSORS
AB Our research introduces a framework that integrates edge computing, quantum transfer learning, and federated learning to revolutionize pain level assessment through ECG signal analysis. The primary focus lies in developing a robust, privacy-preserving system that accurately classifies pain levels (low, medium, and high) by leveraging the intricate relationship between pain perception and autonomic nervous system responses captured in ECG signals. At the heart of our methodology lies a signal processing approach that transforms one-dimensional ECG signals into rich, two-dimensional Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) images. These transformations capture both temporal and frequency characteristics of pain-induced cardiac variations, providing a comprehensive representation of autonomic nervous system responses to different pain intensities. Our framework processes these CWT images through a sophisticated quantum-classical hybrid architecture, where edge devices perform initial preprocessing and feature extraction while maintaining data privacy. The cornerstone of our system is a Quantum Convolutional Hybrid Neural Network (QCHNN) that harnesses quantum entanglement properties to enhance feature detection and classification robustness. This quantum-enhanced approach is seamlessly integrated into a federated learning framework, allowing distributed training across multiple healthcare facilities while preserving patient privacy through secure aggregation protocols. The QCHNN demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.8% in pain level assessment, significantly outperforming traditional machine learning approaches.

TI Comparative Study of Quantum Emitter Fabrication in Wide Bandgap
   Materials Using Localized Electron Irradiation
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Quantum light sources are crucial foundational components for various quantum technology applications. With the rapid development of quantum technology, there has been a growing demand for materials with the capability of hosting quantum emitters. One such material platform uses fluorescent defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that can host deep sublevels within the bandgap. The localized electron irradiation has shown its effectiveness in generating deep sublevels to induce single emitters in hBN. The question is whether localized (electron beam) irradiation is a reliable tool for creating emitters in other wide bandgap materials and its uniqueness to hBN. Here, we investigate and compare the fabrication of quantum emitters in hBN and exfoliated muscovite mica flakes along with other 3D crystals, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, which are known to host quantum emitters. We used our primary fabrication technique of localized electron irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope. To complement our experimental work, we employed density functional theory simulations to study the atomic structures of defects in mica. While our fabrication technique allows one to create hBN quantum emitters with a high yield and high single photon purity, it is unable to fabricate single emitters in the other solid-state crystals under investigation. This allows us to draw conclusions on the emitter fabrication mechanism in hBN, which could rely on activating pre-existing defects by charge state manipulation. Therefore, we provide an essential step toward the identification of hBN emitters and their formation process.

AB Computationally hard problems based on coding theory, such as the syndrome decoding problem, have been used for constructing secure cryptographic schemes for a long time. Schemes based on these problems are also assumed to be secure against quantum computers. However, these schemes are often considered impractical for real-world deployment due to large key sizes and inefficient computation time. In the recent call for standardization of additional post-quantum digital signatures by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, several code-based candidates have been proposed, including LESS, CROSS, and MEDS. These schemes are designed on the relatively new zero-knowledge framework. Although several works analyze the hardness of these schemes, there is hardly any work that examines the security of these schemes in the presence of physical attacks. In this work, we analyze these signature schemes from the perspective of fault attacks. All these schemes use a similar tree-based construction to compress the signature size. We attack this component of these schemes. Therefore, our attack is applicable to all of these schemes. In this work, we first analyze the LESS signature scheme and devise our attack. Furthermore, we showed how this attack can be extended to the CROSS signature scheme. Our attacks are built on very simple fault assumptions. Our results show that we can recover the entire secret key of LESS and CROSS using as little as a single fault. Finally, we propose various countermeasures to prevent these kinds of attacks and discuss their efficiency and shortcomings.

TI Variational Ansatz preparation to avoid CNOT-gates on noisy
   quantum devices for combinatorial optimizations
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which is a quantum-classical hybrid approach, has latent powers to leverage near-term quantum devices by effectively managing a limited number of qubits with finite coherent lifetimes. While it is generally argued that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), which is a special case of VQE with a variational Ansatz based on the adiabatic theorem, may enable practical applications of noisy quantum devices for classical combinatorial optimizations, the strategy to improve the performance of this algorithm by increasing the circuit depth conflicts with the limited coherence time of near-term quantum devices. Here, we introduce strategies involving the VQE to reduce the circuit resources required for solving combinatorial optimizations. Our concept of a parameterized quantum circuit allows the Ansatz preparation to be achieved by only single-qubit operation. We find that the variational Ansatz without controlled X-gates leads to quick convergence in a classical subroutine used to determine the variational parameters. In addition, the variational Ansatz with optimized parameters maintains performance over the problem sizes both on the numerical simulation and IBM 27-qubit processor "ibm_kawasaki. " Therefore, the variational Ansatz introduced in this study has several advantages considering the total calculation time and performance scaling over the problem sizes. We also show that the variational Ansatz consisting of a lower number of gate operations than that of QAOA can approximate the eigenstates of diagonal Hamiltonians with high accuracy. We illustrate our ideas with a maximum-cut problem and show that near-term quantum applications may be feasible using short-depth circuits. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Benchmarking of X-Ray Fluorescence Microscopy with Ion Beam Implanted
   Samples Showing Detection Sensitivity of Hundreds of Atoms
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Single impurities in insulators are now often used for quantum sensors and single photon sources, while nanoscale semiconductor doping features are being constructed for electrical contacts in quantum technology devices, implying that new methods for sensitive, non-destructive imaging of single- or few-atom structures are needed. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) can provide nanoscale imaging with chemical specificity, and features comprising as few as 100 000 atoms have been detected without any need for specialized or destructive sample preparation. Presently, the ultimate limits of sensitivity of XRF are unknown - here, gallium dopants in silicon are investigated using a high brilliance, synchrotron source collimated to a small spot. It is demonstrated that with a single-pixel integration time of 1 s, the sensitivity is sufficient to identify a single isolated feature of only 3000 Ga impurities (a mass of just 350 zg). With increased integration (25 s), 650 impurities can be detected. The results are quantified using a calibration sample consisting of precisely controlled numbers of implanted atoms in nanometer-sized structures. The results show that such features can now be mapped quantitatively when calibration samples are used, and suggest that, in the near future, planned upgrades to XRF facilities might achieve single-atom sensitivity.
   Advancements in X-ray fluorescence microscopy demonstrate metrological quantification of the sensitivity for just a few hundred buried impurity atoms in clusters of only a few 10's of nanometers in size, using specially designed test structures made with gallium implanted into silicon. Non-destructive observation of single-atom implants is predicted in the near future. image

TI Analyzing the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) can address vulnerabilities on the detection side of a QKD system. The core of this protocol involves continuous-variable Bell measurements performed by an untrusted third party. However, in high-speed systems, spectrum broadening causes Bell measurements to deviate from the ideal single-mode scenario, resulting in mode mismatches, reduced performance, and compromised security. Here, we introduce temporal modes (TMs) to analyze the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios. The mismatch between Bob's transmitting mode and Bell-measurement mode has a more significant effect on system performance compared to that on Alice's side. When the Bell receiver is close to Bob and the mismatch is set to just 5%, the transmission distance drastically decreases from 87.96 km to 18.50 km. In comparison, the same mismatch for Alice reduces the distance to 86.83 km. This greater degradation on Bob's side can be attributed to the asymmetry in the data modification step. Furthermore, the mismatch in TM characteristics leads to a significant reduction in the secret key rate by 83% when the transmission distance is set to 15 km, which severely limits the practical usability of the protocol over specific distances. These results indicate that, in scenarios involving continuous-mode interference, such as large-scale MDI network setups, careful consideration of each user's TM characteristics is crucial. Rigorous precalibration of these modes is essential to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency.

TI Monogamy of nonconvex entanglement measures
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB One of the fundamental traits of quantum entanglement is the restricted shareability among multipartite quantum systems, namely monogamy of entanglement, while it is well known that monogamy inequalities are always satisfied by entanglement measures with convexity. Here we present a measure of entanglement, logarithmic convex-roof extended negativity (LCREN) satisfying important characteristics of an entanglement measure, and investigate the monogamy relation for logarithmic negativity and LCREN both without convexity. We show exactly that the alpha th power of logarithmic negativity, and a newly defined good measure of entanglement, LCREN, obey a class of general monogamy inequalities in multiqubit systems, 2 circle times 2 circle times 3 systems and 2 circle times 2 circle times 2(n) systems for alpha >= 4 ln 2. We provide a class of general polygamy inequalities of multiqubit systems in terms of logarithmic convex-roof extended negativity of assistance (LCRENoA) for 0 <= beta <= 2. Given that the logarithmic negativity and LCREN are not convex, these results are surprising. Using the power of the logarithmic negativity and LCREN, we further establish a class of tight monogamy inequalities of multiqubit systems, 2 circle times 2 circle times 3 systems and 2 circle times 2 circle times 2(n) systems in terms of the alpha th power of logarithmic negativity and LCREN for alpha >= 4 ln 2. We also show that the beta th power of LCRENoA obeys a class of tight polygamy inequalities of multiqubit systems for 0 <= beta <= 2.

TI Dynamical current correlations in Cooper pair splitters based on
   proximized quantum dots
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement of electrons is studied by means of current-current correlations in two Cooper pair splitter devices: with one and two proximized quantum dots (1QD and 2QD), in presence of intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, and weakly coupled with metallic electrodes. The 1QD system, where Cooper pairs can be transmitted to the same or split to different normal electrodes, is contrasted with the 2QD device, where double occupancy of a single quantum dot is forbidden and transport is only through an inter-dot singlet due to non-local crossed Andreev reflection processes deep in the superconducting energy gap. Separating the current correlation function into components for partial currents of electrons and holes through various Andreev bound states, one can see bunching and antibunching of split particles: inter-level components between electron and hole currents flowing to different electrodes are positive, while intra-level electron-electron or hole-hole components are negative, respectively. Spectral decomposition of the frequency-dependent current cross-correlation is performed to get better insight into mechanisms of entanglement and dynamics of split Cooper pairs, and to extract various charge fluctuation processes with different relaxation times, related to electron and hole currents flowing through the Andreev bound states. Only low frequency polarization fluctuations are seen in the current cross-correlations, while various negative and positive high frequency (charge fluctuations) components compensate each other in the symmetric system.

TI Securing Optical Networks Using Quantum-Secured Blockchain: An Overview
SO SENSORS
AB The deployment of optical network infrastructure and development of new network services are growing rapidly for beyond 5/6G networks. However, optical networks are vulnerable to several types of security threats, such as single-point failure, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Since the uptake of e-commerce and e-services has seen an unprecedented surge in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the security of these transactions is essential. Blockchain is one of the most promising solutions because of its decentralized and distributed ledger technology, and has been employed to protect these transactions against such attacks. However, the security of blockchain relies on the computational complexity of certain mathematical functions, and because of the evolution of quantum computers, its security may be breached in real-time in the near future. Therefore, researchers are focusing on combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain to enhance blockchain network security. This new technology is known as quantum-secured blockchain. This article describes different attacks in optical networks and provides a solution to protect networks against security attacks by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It provides a brief overview of blockchain technology with its security loopholes, and focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more robust against quantum attacks. Next, the article provides a broad view of quantum-secured blockchain technology. It presents the network architecture for the future research and development of secure and trusted optical networks using quantum-secured blockchain. The article also highlights some research challenges and opportunities.

TI A Lattice-Based Certificateless Traceable Ring Signature Scheme
SO INFORMATION
AB A ring signature (RS) scheme enables a group member to sign messages on behalf of its group without revealing the definite signer identify, but this also leads to the abuse of anonymity by malicious signers, which can be prevented by traceable ring signatures (TRS). Up until that point, traceable ring signatures have been secure based on the difficult problem of number-theoretic (discrete logarithms or RSA), but since the advent of quantum computers, traditional traceable ring signatures may no longer be secure. Thus Feng proposed a lattice based TRS, which are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. However, that works did not tackle the certificate management problem. To close this gap, a quantum-resistant certificateless TRS scheme was proposed in the study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lattice based certificateless TRS. In detail, a specific TRS scheme was combined with the lattice-based certificateless signature technology to solve the certificate management problem while avoid key escrow problem. Additionally, a better zero-knowledge protocol is used to improve the computational efficiency of the scheme, and by reducing the soundness error of the zero-knowledge protocol, the number of runs of the zero-knowledge protocol is reduced, so that the communication overhead of the scheme is reduced. Under random oracle model, the proposed scheme satisfies tag-linkability, anonymity, exculpability and is secure based on the SIS problem and the DLWE problem. In conclusion, the proposed scheme is more practical and promising in e-voting.

TI Sneaking up the ranks: Partial key exposure attacks on rank-based
   schemes
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB A partial key exposure attack is a key recovery attack where an adversary obtains a priori partial knowledge of the secret key, e.g., through side-channel leakage. While for a long time post-quantum cryptosystems, unlike RSA, have been believed to be resistant to such attacks, recent results by Esser, May, Verbel, and Wen (CRYPTO '22), and by Kirshanova and May (SCN '22), have refuted this belief. In this work, we focus on partial key exposure attacks in the context of rank-metric-based schemes, particularly targeting the RYDE, MIRA, and MiRitH digital signatures schemes, which are active candidates in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. We demonstrate that, similar to the RSA case, the secret key in RYDE can be recovered from a constant fraction of its bits. Specifically, for NIST category I parameters, our attacks remain efficient even when less than 25% of the key material is leaked. Interestingly, our attacks lead to a natural improvement of the best generic attack on RYDE without partial knowledge, reducing security levels by up to 9 bits. For MIRA and MiRitH our attacks remain efficient as long as roughly 57-60% of the secret key material is leaked. Additionally, we initiate the study of partial exposure of the witness in constructions following the popular MPCitH (MPC-in-the-Head) paradigm. We show a generic reduction from recovering RYDE and MIRA's witness to the MinRank problem, which again leads to efficient key recovery from constant fractions of the secret witness in both cases.

AB Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) can be used in client-server applications for mutual authentication and key establishment. In scenarios where client authentication is neither feasible nor desirable, One-Sided AKE (OS-AKE) allows both parties to establish a key while only the server authenticates to the client. Thus, OS-AKE provides client anonymity with respect to the server, but does not allow the server to enforce any form of access control-that is, the server simply establishes a key with any client.
   In this paper, we introduce Anonymous AKE (A-AKE) to strike a balance between classical client authentication of AKE and client anonymity of OS-AKE. In a nutshell A-AKE is an AKE protocol where (i) the server authenticates to the client, (ii) the server can enforce access control by deciding which clients are authorized to run the key-establishment protocol, (iii) a key is established between the server and the client only if the latter is one of the authorized clients as defined by the server, and (iv) the authorized client remains anonymous (within the set of all authorized clients) with respect to the server. We introduce a security model for A-AKE that extends popular AKE models and design a general framework for instantiating A-AKE protocols based on well-established cryptographic primitives. Finally, we instantiate several AKE protocols aiming at strong security guarantees in the classical and post-quantum settings. We implement a prototype of each instantiation and provide an experimental comparison of their performance.

AB We address three main open problems concerning the use of radical isogenies, as presented by Castryck, Decru and Vercauteren at Asiacrypt 2020, in the computation of long chains of isogenies of fixed, small degree between elliptic curves over finite fields. Firstly, we present an interpolation method for finding radical isogeny formulae in a given degree N, which by-passes the need for factoring division polynomials over large function fields. Using this method, we are able to push the range for which we have formulae at our disposal from N <= 13 to N <= 37 (where in the range 18 <= N <= 37 we have restricted our attention to prime powers). Secondly, using a combination of known techniques and ad-hoc manipulations, we derive optimized versions of these formulae for N <= 19, with some instances performing more than twice as fast as their counterparts from 2020. Thirdly, we solve the problem of understanding the correct choice of radical when walking along the surface between supersingular elliptic curves over F-p with p = 7 mod 8; this is non-trivial for even N and was settled for N = 2 and N = 4 only, in the latter case by Onuki and Moriya at PKC 2022. We give a conjectural statement for all even N and prove it for N <= 14. The speed-ups obtained from these techniques are substantial: using 16-isogenies, the computation of long chains of 2-isogenies over 512-bit prime fields can be accelerated by a factor 3, and the previous implementation of CSIDH using radical isogenies can be sped up by about 12%.

TI Magnetically disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice
   antiferromagnets Rb3Yb(VO4)2 and Cs3Yb(VO4)2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent a unique quantum disordered state of matter that hosts long-range quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. However, structural disorder resulting from site mixing between different types of ions usually arises in real QSL candidates, which is considered to be an obstacle to gaining insight into the intrinsic physics. Here, we have synthesized two new rare-earth compounds, Rb3Yb(VO4)2 and Cs3Yb(VO4)2. X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice structure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do not capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8 K. A fit to low-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with a CurieWeiss temperature of -1.40 and -0.43 K for Rb3Yb(VO4)2 and Cs3Yb(VO4)2, respectively. Specific-heat results show no sign of long-range magnetic order down to similar to 0.1 K either, but only a Schottky anomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields. Additionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy spin excitations in Rb3Yb(VO4)2. The absence of magnetic excitation signals as well as static magnetic order down to 97 mK aligns with the results from magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings point to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics, reminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for further exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system.

TI Efficient flexible characterization of quantum processors with nested

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a simple and powerful technique for finding a good error model for a quantum processor. The technique iteratively tests a nested sequence of models against data obtained from the processor, and keeps track of the best-fit model and its wildcard error (a metric of the amount of unmodeled error) at each step. Each best-fit model, along with a quantification of its unmodeled error, constitutes a characterization of the processor. We explain how quantum processor models can be compared with experimental data and to each other. We demonstrate the technique by using it to characterize a simulated noisy two-qubit processor.

Wavefront shaping reverses this scrambling, typically one spatial mode at a time-enabling deployment of MMFs as ultrathin microendoscopes. Here, we go beyond sequential wavefront shaping by showing how to simultaneously unscramble all spatial modes emerging from an MMF in parallel. We introduce a passive multiple-scattering element-crafted through the process of inverse design-that is complementary to an MMF and undoes its optical effects. This "optical inverter" makes possible single-shot widefield imaging and super-resolution imaging through MMFs. Our design consists of a cascade of diffractive elements, and can be understood from the perspective of both multi-plane light conversion, and as a physically inspired diffractive neural network. This physical architecture outperforms state-of-the-art electronic neural networks tasked with unscrambling light, as it preserves the phase and coherence information of optical signals flowing through it. We show, in numerical simulations, how to efficiently sort and tune the relative phase of up to similar to 400 step-index fibre modes, reforming incoherent images of scenes at arbitrary distances from the fibre facet. Our optical inverter can dynamically adapt to see through experimentally realistic flexible fibres-made possible by moulding optical memory effects into its design. The scheme is based on current fabrication technology so could be realised in the near future. Beyond imaging, these concepts open up a range of new avenues for optical multiplexing, communications, and computation in the realms of classical and quantum photonics.

TI Plasmonic metal nanostructures with extremely small features: new
   effects, fabrication and applications
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Surface plasmons in metals promise many fascinating properties and applications in optics, sensing, photonics and nonlinear fields. Plasmonic nanostructures with extremely small features especially demonstrate amazing new effects as the feature sizes scale down to the sub-nanometer scale, such as quantum size effects, quantum tunneling, spill-out of electrons and nonlocal states etc. The unusual physical, optical and photo-electronic properties observed in metallic structures with extreme feature sizes enable their unique applications in electromagnetic field focusing, spectra enhancing, imaging, quantum photonics, etc. In this review, we focus on the new effects, fabrication and applications of plasmonic metal nanostructures with extremely small features. For simplicity and consistency, we will focus our topic on the plasmonic metal nanostructures with feature sizes of sub-nanometers. Subsequently, we discussed four main and typical plasmonic metal nanostructures with extremely small features, including: (1) ultra-sharp plasmonic metal nanotips; (2) ultra-thin plasmonic metal films; (3) ultra-small plasmonic metal particles and (4) ultra-small plasmonic metal nanogaps. Additionally, the corresponding fascinating new effects (quantum nonlinear, non-locality, quantum size effect and quantum tunneling), applications (spectral enhancement, high-order harmonic wave generation, sensing and terahertz wave detection) and reliable fabrication methods will also be discussed. We end the discussion with a brief summary and outlook of the main challenges and possible breakthroughs in the field. We hope our discussion can inspire the broader design, fabrication and application of plasmonic metal nanostructures with extremely small feature sizes in the future.

TI Modifications of Tanabe-Sugano d6 Diagram Induced by Radical Ligand
   Field: Ab Initio Inspection of a Fe(II)-Verdazyl Molecular Complex
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum entanglement between the spin states of a metal center and radical ligands is suggested in an iron(II) [Fe(dipyvd)2]2+ compound (dipyvd = 1-isopropyl-3,5-dipyridil-6-oxoverdazyl). Wave function ab initio (Difference Dedicated Configuration Interaction, DDCI) inspections were carried out to stress the versatility of local spin states. We named this phenomenon excited state spinmerism, in reference to our previous work (see Roseiro et al., ChemPhysChem 2022, e202200478) where we introduced the concept of spinmerism as an extension of mesomerism to spin degrees of freedom. The construction of localized molecular orbitals allows for a reading of the wave functions and projections onto the local spin states. The low-energy spectrum is well-depicted by a Heisenberg picture. A 60 cm-1 ferromagnetic interaction is calculated between the radical ligands with the Stotal = 0 and 1 states largely dominated by a local low-spin SFe = 0. In contrast, the higher-lying Stotal = 2 states are superpositions of the local SFe = 1 (17%, 62%) and SFe = 2 (72%, 21%) spin states. Such mixing extends the traditional picture of a high-field d6 Tanabe-Sugano diagram. Even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the avoided crossing between different local spin states is triggered by the field generated by radical ligands. This puzzling scenario emerges from versatile local spin states in compounds which extend the traditional views in molecular magnetism.

TI Vortex lattices in binary Bose-Einstein condensates: collective modes,
   quantum fluctuations, and intercomponent entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We study binary Bose-Einstein condensates subject to synthetic magnetic fields in mutually parallel or antiparallel directions. Within the mean-field theory, the two types of fields have been shown to give the same vortex-lattice phase diagram. We develop an improved effective field theory to study properties of collective modes and ground-state intercomponent entanglement. Here, we point out the need to introduce renormalized coupling constants for coarse-grained densities. We show that the low-energy excitation spectra for the two types of fields are related to each other by suitable rescaling with the renormalized coupling constants. By calculating the entanglement entropy, we find that for an intercomponent repulsion (attraction), the two components are more strongly entangled in the case of parallel (antiparallel) fields, in qualitative agreement with recent studies for a quantum (spin) Hall regime. We also find that the entanglement spectrum exhibits an anomalous square-root dispersion relation, which leads to a subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy. All of these are confirmed by numerical calculations based on the Bogoliubov theory with the lowest-Landau-level approximation. Finally, we investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations on the phase diagrams by calculating the correction to the ground-state energy due to zero-point fluctuations in the Bogoliubov theory. We find that the boundaries between rhombic-, square-, and rectangular-lattice phases shift appreciably with a decrease in the filling factor.

TI Post-quantum AES encryption using ECC points derived from BB84 sifted
   keys
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Generating a secure key and securely communicating it are crucial aspects for ensuring information security during encryption and decryption processes. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technique for enabling secure communication in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. This paper presents an enhanced BB84 protocol integrated with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that improves efficiency, security, and practical implementation. Our enhanced BB84 protocol employs a basis reconciliation mechanism and introduces a depolarizing channel model to simulate realistic noise conditions and eavesdropping detections. The system effectively identifies potential eavesdroppers based on Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) thresholds, thereby ensuring a secure key exchange process. Unlike traditional ECC implementations, our approach dynamically extracts prime numbers from a sifted key to generate elliptic curve parameters. The extracted key is used for AES encryption, providing an additional security layer for data confidentiality. The performance evaluation demonstrates efficient key generation and computational time, making this approach practical for IIoT environments. The experimental results indicate successful key generation and privacy amplification with a final key derived from the matched measurement bases. Elliptic curve generation successfully computes valid points supporting secure cryptographic operations. The estimated QBER ranged from 0.0 to 0.25, ensuring a secure key exchange. The AES encryption and decryption processes validate the usability of the generated key in real-world applications, confirming the robustness of our integrated QKD-ECC framework. The average key generation time ranged from 0.0000297 s, while the computational time was 0.0000714 s.

TI Spin Noise Spectroscopy of a Single Spin Using Single Detected Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spin noise spectroscopy has become a widespread technique to extract information on spin dynamics in atomic and solid-state systems, in a potentially nonperturbative way. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new approach in spin noise spectroscopy, based on the detection of single photons. Because of the large spin-dependent polarization rotations provided by a deterministically coupled quantum dot-micropillar device, giant spin noise signals induced by a single-hole spin are extracted in the form of photon-photon cross-correlations. Ultimately, such a technique can be extended to an ultrafast regime probing mechanisms down to few tens of picoseconds.

TI Quantum mechanical modelling of phosphorus qubits in silicene under

AB A non-collinear density functional theory calculation of the electronic and magnetic structure of phosphorus-doped silicene was performed using atomic constrained magnetization. The antiferromagnetic state for the local magnetic moments of a pair of phosphorus atoms was found to be preferable both without and with constrained magnetization. A spatial change in the charge densities in the regions of substituting phosphorus atoms was shown. It was found that upon rotation from the |0 state to the |1 state, the charge density in the intermediate state changes asymmetrically relative to the bonds of the P atom with the neighbouring Si atoms.

TI Nonlocality Enhanced Precision in Quantum Polarimetry via Entangled
   Photons
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A nonlocal quantum approach is presented to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, the conditions are explored under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is calculated and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. The theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.
   A quantum polarimetry method using entangled photons to improve measurement precision is introduced. By calculating precision bounds and estimating the rotation angle of optical elements, both theoretically and experimentally, it is shown that the capability of entanglement to enhance accuracy is diminished with noise. Experimental noise induces bias in estimators, reducing accuracy and precision depending on chosen estimators and noise channels. image

AB We develop new techniques for proving lower bounds on the least singular value of random matrices with limited randomness. The matrices we consider have entries that are given by polynomials of a few underlying base random variables. This setting captures a core technical challenge for obtaining smoothed analysis guarantees in many algorithmic settings. Least singular value bounds often involve showing strong anti-concentration inequalities that are intricate and much less understood compared to concentration (or large deviation) bounds.
   First,we introduce a general technique for proving anti-concentration that uses well-conditionedness properties of the Jacobian of a polynomial map, and show how to combine this with a hierarchical Y-net argument to prove least singular value bounds. Our second tool is a new statement about least singular values to reason about higher-order lifts of smoothed matrices and the action of linear operators on them.
   Apart from getting simpler proofs of existing smoothed analysis results, we use these tools to now handle more general families of random matrices. This allows us to produce smoothed analysis guarantees in several previously open settings. These new settings include smoothed analysis guarantees for power sum decompositions and certifying robust entanglement of subspaces, where prior work could only establish least singular value bounds for fully random instances or only show non-robust genericity guarantees.

TI A Critical Review of Works Pertinent to the Einstein-Bohr Debate and
   Bell's Theorem
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB This review is related to the Einstein-Bohr debate and to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's (EPR) and Bohm's (EPRB) Gedanken-experiments as well as their realization in actual experiments. I examine a significant number of papers, from my minority point of view and conclude that the well-known theorems of Bell and Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) deal with mathematical abstractions that have only a tenuous relation to quantum theory and the actual EPRB experiments. It is also shown that, therefore, Bell-CHSH cannot be used to assess the nature of quantum entanglement, nor can physical features of entanglement be used to prove Bell-CHSH. Their proofs are, among other factors, based on a statistical sampling argument that is invalid for general physical entities and processes and only applicable for finite "populations"; not for elements of physical reality that are linked, for example, to a time-like continuum. Bell-CHSH have, furthermore, neglected the subtleties of the theorem of Vorob'ev that includes their theorems as special cases. Vorob'ev found that certain combinatorial-topological cyclicities of classical random variables form a necessary and sufficient condition for the constraints that are now known as Bell-CHSH inequalities. These constraints, however, must not be linked to the observables of quantum theory nor to the actual EPRB experiments for a variety of reasons, including the existence of continuum-related variables and appropriate considerations of symmetry.

TI Evolutionary origins of synchronization for integrating information in
   neurons
SO FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB The evolution of brain-expressed genes is notably slower than that of genes expressed in other tissues, a phenomenon likely due to high-level functional constraints. One such constraint might be the integration of information by neuron assemblies, enhancing environmental adaptability. This study explores the physiological mechanisms of information integration in neurons through three types of synchronization: chemical, electromagnetic, and quantum. Chemical synchronization involves the diffuse release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and acetylcholine, causing transmission delays of several milliseconds. Electromagnetic synchronization encompasses action potentials, electrical gap junctions, and ephaptic coupling. Electrical gap junctions enable rapid synchronization within cortical GABAergic networks, while ephaptic coupling allows structures like axon bundles to synchronize through extracellular electromagnetic fields, surpassing the speed of chemical processes. Quantum synchronization is hypothesized to involve ion coherence during ion channel passage and the entanglement of photons within the myelin sheath. Unlike the finite-time synchronization seen in chemical and electromagnetic processes, quantum entanglement provides instantaneous non-local coherence states. Neurons might have evolved from slower chemical diffusion to rapid temporal synchronization, with ion passage through gap junctions within cortical GABAergic networks potentially facilitating both fast gamma band synchronization and quantum coherence. This mini-review compiles literature on these three synchronization types, offering new insights into the physiological mechanisms that address the binding problem in neuron assemblies.

TI Entanglement in cosmology
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch -Davies vacuum. In order to focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation -dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Polar polyatomic molecules provide an ideal but largely unexplored platform to encode qubits in rotational states. Here, we trap cold (100-600 mK) formaldehyde (H2CO) inside an electric box and perform a Ramsey-type experiment to observe long-lived (similar to 100 mu s) coherences between symmetry-protected molecular states with opposite rotation but identical orientation, representing a quasi-hidden molecular degree of freedom. As a result, the observed qubit is insensitive to the magnitude of an external electric field and depends only weakly on magnetic fields. Our findings provide a basis for future quantum and precision experiments with trapped cold molecules.

TI Secure User Authentication With Information Theoretic Security Using
   Secret Sharing-Based Secure Computation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB When using an insecure communication channel, the initial step involves authenticating the user (verifying the other party) to ensure the legitimacy of the communication partner, followed by an encrypted communication. Public key encryption-based digital signatures are widely used for user authentication; however, with the development of quantum computers they are highly likely to be deciphered. Studies are also ongoing on post-quantum cryptography, although they require significant computational resources and are challenging to implement in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, this study suggests the implementation of user authentication and secure communication that guarantees information-theoretic security through the use of secure computation based on a computationally lightweight $(k,n)$ -threshold secret sharing scheme. In this study, a user authentication system is proposed with information-theoretical security that utilizes constantly changing information. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that secure communication with information-theoretic security can be achieved without the need to distribute a substantial number of true random numbers by employing secure computation based on $(k,n)$ -threshold secret sharing. The proposed methods are suitable for implementation in IoT environments because they require minimal processing overhead. The practical application of the proposed methods are also demonstrated through an implementation using C++. For example, the average execution time of the claimant was less than 0.1 [ms], proving that the proposed methods are very efficient.

TI In vitro Study on the Immunomodulatory and Antiinflammatory
   Effect of Soregen® Technology Water in Broiler and Layer Hens Peripheral
   Blood Mononuclear Cells
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an attractive tissue source in pharmacogenomics and molecular and immunologic studies. In order to investigate the changes in biological effects, water samples were exposed to a specific quantum entanglement signal from the SoRegen chip for 48 hours. This study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of SoRegen Technology in broiler and layer hens PBMCs. Methods: Six-week-old Arbor Acress broiler chickens and 66-week-old layer hens Lohmann were used for the establishment of an in vitro cell culture model with chicken PBMCs. Result: The result indicates that post-treated water media enhanced the proliferative properties of broiler and layer hens PBMCs. The mRNA and protein expression of immune-modulating and pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-2, IL-6, iNOS, IFN gamma, TNF alpha and NF kappa B exhibited a marked increase following stimulation of the cells by LPS and Con A when compared with the non-stimulated cells. However, stimulated cells grown in structured water media showed a strikingly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, except for the upregulation of IFN gamma expression in broiler PBMCs but not in layer hens PBMCs. It can be concluded that SoRegen (R) Technology water had anti-inflammatory activities with potential clinical immunomodulatory effects in younger chicks.

TI Generating Asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering between Two
   movable Mirrors Exploiting Correlated-Emission Laser
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum steering is a form of quantum correlation that exhibits an inherent asymmetry, distinguishing it from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is now understood that quantum steering plays a pivotal role in asymmetric quantum information tasks. In this work, a scheme is proposed to generate asymmetric steering between two mechanical modes by transferring quantum coherence from a correlated-emission laser. To accomplish this, quantum Langevin equations is derived to describe the optomechanical coupling between two cavity modes and two mechanical modes along with the master equation of two-mode laser. By examining the case where the cavity modes scatter at the anti-Stokes sidebands, it is demonstrated that both two-way and one-way steering can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the field driving the gain medium of the laser. Furthermore, it is showed that the direction of one-way steering can be controlled by varying the temperatures of the mechanical baths or the strengths of the optomechanical couplings. Additionally, it is revealed that the directionality of one-way steering depends on the modes fluctuation levels of the modes, with the mode exhibiting larger fluctuations determining the direction. This highly controllable scheme could potentially be realized with current technology, offering a promising platform for implementing one-way quantum information tasks.

TI Designing a two-stage acceleration lens for a 100 keV single-ion
   implantation system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB An array of color centers, each known as an NV center formed by a single-nitrogen atom and a vacancy, spaced at intervals of several tens of nanometers in a diamond exhibits quantum entanglement effects and indicates potential for quantum device applications. To fabricate such an array by implanting single-nitrogen ions into a diamond, a 100 keV single-ion implantation system (SIIS) has been developed by combining a linear Paul-trap laser-cooling ion source (LPTLC-IS) with a sympathetically cooled ion technique and a two-stage acceleration lens. So far, the LPTLC-IS and the two-stage acceleration lens have been refined as individual elemental technologies. However, for deterministic single-ion implantation, the SIIS must meet the following ion beam conditions: implantation with nanometer accuracy, a long working distance exceeding 100 mm to accommodate a quantum effect detector, and a penetration depth of approximately 100 nm in a diamond. These requirements necessitate the development of a two-stage acceleration lens capable of focusing the ion beam to a width of < 50 nm without a collimator when using a 100 keV ion beam. In this study, the two-stage acceleration lens, comprising 1st and 2nd acceleration lenses, was redesigned using numerical simulations to optimize lens parameters. Our primary redesign focus was the 2nd acceleration lens, which was redesigned based on the configuration of the previously developed lens. The resulting two-stage acceleration lens successfully met the target beam conditions for the SIIS.

TI Information Geometry, Jordan Algebras, and a Coadjoint Orbit-Like
   Construction
SO SYMMETRY INTEGRABILITY AND GEOMETRY-METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Jordan algebras arise naturally in (quantum) information geometry, and we want to understand their role and their structure within that framework. Inspired by Kirillov's discussion of the symplectic structure on coadjoint orbits, we provide a similar construction in the case of real Jordan algebras. Given a real, finite-dimensional, formally real Jordan algebra J, we exploit the generalized distribution determined by the Jordan product on the dual J(star) to induce a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor on the leaves of the distribution. In particular, these leaves are the orbits of a Lie group, which is the structure group of J, in clear analogy with what happens for coadjoint orbits. However, this time in contrast with the Lie-algebraic case, we prove that not all points in J* lie on a leaf of the canonical Jordan distribution. When the leaves are contained in the cone of positive linear functionals on J, the pseudo-Riemannian structure becomes Riemannian and, for appropriate choices of J, it coincides with the Fisher-Rao metric on non-normalized probability distributions on a finite sample space, or with the Bures-Helstrom metric for non-normalized, faithful quantum states of a finite-level quantum system, thus showing a direct link between the mathematics of Jordan algebras and both classical and quantum information geometry.

TI Mach-Zehnder-like interferometry with graphene nanoribbon networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We study theoretically electron interference in a Mach-Zehnder-like geometry formed by four zigzag graphene nanoribbons arranged in parallel pairs, one on top of the other, such that they form intersection angles of 60(circle). Depending on the interribbon separation, each intersection can be tuned to act either as an electron beam splitter or as a mirror, enabling tuneable circuitry with interfering pathways. Based on the mean-field Hubbard model and Green's function techniques, we evaluate the electron transport properties of such eight-terminal devices and identify pairs of terminals that are subject to self-interference. We further show that the scattering matrix formalism in the approximation of independent scattering at the four individual junctions provides accurate results as compared with the Green's function description, allowing for a simple interpretation of the interference process between two dominant pathways. This enables us to characterize the device sensitivity to phase shifts from an external magnetic flux according to the Aharonov-Bohm effect as well as from small geometric variations in the two path lengths. The proposed devices could find applications as magnetic field sensors and as detectors of phase shifts induced by local scatterers on the different segments, such as adsorbates, impurities or defects. The setup could also be used to create and study quantum entanglement.

TI Non-Classical Rules in Quantum Games
SO ENTROPY
AB Over the last twenty years, quantum game theory has given us many ideas of how quantum games could be played. One of the most prominent ideas in the field is a model of quantum playing bimatrix games introduced by J. Eisert, M. Wilkens and M. Lewenstein. The scheme assumes that players' strategies are unitary operations and the players act on the maximally entangled two-qubit state. The quantum nature of the scheme has been under discussion since the article by Eisert et al. came out. The aim of our paper was to identify some of non-classical features of the quantum scheme.

TI Simultaneous measurement of multiple incompatible observables and
   tradeoff in multiparameter quantum estimation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB How well can multiple incompatible observables be implemented by a single measurement? This is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics with wide implications for the performance optimization of numerous tasks in quantum information science. While existing studies have been mostly focusing on the approximation of two observables with a single measurement, in practice multiple observables are often encountered, for which the errors of the approximations are little understood. Here we provide a framework to study the implementation of an arbitrary finite number of observables with a single measurement. Our methodology yields novel analytical bounds on the errors of these implementations, significantly advancing our understanding of this fundamental problem. Additionally, we introduce a more stringent bound utilizing semi-definite programming that, in the context of two observables, generates an analytical bound tighter than previously known bounds. The derived bounds have direct applications in assessing the trade-off between the precision of estimating multiple parameters in quantum metrology, an area with crucial theoretical and practical implications. To validate the validity of our findings, we conducted experimental verification using a superconducting quantum processor. This experimental validation not only confirms the theoretical results but also effectively bridges the gap between the derived bounds and empirical data obtained from real-world experiments. Our work paves the way for optimizing various tasks in quantum information science that involve multiple noncommutative observables.

TI Asymptotic reversibility of thermal operations for interacting quantum
   spin systems via generalized quantum Stein's lemma
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB For quantum spin systems in any spatial dimension with a local, translation-invariant Hamiltonian, we prove that asymptotic state convertibility from a quantum state to another one by a thermodynamically feasible class of quantum dynamics, called thermal operations, is completely characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate, if the state is translation-invariant and spatially ergodic. Our proof consists of two parts and is phrased in terms of a branch of the quantum information theory called the resource theory. First, we prove that any states, for which the min and max Renyi divergences collapse approximately to a single value, can be approximately reversibly converted into one another by thermal operations with the aid of a small source of quantum coherence. Second, we prove that these divergences collapse asymptotically to the KL divergence rate for any translation-invariant ergodic state. We show this via a generalization of the quantum Stein's lemma for quantum hypothesis testing beyond independent and identically distributed situations. Our result implies that the KL divergence rate serves as a thermodynamic potential that provides a complete characterization of thermodynamic convertibility of ergodic states of quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, including out-of-equilibrium and fully quantum situations.

   Repulsively Bound Pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We observe and study a special ground state of bosons with two spin states in an optical lattice: the spinMott insulator, a state that consists of repulsively bound pairs that is insulating for both spin and charge transport. Because of the pairing gap created by the interaction anisotropy, it can be prepared with low entropy and can serve as a starting point for adiabatic state preparation. We find that the stability of the spinMott state depends on the pairing energy, and observe two qualitatively different decay regimes, one of which exhibits protection by the gap.

TI Experimental realization of multimode nonlinear parametric amplification
   from cascading four-wave mixing of dressed atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The nonlinear parametric process is of great significance for achieving high-quality coherent optical signals and quantum correlated photons. With the development of classical and quantum information processing, the study of the properties of parametric processes is evolving in complex scenarios of multimode, which is limited in conventional nonlinear media due to strict phase matching, e.g. nonlinear crystals. Here we study the dressing-energy-level-cascaded four-wave mixing process to generate multimode optical parametric signals. Via cascading double-Lambda type configuration of 85Rb D1 line, the non-degenerate energy-level-cascaded FWM is constructed to generate multimode self-parametric amplification. Moreover, with the dressing effects based on atomic coherence, the spatial and frequency multimode characteristics of energy-level-cascaded FWM parametric amplification, i.e., the modes number and pattern, are actively modulated by the pump fields detuning. Also, the spatial modes from the coupling of two coexisting spontaneous parametric FWMs can be controlled to reach tremendous scalability via the atomic coherence and Kerr non-linearity. The atomic coherence effects and unique phase-matching symmetry nature allow flexible modulation of the multimode property of the generated parametric signals within a nonlinear device, which paves a way for multimode classical and quantum information processing.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI On the Coexistence of Quantum and Classical Signal Transmission Over
   Turbulent FSO Channels
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Secure data transmission is essential in today's world, and quantum key distribution (QKD) is widely recognized as the technology of choice to enable information-theoretical secure symmetric key generation. While optical fibers are typically used as a transmission channel, wireless transmission offers the flexibility to reach every part of the Earth; moreover, for Earth-Satellite QKD, wireless communication naturally becomes a necessity. In this study, we deployed a fiber-wireless optical system that transmitted a 64-QAM 400 Gbps classical signal for high-rate data exchange and a 1 MHz quantum signal for QKD. The impact of turbulence in the quantum system is evaluated by transmitting single-polarization quantum states through a turbulent free-space channel and by calculating the respective intrinsic quantum bit error rate (QBER). From this, we estimate the system's secret key rate (SKR) and its dependence on turbulence. The effects of atmospheric turbulence on the optical wireless signal were emulated and investigated by using a custom-made atmospheric chamber to induce different turbulent scenarios. The atmospheric chamber allowed us to vary the turbulence in a Rytov variance range from 0.06 to 2.52. The classical signal showed an overall average reliability of 82% for the mentioned turbulence regimes. The results of the quantum signal showed that for Rytov variances up to 1.3, and under the conditions tested, secret key generation is possible, reaching a maximum SKR of 8.7 x 10( - 4) bits per pulse during the produced turbulence regimes.

TI Optical RISs Improve the Secret Key Rate of Free-Space QKD in HAP-to-UAV
   Scenarios
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Consequently, the information-theoretic bound of the secret key rate and the security performance of a decoy-state QKD protocol are analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles or moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.

TI Evaluation of single silicon vacancy centers in nanodiamonds created by
   ion implantation at cryogenic temperatures
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Silicon vacancy (SiV) centers in diamonds have attracted much attention because of their stability and narrow emission linewidth, and are promising for applications in quantum information technology. SiV-center-encapsulated nanodiamonds have also attracted much attention because of their potential to be coupled to various photonic devices. One efficient way to fabricate nanodiamonds that contain SiV centers is Si ion implantation into nanodiamonds. However, the evaluation of a single SiV center in a nanodiamond produced by this method at low temperatures has not been performed. In this study, we report on the optical properties of a single SiV center in a nanodiamond produced by ion implantation at cryogenic temperatures. The emission spectrum from a single SiV center ( g2(0)=0.19) was observed with four distinct fine splittings of the zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 4 K. At an excitation power of 50 mu W, the full width at half maximum of the ZPL reached the spectrometer resolution limit (0.09 nm). The temperature dependence of the emission peak is consistent with that of the emission coming from an SiV center under high strain. The results obtained in this work suggest that nanodiamonds containing single SiV centers formed using this method will be an important building block for the realization of quantum information applications.

TI Exploring Two-Exciton Steerability and Nonlocality Dynamics in Two Open
   Microcavities Coupled by an Optical Fiber
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This work will explore the generations of quantum nonlocalities (as entanglement, Bellnonlocality, and steerability) for two quantum wells (excitons) in dissipative microcavities containing a linear optical medium. An optical fiber links the microcavities. The generated two-exciton nonlocalities are explored by using Bell inequality, steering inequality, and entanglement of formation. For initial correlated and uncorrelated states, the ability of the excitation-photon-fiber interactions to produce new generation and robustness of the two-exciton nonlocality is investigated under the effects of the couplings of the exciton-photon and fiber-photon interactions as well as of the dissipations and the optical susceptibility. It is found that increasing the optical susceptibility enhances the regularity and amplitudes, reduces the frequencies of two-exciton nonlocality dynamics, and supports dissipation degradations. For the initial uncorrelated state, decreasing the difference between the exciton-photon and fiber-photon couplings enhances the generations of the nonlocalities. For the initial correlated state, increasing the exciton-photon and fiber-photon couplings enhances the nonlocality conservation. For open microcavites, increasing the exciton-photon and fiber-photon couplings and the difference between them supports the nonlocality degradations resulting from the external environment dissipations.
   The physical model describes two quantum wells (excitons) in dissipative microcavities containing a linear optical medium, and linking by an optical fiber. The generations of quantum nonlocalities for two excitons will be explored. Finally, the findings are summarized on the generation and robustness of the two-exciton nonlocality. image

TI Robust Semi-Quantum Summation over a Collective-Dephasing Noise Channel
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum summation is one of the various applications in secure multi-party computation. However, most of the existing quantum summation protocols assume that the participants possess all the quantum devices. Considering future applications, the capability of the participants must be adjusted before it can be put into practical use. Although Boyer et al. proposed that the semi-quantum environment could be used to solve this problem; another practical problem is the interference by noise. In 2022, Ye et al. proposed a two-party semi-quantum summation (SQS) protocol resistant to the interference of collective noise, in which two classical participants can accomplish the summation of their private binary sequences with the assistance of a quantum semi-honest third party. They proved that their SQS protocol is resistant to various eavesdropping attacks. This paper unveils two risks of information leakage in Ye et al.'s SQS protocol. If the aforementioned security issues are not resolved, Ye et al.'s SQS protocol may not be able to perform private quantum computations securely. Fortunately, the SQS protocol against the collective-dephasing noise proposed in this study is free from the issue of information leakage as well as resistant to various quantum attacks. In addition, the quantum efficiency of the SQS protocol proposed in this study is four times higher than that of Ye et al.'s SQS protocol, which can effectively improve the quantum utilization rate.

AB Solving the electronic structure for multi-electronic systems is a hard problem. Even for small atoms and molecules, approximations have to be made in order to solve numerically the Schrodinger equation. Although different methods have been developed to take into account electron correlations, their computational cost reduces their feasibility. Quantum simulation provides an alternative to traditional computational methods for enquiring the electronic structure of molecules. Specifically, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm provides a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the implementation on current near term quantum devices. In this work, we explore the implementation of VQE on Qiskit for calculating the ground-state energy of diatomic Hydrogen molecule.

TI Internal quantum reference frames for finite Abelian groups
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Employing internal quantum systems as reference frames is a crucial concept in quantum gravity, gauge theories, and quantum foundations whenever external relata are unavailable. In this work, we give a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of such quantum reference frames (QRFs) for the case when the underlying configuration space is a finite Abelian group, significantly extending our previous work [M. Krumm, P. A. Hohn, and M. P. Muller, Quantum 5, 530 (2021)]. The simplicity of this setup admits a fully rigorous quantum information-theoretic analysis, while maintaining sufficient structure for exploring many of the conceptual and structural questions also pertinent to more complicated setups. We exploit this to derive several important structures of constraint quantization with quantum information-theoretic methods and to reveal the relation between different approaches to QRF covariance. In particular, we characterize the "physical Hilbert space "-the arena of the "perspective-neutral " approach-as the maximal subspace that admits frame-independent descriptions of purifications of states. We then demonstrate the kinematical equivalence and, surprising, dynamical inequivalence of the "perspective-neutral " and the "alignability " approach to QRFs. While the former admits unitaries generating transitions between arbitrary subsystem relations, the latter, remarkably, admits no such dynamics when requiring symmetry-preservation. We illustrate these findings by example of interacting discrete particles, including how dynamics can be described "relative to one of the subystems.

TI Secret and shared keys recovery on hamming quasi-cyclic with SASCA
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Soft Analytical Side Channel Attacks (SASCA) are a powerful family of Side Channel Attacks (SCA) that allows the recovery of secret values with only a small number of traces. Their effectiveness lies in the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which enables efficient computation of the marginal distributions of intermediate values. Post-quantum schemes such as Kyber, and more recently, Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC), have been targets of SASCA. Previous SASCA on HQC focused on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and successfully retrieved the shared key with a high success rate for high noise levels using a single trace. In this work, we present new SASCA on HQC, where both the shared key and the secret key are targeted. Our attacks are realized on simulations. Unlike the previous SASCA, we take a closer look at the Reed-Muller (RM) code. The advantage of this choice is that the RM decoder is applied before the RS decoder, enabling attacks targeting both the secret key and shared key. We build a factor graph of the Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) function from the HQC reference implementation of April 2023. The information recovered from BP allows us to retrieve the shared key with a single trace. In addition to the previous SASCA targeting HQC, we also manage to recover the secret key with two different chosen ciphertext attacks. One of them requires a single trace and is successful until high noise levels.

TI Neutral Silicon-Vacancy Centers in Diamond via Photoactivated Itinerant
   Carriers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Neutral silicon-vacancy (Si-V0) centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum network applications because of their exceptional optical properties and spin coherence. However, the stabilization of Si-V0 centers requires careful Fermi-level engineering of the diamond host material, making further technological development challenging. Here, we show that Si-V0 centers can be efficiently stabilized by photoactivated itinerant carriers. Even in this nonequilibrium configuration, the resulting Si-V0 centers are stable enough to allow for resonant optical excitation and optically detected magnetic resonance. Our results pave the way for on-demand generation of Si-V0 centers as well as other emerging quantum defects in diamond.

TI Information-theoretic measures and Compton profile of H atom under
   finite oscillator potential
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Information-theoretic measures for nl (2L) states of a H atom (with n=1-10 and l=0-2 , where n and l denote principal and angular momentum quantum numbers) have been investigated within a quantum dot by utilizing the Ritz variational principle, with the help of a Slater-type basis set. A well-established two-parameter (depth and width) model of finite oscillator potential is used to simulate the dot environment. The variationally optimized position (r)-space wave function is utilized to determine the momentum (p)-space wave function, leading to the generation of p-space radial density distribution. We explore the impact of cavity parameters on quantum information theoretic measures, such as Shannon (S) and Fisher information (I) entropy, in the ground as well as the excited state. The results of S were also used to test the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality, related to the entropic uncertainty principle for the confined H atom. Some simple new fitting laws pertaining to S and I have been proposed. Furthermore, the p-space radial density is employed to derive the Compton profile of the confined H atom. Possible tunability of S,I and Compton profiles with respect to the parameters is noted.

TI All-in-Fiber Dynamically Reconfigurable Orbital Angular Momentum Mode
   Sorting
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) spatial degree of freedom of light has been widely explored in many applications, including telecommunications, quantum information, and light-based micromanipulation. The ability to separate and distinguish between the different transverse spatial modes is called mode sorting or mode demultiplexing, and it is essential to recover the encoded information in such applications. An ideal d mode sorter should be able to faithfully distinguish between the different d spatial modes, with minimal losses, and have d outputs and fast response times. All previous mode sorters rely on bulk optical elements, such as spatial light modulators, which cannot be quickly tuned and have additional losses if they are to be integrated with optical fiber systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first all-in-fiber method for OAM mode sorting with ultrafast dynamic reconfigurability. Our scheme first decomposes the OAM mode in-fiber-optical linearly polarized (LP) modes and then interferometrically recombines them to determine the topological charge, thus correctly sorting the OAM mode. In addition, our setup can also be used to perform ultrafast routing of the OAM modes. These results show a novel and fiber-integrated form of optical spatial mode sorting that can be readily used for many new applications in classical and quantum information processing.

TI Improved Mechanical, Anti-UV Irradiation, and Imparted Luminescence
   Properties of Cyanate Ester Resin/Unzipped Multiwalled Carbon
   Nanotubes/Europium Nanocomposites
SO MATERIALS
AB Cyanate ester resin (CER) is an excellent thermal stable polymer. However, its mechanical properties are not appropriate for its application, with brittle weakness, and it has poor functional properties, such as luminescence. This work innovatively combines the luminescence property and the improved mechanical properties with the inherent thermal property of cyanate ester. A novel nanocomposite, CER/uMWCNTs/Eu, with multi-functional properties, has been prepared. The results show that with the addition of 0.1 wt.% of uMWCNTs to the resin, the flexural strength and tensile strength increased 59.3% and 49.3%, respectively. As the curing process of the CER progresses, the injected luminescence signal becomes luminescence behind the visible (FBV). The luminescence intensity of CER/uMWCNTs/Eu was much stronger than that of CER/MWCNTs/Eu, and the luminescence lifetime of CER/MWCNTs/Eu and CER/uMWCNTs/Eu was 8.61 mu s and 186.39 mu s, respectively. FBV exhibited great potential in the embedment of photon quantum information. Therefore, it can be predicted that CER/uMWCNTs/Eu composites will not only have a wide range of applications in sensing, detection, and other aspects, but will also exhibit great potential in the embedding of photon quantum information.

TI Reentrance of the Disordered Phase in the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model

SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Motivated by recent experiments with Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array, we accurately map out the groundstate phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a square lattice with longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields using the quantum Monte Carlo method. For a small but nonzero transverse field, the transition longitudinal field is found to remain nearly constant. By scrutinizing the phase diagram, we uncover a narrow region where the system exhibits reentrant transitions between the disordered and antiferromagnetic phases with increasing transverse field. Our phase diagram provides a useful benchmark for quantum simulation of a Rydberg atom system.

AB The entanglement in multipartite quantum system is hard to characterize and quantify, although it has been intensively studied in bipartite systems. The monogamy of entanglement, as a special property of multipartite systems, shows the distribution of entanglement in the system. In this paper, we investigate the monogamy relations for multi-qubit systems. By using two entangled measures, namely the concurrence C and the negativity Nc, we establish tighter monogamy inequalities for their alpha-th power than those in all the existing ones. We also illustrate the tightness of our results for some classes of quantum states.

TI Generation and Detection of Optical Vortices with Multiple Cascaded
   Spiral Phase Plates
SO PHOTONICS
AB Spiral phase plate (SPP) is the widely used method in the generation of vortex beam (VB) with fixed topological charges (TCs) for specific wavelength. Although VB with large TCs can be directly generated by using the SPP with high vortex order. The fabrication of high-quality SPPs with high vortex orders usually requires complex manufacturing process and high machining accuracy. An alternative method to generate VBs with large TCs is cascaded multiple SPPs with low order. In this study, we numerically calculate the transmitted light field of cascaded multiple SPPs according to the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral, and perform the experimental verifications. Based on cascading 6 SPPs (3 SPPs with TCs of 2, and 3 SPPs with TCs 4, respectively), an VB with TCs as high as 18 is generated. Furthermore, The TCs of the generated VB are detected by coaxial and off-axis interfering with fundamental Gaussian beam or its conjugate beam, respectively. The generated fork and spiral patterns allow us to distinguish the value and sign of TCs carried by the VB. The experimental results coincide well with the theoretical simulations. The fork pattern shows better resolution than the spiral one, and the petal pattern with small spiral allows us to distinguish large TCs with a higher resolution.

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We report on the design and characterization of a cold atom source for strontium (Sr) based on a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) that is directly loaded from the atom jet of a dispenser. We characterize the atom flux of the source by measuring the loading rate of a three-dimensional MOT. We find loading rates of up to 10(8) atoms per second. The setup is compact, easy to construct, and has low power consumption. It addresses the longstanding challenge of reducing the complexity of cold beam sources for Sr, which is relevant for optical atomic clocks, quantum simulation, and computing devices based on ultracold Sr.

TI Deep Learning-Based Min-Entropy-Accelerated Evaluation for High-Speed
   Quantum Random Number Generation
SO ENTROPY
AB Secure communication is critically dependent on high-speed and high-security quantum random number generation (QRNG). In this work, we present a responsive approach to enhance the efficiency and security of QRNG by leveraging polarization-controlled heterodyne detection to simultaneously measure the quadrature amplitude and phase fluctuations of vacuum shot noise. To address the practical non-idealities inherent in QRNG systems, we investigate the critical impacts of imbalanced heterodyne detection, amplitude-phase overlap, finite-size effects, and security parameters on quantum conditional min-entropy derived from the entropy uncertainty principle. It effectively mitigates the overestimation of randomness and fortifies the system against potential eavesdropping attacks. For a high-security parameter of 10-20, QRNG achieves a true random bit extraction ratio of 83.16% with a corresponding real-time speed of 37.25 Gbps following a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter quantization and 1.4 GHz bandwidth extraction. Furthermore, we develop a deep convolutional neural network for rapid and accurate entropy evaluation. The entropy evaluation of 13,473 sets of quadrature data is processed in 68.89 s with a mean absolute percentage error of 0.004, achieving an acceleration of two orders of magnitude in evaluation speed. Extracting the shot noise with full detection bandwidth, the generation rate of QRNG using dual-quadrature heterodyne detection exceeds 85 Gbps. The research contributes to advancing the practical deployment of QRNG and expediting rapid entropy assessment.

They generalize the familiar Gibbs thermal states, which are the sole passive states being stable under tensor product. Here, we introduce a partial order on the set of passive states that captures the idea of a passive state being virtually cooler than another one. This partial order, which we build by defining the notion of relative passivity, offers a fine-grained comparison between passive states based on virtual temperatures (just like thermal states are compared based on their temperatures). We then characterize the quantum operations that are closed on the set of virtually cooler states with respect to some fixed input and output passive states. Viewing the activity, i.e., nonpassivity, of a state as a resource, our main result is then a necessary and sufficient condition on the transformation of a class of pure active states under these relative passivity-preserving operations. This condition gives a quantum thermodynamical meaning to the majorization relation on the set of nonincreasing vectors due to Hoffman. The maximum extractable work under relative passivity-preserving operations is then shown to be equal to the ergotropy of these pure active states. Finally, we are able to fully characterize passivity-preserving operations in the simpler case of qubit systems, and hence to derive a state interconversion condition under passivity-preserving qubit operations. The prospect of this work is a general resource-theoretical framework for the extractable work via quantum operations going beyond thermal operations.

TI Post-Quantum Secure Handover Mechanism for Next-Generation Aviation
   Communication Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB The L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) is a key advancement for next-generation aviation networks, enhancing Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) capabilities. It operates with VHF Datalink mode 2 (VDLm2) and features a seamless handover mechanism to maintain uninterrupted communication between aircraft and ground stations (GSs), improving safety and efficiency in air traffic management (ATM). However, LDACS' handover process encounters significant security risks due to inadequate authentication and key agreement between aircraft and ground station controllers (GSCs) during handovers. This vulnerability threatens communications' confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, posing risks to flight safety and sensitive data. Therefore, developing and implementing a robust security framework to protect aviation communications is essential. In response, we have proposed a security solution specifically designed to protect LDACS handovers. Our solution uses a mutual authentication and key agreement mechanism tailored for LDACS handovers, ensuring robust security for all types of handovers, including Intra GSC - Intra Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN), Inter GSC - Intra ATN, and Inter GSC - Inter ATN. Our approach utilizes post-quantum cryptography to protect aviation communication systems against potential post-quantum threats, such as unauthorized access to flight data, interception of communication, and spoofing of aircraft identity. Furthermore, our proposed solution has undergone a thorough informal security analysis to ensure its effectiveness in addressing handover challenges and offering robust protection against various threats. It seamlessly integrates with the LDACS framework, delivering low Bit Error Rate (BER) and latency levels, making it a highly reliable approach in practice.

TI Rotational-state dependence of interactions between polar molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational-state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.

TI A fiber-pigtailed quantum dot device generating indistinguishable
   photons at GHz clock-rates
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Solid-state quantum light sources based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are increasingly employed in photonic quantum information applications. Especially when moving towards real-world scenarios outside shielded lab environments, the efficient and robust coupling of nanophotonic devices to single-mode optical fibers offers substantial advantage by enabling "plug-and-play" operation. In this work we present a fiber-pigtailed cavity-enhanced source of flying qubits emitting single indistinguishable photons at clock-rates exceeding 1 GHz. This is achieved by employing a fully deterministic technique for fiber-pigtailing optimized QD-devices based on hybrid circular Bragg grating (hCBG) micro-cavities. The fabricated fiber-pigtailed hCBGs feature emission lifetimes of <80 ps, corresponding to a Purcell factor of similar to 9, a suppression of multi-photon emission events with g((2))(0) < 1 %, a photon-indistinguishability >80 % and a measured single-photon coupling efficiency of 53 % in a high numerical aperture single-mode fiber, corresponding to 1.2 Megaclicks per second at the single-photon detectors under 80 MHz excitation clock-rates. Furthermore, we show that high multi-photon suppression and indistinguishability prevail for excitation clock-rates exceeding 1 GHz. Our results show that Purcell-enhanced fiber-pigtailed quantum light sources based on hCBG cavities are a prime candidate for applications of quantum information science.

TI Position-Controlled Functionalization of Vacancies in Silicon by
   Single-Ion Implanted Germanium Atoms
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Special point defects in semiconductors have been envisioned as suitable components for quantum-information technology. The identification of new deep centers in silicon that can be easily activated and controlled is a main target of the research in the field. Vacancy-related complexes are suitable to provide deep electronic levels but they are hard to control spatially. With the spirit of investigating solid state devices with intentional vacancy-related defects at controlled position, the functionalization of silicon vacancies is reported on here by implanting Ge atoms through single-ion implantation, producing Ge-vacancy (GeV) complexes. The quantum transport through an array of GeV complexes in a silicon-based transistor is investigated. By exploiting a model based on an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian derived from ab initio results, anomalous activation energy values of the thermally activated conductance of both quasi-localized and delocalized many-body states are obtained, compared to conventional dopants. Such states are identified, forming the upper Hubbard band, as responsible for the experimental sub-threshold transport across the transistor. The combination of the model with the single-ion implantation method enables future research for the engineering of GeV complexes toward the creation of spatially controllable individual defects in silicon for applications in quantum information technology.

TI Linear quantum systems: A tutorial
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
AB The purpose of this tutorial is to give a brief introduction to linear quantum control systems. The mathematical model of linear quantum control systems is presented first, then some fundamental control-theoretic notions such as stability, controllability and observability are given, which are closely related to several important concepts in quantum information science such as decoherence-free subsystems, quantum non-demolition variables, and back-action evasion measurements. After that, quantum Gaussian states are introduced, in particular, an information-theoretic uncertainty relation is presented which often gives a better bound for mixed Gaussian states than the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The quantum Kalman filter is presented for quantum linear systems, which is the quantum analogy of the Kalman filter for classical (namely, non-quantum-mechanical) linear systems. The quantum Kalman canonical decomposition for quantum linear systems is recorded, and its application is illustrated by means of a recent experiment. As single-and multi -photon states are useful resources in quantum information technology, the response of quantum linear systems to these types of input is presented. Finally, coherent feedback control of quantum linear systems is briefly introduced, and a recent experiment is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of quantum linear systems and networks theory.

TI Single-photon-triggered spin squeezing with decoherence reduction in
   optomechanics via phase matching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum spin squeezing is an important resource for quantum information processing, but its squeezing degree is not easy to preserve in an open system with decoherence. Here, we propose a scheme to implement single-photon-triggered spin squeezing with decoherence reduction in an open system. In our system, a Dicke model (DM) with an added quadratic optomechanical coupling is considered, which can be equivalent to an effective DM manipulated by the photon number. Besides, the phonon mode of the optomechanical coupling is coupled to a squeezed-vacuum reservoir with a phase matching, resulting in that its thermal noise can be suppressed completely. We show that squeezing of the phonon mode triggered by a single photon can be transferred to the spin ensemble totally, and pairwise entanglement of the spin ensemble can be realized if and only if there is spin squeezing. Importantly, when considering the impact of the environment, our system can obtain a squeezing degree better than that of the optimal squeezing that can be achieved in the traditional DM. Meanwhile, the spin squeezing generated in our system is immune to the thermal noise. This work offers an effective way to generate spin squeezing with a single photon and to reduce decoherence in an open system, which will have promising applications in quantum information processing.

TI An AI-Driven Cybersecurity Framework for IoT: Integrating LSTM-Based
   Anomaly Detection, Reinforcement Learning, and Post-Quantum Encryption
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity threats have grown in frequency, complexity, and scale, challenging the adequacy of traditional rule-based defense systems. This study proposes a unified AI-driven cybersecurity framework to detect anomalies, verify data integrity, automate incident response, and ensure long-term cryptographic resilience. The framework integrates four core components: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal anomaly detection, homomorphic hashing using SHA-256 with hidden salts for real-time data integrity verification, Q-learning-based reinforcement learning for automated threat response, and lattice-based encryption grounded in the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to safeguard against quantum-era attacks. The system was evaluated in a simulated IoT network environment, where it demonstrated high accuracy in identifying anomalies, effectively distinguishing between original and tampered data, and adaptively responding to different levels of cyber threats. The integration of these components allows the framework to operate autonomously and contextually, improving scalability and responsiveness in resource-constrained digital infrastructures. This study concludes that the proposed framework addresses key limitations of existing methods by offering a scalable, adaptive, and future-proof cybersecurity solution. The results support its potential for deployment in real-world settings such as smart cities, healthcare systems, and critical infrastructure, with future work aimed at improving real-time adaptability and validating performance in live, heterogeneous environments.

TI Parametrized Hamiltonian simulation using quantum optimal control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Analog quantum simulation offers a hardware-specific approach to studying quantum dynamics, but mapping a model Hamiltonian onto the available device parameters requires matching the hardware dynamics. We introduce a paradigm for quantum Hamiltonian simulation that leverages digital decomposition techniques and optimal control to perform analog simulation. We validate this approach by constructing the optimal analog controls for a superconducting transmon device to emulate the dynamics of an extended Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate the role of control time, digital error, and pulse complexity, and we explore the accuracy and robustness of these controls. We conclude by discussing the opportunity for implementing this paradigm in near-term quantum devices.

TI Monogamy-of-entanglement-inspired protocol for quantifying bipartite
   entanglement using spin squeezing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum science and technology. However, entanglement detection and quantification, via typical entanglement measures such as linear entanglement entropy or negativity, can be a very challenging task. Here we propose a protocol to detect bipartite entanglement in a system of N qubits inspired by the concept of monogamy of entanglement, where, given a total system in a pure state with some bipartite entanglement between two subsystems, subsequent unitary evolution and measurement of one of the subsystems may be used to quantify the entanglement between the two. To address the difficulty of detection, we propose to use spin squeezing to quantify the entanglement within the individual subsystem. Knowing that the relation between spin squeezing and some entanglement measures is not one-to-one, we give some suggestions on how a judicious choice of squeezing Hamiltonian can lead to better results in our protocol. For systems with a small number of qubits, we derive analytical results and show how our protocol can work optimally for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. For larger systems, we show how the accuracy of the protocol can be improved by a proper choice of the squeezing Hamiltonian. Our protocol presents an alternative for entanglement detection in platforms where state tomography is inaccessible or hard to perform. Additionally, the ideas presented here can be extended beyond spin-only systems to expand their applicability.

In particular, finding the universal dimensionless comb inations of their parameters (figures-of-merit), which control transitions between qualitatively different regimes of operation, will help establish the desired parameters of the system with the use of scaled experiments and model calculations.

TI Certificates of quantum many-body properties assisted by machine

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Computationally intractable tasks are often encountered in physics and optimization. They usually comprise a cost function to be optimized over a so-called feasible set, which is specified by a set of constraints. This may yield, in general, to difficult and nonconvex optimization tasks. A number of standard methods are used to tackle such problems: variational approaches focus on parametrizing a subclass of solutions within the feasible set. In contrast, relaxation techniques have been proposed to approximate it from outside, thus complementing the variational approach to provide ultimate bounds to the global optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining the power of relaxation techniques with deep reinforcement learning in order to find the best possible bounds within a limited computational budget. We illustrate the viability of the method in two paradigmatic problems in quantum physics and quantum information processing: finding the ground state energy of many-body quantum systems, and building energy-based entanglement witnesses of quantum local Hamiltonians. We benchmark our approach against other classical optimization algorithms such as breadth-first search or Monte Carlo, and we characterize the effect of transfer learning. We find the latter may be indicative of phase transitions with a completely autonomous approach. Finally, we provide tools to tackle other common applications in the field of quantum information processing with our method.

TI Resolution of 100 photons and quantum generation of unbiased random
   numbers
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as observed in superfluids and superconductors, have led to promising technological advancements and some of the most important tests of fundamental physics. At present, quantum detection of light is mostly relegated to the microscale, where avalanche photodiodes are very sensitive to distinguishing single-photon events from vacuum but cannot differentiate between larger photon-number events. Beyond this, the ability to perform measurements to resolve photon numbers is highly desirable for a variety of quantum information applications, including computation, sensing and cryptography. True photon-number resolving detectors do exist, but they are currently limited to the ability to resolve on the order of 10 photons, which is too small for several quantum-state generation methods based on heralded detection. Here we extend photon measurement into the mesoscopic regime by implementing a detection scheme based on multiplexing highly quantum-efficient transition-edge sensors to accurately resolve photon numbers between 0 and 100. We then demonstrate the use of our system by implementing a quantum random-number generator with no inherent bias. This method is based on sampling a coherent state in the photon-number basis and is robust against environmental noise, phase and amplitude fluctuations in the laser, loss and detector inefficiency as well as eavesdropping. Beyond true random-number generation, our detection scheme serves as a means to implement quantum measurement and engineering techniques valuable for photonic quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Exact Response Theory Based on the Dissipation Function
SO ENTROPY
AB The exact response theory based on the Dissipation Function applies to general dynamical systems and has yielded excellent results in various applications. In this article, we propose a method to apply it to quantum mechanics. In many quantum systems, it has not yet been possible to overcome the perturbative approach, and the most developed theory is the linear one. Extensions of the exact response theory developed in the field of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics could prove useful in quantum mechanics, as perturbations of small systems or far-from-equilibrium states cannot always be taken as small perturbations. Here, we introduce a quantum analogue of the classical Dissipation Function. We then derive a quantum expression for the exact calculation of time-dependent expectation values of observables, in a form analogous to that of the classical theory. We restrict our analysis to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, for the sake of simplicity, and we apply our method to specific examples, like qubit systems, for which exact results can be obtained by standard techniques. This way, we prove the consistency of our approach with the existing methods, where they apply. Although not required for open systems, we propose a self-adjoint version of our Dissipation Operator, obtaining a second equivalent expression of response, where the contribution of an anti-self-adjoint operator appears. We conclude by using new formalism to solve the Lindblad equations, obtaining exact results for a specific case of qubit decoherence, and suggesting possible future developments of this work.

TI Quantum anonymous selection and its applications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we introduce what we believe to be a novel cryptographic primitive in secure multiparty computation, called anonymous selection (AS). This cryptographic primitive involves the random and anonymous selection of one participant from a group, ensuring that no one, except the selected individual, can identify who has been chosen. The AS concept holds significant potential for simplifying complex cryptographic tasks by enabling their implementation in a sequential manner rather than a synchronous one. To develop an efficient and practical AS protocol, we first propose two new primitive protocols: a measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum secure multiparty XOR protocol and an MDI quantum collision detection protocol. Leveraging these protocols, we construct an innovative quantum AS protocol that achieves information-theoretic security under the semi-honest model. Furthermore, we explore the practical applications of the quantum AS protocol and present a feasible quantum protocol for secure multiparty logical multiplication. Our theoretical analysis and simulation experiments collectively demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed quantum protocols.

TI Best Approximate Quantum Compiling Problems

AB We study the problem of finding the best approximate circuit that is the closest (in some pertinent metric) to a target circuit, and which satisfies a number of hardware constraints, like gate alphabet and connectivity. We look at the problem in the CNOT+rotation gate set from a mathematical programming standpoint, offering contributions both in terms of understanding the mathematics of the problem and its efficient solution. Among the results that we present, we are able to derive a 14-CNOT 4-qubit Toffoli decomposition from scratch, and show that the Quantum Shannon Decomposition can be compressed by a factor of two without practical loss of fidelity.

TI Ultrahigh vacuum packaging and surface cleaning for quantum devices
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We describe design, implementation, and performance of an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) package for superconducting qubit chips or other surface sensitive quantum devices. The UHV loading procedure allows for annealing, ultra-violet light irradiation, ion milling, and surface passivation of quantum devices before sealing them into a measurement package. The package retains vacuum during the transfer to cryogenic temperatures by active pumping with a titanium getter layer. We characterize the treatment capabilities of the system and present measurements of flux tunable qubits with an average T-1 = 84 mu s and T2134 mu s after vacuum-loading these samples into a bottom loading dilution refrigerator in the UHV-package.

TI Statistical Phase Estimation and Error Mitigation on a Superconducting
   Quantum Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a key quantum algorithm, which has been widely studied as a method to perform chemistry and solid-state calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Recently, several authors have proposed statistical alternatives to QPE that have benefits on early faulttolerant devices, including shorter circuits and better suitability for error-mitigation techniques. However, experimental investigations of the algorithm on real quantum processors are lacking. Here, we implement statistical phase estimation on Rigetti's superconducting processors. Specifically, we use a modification of the Lin and Tong [PRX Quantum 3, 010318 (2022)] algorithm with the improved Fourier approximation of Wan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 030503 (2022)] and apply a variational-compilation technique to reduce the circuit depth. We then incorporate error-mitigation strategies including zero-noise extrapolation and readout-error mitigation with bit-flip averaging. We propose a new method to estimate energies from the statistical phase estimation data, which is found to improve the accuracy in the final energy estimates by 1-2 orders of magnitude with respect to prior theoretical bounds, reducing the cost of performing accurate phase-estimation calculations. We apply these methods to chemistry problems for active spaces up to four electrons in four orbitals, including the application of a quantum embedding method, and use them to correctly estimate energies within chemical precision. Our work demonstrates that statistical phase estimation has a natural resilience to noise, particularly after mitigating coherent errors, and can achieve far higher accuracy than suggested by previous analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable quantum algorithm for early fault-tolerant devices.

TI Training an Ising machine with equilibrium propagation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ising machines, which are hardware implementations of the Ising model of coupled spins, have been influential in the development of unsupervised learning algorithms at the origins of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, their application to AI has been limited due to the complexities in matching supervised training methods with Ising machine physics, even though these methods are essential for achieving high accuracy. In this study, we demonstrate an efficient approach to train Ising machines in a supervised way through the Equilibrium Propagation algorithm, achieving comparable results to software-based implementations. We employ the quantum annealing procedure of the D-Wave Ising machine to train a fully-connected neural network on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the machine's connectivity supports convolution operations, enabling the training of a compact convolutional network with minimal spins per neuron. Our findings establish Ising machines as a promising trainable hardware platform for AI, with the potential to enhance machine learning applications.
   Ising machines have been usually applied to predefined combinatorial problems due to their distinct physical properties. The authors introduce an approach that utilizes equilibrium propagation for the training of Ising machines and achieves high accuracy performance on classification tasks.

TI Fabrication of low-loss III-V Bragg-reflection waveguides for parametric
   down-conversion
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Entangled photon pairs are an important resource for many types of quantum protocols. Semiconductor Bragg-reflection waveguides are a promising photon-pair source due to mature fabrication, integrability, large transparency window in the telecom wavelength range, integration capabilities for electro-optical devices as well as a high second-order nonlinear coefficient. To increase performance, we improved the fabrication of Bragg-reflection waveguides by employing fixed-beam-moving-stage optical lithography, low-pressure, and low chlorine concentration etching, and resist reflow. The reduction in sidewall roughness yields a low optical loss coefficient for telecom wavelength light of alpha reflow = 0.08 (6) mm-1. Owing to the decreased losses, we achieved a photon-pair production rate of 8800 (300) (mW center dot s center dot mm)-1, which is 15-fold higher than in previous samples.

TI Scaling of temporal entanglement in proximity to integrability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Describing dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a formidable challenge due to rapid generation of quantum entanglement between remote degrees of freedom. A promising approach to tackle this challenge, which has been proposed recently, is to characterize the quantum dynamics of a many-body system and its properties as a bath via the Feynman-Vernon influence matrix (IM), which is an operator in the space of time trajectories of local degrees of freedom. Physical understanding of the general scaling of the IM's temporal entanglement and its relation to basic dynamical properties is highly incomplete to the present day. In this paper, we analytically compute the exact IM for a family of integrable Floquet models-the transverse-field kicked Ising chain-finding a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like "wave function" on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with algebraically decaying correlations. We demonstrate that the IM exhibits area-law temporal entanglement scaling for all parameter values. Furthermore, the entanglement pattern of the IM reveals the system's phase diagram, exhibiting jumps across transitions between distinct Floquet phases. Near criticality, a nontrivial scaling behavior of temporal entanglement is found. The area-law temporal entanglement allows us to efficiently describe the effects of sizable integrability-breaking perturbations for long evolution times by using matrix-product-state methods. This work shows that tensor-network methods are efficient in describing the effect of noninteracting baths on open quantum systems and provides an approach to studying quantum many-body systems with weakly broken integrability.

TI Controlling and exploring quantum systems by algebraic expression of
   adiabatic gauge potential
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Adiabatic gauge potential is the origin of nonadiabatic transitions. In counterdiabatic driving, which is a method of shortcuts to adiabaticity, adiabatic gauge potential can be used to realize identical dynamics to adiabatic time evolution without requiring slow change of parameters. We introduce an algebraic expression of adiabatic gauge potential. Then, we find that the explicit form of adiabatic gauge potential can be easily determined by some algebraic calculations. We demonstrate this method by using a single-spin system, a two-spin system, and the transverse Ising chain. Moreover, we derive a lower bound for fidelity to adiabatic time evolution based on the quantum speed limit. This bound enables us to know the worst case performance of approximate adiabatic gauge potential. We can also use this bound to find dominant terms in adiabatic gauge potential to suppress nonadiabatic transitions. We apply this bound to magnetization reversal of the two-spin system and to quantum annealing of the transverse Ising chain. Adiabatic gauge potential reflects structure of energy eigenstates, and thus we also discuss detection of quantum phase transitions by using adiabatic gauge potential. We find a signature of a quantum phase transition in the transverse Ising chain.

TI Error mitigation in brainbox quantum autoencoders
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum hardware faces noise challenges that disrupt multiqubit entangled states. Quantum autoencoder circuits with a single qubit bottleneck have demonstrated the capability to correct errors in noisy entangled states. By introducing slightly more complex structures in the bottleneck, referred to as brainboxes, the denoising process can occure more quickly and efficiently in the presence of stronger noise channels. Selecting the most suitable brainbox for the bottleneck involves a trade-off between the intensity of noise on the hardware and training complexity. Finally, by analysing the R & eacute;nyi entropy flow throughout the networks, we demonstrate that the localization of entanglement plays a central role in denoising through learning.

AB In the fabrication of superconducting devices, both in situ and ex situ processes are utilized, making the removal of unwanted oxide layers and impurities under vacuum conditions crucial. Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.

We derive analytically the probability density functions (PDFs) of the uncertainties of arbitrary qubit observables. Based on these PDFs, the uncertainty regions of the observables are characterized by the support of the PDFs. The state-independent uncertainty relations are then transformed into the optimization problems over uncertainty regions, which opens a new vista for studying state-independent uncertainty relations. Our results may be generalized to multiple observable cases in higher dimensional spaces.

TI A Grover-Meets-Simon Approach to Match Vector Boolean Functions
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The Boolean matching problem via NP-equivalence requires determining whether two Boolean functions are equivalent or not up to a permutation and negation of the input binary variables. Its solution is a fundamental step in the electronic design automation (EDA) tool chains commonly used for digital circuit design. In fact, the library-mapping step of an EDA workflow requires matching parts of the gate-level design (netlist) with the components available in a technology library, considering them as Boolean functions, while taking into account that permutations and negations of input variables can be efficiently implemented through rewiring and the use of inverters. For n-to-n vector Boolean functions, where n is the number of input and output variables, the search space of possible negations and permutations is super-exponential in size, while the O(n!n2(2n)) time complexity of classical approaches allows solving only small instances of the NP-problem, often limited to n-to-1 Boolean functions (executing O(n!2(2n)) bit operations). This work presents a quantum algorithm for matching n-to-n vector Boolean functions by effectively combining the Grover-meets-Simon approach with an original and novel use of the Simon solver without the constraints imposed by its usual premises. We provide a fully detailed quantum circuit implementing our proposal, calculate its cost by evaluating key performance indicators for circuit synthesis, and show an exponential speedup over classical solutions. Finally, we validate our approach on the Boolean functions included in the ISCAS benchmark suite, which are of practical interest in EDA.

However, in some current modes of robot operation, such as leader-follower control, the operator must use visual information to recognize the physical deviation between him/herself and the robot, and correct the operation instructions sequentially, which limits movement speed and places a heavy burden on the operator. In this study, we propose a leader-follower control parameter optimization method for the feedforward correction necessitated by deviations in the link length between the robot and the operator. To optimize the parameters, we used the Digital Annealer developed by Fujitsu Ltd., which can solve the combinatorial optimization problem at high speed. The main objective was to minimize the difference between the hand coordinates target and the actual hand position of the robot. In simulations, the proposed method decreased the difference between the hand position of the robot and the target. Moreover, this method enables optimum operation, in part by eliminating the need for the operator to maintain an unreasonable posture, as in some robots the operator's hand position is unsuitable for achieving the objective.

TI Implementing magnetic properties on demand with a dynamic
   lanthanoid-organic framework
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We present the synthesis of a lanthanoid-organic framework (LOF) featuring a dynamic structure that exhibits tunable magnetic properties. The LOF undergoes breathing and gate-opening phenomena in response to changes in DMF content and N2 sorption, leading to the emergence of new crystal phases with distinct characteristics. Notably, the desolvated form of the LOF excels as a single-ion magnet, while the fully activated structure demonstrates impressive qubit properties, exhibiting Rabi oscillations up to 60 K. Our work enables precise control over the LOF's geometry, allowing us to selectively tailor its magnetic behavior to achieve either of these two intriguing functionalities.

TI Universal quantum operation of spin-3/2 Blume-Capel chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a logical qubit based on the Blume-Capel model: A higher-spin generalization of the Ising chain which allows for an on-site anisotropy-preserving rotational invariance around the Ising axis. We show that such a spin-3/2 Blume-Capel model can also support localized Majorana zero modes at the ends of the chain. Inspired by known braiding protocols of these Majorana zero modes, upon appropriate manipulation of the system parameters, we demonstrate a set of universal gate operations which act on qubits encoded in the doubly degenerate ground states of the chain.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate the measurement of p-channel silicon-on-insulator quantum dots at liquid helium temperatures by using a radio frequency (rf) reflectometry circuit comprising of two independently tunable GaAs varactors. This arrangement allows observing Coulomb diamonds at 4.2 K under nearly best matching condition and optimal signal-to-noise ratio. We also discuss the rf leakage induced by the presence of the large top gate in MOS nanostructures and its consequence on the efficiency of rf-reflectometry. These results open the way to fast and sensitive readout in multi-gate architectures, including multi qubit platforms.

TI Comparing Relaxation Mechanisms in Quantum and Classical
   Transverse-Field Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Annealing schedule control provides opportunities to better understand the manner and mechanisms by which putative quantum annealers operate. By appropriately modifying the annealing schedule to include a pause (keeping the Hamiltonian fixed) for a period of time, we show that it is possible to more directly probe the dissipative dynamics of the system at intermediate points along the anneal and examine thermal relaxation rates, for example, by observing the repopulation of the ground state after the minimum spectral gap. We provide a detailed comparison of experiments from a D-Wave device, simulations of the quantum adiabatic master equation, and a classical analogue of quantum annealing, spin-vector Monte Carlo, and we observe qualitative agreement, showing that the characteristic increase in success probability when pausing is not a uniquely quantum phenomena. We find that the relaxation in our system is dominated by a single timescale, which allows us to give a simple condition for when we can expect pausing to improve the time to solution, the relevant metric for classical optimization. Finally, we also explore in simulation the role of temperature whilst pausing as a means to better distinguish quantum and classical models of quantum annealers.

TI Adaptable Cryptographic Primitives in Blockchains via Smart Contracts
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Blockchain-based platforms utilise cryptographic protocols to enforce the correct behaviour of users, as well as to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against malicious adversaries. Cryptography is, however, an ever-evolving discipline, and any breakthrough would have immediate consequences on the security of blockchain-based applications. A possible threat currently under investigation is given by the development of quantum computers, since several wide-adopted cryptographic protocols have been proved to be unsafe against quantum-capable adversaries. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the management of cryptographic primitives in smart-contract-based ledgers, discussing how it fits in both a (partially) permissioned and a fully permissionless setting. The cryptographic protocols are managed in a flexible manner via a set of smart-contracts defined on the ledger itself, in this way the choice of algorithms and parameters can change quickly. Among the advantages of this approach, we remark how it allows designing an adaptive post-quantum-based blockchain that keeps up with ongoing technological advances. In general, the introduction of new features and the application of fixes to a blockchain cause forks in the chain, which may cause major disruptions. The use of smart contracts in blockchain management allows to avoid this problem, dynamically introducing new protocols or deprecating old ones without compromising previous data. The Cryptographic Kernel approach has been adopted by Quadrans, an open-source, public, decentralised smart-contract-based blockchain with a specific focus on the needs of industry, complex supply chains, and IOT devices.

TI Robust Demultiplexing of Distinct Orbital Angular Momentum Infrared
   Vortex Beams Into Different Spatial Geometry Over a Broad Spectral Range
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multi-channel structured light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be applied in different applications. For example, OAM modulation and OAM multiplexing in fiber optics communications, high-dimensional quantum cryptography-based OAM states for transmitting secure information across free-space, and independent data streams through OAM beams multiplexed free-space optical links. Using a simple and efficient system consisting of a spiral phase element (SPE) and a multi-channel vortex filter (MVF), we have converted input Gaussian beams into multi-channel OAM-based vortex beams for infrared wavelengths. An SPE has been designed, which generates optical vortices with wavelength-dependent topological charge (including fractional values). The resulting complex fields are optically relayed on a binary MVF designed by modulo-2 pi phase addition of multiple fork gratings with topological charges 1, 2, and 3 and azimuthal orientations. In this way, the MVF generates beams with different OAM states for different carrier waves with different angles and maps them at desired locations in the detector plane. In this study, both 3 x 3, as well as a hexagonal configuration, were used. Furthermore, the experimentally obtained OAM spectrum qualitatively agrees with the results of numerical simulations, thus verifying our approach. The presented approach opens a new pathway for developing an efficient multi-channel OAM beams generator designed for a specific wavelength and illuminated by an input beam of different wavelengths over a broad spectral range.

TI Quantum sequel of neural network training
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.

TI Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum
   critical point
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the "anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent of the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical timescale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.

AB With the advent of near-term quantum computers, it is now possible to simulate solid-state properties using quantum algorithms. By an adequate description of the system's Hamiltonian, variational methods enable to fetch of the band structure and other fundamental properties as transition probabilities. Here, we describe semiconductor structures of the III-V family using k center dot p Hamiltonians and obtain their band structures using a state vector solver, a probabilistic simulator, and a real noisy-device simulator. The resulting band structures are in good agreement with those obtained by direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. The simulation times depend on the optimizer, circuit depth, and simulator used. Finally, with the optimized eigenstates, we convey the inter-band absorption probability, demonstrating the possibility of analyzing the fundamental properties of crystalline systems using quantum computers.

TI How to Reduce the Bit-Width of an Ising Model by Adding Auxiliary Spins
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Annealing machines have been developed as non-von Neumann computers aimed at solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. To use annealing machines for solving combinatorial optimization problems, we have to represent the objective function and constraints by an Ising model, which is a theoretical model in statistical physics. Further, it is necessary to transform the Ising model according to the hardware limitations. In the transformation, the process of effectively reducing the bit-widths of coefficients in the Ising model has hardly been studied so far. Thus, when we consider the Ising model with a large bit-width, a naive method, which means right bit-shift, has to be applied. Since it is expected that obtaining highly accurate solutions is difficult by the naive method, it is necessary to construct a method for efficiently reducing the bit-width. This article proposes methods for reducing the bit-widths of interaction and external magnetic field coefficients in the Ising model and proves that the reduction gives theoretically the same ground state of the original Ising model. The experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

TI Post-quantum identity-based authenticated multiple key agreement
   protocol
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Authenticated multiple key agreement (AMKA) protocols provide participants with multiple session keys after one round of authentication. Many schemes use Diffie-Hellman or authenticated key agreement schemes that rely on hard integer factorizations that are vulnerable to quantum algorithms. Lattice cryptography provides quantum resistance to authenticated key agreement protocols, but the certificate always incurs excessive public key infrastructure management overhead. Thus, a lightweight lattice-based secure system is needed that removes this overhead. To answer this need, we provide a two-party lattice- and identity-based AMKA scheme based on bilateral short integer or computational bilateral inhomogeneous small integer solutions, and we provide a security proof based on the random oracle model. Compared with existing AMKA protocols, our new protocol has higher efficiency and stronger security.

TI Classifying causal structures: Ascertaining when classical correlations
   are constrained by inequalities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The classical causal relations between a set of variables, some observed and some latent, can induce both equality constraints (typically conditional independencies) as well as inequality constraints (Instrumental and Bell inequalities being prototypical examples) on their compatible distribution over the observed variables. Enumerating a causal structure's implied inequality constraints is generally far more difficult than enumerating its equalities. Furthermore, only inequality constraints ever admit violation by quantum correlations. For both those reasons, it is important to classify causal scenarios into those which impose inequality constraints versus those which do not. Here we develop methods for detecting such scenarios by appealing to d separation, e separation, and incompatible supports. Many (perhaps all?) scenarios with exclusively equality constraints can be detected via a condition articulated by Henson, Lal, and Pusey (HLP). Considering all scenarios with up to four observed variables, which number in the thousands, we are able to resolve all but three causal scenarios, providing evidence that the HLP condition is, in fact, exhaustive.

TI Out-of-time-order correlation as a witness for topological phase
   transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a physical witness for dynamically detecting topological phase transitions (TPTs) via an ex-perimentally observable out-of-time-order correlation (OTOC). The distinguishable OTOC dynamics appears in the topological trivial and nontrivial phases due to the topological locality. In the long-time limit, the OTOC undergoes a zero-to-finite-value transition at the critical point of the TPTs. This transition is robust to the choices of the initial state of the system and the operators used in the OTOC. The proposed OTOC witness can be applied to systems with and without chiral symmetry, e.g., the lattices described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Creutz model, and Haldane model. Moreover, our proposal, as a physical witness in real space, is still valid even in the presence of disorder. Our work fundamentally brings the OTOC into the realm of TPTs and offers the prospect of exploring topological physics with quantum correlations.

TI Predicting quantum dynamical cost landscapes with deep learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB State-of-the-art quantum algorithms routinely tune dynamically parametrized cost functionals for combinatorics, machine learning, equation solving, and energy minimization. However, large search complexity often demands many (noisy) quantum measurements, leading to the increasing use of classical probability models to estimate which areas in the cost functional landscape are of highest interest. Introducing deep learning based modeling of the landscape, we demonstrate order-of-magnitude increases in accuracy and speed over state-of-the-art Bayesian methods with respect to control of a many-body spin chain. Moreover, once trained, the deep neural network enables the extraction of information at a much faster rate than conventional numerical simulation. This allows for on-the-fly experimental optimizations of circuits with large depth and moderate width and detailed classification of problem complexity and navigability throughout the phase diagram of the landscape.

TI Unconventional saturation effects at intermediate drive in a lossy
   cavity coupled to few emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent technological advancements have enabled strong light-matter interaction in highly dissipative cavity-emitter systems. However, in these systems, which are well described by the Tavis-Cummings model, the considerable loss rates render the realization of many desirable nonlinear effects, such as saturation and photon blockade, problematic. Here we present another effect occurring within the Tavis-Cummings model: A nonlinear response of the cavity for resonant external driving of intermediate strength, which makes use of large cavity dissipation rates. In this regime, (N + 1)-photon absorption processes dominate when the cavity couples to N emitters. We explore and characterize this effect in detail, and provide a picture of how the effect occurs due to destructive interference between the emitter ensemble and the external drive. We find that a central condition for the observed effect is large cooperativity; i.e., the product of the cavity and emitter decay rates is much smaller than the collective cavity-emitter interaction strength squared. Importantly, this condition does not require strong coupling. We also find an analytical expression for the critical drive strength at which the effect appears. Our results have potential for quantum state engineering, e.g., photon filtering, and could be used for the characterization of cavity-emitter systems where the number of emitters is unknown. In particular, our results open the way for investigations of unique quantum-optics applications in a variety of platforms that require neither high-quality cavities nor strong coupling.

TI Sampling on NISQ Devices: "Who's the Fairest One of All?"

AB Modern NISQ devices are subject to a variety of biases and sources of noise that degrade the solution quality of computations carried out on these devices. A natural question that arises in the NISQ era, is how fairly do these devices sample ground state solutions. To this end, we run five fair sampling problems (each with at least three ground state solutions) that are based both on quantum annealing and on the Grover Mixer-QAOA algorithm for gate-based NISQ hardware. In particular, we use seven IBM Q devices, the Aspen-9 Rigetti device, the IonQ device, and three D-Wave quantum annealers.
   For each of the fair sampling problems, we measure the ground state probability, the relative fairness of the frequency of each ground state solution with respect to the other ground state solutions, and the aggregate error as given by each hardware provider. Overall, our results show that NISQ devices do not achieve fair sampling yet. We also observe differences in the software stack with a particular focus on compilation techniques that illustrate what work will still need to be done to achieve a seamless integration of frontend (i.e. quantum circuit description) and backend compilation.

TI Pauli decomposition via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present an exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in O(N2log N) time and using O(1) additional memory, for an N x N matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.

TI On efficient quantum block encoding of pseudo- differential operators
SO QUANTUM
AB Block encoding lies at the core of many existing quantum algorithms. Mean-while, efficient and explicit block encodings of dense operators are commonly acknowledged as a challenging problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the block encoding of a rich family of dense operators: the pseudo -differential operators (PDOs). First, a block encoding scheme for generic PDOs is developed. Then we propose a more efficient scheme for PDOs with a separa-ble structure. Finally, we demonstrate an explicit and efficient block encoding algorithm for PDOs with a dimension-wise fully separable structure. Com-plexity analysis is provided for all block encoding algorithms presented. The application of theoretical results is illustrated with worked examples, including the representation of variable coefficient elliptic operators and the computa-tion of the inverse of elliptic operators without invoking quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs).

TI Quantum Bayesian Decision-Making
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB As a compact representation of joint probability distributions over a dependence graph of random variables, and a tool for modelling and reasoning in the presence of uncertainty, Bayesian networks are of great importance for artificial intelligence to combine domain knowledge, capture causal relationships, or learn from incomplete datasets. Known as a NP-hard problem in a classical setting, Bayesian inference pops up as a class of algorithms worth to explore in a quantum framework. This paper explores such a research direction and improves on previous proposals by a judicious use of the utility function in an entangled configuration. It proposes a completely quantum mechanical decision-making process with a proven computational advantage. A prototype implementation in Qiskit (a Python-based program development kit for the IBM Q machine) is discussed as a proof-of-concept.

TI Magnon-atom-optical photon entanglement via the microwave
   photon-mediated Raman interaction
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We show that it is possible to generate magnon-atom-optical photon tripartite entanglement via the microwave photon-mediated Raman interaction. Magnons in a macroscopic ferromagnet and optical photons in a cavity are induced into a Raman interaction with an atomic spin ensemble when a microwave field couples the magnons to one Raman wing. The controllable magnon-atom entanglement, magnon-optical photon entanglement, and even genuine magnon-atom-optical photon tripartite entanglement can be generated simultaneously. In addition, these bipartite and tripartite entanglements are robust against the environment temperature. Our scheme paves the way for exploring a quantum interface bridging the microwave and optical domains, and may provide a promising building block for hybrid quantum networks.

TI Gate-controlled near-surface Josephson junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Gate-tunable Josephson junctions are interesting for quantum technology applications, such as gatemon qubits and topological Majorana-based qubits. Furthermore, high-frequency compatible geometries can be utilized for implementing electrically pumped parametric amplifiers. In this paper, we combine processing, measurements, and modeling of near-surface InGaAs Josephson field-effect transistors in order to facilitate circuit simulations of actual non-ideal devices. We developed a compact model using Verilog-A and confirmed the validity of our model by accurately reproducing our measured data by circuit simulations in Advanced Design System. From the circuit simulations, an effective gate-dependent transmission coefficient, with a peak value of similar to 3.5%, was extracted, mainly limited by contact transparency.

TI Non-Gaussian superradiant transition via three-body ultrastrong coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a class of quantum optical Hamiltonians characterized by three-body couplings and propose a circuit-QED scheme based on state-of-the-art technology that implements the considered model. Unlike two-body light-matter interactions, this three-body coupling Hamiltonian is exclusively composed of terms which do not conserve the particle number. We explore the three-body ultrastrong-coupling regime, showing the emergence of a superradiant phase transition which is of first order, is characterized by the breaking of Z2 x Z2 symmetry, and has a strongly non-Gaussian nature. Indeed, in contrast to what is observed in any two-body-coupling model, in proximity of the transition the ground state exhibits a divergent coskewness, i.e., quantum correlations that cannot be captured within semiclassical and Gaussian approximations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our findings by including dissipative processes in the model, showing that the steady state of the system inherits from the ground states the most prominent features of the transition.

TI Observation of pairs of atoms at opposite momenta in an equilibrium
   interacting Bose gas
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum fluctuations play a central role in the properties of quantum matter. In non-interacting ensembles, they manifest as fluctuations of non-commuting observables, quantified by Heisenberg inequalities(1). In the presence of interactions, additional quantum fluctuations appear, from which many-body correlations and entanglement arise(2). Weak interactions are predicted to deplete Bose-Einstein condensates by the formation of correlated pairs of bosons with opposite momenta(3,4). Here we report the observation of these atom pairs in the depletion of an equilibrium interacting Bose gas(5). Our measurements of atom-atom correlations, both at opposite and close-by momenta(6,7), allow us to characterize the equilibrium many-body state. We also show that the atom pairs share the properties of two-mode squeezed states(8,9), including relative number squeezing(10-12). Our results illustrate how interacting systems acquire non-trivial quantum correlations as a result of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and interactions(13).

TI Loss-resistant verification of quantum non-Gaussian photon statistics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum non-Gaussian states of light have fundamental properties that are essential for a multitude of applications in quantum technology. However, many of these features are difficult to detect using standard criteria due to optical losses and detector inefficiency. As the statistics of light are unknown, the loss correction on the data is unreliable, despite the fact that the losses can be precisely measured. To address this issue, we employ a loss-mitigated verification technique utilizing quantum non-Gaussian witnesses, which incorporate the known optical losses and detector inefficiency into their derivation. This approach allows us to address the considerable challenge of experimentally demonstrating unheralded quantum non-Gaussian states of single photons and photon pairs.

TI Signatures of Weyl Fermion Annihilation in a Correlated Kagome Magnet

AB The manipulation of topological states in quantum matter is an essential pursuit of fundamental physics and next-generation quantum technology. Here we report the magnetic manipulation of Weyl fermions in the kagome spin-orbit semimetal Co3Sn2S2, observed by high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy. We demonstrate the exchange collapse of spin-orbit-gapped ferromagnetic Weyl loops into paramagnetic Dirac loops under suppression of the magnetic order. We further observe that topological Fermi arcs disappear in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting the annihilation of exchange-split Weyl points. Our findings indicate that magnetic exchange collapse naturally drives Weyl fermion annihilation, opening new opportunities for engineering topology under correlated order parameters.

TI Protective Measurement-A New Quantum Measurement Paradigm: Detailed
   Description of the First Realization

AB We present a detailed description of the experiment realizing for the first time a protective measurement, a novel measurement protocol which combines weak interactions with a "protection mechanism" preserving the measured state coherence during the whole measurement process. Furthermore, protective measurement allows finding the expectation value of an observable, i.e., an inherently statistical quantity, by measuring a single particle, without the need for any statistics. This peculiar property, in sharp contrast to the framework of traditional (projective) quantum measurement, might constitute a groundbreaking advance for several quantum technology related fields.

TI Unimodular Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and de Sitter quantum cosmology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this work, we show that a gauge-theoretic description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity naturally yields a Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) unimodular gravity via a central extension of its isometry group, valid for both flat and curved two-dimensional spacetimes. HT gravity introduces a unimodular time canonically conjugate to the cosmological constant, serving as a physical time in quantum cosmology. By studying the minisuperspace reduction of HT2 gravity, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes a Schr & ouml;dinger-like equation, giving a consistent and unitary quantum theory. Analysis of the wave function's probability density reveals a quantum distribution for the scale factor a, offering a quantum perspective on the expansion and contraction of the Universe. In this perspective, the possibility of reaching the singular point a 1/4 0 signals that topology change could occur. Finally, we give a consistent quantum description of unimodular time that aligns seamlessly with Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics, where quantum correlations between unimodular time and JT gravity are studied in HT2 quantum cosmology.

TI Noise-robust exploration of many-body quantum states on near-term
   quantum devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We describe a resource-efficient approach to studying many-body quantum states on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. We employ a sequential generation model that allows us to bound the range of correlations in the resulting many-body quantum states. From this, we characterize situations where the estimation of local observables does not require the preparation of the entire state. Instead smaller patches of the state can be generated from which the observables can be estimated. This can potentially reduce circuit size and number of qubits for the computation of physical properties of the states. Moreover, we show that the effect of noise decreases along the computation. Our results apply to a broad class of widely studied tensor network states and can be directly applied to near-term implementations of variational quantum algorithms.

TI Spin coherence in strongly coupled spin baths in quasi-two-dimensional
   layers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the spin-coherence decay of NV- spins interacting with the strongly coupled bath of nitrogen defects in diamond layers. For thin diamond layers, we demonstrate that the spin-coherence times exceed those of bulk diamond, thus allowing to surpass the limit imposed by high-defect concentrations in bulk. We show that the stretched-exponential parameter for the short-time spin-coherence decay is governed by the hyperfine interaction in the bath, thereby constraining random-noise models. We introduce a method based on the cluster-correlation expansion applied to strongly interacting bath partitions instead of individual spins. Our results facilitate material development for quantum-technology devices.

TI Experimental signature of initial quantum coherence on entropy
   production
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report on the experimental quantification of the contribution to non-equilibrium entropy production stemming from the quantum coherence content in the initial state of a qubit exposed to both coherent driving and dissipation. Our experimental demonstration builds on the exquisite experimental control of the spin state of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond and is underpinned, theoretically, by the formulation of a generalized fluctuation theorem designed to track the effects of quantum coherence. Our results provide significant evidence of the possibility to pinpoint the genuinely quantum mechanical contributions to the thermodynamics of non-equilibrium quantum processes in an open quantum systems scenario.

TI Unveiling Hidden Features of Strongly Correlated Quantum Systems Through
   a Complex-Network Analysis
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Complex networks provide a powerful framework for capturing the intricate correlations, topological features, and emergent behaviors in quantum systems, offering insights that traditional approaches may overlook. We introduce a density matrix-based network analysis to explore the ground state of the Kitaev chain, uncovering previously hidden structural and entanglement features. This approach successfully identifies the critical point associated with the topological phase transition and reveals a singular point where the ground state exhibits uniform, nonzero entanglement between all fermion pairs, corresponding to a fully connected network structure. We provide an analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection to the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover, we analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes in the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. While complex network theory has been employed in the study of quantum systems before, we demonstrate that it can uncover fundamentally new physical insights.

TI Hilbert space fragmentation in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in open quantum systems and find that it can stabilize highly entangled steady states. For concreteness, we consider the Temperley-Lieb model, which exhibits quantum HSF in an entangled basis, and investigate the Lindblad dynamics under two different couplings. First, we couple the system to a dephasing bath that reduces quantum fragmentation to a classical one with the resulting stationary state being separable. We observe that despite vanishing quantum correlations, classical correlations develop due to fluctuations of the remaining conserved quantities, which we show can be captured by a classical stochastic circuit evolution. Second, we use a coupling that preserves the quantum fragmentation structure. We derive a general expression for the steady state, which has a strong coherent memory of the initial state due to the extensive number of noncommuting conserved quantities. We then show that it is highly entangled as quantified by logarithmic negativity.

TI On the Dynamics between Gravity and Entanglement
SO GRAVITATION & COSMOLOGY
AB Recent developments on Bell's experiments demonstrate that entanglement could indeed eliminate the gap between classical and quantum physics. At the same time, it is difficult for a classical theory to include a particular feature like entanglement without compromising the theory's smooth working on a four-dimensional scale geometry. A unified theory should reconsider this difficulty. On the other hand, pregeometry holds the assumption of a noncommutative space where the Requardt-Roy model seems to be a promising one. From the ordinary five-dimensional approach, first initiated by Kaluza and Klein, a toy model is proposed to show an insignificant description of gravity at Planck's scale physics. It is found that the classical nature of quantum correlations is fine-tuned within the geometry of space-time in four dimensions. Such a nature can be better understood by studying the pregeometric effects of gravity in five dimensions. A combined description is found, sufficient to explain the fundamental difficulties of a discrete space-time manifold in both theories.

TI The coherence of light is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence of
   the emitting particle
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Coherent emission of light by free charged particles is believed to be successfully captured by classical electromagnetism in all experimental settings. However, recent advances triggered fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wave function in these processes. Here, we find that even in seemingly classical experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence and correlations of the emitting particle. We use quantum electrodynamics to show how the particle's momentum uncertainty determines the optical coherence of the emitted light. We find that the temporal duration of Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century as a shock wave of light, is limited by underlying entanglement between the particle and light. Our findings enable new capabilities in electron microscopy for measuring quantum correlations of shaped electrons. Last, we propose new Cherenkov detection schemes, whereby measuring spectral photon autocorrelations can unveil the wave function structure of any charged high-energy particle.

TI Momentum space separation of quantum path interferences between photons
   and surface plasmon polaritons in nonlinear photoemission microscopy
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum path interferences occur whenever multiple equivalent and coherent transitions result in a common final state. Such interferences strongly modify the probability of a particle to be found in that final state, a key concept of quantum coherent control. When multiple nonlinear and energy-degenerate transitions occur in a system, the multitude of possible quantum path interferences is hard to disentangle experimentally. Here, we analyze quantum path interferences during the nonlinear emission of electrons from hybrid plasmonic and photonic fields using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy. We experimentally distinguish quantum path interferences by exploiting the momentum difference between photons and plasmons and through balancing the relative contributions of their respective fields. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the nonlinear photon-plasmon-electron interaction. Distinguishing emission processes in momentum space, as introduced here, could allow nano-optical quantum-correlations to be studied without destroying the quantum path interferences.

TI Dissipation-induced collective advantage of a quantum thermal machine
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Do quantum correlations lead to better performance with respect to several different systems working independently? For quantum thermal machines, the question is whether a working medium (WM) made of N constituents exhibits better performance than N independent engines working in parallel. Here, by inspecting a microscopic model with the WM composed by two non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators, we show that the presence of a common environment can mediate non-trivial correlations in the WM leading to better quantum heat engine performance-maximum power and efficiency-with respect to an independent configuration. Furthermore, this advantage is striking for strong dissipation, a regime in which two independent engines cannot deliver any useful power. Our results show that dissipation can be exploited as a useful resource for quantum thermal engines and are then corroborated by optimization techniques here extended to non-Markovian quantum heat engines.

TI Simulating Gaussian boson sampling quantum computers
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB A growing cohort of experimental linear photonic networks implementing Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) have now claimed quantum advantage. However, many open questions remain on how to effectively verify these experimental results, as scalable methods are needed that fully capture the rich array of quantum correlations generated by these photonic quantum computers. In this paper, we briefly review recent theoretical methods to simulate experimental GBS networks. We focus mostly on methods that use phase-space representations of quantum mechanics, as these methods are highly scalable and can be used to validate experimental outputs and claims of quantum advantage for a variety of input states, ranging from the ideal pure squeezed vacuum state to more realistic thermalized squeezed states. A brief overview of the theory of GBS, recent experiments, and other types of methods are also presented. Although this is not an exhaustive review, we aim to provide a brief introduction to phase-space methods applied to linear photonic networks to encourage further theoretical investigations.

TI Energy-Filtered Quantum States and the Emergence of Nonlocal
   Correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence toward thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium, and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, nonlocal quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the Re<acute accent>nyi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition, and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.

TI Generalized Bell Scenarios: Disturbing Consequences on

SO ENTROPY
AB Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality are among the main topics in the foundations of quantum theory. Both of them are related to stronger-than-classical correlations, with the former usually referring to spatially separated systems, while the latter considers a single system. In recent works, a unified framework for these phenomena was presented. This article reviews, expands, and obtains new results regarding this framework. Contextual and disturbing features inside the local models are explored, which allows for the definition of different local sets with a non-trivial relation among them. The relations between the set of quantum correlations and these local sets are also considered, and post-quantum local behaviours are found. Moreover, examples of correlations that are both local and non-contextual but such that these two classical features cannot be expressed by the same hidden variable model are shown. Extensions of the Fine-Abramsky-Brandenburger theorem are also discussed.

TI Quantum Langevin theory for two coupled phase-conjugated electromagnetic
   waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We provide a general macroscopic phenomenological formula of quantum Langevin equations for two coupled phase-conjugated electromagnetic fields with linear loss (gain) and complex nonlinear coupling coefficient. The macroscopic phenomenological formula is obtained from the coupling matrix to preserve the field commutation relations and correlations, which does not require knowing the microscopic details of light-matter interaction and internal atomic structures. To validate this phenomenological formula, we take spontaneous four-wave mixing in a double- (sic) four-level atomic system as an example to numerically confirm that our macroscopic phenomenological result is consistent with that obtained from the microscopic Heisenberg-Langevin theory. We find that a complex-valued nonlinear coupling coefficient can lead to noises even without linear gain or loss. Finally, we apply the quantum Langevin equations to study the effects of linear gain and loss, complex phase mismatching, as well as complex nonlinear coupling coefficient in entangled photon pair (biphoton) generation, particularly to their temporal quantum correlations.

TI Effects of quenching protocols based on parametric oscillators
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider the problem of understanding the basic features displayed by quantum systems described by parametric oscillators whose time-dependent frequency parameter omega(t) varies continuously during evolution so to realize quenching protocols of different types. To this scope we focus on the case where omega(t)(2) behaves like a Morse potential, up to possible sign reversion and translations in the (t, omega(2)) plane. We derive closed form solution for the time-dependent amplitude of quasi-normal modes, which is the very fundamental dynamical object entering the description of both classical and quantum parametric oscillators, and highlight its significant characteristics for distinctive cases arising based on the driving specifics. After doing so, we provide an insight on the way quantum states evolve by paying attention on the positionmomentum Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the statistical aspects implied by second-order correlation functions over number-type states.

TI Elastic cross section is entanglement entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the cross section, which is the primary observable for high-energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the Re<acute accent>nyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in units of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and nonkinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel "area law" for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.

Current experimental challenges and successes in understanding decays of the charmed hadrons are discussed. Precise calibrations of quantum chromodynamics and tests of the standard model are provided by measurements of purely leptonic and semi-leptonic decays of charmed hadrons, and lepton universality is probed in purely leptonic decays of charmed mesons to three generations of leptons. Quantum correlations in threshold data samples provide access to strong phases in the neutral D meson decays and probe the decay dynamics of the charmed Lambda(c) baryon. Charm physics studies with near-threshold production of charmed particle pairs are unique to BESIII, and provide many important opportunities and challenges.

TI Spreading of correlations in Markovian open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Understanding the spreading of quantum correlations in out-of-equilibrium many-body systems is one of the major challenges in physics. For isolated systems, a hydrodynamic theory explains the origin and spreading of entanglement via the propagation of quasiparticle pairs. However, when systems interact with their surrounding much less has been established. Here we show that the quasiparticle picture remains valid for open quantum systems: While information is still spread by quasiparticles, the environment modifies their correlation and introduces incoherent and mixing effects. For free fermions with gain/loss dissipation we provide formulas fully describing incoherent and quasiparticle contributions in the spreading of entropy and mutual information. Importantly, the latter is not affected by entanglement of the system with the external environment. The mutual information is exponentially damped at short times and eventually vanishes signaling the onset of a classical limit. The behavior of the logarithmic negativity is similar and this scenario is common to other dissipations. For weak dissipation, the presence of quasiparticles underlies remarkable scaling behaviors.

TI Citizen science games on the timeline of quantum games
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB This article provides an overview of existing quantum physics-related games, referred to as quantum games, that serve citizen science research in quantum physics. Additionally, we explore the connection between citizen science and quantum computer games, games played on quantum computers. The information presented is derived from academic references and supplemented by diverse sources, including social media publications, conference presentations and blog posts from research groups and developers associated with the presented games. We observe that the current landscape of quantum games is shaped by three distinct driving forces: the serious application of games, the evolution of quantum computers and open game development events such as Quantum Game Jams. Notably, citizen science plays an influential role in all three aspects. The article points to existing design guides for citizen science quantum games and views future prospects of citizen science projects and quantum games through collaborative endeavours, human-machine collaboration and open access quantum computers.

TI Enhancing quantum temporal steering via frequency modulation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Various strategies have been proposed to harness and protect space-like quantum correlations in different models under decoherence. However, little attention has been given to temporal-like correlations, such as quantum temporal steering (TS), in this context. In this work, we investigate TS in a frequency-modulated two-level system coupled to a zero-temperature reservoir in both the weak and strong coupling regimes. We analyze the impact of various frequency-modulated parameters on the behavior of TS and non-Markovian. The results demonstrate that appropriate frequency-modulated parameters can enhance the TS of the two-level system, regardless of whether the system is experiencing Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, a suitable ratio between modulation strength and frequency (i.e., all zeroes of the 0th Bessel function J 0(delta/Omega)) can significantly enhance TS in the strong coupling regime. These findings indicate that efficient and effective manipulation of quantum TS can be achieved through a frequency-modulated approach.

TI Complexity of frustration: A new source of non-local non-stabilizerness
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We advance the characterization of complexity in quantum many-body systems by examining W-states embedded in a spin chain. Such states show an amount of nonstabilizerness or "magic", measured as the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy, that grows logarithmically with the number of qubits/spins. We focus on systems whose Hamiltonian admits a classical point with extensive degeneracy. Near these points, a Clifford circuit can convert the ground state into a W-state, while in the rest of the phase to which the classical point belongs, it is dressed with local quantum correlations. Topological frustrated quantum spin-chains host phases with the desired phenomenology, and we show that their ground state's Stabilizer Renyi Entropy is the sum of that of the W-states plus an extensive local contribution. Our work reveals that W-states/frustrated ground states display a non-local degree of complexity that can be harvested as a quantum resource and has no counterpart in GHZ states/non-frustrated systems.

TI X-ray phase measurements by time-energy correlated photon pairs
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The resolution of a measurement system is fundamentally constrained by the wavelength of the used wave packet and the numerical aperture of the optical system. Overcoming these limits requires advanced interferometric techniques exploiting quantum correlations. While quantum interferometry can surpass the Heisenberg limit, it has been confined to the optical domain. Extending it to x-rays enables sub-angstrom spatial and zeptosecond temporal resolution, unlocking atomic-scale processes inaccessible to existing methods. Here, we demonstrate x-ray quantum interferometry using 17.5-kilo-electron volt ( lambda = 70 picometers) photon pairs. Our approach introduces a phase measurement technique with exceptional noise resilience, mitigating the impact of mechanical instabilities, vibrations, and photonic noise-key challenges in x-ray interferometry. By generating and using entangled x-ray photons, we lay the foundation for next-generation techniques with unprecedented phase precision. This breakthrough carries far-reaching consequences for fundamental physics, high-resolution imaging, and spectroscopy, bringing to light quantum optical effects never before accessed in the x-ray regime.

TI Spectroscopic signatures of biexcitons: A case study in
   Ruddlesden-Popper lead-halides
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances (X1 and X2) with unique lattice coupling. These multiple resonances enable the formation of both self- and cross-coupled biexcitons (mixed biexcitons). Using three spectroscopic techniques-photoluminescence and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES)-we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering the mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.

TI Color-switching in an optical parametric oscillator using a
   phase-conjugate mirror
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We construct a phase-conjugate resonator which passively produces stable pulses that alternate between the probe and the conjugate colors. The requisite phase-conjugate mirror inside the resonator is constructed using non-degenerate four-wave mixing (4WM) in rubidium vapor. The glancing-angle phase-conjugate mirror is a 100% output coupler, and therefore this resonator is unusual in that no light circulates the cavity more than once. Without the gain of the phase-conjugate mirror, the cavity boundary conditions, and thus resonant modes, are not defined and therefore can be tuned by the pump. The output of the optical parametric oscillator that is formed above threshold can passively mode-lock. The phase-conjugate mirror removes thermal or acoustic instabilities that are on a MHz or slower timescale. This work provides a new method for stable pulsing using phase-conjugate optics, and suggests a platform for producing mode-locked pulses with squeezed light, as the 4WM process has already demonstrated quantum correlations.

TI Many-body Bell inequalities for bosonic qubits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Since John Bell formulated his paramount inequality for a pair of spin-1=2 particles, quantum mechanics has been confronted with the postulates of local realism with various equivalent configurations. Current technology, with its advanced manipulation and detection methods, allows to extend the Bell tests to more complex structures. The aim of this work is to analyze a set of Bell inequalities suitable for a possibly broad family of many-body systems with the focus on bosonic qubits. We develop a method that allows for a step-by-step study of the many-body Bell correlations, for instance among atoms forming a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate or between photons obtained from the parametric-down conversion. The presented approach is valid both for cases of fixed and non-fixed number of particles, hence it allows for a thorough analysis of quantum correlations in a variety of many-body systems.

TI Quantum Random Access Memory with Transmon-Controlled Phonon Routing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum random access memory (QRAM) promises simultaneous data queries at multiple memory locations, with data retrieved in coherent superpositions, essential for achieving quantum speedup in many quantum algorithms. We introduce a transmon-controlled phonon router and propose a QRAM implementation by connecting these routers in a treelike architecture. The router controls the motion of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons based on the state of the control transmon, implementing the core functionality of conditional routing for QRAM. Our QRAM design is compact, supports fast routing operations, and avoids frequency crowding. Additionally, we propose a hybrid dual-rail encoding method to detect dominant loss errors without additional hardware, a versatile approach applicable to other QRAM platforms. Our estimates indicate that the proposed QRAM platform can achieve high heralding rates using current device parameters, with heralding fidelity primarily limited by transmon dephasing.

TI Optical signatures of coherence in molecular dimers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We calculate experimentally measurable signatures of quantum correlations in a coupled molecular dimer that strongly interacts with its vibrational environment. We investigate intensity and mode-resolved photon coincidences for different relative orientations of such dimers and observe spatio-temporal correlations for various configurations. We find that projective measurements can produce cooperative signatures even when emitters are arranged orthogonal to each other. To model effects of vibrational environments that are present in realistic experimental situations, we use the polaron framework. Furthermore, we also account for the effects of finite instrument response, varying temperature, and the presence of static disorder. We analyze the effect of disorder in both dimer orientation and measurement direction and find that photon coincidences remain well-resolvable using state-of-the-art detectors. This work enhances our understanding of cooperative emission from two coupled emitters and offers direction for future experiments on probing their coherent dynamics.

TI Limits on sequential sharing of nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Sequential sharing of nonlocal correlation is inherently related to its application. We address the question as to how many observers can share the nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC) in a (d x d)-dimensional state, where d is a prime or a power of a prime. We first analyze the trade-off between disturbance and information gain of the general d-dimensional unsharp measurements. Then in a scenario where multiple Alices perform unsharp measurements on one party of the state sequentially and independently and a single Bob measures coherence of the conditional states on the other party, we show that at most one Alice can demonstrate NAQC with Bob. This limit holds even when considering the weak measurements with optimal pointer states. These results may shed light on the interplay between nonlocal correlations and quantum measurements on high-dimensional systems and the hierarchy of different quantum correlations.

TI Simulating violation of causality using a topological phase transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a topological Hamiltonian and establish correspondence between its eigenstates and the resource for a causal-order game introduced by Oreshkov et al. [Nat. Commun. 3, 1092 (2012)], known as the process matrix. We show that quantum correlations generated in the quantum many-body energy eigenstates of the model can mimic the statistics that can be obtained by exploiting different quantum measurements on the process matrix of the game. This provides an interpretation of the expectation values of the observables computed for the quantum many-body states in terms of the success probabilities of the game. As a result, we show that the ground state of the model can be related to the optimal strategy of the causal-order game. Subsequently, we observe that at the point of maximum violation of the classical bound in the causal-order game, the corresponding quantum many-body model undergoes a second-order quantum phase transition. The correspondence equally holds even when we generalize the game for a higher number of parties.

AB Practical error analysis is essential for the design, optimization, and evaluation of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum(NISQ) computing. However, bounding errors in quantum programs is a grand challenge, because the effects of quantum errors depend on exponentially large quantum states. In this work, we present Gleipnir, a novel methodology toward practically computing verified error bounds in quantum programs. Gleipnir introduces the ((rho) over cap,delta)-diamond norm, an error metric constrained by a quantum predicate consisting of the approximate state (rho) over cap and its distance d to the ideal state rho?. This predicate ((rho) over cap,delta) can be computed adaptively using tensor networks based on the Matrix Product States. Gleipnir features a lightweight logic for reasoning about error bounds in noisy quantum programs, based on the ((rho) over cap,delta)-diamond norm metric. Our experimental results show that Gleipnir is able to efficiently generate tight error bounds for real-world quantum programs with 10 to 100 qubits, and can be used to evaluate the error mitigation performance of quantum compiler transformations.

TI Realistic simulations of spin squeezing and cooperative coupling effects
   in large ensembles of interacting two-level systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We describe an efficient numerical method for simulating the dynamics of interacting spin ensembles in the presence of dephasing and decay. The method builds on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation for isolated systems, which combines the mean-field dynamics of a spin ensemble with a Monte Carlo sampling of discrete initial spin values to account for quantum correlations. Here we show how this approach can be generalized for dissipative spin systems by replacing the deterministic mean-field evolution by a stochastic process, which describes the decay of coherences and populations while preserving the length of each spin. We demonstrate the application of this technique for simulating nonclassical spin-squeezing effects or the dynamics and steady states of cavity QED models with 10(5) interacting two-level systems. This opens up the possibility to perform accurate real-scale simulations of a diverse range of experiments in quantum optics or with solid-state spin ensembles under realistic laboratory conditions.

TI Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy with Intense Entangled-Photon
   Beams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entangled photons carry nontrivial quantum correlations that defy classical physics and provide new tools for monitoring quantum dynamics in molecules. The use of low-flux entangled photons in molecular spectroscopy has been proposed in the past to probe excited-state dynamics with enhanced temporal and spectral resolutions. However, these techniques have been challenging to implement experimentally since the resulting signal has a low signal-to-noise ratio. The signal strength can be boosted by using intense entangled-photon beams, where multiple pairs of entangled photons are present in the environment. This allows the molecule under study to interact with both entangled and unentangled photons, where the classical component of the spectroscopic signal stemming from the latter can mask the spectral features associated with the former. In this Letter, we show how the signal arising from unentangled photons can be eliminated when intense entangled-photon beams are used in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), and demonstrate the advantage of photonic entanglement.

AB Quantum dense coding (QDC) means to transmit two classical bits by only transferring one quantum bit, which has enabled high-capacity information transmission and strengthened system security. Continuousvariable QDC offers a promising solution to increase communication rates while achieving seamless integration with classical communication systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light (RFOL) communication scheme based on QDC with an entangled state, and achieve a practical rate of 20 Mbps through digital modulation and RFOL communication. This scheme bridges the gap between quantum technology and real-world communication systems, which bring QDC closer to practical applications and offer prospects for further enhancement of metropolitan communication networks.

TI Dynamics of entanglement after exceptional quantum quench
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate a quantum quench from a critical to an exceptional point. The initial state, prepared in the ground state of a critical Hermitian system, is time evolved with a non-Hermitian SSH model, tuned to its exceptional point. The single particle density matrix exhibits supersonic modes and multiple light cones, characteristic of non-Hermitian time evolution. These propagate with integer multiples of the original Fermi velocity. In the long time limit, the fermionic Green's function decays spatially as 1/x(2), in sharp contrast to the usual 1/x decay of noninteracting fermions. The entanglement entropy is understood as if all these supersonic modes arise from independent quasiparticles (though they do not), traveling with the corresponding supersonic light cone velocity. The entropy production rate decreases with time and develops plateaus during the time evolution, signaling the distinct velocities in the propagation of nonlocal quantum correlations. At late times, the entanglement entropy saturates to a finite value, satisfying a volume law.

TI The genuinely multipartite nonlocality of graph states is
   model-dependent
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The notion of genuinely multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) was introduced to conceptualize the fact that nonclassical resources involving more than two parties in a nontrivial way may be needed to account for some quantum correlations. In this letter, we first recall the contradictions inherent to the historical definition of GMNL. Second, we turn to one of its redefinitions, called Local-Operations-and-Shared-Randomness GMNL (LOSR-GMNL), proving that all caterpillar graph states (including linear cluster states) have this second property. Finally, we conceptualize a third, alternative definition, which we call Local-Operations-and-Neighbour-Communication GMNL (LONC-GMNL), that is adapted to situations in which short-range communication between some parties might occur. We show that linear cluster states do not have this third property, while GHZ states do. Beyond its technical content, our letter illustrates that rigorous conceptual work is needed before applying the concepts of multipartite nonlocality or entanglement to benchmark the nonclassicality of some experimentally-produced quantum systems.

AB Differential Linear Logic (DiLL) adds to Linear Logic (LL) a symmetrization of three out of the four exponential rules, which allows the expression of a natural notion of differentiation. In this paper, we introduce a codigging inference rule for DiLL and study the categorical semantics of DiLL with codigging using differential categories. The addition of codigging makes the rules of DiLL completely symmetrical. We will explain how codigging is interpreted thanks to the exponential function ex, and in certain cases by the convolutional exponential. In a setting with codigging, every proof is equal to its Taylor series, which implies that every model of DiLL with codigging is quantitative. We provide examples of codigging in relational models, as well as models related to game logic and quantum programming. We also construct a graded model of DiLL with codigging in which the indices witness exponential growth. Codigging makes the exponential of-course connective ! in LL into a monad, where the monad axioms enforce Taylor expansion. As such, codigging opens the door to monadic reformulations of quantitative features in programming languages, as well as further categorical generalizations.

TI Quantum theory of feedback cooling of an anelastic macromechanical
   oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Conventional techniques for laser cooling, by coherent scattering off of internal states or through an optical cavity mode, have so far proved inefficient on mechanical oscillators heavier than a few nanograms. That is because larger oscillators vibrate at frequencies much too small compared to the scattering rates achievable by their coupling to auxiliary modes. Decoherence mechanisms typically observed in heavy low-frequency elastically suspended oscillators also differ markedly from what is assumed in conventional treatments of laser cooling. We show that for a low-frequency anelastic oscillator forming the mechanically compliant end mirror of a cavity, detuned optical readout, together with measurement-based feedback to stiffen and dampen it, can harness ponderomotively generated quantum correlations to realize efficient cooling to the motional ground state. This will pave the way for experiments that call for milligram-scale mechanical oscillators prepared in pure motional states, for example, for tests of gravity???s effect on massive quantum systems.

TI Room-temperature optical non-reciprocity in a Doppler-broadened medium
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a true room-temperature magneticfree non-reciprocity in a Doppler-broadened medium. By applying an additional pump field, the absorption of the forward probe field is significantly enhanced due to the canceling of the Doppler shifts; in contrast, the backward one is weakened due to the optical pumping process. In the experiment, we achieved a forward isolation of 11.47 dB and a backward transmission of 0.94 at 25 degrees C. This approach has potential applications in integrated optics and quantum information processing.

Based on a broad class of informationally complete symmetric measurements, a series of separability criteria are proposed for different bipartite quantum systems using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and p - p- & REG; p,3, respectively. In addition, by comparing and analyzing the existing entanglement criteria and detailed examples, it is not difficult to prove that our proposed criteria are more powerful and comprehensive in entanglement detection.

TI NPA Hierarchy and Extremal Criterion in the Simplest Bell Scenario
SO ENTROPY
AB It is difficult to establish an analytical criterion to identify the boundaries of quantum correlations, even for the simplest Bell scenario. Here, we briefly reviewed the plausible analytical criterion, and we found a way to confirm the extremal conditions from another direction. For that purpose, we analyzed the Navascu & eacute;s-Pironio-Ac & iacute;n (NPA) hierarchy to study the algebraic structure and found that the problem could not be simplified using the 1+AB level. However, considering the plausible criterion, the 1+AB and second levels for correlations were equal, and the extremal condition in the simplest Bell scenario was replaced by that in the 1+AB level. Thus, the correctness of the plausible criterion was verified, and the results demonstrated that the plausible criterion held, thereby explaining its simplicity. It seemed plausible, but now it becomes more certain.

TI Gouy phase of type-I SPDC-generated biphotons
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We consider a double Gaussian approximation to describe the wavefunction of twin photons (also called a biphoton) created in a nonlinear crystal via a type-I spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) process. We find that the wavefunction develops a Gouy phase while it propagates, being dependent of the two-photon correlation through the Rayleigh length. We evaluate the covariance matrix and show that the logarithmic negativity, useful in quantifying entanglement in Gaussian states, although Rayleigh-dependent, does not depend on the propagation distance. In addition, we show that the two-photon entanglement can be connected to the biphoton Gouy phase as these quantities are Rayleigh-length-related. Then, we focus the double Gaussian biphoton wavefunction using a thin lens and calculate a Gouy phase that is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data of D. Kawase et al. published in Ref. [1]. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Quantum recoherence in the early universe
SO EPL
AB - Despite being created through a fundamentally quantum-mechanical process, cosmo-logical structures have not yet revealed any sign of genuine quantum correlations. Among the obstructions to the direct detection of quantum signatures in cosmology, environmental-induced decoherence is arguably one of the most inevitable. Yet, we discover a mechanism of quantum recoherence for the adiabatic perturbations when they couple to an entropic sector. After a transient phase of decoherence, a turning point is reached, recoherence proceeds and adiabatic perturbations exhibit a large amount of self-coherence at late-time. This result is also understood by means of a non-Markovian master equation, which reduces to Wilsonian effective-field theory in the unitary limit. This allows us to critically assess the validity of open-quantum-system meth-ods in cosmology and to highlight that re(de)coherence from linear interactions has no flat-space analogue.

AB Correlated photon pairs generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are a key resource in quantum optics. In many quantum optics applications, such as satellite quantum key distribution (QKD), a compact, high repetition rate pump laser is required. Here we demonstrate the use of a compact, GHz-rate diode-pumped three-element Kerr-lens-modelocked Ti:sapphire laser for the generation of correlated photon pairs at 790 nm. We verify the presence of indistinguishable photons produced via SPDC using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry and observe a dip in coincidence counts with a visibility of 81.8%.

The natural generalisation would be to consider the unital completely positive semigroups on operator systems. We show that any continuous unital completely positive semigroup on matricial systemcan be extended to a semigroup on a finite-dimensional C *-algebra, which is an injective envelope of the matricial system. In case the semigroup is invertible, this extension is unique.

The coupling strength is adjustable via the external magnetic field's direction and the nanomagnet's aspect ratio. Micromagnetic simulation indicates that the stable existence of the center mode determines the occurrence of coupling, which correlates with the direction of the edge demagnetization field. This work offers a novel perspective on the study of magnon-magnon coupling in a single material, which benefits magnon-based quantum information technology.

We theoretically study the echo phenomenon in a single impulsively excited ("kicked") Kerr-nonlinear oscillator. We reveal two types of echoes, "quantum" and "classical" ones, emerging on the long and short time scales, respectively. The mechanisms of the echoes are discussed, and their sensitivity to dissipation is considered. These echoes may be useful for studying decoherence processes in a number of systems related to quantum information processing.

Superadditivity constitutes one of the most fundamental attributes in characterizing the coherence distribution in multipartite quantum systems. In this paper, we provide a way to derive tighter superadditivity inequalities of l(1)-norm coherence measure for arbitrary multiqubit states. We present a category of superadditivity relations related to the alpha th (alpha >= 2) power of l(1)-norm coherence C-l1 under certain conditions.

TI Complete Readout of Two-Electron Spin States in a Double Quantum Dot
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose and demonstrate complete spin state readout of a two-electron system in a double quantum dot probed by an electrometer. The protocol is based on repetitive single-shot measurements using Pauli spin blockade and our ability to tune on fast timescales the detuning and the interdot tunnel coupling between the GHz and sub-Hz regime. A sequence of three distinct manipulations and measurements allows establishing if the spins are in S, T0, T+, or T- state. This work points at a procedure to reduce the overhead for spin readout, an important challenge for scaling up spin-qubit platforms.

TI Environment-Assisted Shortcuts to Adiabaticity
SO ENTROPY
AB Envariance is a symmetry exhibited by correlated quantum systems. Inspired by this "quantum fact of life, " we propose a novel method for shortcuts to adiabaticity, which enables the system to evolve through the adiabatic manifold at all times, solely by controlling the environment. As the main results, we construct the unique form of the driving on the environment that enables such dynamics, for a family of composite states of arbitrary dimension. We compare the cost of this environment-assisted technique with that of counterdiabatic driving, and we illustrate our results for a two-qubit model.

TI Triviality of quantum trajectories close to a directed percolation
   transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates, projective measurements, and control operations that steer the system toward a pure absorbing state. Two types of phase transition occur as the rate of these control operations is increased: a measurement-induced entanglement transition, and a directed percolation transition into the absorbing state (taken here to be a product state). In this work, we show analytically that these transitions are generically distinct, with the quantum trajectories becoming disentangled before the absorbing state transition is reached, and we analyze their critical properties. We introduce a simple class of models where the measurements in each quantum trajectory define an effective tensor network (ETN)-a subgraph of the initial spacetime graph where nontrivial time evolution takes place. By analyzing the entanglement properties of the ETN, we show that the entanglement and absorbing-state transitions coincide only in the limit of the infinite local Hilbert-space dimension. Focusing on a Clifford model which allows numerical simulations for large system sizes, we verify our predictions and study the finite-size crossover between the two transitions at large local Hilbert space dimension. We give evidence that the entanglement transition is governed by the same fixed point as in hybrid circuits without feedback.

TI Exact spectral statistics in strongly localized circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Since the seminal work of Anderson, localization has been recognized as a standard mechanism allowing quantum many-body systems to escape ergodicity. This idea has acquired even more prominence in the last decade as it has been argued that localization???dubbed many-body localization (MBL) in this context???can sometimes survive local interactions in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder. A conventional signature of localization is in the statistical properties of the spectrum???spectral statistics???which differ qualitatively from those in the ergodic phase. Although features of the spectral statistics are routinely used as numerical diagnostics for localization, their derivation from first principles in the presence of nontrivial interactions has been lacking. Here we provide the example of a simple class of quantum many-body systems???which we dub strongly localized quantum circuits???that are interacting and localized and where the spectral statistics can be characterized exactly. Furthermore, we show that these systems exhibit a cascade of three different regimes for spectral correlations depending on the energy scale: at small, intermediate, and large scales they behave as disconnected patches of three decreasing sizes. We argue that these features appear in generic MBL systems, with the difference that only at the smallest scale do they become Poissonian.

TI Islands in the stream of Hawking radiation

AB We consider the island formula for the entropy of subsets of the Hawking radiation in the adiabatic limit where the black hole evaporation is very slow. We find a simple concrete 'on-shell' formula for the generalized entropy which involves the image of the island out in the stream of radiation, the 'island in the stream'. The resulting recipe for the entropy allows us to calculate the quantum information properties of the radiation and verify various constraints including the Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity.

TI Nonlinear enhancement of coherent magnetization dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnets are interesting materials for classical and quantum information technologies. However, the short decoherence and dephasing times that determine the scale and speed of information networks severely limit the appeal of employing the ferromagnetic resonance. Here we show that the lifetime and coherence of the uniform Kittel mode can be enhanced by three-magnon interaction-induced mixing with the long-lived magnons at the minima of the dispersion relation. Analytical and numerical calculations based on this model explain recent experimental results and predict experimental signatures of quantum coherence.

TI Lowering the Helstrom bound with non-standard coherent states

The minimum possible error is known as the Helstrom bound. In this work, we study statistical aspects and quantum limits for states that generalize the Glauber-Sudarshan coherent states, such as nonlinear, Perelomov, Barut-Girardello, and (modified) Susskind-Glogower coherent states. For some of these, we show that the Helstrom bound can be significantly lowered and even vanish in specific regimes. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

In particular, we study a Bures information metric naturally associated with the correlation functions of a conformal field theory. We compute the metric of holographic four-point functions and include corrections generated by tree Witten diagrams in the bulk. In this setting, we translate properties of correlators into the language of information geometry. Cross terms in the information metric encode non-identity operators in the OPE. We find that the information metric is asymptotically AdS. Finally, we discuss an information metric for transition amplitudes.

TI Entanglement duality in spin-spin interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We examine entanglement of thermal states for spin-1/2 dimers in external magnetic fields. Entanglement transition in the temperature-magnetic-field plane demonstrates a duality in spin-spin interactions. This identifies a pair of dual categories of symmetric and antisymmetric dimers with each category classified into toric entanglement classes. The entanglement transition line is preserved from each toric entanglement class to its dual toric class. The toric classification is an indication of the topological signature of the entanglement, which bring about topological stability that could be relevant for quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement criteria based on quantum Fisher information
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB To optimize the entanglement detection, we formulate the metrologically operational entanglement condition in quantum Fisher information by maximizing the QFI on the measurement orbit. Specifically, we consider two classes of typical local observables, i.e. the local orthonormal observables and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures. Result shows that the symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures are superior to local orthonormal observables in entanglement detection, which in some sense hints the yet unconfirmed generally superiority of symmetric informationally complete positive operator- valued measures in quantum information processing.

In this paper, we design an innovative approach leveraging metasurfaces to perform randomized measurements on photonic qubits, together with error mitigation techniques that suppress realistic metasurface measurement noise. Through fidelity and purity estimation, we confirm the capability of metasurfaces to implement randomized measurements and the unbiased nature of our error-mitigated estimator. Our findings show the potential of metasurface-based randomized measurement schemes in achieving robust and resource-efficient estimation of quantum state properties.

TI Compact and high-resolution spectrometer via Brillouin integrated
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical spectrometers are indispensable tools across various fields, from chemical and biological sensing to astronomical observations and quantum technologies. However, the integration of spectrometers onto photonic chips has been hindered by the low spectral resolution or large device footprint with complex multiple channel operations. Here, we introduce a chip-integrated spectrometer by leveraging the acoustically-stimulated Brillouin scattering in a hybrid photonic-phononic chip. The Brillouin interaction provides a dynamic reflection grating with a high reflectivity up to 50% and a fast switching time on the microsecond scale, achieving a spectral resolution of 0.56 nm over a 110 nm bandwidth using just a single 1 mm-long straight waveguide. This performance approaches the fundamental limit of resolution for a given device size, validating the potential of the hybrid photonic-phononic device for efficient and dynamically-reconfigurable spectral analysis, and thus opens up the avenues for advanced optical signal processing and sensing applications.

TI Spatial adiabatic passage of ultracold atoms in optical tweezers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Coherent manipulation of matter waves, a distinctive hallmark of quantum mechanics, is fundamental to modern quantum technologies. Spatial adiabatic passage (SAP) is a prime example of this phenomenon, where a wave packet is transferred between two uncoupled localized modes by adjusting the tunneling coupling to an intermediate third mode in a counterintuitive sequence. Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves. In this study, we demonstrate this quantum interference effect using massive particles that tunnel between three micro-optical traps ("optical tweezers"). We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in low vibrational eigenstates of one trap, followed by manipulating the distance between the traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth and high-efficiency transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, with a very low population remaining in the central trap. These findings open possibilities for advanced control schemes in optical tweezer array platforms.

TI From Goldilocks to twin peaks: multiple optimal regimes for quantum
   transport in disordered networks
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Understanding energy transport in quantum systems is crucial for an understanding of light-harvesting in nature, and for the creation of new quantum technologies. Open quantum systems theory has been successfully applied to predict the existence of environmental noise-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT) as a widespread phenomenon occurring in biological and artificial systems. That work has been primarily focused on several 'canonical' structures, from simple chains, rings and crystals of varying dimensions, to well-studied light-harvesting complexes. Studying those particular systems has produced specific assumptions about ENAQT, including the notion of a single, ideal, range of environmental coupling rates that improve energy transport. In this paper we show that a consistent subset of physically modelled transport networks can have at least two ENAQT peaks in their steady state transport efficiency.

TI Enhanced nonlinear optical response of graphene-based nanoflake van der
   Waals heterostructures
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The nonlinear optical properties of van der Waals bilayer heterostructures composed of graphene/h-BN and graphene/phosphorene nanoflakes are investigated using time-dependent density functional theory. Our calculated results show a significant enhancement of the first-hyperpolarizability value, beta in heterostructures relative to the pristine nanoflakes at lambda = 1064 nm. The calculated enhancement in optical nonlinearity mainly results from in-plane anisotropy induced by the interlayer electronic coupling between the adjacent nanoflake layers; a higher degree of anisotropy is induced by puckered phosphorene compared to atomically flat h-BN yielding chi((2)) value corresponding to the second harmonic generation of similar to 50 pm V-1 in the zigzag graphene/phosphorene bilayer heterostructure. The calculated results clearly show that graphene-based nanoflake heterostructures giving large NLO coefficients together with high electron mobility of these materials offer new opportunities as candidate materials of choice for next-generation photonics and integrated quantum technologies.

TI Stabilizer code model with noninvertible symmetries: Strange fractons,
   confinement, and noncommutative and non-Abelian fusion rules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a stabilizer code model with a qutrit at every edge on a square lattice and with noninvertible plaquette operators. The degeneracy of the ground state is topological as in the toric code, and it also has the usual deconfined excitations consisting of pairs of electric and magnetic charges. However, there are novel types of confined fractonic excitations composed of a cluster of adjacent faces with vanishing flux. They manifest confinement, and even larger configurations of these fractons are fully immobile although they acquire emergent internal degrees of freedom. Deconfined excitations change their nature in presence of these fractonic defects. As for instance, fractonic defects can absorb magnetic charges making magnetic monopoles exist while electric charges acquire restricted mobility. Furthermore, some generalized symmetries can annihilate any ground state and also the full sector of fully mobile excitations. All these properties can be captured via a novel type of noncommutative and non-Abelian fusion category in which the product is associative but does not commute, and can be expressed as a sum of (operator) equivalence classes. Generalized noninvertible symmetries give rise to the feature that the fusion products form a nonunital category without a proper identity. We show that a variant of this model features a deconfined fracton liquid phase and a phase where the dual (magnetic) strings have condensed.

TI Exact Model Reduction for Discrete-Time Conditional Quantum Dynamics
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB Leveraging an algebraic approach built on minimal realizations and conditional expectations in quantum probability, we propose a method to reduce the dimension of quantum filters in discrete-time, while maintaining the correct distributions on the measurement outcomes and the expectations of some relevant observable. The method is presented for general quantum systems whose dynamics depend on measurement outcomes, hinges on a system-theoretic observability analysis, and is tested on prototypical examples.

TI Observing quasiparticles through the entanglement lens
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The low-energy physics of interacting quantum systems is typically understood through the identification of the relevant quasiparticles or low-energy excitations and their quantum numbers. We present a quantum information framework that goes beyond this to examine the nature of the entanglement in the corresponding quantum states. We argue that the salient features of the quasiparticles, including their quantum numbers, locality, and fractionalization, are reflected in the entanglement spectrum and in the mutual information. We illustrate these ideas in the specific context of the d = 1 transverse field Ising model with an integrability breaking perturbation.

TI Control and readout of a transmon using a compact superconducting
   resonator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate control and readout of a superconducting artificial atom based on a transmon qubit using a compact lumped-element resonator. The resonator consists of a parallel-plate capacitor with a wire geometric inductor. The footprint of the resonators is about 200 x 200 mu m(2), which is similar to the standard transmon size and one or two orders of magnitude more compact in the occupied area compared to coplanar waveguide resonators. We observe coherent Rabi oscillations and obtain time-domain properties of the transmon. The work opens a door to miniaturize essential components of superconducting circuits and to further scale up quantum systems with superconducting transmons.

TI Quantum automorphism groups of trees
SO JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY

In particular, for every tree, we show how to iteratively construct its quantum automorphism group using free products and free wreath products. This can be considered a quantum version of Jordan's theorem for the automorphism groups of trees. We use ideas from algebraic combinatorics, quantum groups, and quantum information theory. This is one of the first characterizations of quantum automorphism groups of a natural class of graphs with quantum symmetry.

TI Effective calculation of the Green's function in the time domain on
   near-term quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an improved quantum algorithm to calculate the Green's function through real-time propagation, and use it to compute the retarded Green's function for the two-, three-, and four-site Hubbard models. This protocol significantly reduces the number of controlled operations when compared to those previously suggested in literature. Such reduction is quite remarkable when considering the two-site Hubbard model, for which we show that it is possible to obtain the exact time propagation of the vertical bar N +/- 1 > states by exponentiating one single Pauli component of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to perform the calculations on an actual superconducting quantum processor.

TI Digital Control of a Superconducting Adiabatic Sigma Neuron
SO JETP LETTERS
AB Superconducting adiabatic neurons based on quantum parametrons make it possible to "calculate" sigmoid activation functions and their derivatives in an analog manner in one cycle with record energy efficiency. However, for the application of such systems, it is necessary to determine operation regimes that allow integration with Josephson digital circuits, where information is presented in the form of sequences of picosecond unipolar voltage pulses. The conditions allowing the pulse control of an adiabatic sigma neuron have been theoretically determined in this work. The obtained results allowed us to develop the design of the basic unit for the hardware implementation of analog-digital Josephson neural networks.

TI Measurement-induced heating of a trapped ion
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We experimentally study the heating of trapped atomic ions during measurement of their internal qubit states. During measurement, ions are projected into one of two basis states and discriminated by their state-dependent fluorescence. We observe that ions in the fluorescing state rapidly scatter photons and heat at a rate of n<overline>(center dot)greater than or similar to 2x104 quanta s-1, which is orders of magnitude faster than typical anomalous ion heating rates. We introduce a quantum trajectory-based framework that accurately reproduces the experimental results and provides a unified description of ion heating for both continuous and discrete sources.

TI Correlations breaking homogenization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The standard collisional model paradigm consists of a system that interacts sequentially with identically prepared ancillas. After infinitely many collisions, and under appropriate conditions, the system may converge to the same state as the ancillas. This process, known as homogenization, is independent of the ancilla initial state, being a property only of the underlying dynamics. In this paper we extend this idea to locally identical, but globally correlated, ancillas, and show that correlations break homogenization. This is done numerically using a minimal qubit model, and analytically using an exactly soluble Gaussian model. In both cases, we use Hamiltonian graph states with cyclic graphs as the prototypical method for building scalable many-body entangled ancillary states.

AB In quantum information theory, measurements are represented by positive, operator-valued measures. In this paper, we use the operators corresponding to generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the properties of index of coincidence for few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Quantum Overlapping Tomography

AB Quantum tomography is one of the major challenges of large-scale quantum information research due to the exponential time complexity. In this Letter, we develop and apply a Bayesian state estimation method to experimentally demonstrate quantum overlapping tomography [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 100401 (2020)], a scheme intent on characterizing critical information of a many-body quantum system in logarithmic time complexity. By comparing the measurement results of full-state tomography and overlapping tomography, we show that overlapping tomography gives accurate information of the system with much fewer state measurements than full-state tomography.

Finally, we state two important conjectures relating the quantum and the classical solutions of SudoQ puzzles, corroborated by analytical and numerical evidence.

TI Higher-order quantum transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a quantum algorithm to achieve higher-order transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics. Namely, the algorithm takes as input a finite number of queries to a black-box seed Hamiltonian dynamics to simulate a desired Hamiltonian. Our algorithm efficiently simulates linear transformations of any seed Hamiltonian with a bounded energy range consisting of a polynomial number of terms in system size, making use of only controlledPauli gates and time-correlated randomness. This algorithm is an instance of quantum functional programming, where the desired function is specified as a concatenation of higher-order quantum transformations. By way of example, we demonstrate the simulation of negative time-evolution and time-reversal, and perform a Hamiltonian learning task.

TI A Grover Search-Based Algorithm for the List Coloring Problem

AB Graph coloring is a computationally difficult problem, and currently the best known classical algorithm for k-coloring of graphs on n vertices has runtimes Omega(2(n)) for k >= 5. The list coloring problem asks the following more general question: given a list of available colors for each vertex in a graph, does it admit a proper coloring? We propose a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Grover search 12 to quadratically speed up exhaustive search. Our algorithm loses in complexity to classical ones in specific restricted cases, but improves exhaustive search for cases, where the lists and graphs considered are arbitrary in nature.

TI Many bounded versions of undecidable problems are NP-hard
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Several physically inspired problems have been proven undecidable; examples are the spectral gap problem and the membership problem for quantum correlations. Most of these results rely on reductions from a handful of undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, the tiling problem, the Post correspondence problem or the matrix mortality problem. All these problems have a common property: they have an NP-hard bounded version. This work establishes a relation between undecidable unbounded problems and their bounded NP-hard versions. Specifically, we show that NP-hardness of a bounded version follows easily from the reduction of the unbounded problems. This leads to new and simpler proofs of the NP-hardness of bounded version of the Post correspondence problem, the matrix mortality problem, the positivity of matrix product operators, the reachability problem, the tiling problem, and the ground state energy problem. This work sheds light on the intractability of problems in theoretical physics and on the computational consequences of bounding a parameter.

AB Since quantum spatial searches on networks have a strong network dependence, the question arises whether the universal perspective exists in this quantum algorithm for various networks. Here, we propose a universal scaling hypothesis of the quantum spatial search on complex networks such as small-world and scale-free networks. The average path length, a key quantity in the complex network science, is useful to expose this universal feature, where the collapse plot can be generated for the optimal time, the maximal finding probability, and the optimal hopping parameter. Based on the path integral method, we also clarify that the probability amplitude in the continuous-time quantum walk can be determined by the path length distribution.

TI Quasi-Φ0-Periodic Supercurrent at Quantum Hall Transitions
SO ACS NANO
AB The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate Phi 0 = h/2e periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.

TI Complementarity and the unitarity of the black hole S-matrix
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recently, Akers et al. proposed a non-isometric holographic map from the interior of a black hole to its exterior. Within this model, we study properties of the black hole S-matrix, which are in principle accessible to observers who stay outside the black hole. Specifically, we investigate a scenario in which an infalling agent interacts with radiation both outside and inside the black hole. Because the holographic map involves postselection, the unitarity of the S-matrix is not guaranteed in this scenario, but we find that unitarity is satisfied to very high precision if suitable conditions are met. If the internal black hole dynamics is described by a pseudorandom unitary transformation, and if the operations performed by the infaller have computational complexity scaling polynomially with the black hole entropy, then the S-matrix is unitary up to corrections that are superpolynomially small in the black hole entropy. Furthermore, while in principle quantum computation assisted by postselection can be very powerful, we find under similar assumptions that the S-matrix of an evaporating black hole has polynomial computational complexity.

Path-based link prediction methods utilize the explicit counting of even-and odd-length paths between nodes to quantify a score function and infer new or unobserved links. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for path-based link prediction using a controlled continuous-time quantum walk to encode even and odd path-based prediction scores. Through classical simulations on a few real networks, we confirm that the quantum walk scoring function performs similarly to other path-based link predictors. In a brief complexity analysis we identify the potential of our approach in uncovering a quantum speedup for path-based link prediction.

TI Investigating the current distribution of parallel-configured quantum
   point contacts under quantum Hall conditions
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS
AB Electric-field-controlled charge transport is a crucial concept of modern computers, embodied, namely in field-effect transistors. The metallic gate voltage controls the charge population. Thus, it is possible to define logical elements which are the key to computational processes. Here, we investigate a similar system defined by metallic gates inducing quasi-one-dimensional transport channels on a high-mobility electron system in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field. Firstly, we solve the three-dimensional Poisson equation, self-consistently imposing relevant boundary conditions and use the output as an initial condition to calculate charge density and potential distribution in the plane of a two-dimensional electron system in the presence of an external magnetic field. Subsequently, we impose an external current and obtain the spatial distribution of the transport charges, considering the various magnetic field and gate voltage strengths at sufficiently low (<10 Kelvin) temperatures. Finally, we show that the magnetic field breaks the spatial symmetry of the current distribution, whereas voltage applied to metallic gates determines the scattering processes.

TI Uncovering local integrability in quantum many-body dynamics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Interacting many-body quantum systems and their dynamics, while fundamental to modern science and technology, are formidable to simulate and understand. However, by discovering their symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability, one can unravel their intricacies. Here, using up to 124 qubits of a fully programmable quantum computer, we uncover local conservation laws and integrability in one- and two-dimensional periodically-driven spin lattices in a regime previously inaccessible to such detailed analysis. We focus on the paradigmatic example of disorder-induced ergodicity breaking, where we first benchmark the system crossover into a localized regime through anomalies in the one-particle-density-matrix spectrum and other hallmark signatures. We then demonstrate that this regime stems from hidden local integrals of motion by faithfully reconstructing their quantum operators, thus providing a more detailed portrait of the system's integrable dynamics. Our results demonstrate a versatile strategy for extracting the hidden dynamical structure from noisy experiments on large-scale quantum computers.

TI Quantum Implementation of Non-unitary Operations with Biorthogonal
   Representations
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We propose a new dilation method for implementing non-unitary operators on a quantum computer using the biorthogonal framework. By selecting an appropriate biorthogonal basis for the non-unitary operator, a unitary counterpart can be constructed in the biorthogonal representation, enabling its implementation in the orthonormal computational basis. When compared to other dilation and decomposition methods, the proposed method is particularly efficient for non-contraction, non-unitary operators. In contrast to the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method, the efficiency of the biorthogonal dilation technique is not constrained by the number of unitary summands but instead by the dimensionality of the non-unitary operator. The proposed method complements the LCU method for implementing general non-unitary operators that arise in positive-only open quantum systems, pseudo-Hermitian, and general non-Hermitian systems.

AB Embedding of a knowledge graph(KG) entities and relations in the form of vectors is an important aspect for the manipulation of the KG database for several downstream tasks, such as link prediction, knowledge graph completion, and recommendation. Because of the growing size of the knowledge graph databases, it has become a daunting task for the classical computer to train a model efficiently. Quantum computer can help speedup the embedding process of the KGs by encoding the entities into a variational quantum circuit of polynomial depth. Usually, the time complexity for such variational circuit-dependent quantum classical algorithms for each epoch is O(N poly(log M)), where N is number of elements in the knowledge graph and M is the number of features of each entities of the knowledge graph. In this article we exploit additional quantum advantage by training multiple elements of KG in superpositions, thereby reducing the computing time further for the knowledge graph embedding model.

TI Experimental quantum end-to-end learning on a superconducting processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Machine learning can be enhanced by a quantum computer via its inherent quantum parallelism. In the pursuit of quantum advantages for machine learning with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, it was proposed that the learning model can be designed in an end-to-end fashion, i.e., the quantum ansatz is parameterized by directly manipulable control pulses without circuit design and compilation. Such gate-free models are hardware friendly and can fully exploit limited quantum resources. Here, we report the experimental realization of quantum end-to-end machine learning on a superconducting processor. The trained model can achieve 98% recognition accuracy for two handwritten digits (via two qubits) and 89% for four digits (via three qubits) in the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database. The experimental results exhibit the great potential of quantum end-to-end learning for resolving complex real-world tasks when more qubits are available.

TI Preparing many copies of a quantum state in the black-box model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We describe a simple quantum algorithm for preparing K copies of an N-dimensional quantum state whose amplitudes are given by a quantum oracle. Our result extends a previous work of Grover, who showed how to prepare one copy in time O(???N). In comparison with the naive O(K???N) solution obtained by repeating this procedure K times, our algorithm achieves the optimal running time of ???(???KN). Our technique uses a refinement of the quantum rejection sampling method employed by Grover. As a direct application, we obtain a similar speedup for obtaining K independent samples from a distribution whose probability vector is given by a quantum oracle.

TI Helical Luttinger Liquid on the Edge of a Two-Dimensional Topological
   Antiferromagnet
SO NANO LETTERS
AB A boundary helical Luttinger liquid (HLL) with broken bulk time-reversal symmetry belongs to a unique topological class that may occur in antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, we search for signatures of HLL on the edge of a recently discovered topological AFM, MnBi2Te4 even-layer. Using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device, we directly image helical edge current in the AFM ground state appearing at its charge neutral point. Such a helical edge state accompanies an insulating bulk which is topologically distinct from the ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase, as revealed in a magnetic field driven quantum phase transition. The edge conductance of the AFM order follows a power law as a function of temperature and source-drain bias which serves as strong evidence for HLL. Such HLL scaling is robust at finite fields below the quantum critical point. The observed HLL in a layered AFM semiconductor represents a highly tunable topological matter compatible with future spintronics and quantum computation.

TI Integrated Tool Set for Control, Calibration, and Characterization of
   Quantum Devices Applied to Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efforts to scale-up quantum computation have reached a point where the principal limiting factor is not the number of qubits, but the entangling gate infidelity. However, the highly detailed system characterization required to understand the underlying error sources is an arduous process and impractical with increasing chip size. Open-loop optimal control techniques allow for the improvement of gates but are limited by the models they are based on. To rectify the situation, we provide an integrated opensource tool set for control, calibration, and characterization (C3), capable of open-loop pulse optimization, model-free calibration, model fitting, and refinement. We present a methodology to combine these tools to find a quantitatively accurate system model, high-fidelity gates, and an approximate error budget, all based on a high-performance, feature-rich simulator. We illustrate our methods using simulated fixedfrequency superconducting qubits for which we learn model parameters with less than 1% error and derive a coherence-limited cross-resonance gate that achieves 99.6% fidelity without the need for calibration.

TI Thermo-optic phase shifters based on silicon-on-insulator platform:
   state-of-the-art and a review
SO FRONTIERS OF OPTOELECTRONICS
AB Silicon photonic platforms offer relevance to large markets in many applications, such as optical phased arrays, photonic neural networks, programmable photonic integrated circuits, and quantum computation devices. As one of the basic tuning devices, the thermo-optic phase shifter (TOPS) plays an important role in all these applications. A TOPS with the merits of easy fabrication, low power consumption, small thermal time constant, low insertion loss, small footprint, and low crosstalk, is needed to improve the performance and lower the cost of the above applications. To meet these demands, various TOPS have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated on different foundry platforms In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of TOPS, including metal heater, doped silicon, silicide, with silicon substrate undercut for heat insulation, folded waveguide structure, and multi-pass waveguide structure. We further compare these TOPSs and propose the directions of the future developments on TOPS.

TI Superiorly low half-wave voltage electro-optic polymer modulator for
   visible photonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Chip-scale optical devices operated at wavelengths shorter than communication wavelengths, such as LiDAR for autonomous driving, bio-sensing, and quantum computation, have been developed in the field of photonics. In data processing involving optical devices, modulators are indispensable for the conversion of electronic signals into optical signals. However, existing modulators have a high half-wave voltage-length product (V pi L) which is not sufficient at wavelengths below 1000 nm. Herein, we developed a significantly efficient optical modulator which has low V pi L of 0.52 V.cm at lambda = 640 nm using an electro-optic (EO) polymer, with a high glass transition temperature (T-g = 164 degrees C) and low optical absorption loss (2.6 dB/cm) at lambda = 640 nm. This modulator is not only more efficient than any EO-polymer modulator reported thus far, but can also enable ultra-high-speed data communication and light manipulation for optical platforms operating in the ranges of visible and below 1000 nm infrared.

TI Optimizing microring resonator performance via femtosecond laser:
   post-fabrication trimming of resonance wavelength and coupling regimes
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Integrated silicon photonic devices, especially microring resonators, are susceptible to fabrication variations, with even nanoscale errors potentially leading to suboptimal performance, thereby hindering their large-scale production and commercialization. This study demonstrates femtosecond-laser-based post-fabrication trimming of microring resonators, achieving controllable and permanent adjustments to the resonance wavelengths and coupling regimes. Micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed the trimming mechanism, whereas systematic analysis highlighted performance variations among the on-chip devices. The experimental results showed directional resonance wavelength shifts with long-term stability and minimal reduction in the quality factor. The overcoupling devices were tuned to near-critical coupling to improve the extinction ratio exceeding 22 dB. This approach promises to accelerate the industrialization of high-performance, cost-effective photonic devices. 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Color Image Encryption Scheme Based on Geometric Transformation
   and Intensity Channel Diffusion
SO MATHEMATICS
AB A quantum color image encryption algorithm based on geometric transformation and intensity channel diffusion was designed. Firstly, a plaintext image was transformed into a quantum state form using the quantum image representation based on HSI color space (QIRHSI) representation as a carrier. Next, a pseudo-random sequence was generated using the generalized logistic map, and the pixel positions permuted multiple two-point swap operations. Immediately afterward, the intensity values were changed by an intensity bit-plane cross-swap and XOR, XNOR operations. Finally, the intensity channel of the above image was diffused in combination with the pseudo-confusion sequence as produced by the quantum logistic map to perform a diffusion operation on the intensity bit-plane to obtain the ciphertext image. Numerical simulations and analyses show that the designed algorithm is implementable and robust, especially in terms of outstanding performance and less computational complexity than classical algorithms in terms of security perspective.

TI Dual-map framework for noise characterization of quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In order to understand the capabilities and limitations of quantum computers, it is necessary to develop methods that efficiently characterize and benchmark error channels present on these devices. In this paper, we present a method that faithfully reconstructs a marginal (local) approximation of the effective noise (MATEN) channel, that acts as a single layer at the end of the circuit. We first introduce a dual-map framework that allows us to analytically derive expectation values of observables with respect to noisy circuits. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) that also justify the MATEN, even in the presence of nonlocal errors that occur during a circuit. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the method on Rigetti???s Aspen-11 quantum computer for QAOA circuits up to six qubits, successfully predicting the observed measurements on a majority of the qubits.

TI Nanoelectromechanical Spectral Control of Silicon Bowtie Nanocavities
   for Quantum Light Sources
SO NANO LETTERS
AB We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of tunable waveguide-coupled silicon bowtie cavities with strong spatial electromagnetic field confinement. We use nanoelectromechanical in-plane actuation for the tuning, as this combines cryocompatibility with ultralow power consumption. Our device leverages a mode volume below 0.2 cubic wavelengths in the material to reach theoretical Purcell factors above 6,500 and waveguide-coupling efficiency above 30% across the full experimentally measured spectral-tuning range of 11 nm. Our spectral measurements demonstrate reversible tuning of bowtie cavities, and we directly show the in-plane actuation using in situ characterization in a scanning electron microscope. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a low-loss tunable bowtie nanocavity with strong light confinement. This solves a key issue for experiments on strong light-matter interactions for cavity quantum electrodynamics and scalable photonic quantum technologies.

TI Non-Gaussian dissipative quantum thermometry beyond Gaussian bounds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The fundamental metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems remain largely unresolved, particularly regarding the role of non-Gaussian quantum resources. In this paper, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies.

TI Solving Quantum Dynamics with a Lie-Algebra Decoupling Method
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum technologies rely on the control of quantum systems at the level of individual quanta. Mathematically, this control is described by Hamiltonian or Liouvillian evolution, requiring the application of various techniques to solve the resulting dynamic equations. Here, we present a tutorial for how the quantum dynamics of systems can be solved using a Lie-algebra decoupling method. The approach involves identifying a Lie algebra that governs the dynamics of the system, enabling the derivation of differential equations to solve the Schr & ouml;dinger equation. As background, we include an overview of Lie groups and Lie algebras aimed at a general-physicist audience. We then prove the Lie-algebra decoupling theorem and apply it to both closed and open dynamics. The results represent a broad methodology to find the dynamics of quantum systems with applications across many fields of modern quantum research.

TI Hybrid quantum thermal machines with dynamical couplings
SO ISCIENCE
AB Quantum thermal machines can perform useful tasks, such as delivering power, cooling, or heating. In this work, we consider hybrid thermal machines, that can execute more than one task simultaneously. We characterize and find optimal working conditions for a three-terminal quantum thermal machine, where the working medium is a quantum harmonic oscillator, coupled to three heat baths, with two of the couplings driven periodically in time. We show that it is possible to operate the thermal machine efficiently, in both pure and hybrid modes, and to switch between different operational modes simply by changing the driving frequency. Moreover, the proposed setup can also be used as a high-performance transistor, in terms of output-to-input signal and differential gain. Owing to its versatility and tunability, our model may be of interest for engineering thermody-namic tasks and for thermal management in quantum technologies.

TI Observation of frequency-uncorrelated photon pairs generated by
   counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We report the generation of frequency-uncorrelated photon pairs from counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a periodically-poled KTP waveguide. The joint spectral intensity of photon pairs is characterized by measuring the corresponding stimulated process, namely, the difference frequency generation process. The experimental result shows a clear uncorrelated joint spectrum, where the backward-propagating photon has a narrow bandwidth of 7.46 GHz and the forward-propagating one has a bandwidth of 0.23 THz like the pump light. The heralded single-photon purity estimated through Schmidt decomposition is as high as 0.996, showing a perspective for ultra-purity and narrow-band single-photon generation. Such unique feature results from the backward-wave quasi-phase-matching condition and does not has a strict limitation on the material and working wavelength, thus fascinating its application in photonic quantum technologies.

TI Vortex control in superconducting Corbino geometry networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In superconductors, vortices induced by a magnetic field are nucleated where some random fluctuations determine the nucleation position, and then may be pinned by impurities or boundaries, impeding the development of vortex-based quantum devices. Here, we propose a superconducting structure, which allows to nucleate and control vortices on-demand by controlling magnetic fields and currents. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, we study a driven vortex motion in two-dimensional Corbino geometries of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions. We remedy the randomness of nucleation by introducing normal conducting rails to the Corbino disk to guide the nucleation process and motion of vortices towards the junction. We elaborate on the consequences of rail-vortex and vortex-vortex interactions to the quantization of resistance across the junction. Finally, we simulate the nucleations and manipulations of two and four vortices in Corbino networks, and discuss its application to Majorana zero mode braiding operations. Our study provides a potential route towards quantum computation with non-Abelian anyons.

TI Quantum speed-up in global optimization of binary neural nets
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The performance of a neural network (NN) for a given task is largely determined by the initial calibration of the network parameters. Yet, it has been shown that the calibration, also referred to as training, is generally NP-complete. This includes networks with binary weights, an important class of networks due to their practical hardware implementations. We therefore suggest an alternative approach to training binary NNs. It utilizes a quantum superposition of weight configurations. We show that the quantum training guarantees with high probability convergence towards the globally optimal set of network parameters. This resolves two prominent issues of classical training: (1) the vanishing gradient problem and (2) common convergence to sub-optimal network parameters. We prove that a solution is found after approximately 4n(2) log (n/d) root(N) over tilde calls to a comparing oracle, where delta represents a precision, n is the number of training inputs and (N) over tilde is the number of weight configurations. We give the explicit algorithm and implement it in numerical simulations.

TI Experimental Insights into Impurity Incorporation in Chemical Vapor
   Deposition Doped Diamond
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Diamond's exceptional properties as a wide bandgap semiconductor make it a leading candidate for next-generation power electronics and quantum technologies. However, achieving precise control over the incorporation of active dopants, such as boron, phosphorus, and nitrogen, remains a key challenge in the fabrication of diamond-based devices. Herein, over 100 literature sources are reviewed and analyzed to evaluate and compare dopant incorporation efficiency in single-crystal diamond synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. It also incorporates some data from polycrystalline layers for broader comparison. Specifically, the influence of dopant precursor concentration in the plasma and substrate orientation is investigated. The findings offer new insights and provide a useful reference metric for optimizing doped diamond synthesis.

TI Rare-Earth Ion Intercalation in Graphene via Thermal and Electrostatic
   Control
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Atomic-scale control and understanding the controlling strategy of ion intercalation are pivotal for advancing energy storage, quantum technologies, and adaptive electronics. While intercalation - the insertion of ions into layered materials - has transformative potential, the mechanisms driving it, particularly for rare-earth ions, remain poorly understood. Here, a thermal-electrostatic strategy is developed to achieve reversible and tunable europium ion intercalation that enables precise control over intercalation dynamics. This study investigates how temperature and voltage influence the intercalation of europium ions into bilayer graphene. Our results reveal the formation of a 2D europium layer and ionic state of intercalation europium within the graphene structure, providing fundamental insights into intercalation energetics. This work establishes a versatile platform for designing adaptive 2D heterostructure, engineering advanced materials and devices with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties.

TI Low-loss on-chip superconducting microwave circulator assisted by
   shunting capacitors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ferrite-free circulators that are passive and readily integratable on a chip are highly sought-after in quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. In our previous work, we implemented such a circulator using a three-Josephson-junction loop that exhibited unambiguous nonreciprocity and signal circulation, but required junction energies to be within 1% of design values. This tolerance is tighter than standard junction fabrication methods provide, so we propose and demonstrate a design improvement that relaxes the required junction fabrication precision, allowing for higher device performance and fabrication yield. Specifically, we introduce large direct capacitive couplings between the waveguides, which based on the modeling we describe here, requires less stringent junction fabrication tolerance. We implement the design, and measure enhanced "circulation fidelity" above 97%, with optimized on-resonance insertion loss of 0.2 dB, isolation of 18 dB, and power reflectance of -15 dB, in good agreement with model calculations.

TI ADAQ-SYM: Automated symmetry analysis of defect orbitals
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum technologies like single photon emitters and qubits can be enabled by point defects in semiconductors, with the NV-center in diamond being the most prominent example. There are many different semiconductors, each potentially hosting interesting defects. The symmetry properties of the point defect orbitals can yield useful information about the behavior of the system, such as the interaction with polarized light. We have developed a tool to perform symmetry analysis of point defect orbitals obtained by plane-wave density functional theory simulations. The software tool, named ADAQ-SYM, calculates the characters for each orbital, finds the irreducible representations, and uses selection rules to find which optical transitions are allowed. The capabilities of ADAQSYM are demonstrated on several defects in diamond and 4H-SiC. The symmetry analysis explains the different zero phonon line (ZPL) polarization of the hk and kh divacancies in 4H-SiC.

TI Resonance-Amplified Terahertz Near-Field Spectroscopy of a Single
   Nanowire
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nanoscale material systems are central to next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies, yet their development remains hindered by limited characterization tools, particularly at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Far-field THz spectroscopy techniques lack the sensitivity for investigating individual nanoscale systems, whereas in near-field THz nanoscopy, surface states, disorder, and sample-tip interactions often mask the response of the entire nanoscale system. Here, we present a THz resonance-amplified near-field spectroscopy technique that can detect subtle conductivity changes in isolated nanoscale systems-such as a single InAs nanowire-under ultrafast photoexcitation. By exploiting the spatial localization and resonant field enhancement in the gap of a bowtie antenna, our approach enables precise measurements of the nanostructures through shifts in the antenna resonant frequency, offering a direct means of extracting the system response, and unlocking investigations of ultrafast charge-carrier dynamics in isolated nanoscale and microscale systems.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The fabrication of a yttrium orthosilicate (YSO) whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator is described, displaying quality (Q)-factors as high as 1.1 x 109. An overview of the experimental setup is presented including the procedure for spatial and spectral characterisation of the WGMs. We consider the optical losses present in such a resonator and what steps were taken in order to minimise these losses. The surface scattering in such a resonator is considered and we show that in the wavelength range of 1.5 mu m, the Q-factor is not limited by scattering losses for the case in which surface inhomogeneities are weakly correlated. The high Q-factors we demonstrate have implications for rare earth ion dopant based quantum technologies because YSO is an important host material for these applications.

TI 36 Hz integral linewidth laser based on a photonic integrated 4.0 m coil
   resonator
SO OPTICA
AB Laser stabilization sits at the heart of many precision scientific experiments and applications, including quantum information science, metrology, and atomic timekeeping. Many of these systems narrow the laser linewidth and stabilize the carrier by use of Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking to a table-scale, ultrahigh quality factor (Q), vacuum spaced Fabry-Perot reference cavity. Integrating these cavities to bring characteristics of PDH stabilization to the chip scale is critical to reducing their size, cost, and weight, and enabling a wide range of portable and system-on-chip applications. We report a significant advance in integrated laser linewidth narrowing, stabilization, and noise reduction by use of a photonic integrated 4.0 m long coil resonator to stabilize a semiconductor laser. We achieve a 36 Hz 1/pi-integral linewidth, Allan deviation of 1.8 x 10(-13) at 10 ms measurement time, and a 2.3 kHz/s drift-to the best of our knowledge, the lowest integral linewidth and highest stability demonstrated for an integrated waveguide reference cavity. This performance represents over an order of magnitude improvement in integral linewidth and frequency noise over previous integrated waveguide PDH stabilized reference cavities and bulk-optic and integrated injection locked approaches, and over two orders of magnitude improvement in frequency and phase noise than integrated injection locked approaches. Two different wavelength coil designs are demonstrated, stabilizing lasers at 1550 nm and 1319 nm. The resonator is bus-coupled to a 4.0 m long coil, with a 49 MHz free spectral range, mode volume of 1.0 x 10(10) mu m(3), and 142 million intrinsic Q, fabricated in a CMOS compatible, ultralow loss silicon nitride waveguide platform. Our measurements and simulations show that the thermorefractive noise floor for this particular cavity is reached for frequencies down to 20 Hz in an ambient environment with simple passive vibration isolation and without vacuum or thermal isolation. The thermorefractive noise limited performance is estimated to yield an 8 Hz 1/pi-integral linewidth and Allan deviation of 5 x 10(-14) at 10 ms, opening a stability regime that heretofore has been available only in fundamentally non-integrated systems. These results demonstrate the potential to bring the characteristics of laboratory-scale stabilized lasers to the integrated, wafer-scale compatible chip scale, and are of interest for a number of applications in quantum technologies and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and with further developments below 10 Hz linewidth, can be highly relevant to ultralow noise microwave generation.

TI Quantum Logic Control of a Transition Metal Ion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Extending quantum control to increasingly complex systems is crucial for both advancing quantum technologies and fundamental physics. In trapped ion systems, quantum logic techniques that combine a well-controlled logic species with a more complex spectroscopy species have proven to be a powerful tool for extending the range of accessible species. Here, we demonstrate that a quantum system as complex as 48Ti+ with its many metastable states can be controlled employing a combination of intrinsic thermalization due to collisions with background gas and quantum-logic techniques using a far-detuned Raman laser. The preparation of pure quantum states allows coherent manipulation and high resolution measurements of the Zeeman structure in 48Ti+. The presented techniques are applicable to a wide range of ionic species giving access to a larger variety of systems for fundamental physics and constitute the first step for quantumcontrolled spectroscopy of transition metals, relevant, e.g., for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra.

TI Electrical-Readout Microwave-Free Sensing with Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB While nitrogen-vacancy (N-V & minus;) centers have been extensively investigated in the context of spin -based quantum technologies, the spin-state readout is conventionally performed optically, which may limit miniaturization and scalability. Here, we report photoelectric readout of ground-state cross-relaxation features, which serves as a method for measuring electron-spin resonance spectra of nanoscale electronic environments and also for microwave-free sensing. As a proof of concept, by systematically tuning N-V centers into resonance with the target electronic system, we extract the spectra for the P1 electronic spin bath in diamond. Such detection may enable probing optically inactive defects and the dynamics of local spin environment. We also demonstrate a magnetometer based on photoelectric detection of the ground -state level anticrossings (GSLACs), which exhibits a favorable detection efficiency as well as magnetic sensitivity. This approach may offer potential solutions for determining spin densities and characterizing local environment.

TI Josephson-like Oscillations in Toroidal Spinor Bose-Einstein
   Condensates: A Prospective Symmetry Probe
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Josephson junctions are essential ingredients in the superconducting circuits used in many existing quantum technologies. Additionally, ultracold atomic quantum gases have also become essential platforms to study superfluidity. Here, we explore the analogy between superconductivity and superfluidity to present an intriguing effect caused by a thin finite barrier in a quasi-one-dimensional toroidal spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In this system, the atomic current density flowing through the edges of the barrier oscillates, such as the electrical current through a Josephson junction in a superconductor, but in our case, there is no current circulation through the barrier. We also show how the nontrivial broken-symmetry states of spinor BECs change the structure of this Josephson-like current, creating the possibility to probe the spinor symmetry, solely using measurements of this superfluid current.

TI Magnetic brightening and its dynamics of defect-localized exciton
   emission in monolayer two-dimensional semiconductor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum light sources, especially single-photon emitters, are crucial for advancing quantum technologies. Despite extensive research, the behavior of defect-localized excitons in monolayer WSe2 under external perturbations, such as magnetic fields, remain underexplored. This study investigates the nature and dynamics of defect-localized excitons under in-plane magnetic fields using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Observations reveal a sharp PL peak, indicative of single-photon emission, with doublet peaks from hybridized spin-state excitons. Notably, magnetic brightening of the PL peak was detected at a low magnetic field (<1 tesla), and the dynamics of hybridized-state excitons under magnetic fields indicated field-induced state mixing, explaining the magnetic brightening. These findings advance tunable single-photon emitters controlled by magnetic fields, with implications for quantum optics applications.

TI Strong Coupling of Carbon Quantum Dots in Liquid Crystals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Carbon quantum dots (CDs) have recently received a tremendous amount ofinterest owing to their attractive optical properties. However, CDs have broad absorption andemission spectra limiting their application ranges. We herein, for thefirst time, show synthesis ofwater-soluble red emissive CDs with a very narrow line width (similar to 75 meV) spectral absorbance andhence demonstrate strong coupling of CDs and plasmon polaritons in liquid crystallinemesophases. The excited state dynamics of CDs has been studied by ultrafast transient absorptionspectroscopy, and CDs display very stable and strong photoluminescence emission with aquantum yield of 35.4% and a lifetime of similar to 2 ns. More importantly, we compareJ-aggregate dyeswith CDs in terms of their absorption line width, photostability, and ability to do strong coupling,and we conclude that highlyfluorescent CDs have a bright future in the mixed light-matter statesfor emerging applications in future quantum technologies.

TI Demonstration of an integrated nanophotonic chip-scale alkali vapor
   magnetometer using inverse design
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Recently, there has been growing interest in the miniaturization and integration of atomic-based quantum technologies. In addition to the obvious advantages brought by such integration in facilitating mass production, reducing the footprint, and reducing the cost, the flexibility offered by on-chip integration enables the development of new concepts and capabilities. In particular, recent advanced techniques based on computer-assisted optimization algorithms enable the development of newly engineered photonic structures with unconventional functionalities. Taking this concept further, we hereby demonstrate the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of an integrated nanophotonic-atomic chip magnetometer based on alkali vapor with a micrometer-scale spatial resolution and a magnetic sensitivity of 700 pT/root Hz. The presented platform paves the way for future applications using integrated photonic-atomic chips, including high-spatial-resolution magnetometry, near-field vectorial imaging, magnetically induced switching, and optical isolation.

TI Coherent perfect absorption in Tavis-Cummings models
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We theoretically study the conditions under which two laser fields can undergo Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA) when shined on a single-mode bi-directional optical cavity coupled with two two-level quantum emitters (natural atoms, artificial atoms, quantum dots, qubits, etc.). In addition to being indirectly coupled through the cavity-mediated field, in our Tavis-Cummings model, the two quantum emitters (QEs) are allowed to interact directly via the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). Under the mean-field approximation and low-excitation assumption, in this work, we particularly focus on the impact of DDI on the existence of CPA in the presence of decoherence mechanisms (spontaneous emission from the QEs and the leakage of photons from the cavity walls). We also present a dressed-state analysis of the problem to discuss the underlying physics related to the allowed polariton state transitions in the Jaynes-Tavis-Cummings ladder. As a key result, we find that in the strong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the strong DDI and the emitter-cavity detuning can act together to achieve the CPA at two laser frequencies tunable by the inter-atomic separation which are not possible to attain with a single QE in the presence of detuning. Our CPA results are potentially applicable in building quantum memories that are an essential component in long-distance quantum networking.

AB Ultracold atoms provide a platform for analog quantum computer capable of simulating the quantum turbulence that underlies puzzling phenomena like pulsar glitches in rapidly spinning neutron stars. Unlike other platforms like liquid helium, ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the Eigenvalue soLvers for Petaflop Applications library that enable us to diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how dissipation and thermalization proceed in fermionic quantum turbulence by using the internal structure of vortices as a new probe of the local effective temperature. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate rapid scientific progress in the field of ultracold Fermi gases.

TI Realizing intrinsic Chern half-metallicity and large anomalous Hall
   conductivity in 2D BaNiCl3
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report atomically thin BaNiCl3, a layered halide perovskite, as a rare intrinsic Chern half-metal from first-principles calculations. The system exhibits complete spin polarization with a high Chern number (C = 2), a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity of 316 Omega(-1),cm(-1), and ultrafast carrier dynamics with v(F)approximate to 0.78x10(6) m s(-1). Spin-orbit coupling opens a 20 meV bandgap, generating strong Berry-curvature hotspots that enhance Hall response. Ferromagnetism is stabilized by the Ni2+ (d(8)) configuration and Cl-mediated superexchange. This combination of half-metallicity, SOC-induced topology, and robust anomalous Hall transport positions BaNiCl3 as a promising 2D platform for dissipationless spintronics and quantum technologies.

Broadening effects due to diffraction or group velocity dispersion are balanced by the nonlinear interaction with the medium while cavity losses balance the input energy. The history, properties, physical interpretation and wide application of cavity solitons are reviewed. Cavity solitons in the plane perpendicular to light propagation find application in optical information processing, while cavity solitons in the longitudinal direction produce high-quality frequency combs with applications in optical communications, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS, astronomy and quantum technologies.This article is part of the theme issue 'The quantum theory of light'.

TI Tensor networks for unsupervised machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Modeling the joint distribution of high-dimensional data is a central task in unsupervised machine learning. In recent years, many interests have been attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have the advantages of a principle understanding of the expressive power using entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting classical computation and quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing tensor network models for unsupervised machine learning only work as a proof of principle, as their performance is much worse than the standard models such as restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this Letter, we present autoregressive matrix product states (AMPS), a tensor network model combining matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and autoregressive modeling from machine learning. Our model enjoys the exact calculation of normalized probability and unbiased sampling. We demonstrate the performance of our model using two applications, generative modeling on synthetic and real-world data, and reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing tensor network models and the restricted Boltzmann machines, and is competitive with state-of-the-art neural network models.

TI Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes nondiagonalizable. Steady states, i.e., zero modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes nondiagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach toward the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling toward the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight W of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value W = 1 may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

TI Characterizing Matrix-Product States and Projected Entangled-Pair States
   Preparable via Measurement and Feedback
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here, we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPSs) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. In one dimension, we show that states with Abelian-symmetry-protected topological order are a restricted class of MF-preparable states. In two dimensions, we parametrize a subset of states with Abelian topological order that are MF preparable. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.

TI Spin polarised quantised transport via one-dimensional nanowire-graphene
   contacts
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Graphene spintronics offers a promising route to achieve low power 2D electronics for next generation classical and quantum computation. As device length scales are reduced to the limit of the electron mean free path, the transport mechanism crosses over to the ballistic regime. However, ballistic transport has yet to be shown in a graphene spintronic device, a necessary step towards realising ballistic spintronics. Here, we report ballistic injection of spin polarised carriers via one-dimensional contacts between magnetic nanowires and a high mobility graphene channel. The nanowire-graphene interface defines an effective constriction that confines charge carriers over a length scale smaller than that of their mean free path. This is evidenced by the observation of quantised conductance through the contacts with no applied magnetic field and a transition into the quantum Hall regime with increasing field strength. These effects occur in the absence of any constriction in the graphene itself and occur across several devices with transmission probability in the range T = 0.08 - 0.30.

TI False vacuum decay in triamond lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The transition from a false vacuum to the true vacuum is a real-time phenomenon of interest in many contexts. It represents a special challenge for strongly interacting non-Abelian gauge theories because standard spacetime lattices incorporate imaginary time from the outset. To attain real-time phenomena, Hamiltonian lattice methods are being developed for quantum computers. The present work considers SU(2) gauge theory on a minimal lattice in three spatial dimensions, where round-the-world strings called torelons can travel and interact. This minimal 3D lattice has a triamond structure whose properties are elucidated by calculating the spectrum of torelon states. Then, by introducing a twisted boundary condition, real-time evolution is used to demonstrate the decay of a false vacuum. Calculations in the present work are done on classical computers except for one benchmark study of imaginary time evolution that ran on the IBM_BRISBANE quantum computer.

In this paper, not only the general theory is presented, but also the results of successful factorizations of the numbers 247 and 143 using Shor's algorithm from a quantum computer simulator. An interesting fact is that no ancillary qubits were needed in these factorizations. Based on the content of the paper, the conclusion also suggests possible future work on the development of this modular exponentiation function implementation.

TI On reconstruction of states from evolution induced by quantum dynamical
   semigroups perturbed by covariant measures
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this work, we show the ability to restore states of quantum systems from evolution induced by quantum dynamical semigroups perturbed by covariant measures. Our procedure describes reconstruction of quantum states transmitted via quantum channels, and as a particular example, it can be applied to the reconstruction of photonic states transmitted via optical fibers. For this, the concept of perturbation by covariant operator-valued measure in a Banach space is introduced and integral representation of the perturbed semigroup is explicitly constructed. Various physically meaningful examples are provided. In particular, a model of the perturbed dynamics in the symmetric (boson) Fock space is developed as covariant measure for a semiflow of shifts and its perturbation in the symmetric Fock space, and its properties are investigated. Another example may correspond to the Koopman-von Neumann description of a classical oscillator with bounded phase space.

TI Robust simulations of many-body symmetry-protected topological phase
   transitions on a quantum processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Topology and symmetry play critical roles in characterizing quantum phases of matter. Recent advancements have unveiled symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in many-body systems as a unique class of short-range entangled states, notable for their nontrivial edge modes and characteristic ground-state entanglement gap. In this study, we demonstrate the robust simulation of many-body ground states of an Ising-cluster model on a quantum computer. By employing the method of quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) combined with enhanced zero-noise extrapolation techniques, we achieve accurate measurements of the transition between trivial and cluster SPT phases. Furthermore, we measured the characteristic edge modes and their associated topological entanglement properties, such as the second R & eacute;nyi entropy, reduced density matrix, and entanglement spectral gap. Our work demonstrates the potential of using QITE in investigating sophisticated quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena on quantum computers.

TI Fermionic and bosonic quantum field theories from quantum cellular
   automata in three spatial dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the past decade or so, there has been a growing number of papers postulating a correspondence relating quantum cellular automata (QCAs) to quantum field theories (QFTs). If valid, this would relate two important but seemingly unconnected physical systems and offer the potential for a deeper understanding of both. For example, it could lead to algorithms for simulating QFTs on a quantum computer. Moreover, it is possible that nature actually obeys a QCA model and it is the corresponding QFT that is a mere approximation. However, verifying the QCA/QFT correspondence beyond the single-particle case has proven challenging, especially in more than one spatial dimension. Here we construct quantum cellular automata that, in the long-wavelength limit, yield a multiparticle theory for free fermions and bosons in three spatial dimensions: the Dirac and Maxwell field theories, i.e., free QED.

AB Computation and information theory are fundamental across disciplines such as physics, computer science, chemistry, biology, and even philosophy.

TI The Generation of Equal-Intensity and Multi-Focus Optical Vortices by a
   Composite Spiral Zone Plate
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a new vortex lens for producing multiple focused coaxial vortices with approximately equal intensities along the optical axis, termed equal-intensity multi-focus composite spiral zone plates (EMCSZPs). In this typical methodology, two concentric conventional spiral zone plates (SZPs) of different focal lengths were composited together and the alternate transparent and opaque zones were arranged with specific m-bonacci sequence. Based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory, the focusing properties of the EMCSZPs were calculated in detail and the corresponding demonstration experiment was been carried out to verify our proposal. The investigations indicate that the EMCSZPs indeed exhibit superior performance, which accords well with our physical design. In addition, the topological charges (TCs) of the multi-focus vortices can be flexibly selected and controlled by optimizing the parameters of the zone plates. These findings which were demonstrated by the performed experiment may open new avenues towards improving the performance of biomedical imaging, quantum computation and optical manipulation.

TI Multigap topology and non-Abelian braiding of phonons from first
   principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Non-Abelian states of matter, in which the final state depends on the order of the interchanges of two quasipar-ticles, can encode information immune from environmental noise with the potential to provide a robust platform for topological quantum computation. We demonstrate that phonons can carry non-Abelian frame charges at the band-crossing points of their frequency spectrum, and that external stimuli can drive their braiding. We present a general framework to understand the topological configurations of phonons from first-principles calculations using a topological invariant called Euler class, and provide a complete analysis of phonon braiding by combining different topological configurations. Taking a well-known dielectric material Al2O3 as a representative example, we demonstrate that electrostatic doping gives rise to phonon band inversions that can induce redistribution of the frame charges, leading to non-Abelian braiding of phonons. Our work provides a quasiparticle platform for realizable non-Abelian braiding in reciprocal space, and expands the tool set for studying braiding processes.

TI Phase-Manipulation-Induced Majorana Mode and Braiding Realization in
   Iron-Based Superconductor Fe(Te,Se)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A recent experiment reported the evidence of dispersing one-dimensional Majorana mode trapped by the crystalline domain walls in FeSe0.45Te0.55. Here, we perform the first-principles calculations to show that iron atoms in the domain wall spontaneously form the ferromagnetic order in line with orientation of the wall. The ferromagnetism can impose a pi phase difference between the domain-wall-separated surface superconducting regimes under the appropriate width and magnetization of the wall. Accordingly, the topological surface superconducting state of FeSe0.45Te0.55 can give rise to one-dimensional Majorana modes trapped by the wall. More interestingly, we further propose a surface junction in the form of FeSe0.45Te0.55-ferromagnet-FeSe0.45Te0.55, which can be adopted to create and fuse the Majorana zero modes through controlling the width or magnetization of the interior ferromagnetic barrier. The braiding and readout of Majorana zero modes can be realized by the designed device. Such surface junction has the potential application in the superconducting topological quantum computation.

TI A Majorana perspective on understanding and identifying axion insulators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB An axion insulator is theoretically introduced to harbor unique surface states with half-integer Chern number C. Recently, experimental progress has been made in different candidate systems, while a unique Hall response to directly reflect the half-integer Chern number is still lacking to distinguish an axion state from other possible insulators. Here we show that the C = 12 axion state corresponds to a topological state with Chern number N = 1 in the Majorana basis. In proximity to an s - wave superconductor, a topological phase transition to an N = 0 phase takes place at critical superconducting pairing strength. Our theoretical analysis shows that a chiral Majorana hinge mode emerges at the boundary of N = 1 and N = 0 regions on the surface of an axion insulator. Furthermore, we propose a half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductance via a thermal transport measurement, which is a signature of the gapless chiral Majorana mode and thus confirms the C = 1/2 (N = 1) topological nature of an axion state. Our proposals help to theoretically comprehend and experimentally identify the axion insulator and may benefit the research of topological quantum computation.

TI Integrability and scattering of the boson field theory on a lattice
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A free boson on a lattice is the simplest field theory one can think of. Its partition function can be easily computed in momentum space. However, this straightforward solution hides its integrability properties. Here, we use the methods of exactly solvable models, that are currently applied to spin systems, to a massless and massive free boson on a 2D lattice. The Boltzmann weights of the model are shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation with a uniformization given by trigonometric functions in the massless case, and Jacobi elliptic functions in the massive case. We diagonalize the row-to-row transfer matrix, derive the conserved quantities, and implement the quantum inverse scattering method. Finally, we construct two factorized scattering S matrix models for continuous degrees of freedom using trigonometric and elliptic functions. These results place the free boson model in 2D in the same position as the rest of the models that are exactly solvable a la Yang-Baxter, offering possible applications in quantum computation.

TI Graphene Monolayer Nanomesh Structures and Their Applications in

In this respect, the main parameters characterizing any nonlinear device for energy harvesting are extracted from tens of measurements performed on a single chip containing the fabricated diodes. The best nano-perforated graphene structure is the triangle nanomesh structure, which exhibits remarkable performance in terms of its characteristic parameters, e.g., a 420 Omega differential resistance for optimal impedance matching to an antenna, a high responsivity greater than 103 V/W, and a low noise equivalent power of 847 pW/root Hz at 0 V.

TI Examining the quantum signatures of optimal excitation energy transfer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The transport and capture of photo-induced electronic excitations is of fundamental interest to the design of energy efficient quantum technologies and to the study of potential quantum effects in biology. Using a simple quantum optical model, we examine the influence of coherence, entanglement, and cooperative dissipation on the transport and capture of excitation energy. We demonstrate that the rate of energy extraction is optimized under conditions that minimize the quantum coherence and entanglement of the system, which is a consequence of spontaneous parity time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then examine the effects of vibrational disorder and show that dephasing can be used to enhance the transport of delocalized excitations in settings relevant to biological photosynthesis. Our results highlight the rich, emergent behavior associated with the quantum-toclassical transition with relevance to the design of room-temperature quantum devices.

TI Isotopic Control of the Boron-Vacancy Spin Defect in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of boron-vacancy (V-B(-)) centers hosted in isotopically engineered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. We first show that isotopic purification of hBN with N-15 yields a simplified and well-resolved hyperfine structure of V-B(-) centers, while purification with B-10 leads to narrower ESR linewidths. These results establish isotopically purified h(10)B(15)N crystals as the optimal host material for future use of V-B(-) spin defects in quantum technologies. Capitalizing on these findings, we then demonstrate optically induced polarization of N-15 nuclei in h(10)B(15)N, whose mechanism relies on electron-nuclear spin mixing in the V-B(-) ground state. This work opens up new prospects for future developments of spin-based quantum sensors and simulators on a two-dimensional material platform.

TI Fragility of gate-error metrics in simulation models of flux-tunable
   transmon quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Constructing a quantum computer requires immensely precise control over a quantum system. A lack of precision is often quantified by gate-error metrics, such as the average infidelity or the diamond distance. However, usually such gate-error metrics are only considered for individual gates and not the errors that accumulate over consecutive gates. Furthermore, it is not well known how susceptible the metrics are to the assumptions which make up the model. Here we investigate these issues using realistic simulation models of quantum computers with flux-tunable transmons and coupling resonators. Our main findings reveal that (i) gate-error metrics are indeed affected by the many assumptions of the model, (ii) consecutive gate errors do not accumulate linearly, and (iii) gate-error metrics are poor predictors for the performance of consecutive gates. Additionally, we discuss a potential limitation in the scalability of the studied device architecture.

TI Second-Order Temporal Coherence of Polariton Lasers Based on an
   Atomically Thin Crystal in a Microcavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Bosonic condensation and lasing of exciton polaritons in microcavities is a fascinating solid-state phenomenon. It provides a versatile platform to study out-of-equilibrium many-body physics and has recently appeared at the forefront of quantum technologies. Here, we study the photon statistics via the second-order temporal correlation function of polariton lasing emerging from an optical microcavity with an embedded atomically thin MoSe2 crystal. Furthermore, we investigate the macroscopic polariton phase transition for varying excitation powers and temperatures. The lower-polariton exhibits photon bunching below the threshold, implying a dominant thermal distribution of the emission, while above the threshold, the second-order correlation transits towards unity, which evidences the formation of a coherent state. Our findings are in agreement with a microscopic numerical model, which explicitly includes scattering with phonons on the quantum level.

TI Degenerate photons from a cryogenic spontaneous parametric
   down-conversion source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate the generation of degenerate photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down-conversion in titanium-indiffused waveguides in lithium niobate at cryogenic temperatures. Since the phase matching cannot be temperature tuned inside a cryostat, we rely on a precise empirical model of the refractive indices when fabricating a fixed poling period. We design the phase-matching properties of our periodic poling to enable signal and idler photons at 1559.3(6) nm and characterize the indistinguishability of our photons by performing a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurement. Despite the effects of photorefraction and pyroelectricity, which can locally alter the phase matching, we achieve cryogenic indistinguishable photons within 1.5 nm of our design wavelength. Our results verify sufficient understanding and control of the cryogenic nonlinear process, which has wider implications when combining quasi-phase-matched nonlinear optical processes with other cryogenic photonic quantum technologies, such as superconducting detectors.

TI Quantum signal processing for simulating cold plasma waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Numerical modeling of radio-frequency waves in plasma with sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution remains challenging even with modern computers. However, such simulations can be sped up using quantum computers in the future. Here, we propose how to do such modeling for cold plasma waves, in particular, for an X wave propagating in an inhomogeneous one-dimensional plasma. The wave system is represented in the form of a vector Schr??dinger equation with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Block encoding is used to represent the Hamiltonian through unitary operations that can be implemented on a quantum computer. To perform the modeling, we apply the so-called quantum signal processing algorithm and construct the corresponding circuit. Quantum simulations with this circuit are emulated on a classical computer, and the results show agreement with traditional classical calculations. We also discuss how our quantum circuit scales with the resolution.

TI Faster spectral density calculation using energy moments
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB Accurate predictions of inclusive scattering cross sections in the linear response regime require efficient and controllable methods to calculate the spectral density in a strongly-correlated many-body system. In this work we reformulate the recently proposed Gaussian Integral Transform technique in terms of Fourier moments of the system Hamiltonian which can be computed efficiently on a quantum computer. One of the main advantages of this framework is that it allows for an important reduction of the computational cost by exploiting previous knowledge about the energy moments of the spectral density. For a simple model of medium mass nucleus like Ca-40 and target energy resolution of 1 MeV we find an expected speed-up of approximate to 125 times for the calculation of the giant dipole response and of approximate to 50 times for the simulation of quasi-elastic electron scattering at typical momentum transfers.

TI Matrix product operator algebras II: phases of matter for 1D mixed
   states
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The mathematical classification of topological phases of matter is a crucial step toward comprehending and characterizing the properties of quantum materials. In this study, our focus is on investigating phases of matter in one-dimensional open quantum systems. Our goal is to elucidate the emerging phase diagram of one-dimensional tensor network mixed states that act as renormalization fixed points. These operators hold special significance since, as we prove, they manifest as boundary states of two-dimensional topologically ordered states, encompassing all known two-dimensional topological phases. To achieve their classification we begin by constructing families of such states from C*-weak Hopf algebras, which are algebras with fusion categories as their representations, and we present explicit local fine-graining and coarse-graining quantum channels defining the renormalization procedure. Lastly, we prove that a subset of these states, originating from C*-Hopf algebras, are in the trivial phase.

TI On the optimal certification of von Neumann measurements
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this report we study certification of quantum measurements, which can be viewed as the extension of quantum hypotheses testing. This extension involves also the study of the input state and the measurement procedure. Here, we will be interested in two-point (binary) certification scheme in which the null and alternative hypotheses are single element sets. Our goal is to minimize the probability of the type II error given some fixed statistical significance. In this report, we begin with studying the two-point certification of pure quantum states and unitary channels to later use them to prove our main result, which is the certification of von Neumann measurements in single-shot and parallel scenarios. From our main result follow the conditions when two pure states, unitary operations and von Neumann measurements cannot be distinguished perfectly but still can be certified with a given statistical significance. Moreover, we show the connection between the certification of quantum channels or von Neumann measurements and the notion of q-numerical range.

TI Complete Active Space Methods for NISQ Devices: The Importance of
   Canonical Orbital Optimization for Accuracy and Noise Resilience
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB To avoid the scaling of the number of qubits with the size of the basis set, one can divide the molecula r space into active and inactive regions, which is also known as complete active space methods. However, selecting the ac t i v e space alone is not enough to accurately describe quantum mechanical effects such as correlation. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing the active space orbitals to describe correlation and improve the basis-dependent Hartree-Fock energies. We wi l l explore classical and quantum computation methods for orbital optimization and compare the chemically inspired ansatz, UCCSD, with the classical full CI approach for describing the active space in both weakly and strongly correlated molecules. Finally, we wi l l investigate the practical implementation of a quantum CASSCF, where hardware-efficient circuits must be used and noise can interfere with accuracy and convergence. Additionally, we wi l l examine the impact of using canonical and noncanonical active orbitals on the convergence of the quantum CASSCF routine in the presence of noise.

TI Simulating Dynamical Phases of Chiral p + ip Superconductors with
   a Trapped ion Magnet
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Two-dimensional p + ip superconductors and superfluids are systems that feature chiral behavior emerging from the Cooper pairing of electrons or neutral fermionic atoms with nonzero angular momen-tum. Their realization has been a longstanding goal because they offer great potential utility for quantum computation and memory. However, they have so far eluded experimental observation both in solid-state systems as well as in ultracold quantum gases. Here, we propose to leverage the tremendous control offered by rotating two-dimensional trapped-ion crystals in a Penning trap to simulate the dynamical phases of two-dimensional p + ip superfluids. This is accomplished by mapping the presence or absence of a Cooper pair into an effective spin-1/2 system encoded in the ions' electronic levels. We show how to infer the topological properties of the dynamical phases, and discuss the role of beyond mean-field corrections. More broadly, our work opens the door to use trapped-ion systems to explore exotic models of topological superconductivity and also paves the way to generate and manipulate skyrmionic spin textures in these platforms.

TI Robust and optimal control of open quantum systems
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Recent advancements in quantum technologies have highlighted the importance of mitigating system imperfections, including parameter uncertainties and decoherence effects, to improve the performance of experimental platforms. However, most of the previous efforts in quantum control are devoted to the realization of arbitrary unitary operations in a closed quantum system. Here, we improve the algorithm that suppresses system imperfections and noises, providing notably enhanced scalability for robust and optimal control of open quantum systems. Through experimental validation in a superconducting quantum circuit, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms its conventional counterpart for closed quantum systems with an ultralow infidelity of about 0.60%, while the complexity of this algorithm exhibits the same scaling, with only a modest increase in the prefactor. This work represents a notable advancement in quantum optimal control techniques, paving the way for realizing quantum-enhanced technologies in practical applications.

TI Room-Temperature Low-Voltage Control of Excitonic Emission in Transition
   Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Charge doping of materials with 2D and 3D quantum confinement is a flexible tool to tailor their excitonic emission. Here, using electron doping experiments on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, reversible tuning of charged exciton emission within a redshift of up to 75 meV is demonstrated by applying very modest voltages (corresponding roughly to the band gap of TMDs), while also controlling the radiative lifetime and intensity. It is found that the neutral exciton ionization dynamics at increasing electron doping follows the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which allows to determine the size of the band gap as well as to extract experimental values for effective masses of electrons and holes at room temperature. The tunable excitonic emission, preserving coherence at room temperature, holds great promise for quantum technologies requiring deterministic coupling with integrated photonic and plasmonic devices.

TI Probing Phases of Quantum Matter with an Ion-Trap Tensor-Network Quantum
   Eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Tensor-network (TN) states are efficient parametric representations of ground states of local quantum Hamiltonians extensively used in numerical simulations. Employing TN Ansatz states directly on a quantum simulator can potentially offer an exponential computational advantage over purely numerical simulation. We implement a quantum-encoded TN Ansatz state using a variational quantum eigensolver on an ion-trap quantum computer that approximates the ground states of the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The generated states are characterized by estimating the topological invariants, verifying their topological order. Our TN encoding as a trapped-ion circuit employs only single-site optical pulses-the native operations naturally available on the platform. We reduce nearest-neighbor crosstalk by selec-ting different magnetic sublevels with well-separated transition frequencies to encode the qubits in neighboring ions.

TI Phase-Programmable Gaussian Boson Sampling Using Stimulated Squeezed
   Light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report phase-programmable Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) which produces up to 113 photon detection events out of a 144-mode photonic circuit. A new high-brightness and scalable quantum light source is developed, exploring the idea of stimulated emission of squeezed photons, which has simultaneously near-unity purity and efficiency. This GBS is programmable by tuning the phase of the input squeezed states. The obtained samples are efficiently validated by inferring from computationally friendly subsystems, which rules out hypotheses including distinguishable photons and thermal states. We show that our GBS experiment passes a nonclassicality test based on inequality constraints, and we reveal nontrivial genuine high-order correlations in the GBS samples, which are evidence of robustness against possible classical simulation schemes. This photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang 2.0, yields a Hilbert space dimension up to similar to 1043, and a sampling rate similar to 1024 faster than using brute-force simulation on classical supercomputers.

TI Fabrication and characterization of impedance-transformed Josephson
   parametric amplifier
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In this paper, we introduce a method of using a double-layer resist lift-off process to prepare the capacitor dielectric layer for fabricating impedance-engineered Josephson parametric amplifiers (IMPAs). Compared to prior art, this method enhances fabrication success rate and accelerates production. The IMPA we made, experimentally achieves an instantaneous bandwidth over 950 (600) MHz with a gain exceeding 10 (14) dB, along with saturation input power of -115 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. We demonstrate the negligible backaction from the IMPA on superconducting qubits, resulting in no significant degradation of the relaxation time and coherence time of the qubits. The IMPA improves the signal-to-noise ratio from 1.69 to 14.56 and enables the amplification chain to achieve high quantum efficiency with eta approximate to 0.26, making it a critical necessity for large-scale quantum computation.

TI Cooperative and selective redox doping switches single-molecule
   magnetism
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The controlled manipulation of electronic and magnetic states in single-molecule magnets (SMMs) is crucial for their implementation in molecular electronics, spintronics, and quantum computation. In typical SMMs, key properties like magnetic anisotropy and slow magnetic relaxation are imposed by complex ligand shells, whose bulky and three-dimensional structures hamper efficient manipulation of the molecular magnetism by chemical methods. This work demonstrates highly selective redox doping of an Fe4 nanomagnet on a Pb(111) surface using lithium atoms. Scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations reveal the cooperative incorporation of three Li atoms per Fe4 molecule, resulting in a selective, threefold reduction of its iron-based magnetic core. The doping modifies the intramolecular exchange interaction, turning from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, and changes the molecular magnetic anisotropy from easy-axis to easy-plane. This study demonstrates successful chemical redox doping of individual polynuclear molecular magnets, exploits a rare showcase of cooperative binding, and highlights a route for tuning magnetic properties of complex SMMs.

TI Optimal Quantum Circuit Cuts with Application to Clustered Hamiltonian
   Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study methods to replace entangling operations with random local operations in a quantum computation, at the cost of increasing the number of required executions. First, we consider "spacelike cuts" where an entangling unitary is replaced with random local unitaries. We propose an entanglement measure for quantum dynamics, the product extent, which bounds the cost in a procedure for this replacement based on two copies of the Hadamard test. In the terminology of prior work, this procedure yields a quasiprobability decomposition with minimal 1-norm in a number of cases, which addresses an open question of Piveteau and Sutter. As an application, we give an improved algorithm for clustered Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically we show that interactions can be removed at a cost, which is exponential in the sum of their strengths times the evolution time, and vanishing in the limit of weak interactions. We also give an improved upper bound on the cost of replacing wires with measure-and-prepare channels using "timelike cuts." We prove a matching information-theoretic lower bound when estimating output probabilities.

TI Process tensor distinguishability measures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Process tensors are quantum combs describing the evolution of open quantum systems through multiple steps of quantum dynamics. While there is more than one way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken to ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data-processing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability measures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that the first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data-processing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized divergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results of generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties we proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi divergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications. Particularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories whose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum processes and resource theories of quantum strategies.

TI Interferometry of quantum correlation functions to access
   quasiprobability distribution of work
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, intimately connected with the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times, is becoming increasingly relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. This quasiprobability distribution can take non-positive values, and its experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Here, we use an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate this scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of work and analyze the behavior of its first and second moments. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, we study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr & ouml;dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.

SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Quantifying and controlling the coherent dynamics and couplings of optically active excitations in solids is of paramount importance in fundamental research in condensed matter optics and for their prospective optoelectronic applications in quantum technologies. Here, we perform ultrafast coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of a charge-tunable MoSe2 monolayer. The experiments show that the homogeneous and inhomogeneous line width and the population decay of exciton complexes hosted by this material can be directly tuned by an applied gate bias, which governs the Fermi level and therefore the free carrier density. By performing two-dimensional spectroscopy, we also show that the same bias-tuning approach permits us to control the coherent coupling strength between charged and neutral exciton complexes.

TI Optimizing ion implantation to create shallow NV centre ensembles in
   high-quality CVD diamond
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centre (so-called NV-centre) in diamond is one of the most promising systems for applications in quantum technologies because of the possibility to optically manipulate and read out the spin state of this defect, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, obtaining high NV densities (>500 ppb) close to the surface (5-20 nm) while maintaining good spin properties remain challenging. In this work we rely on a versatile ion implantation system allowing both implanting nitrogen using N-2(+) and creating vacancies with He+ ion bombardment at variable energies and fluence to create shallow NV ensembles. By optimizing the ion irradiation conditions as well as the surface preparation prior to treatment we successfully increase the amount of created colour centres while demonstrating narrow magnetic resonance linewidths.

TI Enhancement of proximity-induced superconductivity in a planar Ge hole
   gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hole gases in planar germanium can have high mobilities in combination with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable g factors, and are therefore emerging as a promising platform for creating hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices. A key challenge towards hybrid Ge-based quantum technologies is the design of high-quality interfaces and superconducting contacts that are robust against magnetic fields. In this work, by combining the assets of aluminum, which provides good contact to the Ge, and niobium, which has a significant superconducting gap, we demonstrate highly transparent low-disordered JoFETs with relatively large ICRN products that are capable of withstanding high magnetic fields. We furthermore demonstrate the ability of phase-biasing individual JoFETs, opening up an avenue to explore topological superconductivity in planar Ge. The persistence of superconductivity in the reported hybrid devices beyond 1.8 T paves the way towards integrating spin qubits and proximity-induced superconductivity on the same chip.

TI Interferometric detection of continuous-variable entanglement using two
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin-Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states. We also take into account experimental noise, including photon loss and detection inefficiency, as well as finite measurement statistics.

TI Charging a Dimerized Quantum XY Chain
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum batteries are quantum systems designed to store energy and release it on demand. The optimization of their performance is an intensively studied topic within the realm of quantum technologies. Such optimization forces the question: how do quantum many-body systems work as quantum batteries? To address this issue, we rely on symmetry and symmetry breaking via quantum phase transitions. Specifically, we analyze a dimerized quantum XY chain in a transverse field as a prototype of an energy storage device. This model, which is characterized by ground states with different symmetries depending on the Hamiltonian parameters, can be mapped onto a spinless fermionic chain with superconducting correlations, displaying a rich quantum phase diagram. We show that the stored energy strongly depends on the quantum phase diagram of the model when large charging times are considered.

SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB All-optical control of terahertz pulses is essential for the development of optoelectronic devices for next-generation quantum technologies. Despite substantial research in THz generation methods, polarization control remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate that by exploiting band structure topology, both helicity-dependent and helicityindependent THz emission can be generated from nanowires of the topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. We show that narrowband THz pulses can be generated at oblique incidence by driving the system with optical (1.55 eV) pulses with circular polarization. Varying the incident angle also provides control of the peak emission frequency, with peak frequencies spanning 0.21-1.40 THz as the angle is tuned from 15 to 45 degrees. We therefore present Cd3As2 nanowires as a promising novel material platform for controllable terahertz emission.

This helicoidal potential, engineered via structured light fields with orbital angular momentum, imposes a twisted geometry on the atomic ensemble during confinement. We examine how this geometry shapes the initial quantum state-particularly its spatial localization and phase structure-and how these features influence the subsequent free evolution. Our analysis reveals that the overall confinement geometry supports the formation of spatially coherent, structured wavepackets, paving the way for the realization of twisted Bose-Einstein condensates and directed atom lasers. The results are of particular interest for applications in quantum technologies, such as coherent atom beam shaping, matter-wave interferometry, and guided transport of quantum matter.

   TiO2 for quantum emitters
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Erbium-doped TiO2 materials are promising candidates for advancing quantum technologies, necessitating a thorough understanding of their electronic and crystal structures to tailor their properties and enhance coherence times. This study explored epitaxial erbium-doped rutile TiO2 films deposited on r-sapphire substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy demonstrated decreasing photoluminescence lifetimes with erbium doping, indicating limited optical coherence times. Lattice distortions associated with Er3+ were probed by x-ray absorption spectroscopy, indicating that erbium primarily occupies Ti4+ sites and influences oxygen vacancies. Significant lattice distortions in the higher-order shells and apparent full coordination around erbium suggest that additional defects are likely prevalent in these regions. These findings indicate that defects contribute to limited coherence times by introducing alternative decay pathways, leading to shorter photoluminescence lifetimes.

TI Limits to the sensitivity of a rare-earth-enabled cryogenic vibration
   sensor
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Cryogenics is a pivotal aspect in the development of quantum technologies. Closed-cycle devices have recently emerged as an environmentally friendly and low-maintenance alternative to liquid helium cryostats. Yet the larger level of vibrations in dry cryocoolers forbids their use in most sensitive applications. In a recent work, we have proposed an inertial, broadband, contactless sensor based on the piezospectroscopic effect, i.e., the natural sensitivity of optical lines to strain exhibited by impurities in solids. This sensor builds on the exceptional spectroscopic properties of rare earth ions and operates below 4 K, where spectral hole burning considerably enhances the sensitivity. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental and technical limitations of this vibration sensor by comparing a rigid sample attachment to the cold stage of a pulse-tube cryocooler and a custom-designed exchange gas chamber for acoustic isolation.

TI Engineering and Probing Non-Abelian Chiral Spin Liquids Using
   Periodically Driven Ultracold Atoms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a scheme to implement Kitaev's honeycomb model with cold atoms, based on a periodic (Floquet) drive, in view of realizing and probing non-Abelian chiral spin liquids using quantum simulators. We derive the effective Hamiltonian to leading order in the inverse-frequency expansion, and show that the drive opens up a topological gap in the spectrum without mixing the effective Majorana and vortex degrees of freedom. We address the challenge of probing the physics of Majorana fermions, while having access only to the original composite spin degrees of freedom. Specifically, we propose to detect the properties of the chiral spin liquid phase using gap spectroscopy and edge quenches in the presence of the Floquet drive. The resulting chiral edge signal, which relates to the thermal Hall effect associated with neutral Majorana currents, is found to be robust for realistically prepared states. By combining strong interactions with Floquet engineering, our work paves the way for future studies of non-Abelian excitations and quantized thermal transport using quantum simulators.

TI An efficient quantum partial differential equation solver with chebyshev
   points
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Differential equations are the foundation of mathematical models representing the universe's physics. Hence, it is significant to solve partial and ordinary differential equations, such as Navier-Stokes, heat transfer, convection-diffusion, and wave equations, to model, calculate and simulate the underlying complex physical processes. However, it is challenging to solve coupled nonlinear high dimensional partial differential equations in classical computers because of the vast amount of required resources and time. Quantum computation is one of the most promising methods that enable simulations of more complex problems. One solver developed for quantum computers is the quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solver, which uses the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm (QAEA). This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the QAEA by utilizing Chebyshev points for numerical integration to design robust quantum PDE solvers. A generic ordinary differential equation, a heat equation, and a convection-diffusion equation are solved. The solutions are compared with the available data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We show that the proposed implementation provides a two-order accuracy increase with a significant reduction in solution time.

TI Tunable coupling between InSb nanowires and superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB The quest for topological states in hybrid nanowire devices has ignited substantial research in perfecting the nanowire-superconductor interface. Recent proposals, however, suggest that these immaculate interfaces can lead to an overly strong superconducting-semiconducting coupling that "metalizes" the nanowire (i.e., dominates its intrinsic properties which are essential for hosting topological particles). One way to reduce this coupling is to add an insulating shell between the nanowire and the superconductor. Here, we explore cadmium telluride (CdTe) shells as a tunnel barrier at the interface between indium antimonide (InSb) nanowires and a superconductor. We demonstrate the growth of epitaxial, defect-free CdTe on InSb and high-quality superconductor deposition at cryogenic temperatures, enabled by the near perfect lattice match of CdTe and InSb and their comparable thermal-expansion coefficients. Using growth and etching, we control the thickness of CdTe shells down to a few monolayers. This level of control indicates the potential of these shells to serve as a knob that modulates the coupling between a nanowire and a superconductor, possibly introducing a new generation of nanowire hybrids suitable for topological Majorana devices.

TI Combining hard and soft decoders for hypergraph product codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Hypergraph product codes are a class of constant-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes equipped with a linear-time decoder called small-set-flip (SSF). This decoder displays sub-optimal performance in practice and requires very large error correcting codes to be effective. In this work, we present new hybrid decoders that combine the belief propagation (BP) algorithm with the SSF decoder. We present the results of numerical simulations when codes are subject to independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. We provide evidence that the threshold of these codes is roughly 7.5% assuming an ideal syndrome extraction, and remains close to 3% in the presence of syndrome noise. This result subsumes and significantly improves upon an earlier work by Grospellier and Krishna (arXiv:1810.03681). The low-complexity high-performance of these heuristic decoders suggests that decoding should not be a substantial difficulty when moving from zero-rate surface codes to constant-rate LDPC codes and gives a further hint that such codes are well-worth investigating in the context of building large universal quantum computers.

TI Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by 2 pi rotations of the phase phi of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces H0(phi) based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective sigma x gate and a projective sigma s-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.

   spin-orbit spillage, machine learning, and experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnetic topological insulators and semimetals have a variety of properties that make them attractive for applications, including spintronics and quantum computation, but very few high-quality candidate materials are known. In this paper, we use systematic high-throughput density functional theory calculations to identify magnetic topological materials from the approximate to 4000 three-dimensional materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. First, we screen materials with net magnetic moment >0.5 mu B and spin-orbit spillage (SOS) >0.25, resulting in 25 insulating and 564 metallic candidates. The SOS acts as a signature of spin-orbit-induced band-inversion. Then we carry out calculations of Wannier charge centers, Chern numbers, anomalous Hall conductivities, surface band structures, and Fermi surfaces to determine interesting topological characteristics of the screened compounds. We also train machine learning models for predicting the spillages, band gaps, and magnetic moments of new compounds, to further accelerate the screening process. We experimentally synthesize and characterize a few candidate materials to support our theoretical predictions.

TI Quantum Zeno approach for molecular energies with maximum commuting
   initial Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose to use a quantum adiabatic and simulated-annealing framework to compute the ground state of small molecules. The initial Hamiltonian of our algorithms is taken to be the maximum commuting Hamiltonian that consists of a maximal set of commuting terms in the full Hamiltonian of molecules in the Pauli basis. We consider two variants. In the first method, we perform the adiabatic evolution on the obtained time- or path-dependent Hamiltonian with the initial state as the ground state of the maximum commuting Hamiltonian. However, this method does suffer from the usual problems of adiabatic quantum computation due to degeneracy and energy-level crossings along the Hamiltonian path. This problem is mitigated by a Zeno method, i.e., via a series of eigenstate projections used in the quantum simulated annealing, with the path-dependent Hamiltonian augmented by a sum of Pauli X terms, whose contribution vanishes at the beginning and the end of the path. In addition to the ground state, the low lying excited states can be obtained using this quantum Zeno approach with equal accuracy to that of the ground state.

TI Development of a Capping Layer for Air-Stable 2D WTe2
   Materials
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Two-dimensional tungsten ditelluride (2D WTe2) possesses a rich variety of unconventional properties, which are particularly promising for fundamental studies of topologically nontrivial states and their potential applications in advanced electronics and quantum technologies. Given that the majority of future applications rely on stable charge transport characteristics, the susceptibility of WTe2 to oxidation under ambient conditions presents a significant challenge, limiting its practical use. In this study, we present an innovative inorganic polysilazane capping layer that can be converted to silica to effectively isolate 2D WTe2 structures from oxygen and water. Additionally, WTe2 surface passivation with n-hexylamine is also tested. Charge transport measurements at low temperatures for as-grown, polysilazane-capped, and n-hexylamine-functionalized structures demonstrate that the developed inorganic polysilazane capping layer efficiently protects from oxidation in an ambient environment, thereby allowing 2D WTe2 to maintain its structural integrity and electronic characteristics over extended periods.

SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB The development of superconducting thin films has opened new avenues in electronic and quantum technologies, offering potential breakthroughs in performance due to their unique properties such as zero electrical DC resistance and perfect diamagnetism. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) stands out as a highly precise and uniform technique for fabricating these films based on sequential, and self-limiting gas-solid surface reactions, offering distinct advantages over other deposition methods. This review explores the role of ALD in the production of superconducting thin films, highlighting its ability to control film thickness at the atomic level, ensuring superior uniformity and conformality. The fundamentals of superconductors and the ALD process are discussed, along with a review of various materials used in the field. It also examines the existing and potential applications of these films and considers future prospects and challenges in the field.

TI Corrupted sensing quantum state tomography
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The reliable characterization of quantum states as well as any potential noise in various quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. In this work we propose the concept of corrupted sensing quantum state tomography which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of quantum states and structured noise with the aid of simple Pauli measurements only. Without additional prior information, we investigate the reliability and robustness of the framework. The power of our protocol is demonstrated by assuming sparse Gaussian and Poisson noise for low-rank state tomography. In particular, our approach is able to achieve a high quality of the recovery with incomplete sets of measurements and is also suitable for performance improvement of large quantum systems. It is envisaged that the techniques can become a practical tool to greatly reduce the cost and computational effort for quantum tomography in noisy quantum systems.

TI Bilateral photon emission from a vibrating mirror and entanglement
   generation
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Entanglement plays a crucial role in the development of quantum-enabled devices. One significant objective is the deterministic creation and distribution of entangled states, achieved, for example, through a mechanical oscillator interacting with confined electromagnetic fields. In this study, we explore a cavity resonator containing a two-sided perfect mirror. Although the mirror separates the cavity modes into two independent confined electromagnetic fields, the radiation pressure interaction gives rise to high- order effective interactions across all subsystems. Depending on the chosen resonant conditions, which are also related to the position of the mirror, we study 2n-photon entanglement generation and bilateral photon pair emission. Demonstrating the nonclassical nature of the mechanical oscillator, we provide a pathway to control these phenomena, opening potential applications in quantum technologies. Looking ahead, similar integrated devices could be used to entangle subsystems across vastly different energy scales, such as microwave and optical photons.

TI General theory for discrete symmetry-breaking equilibrium states in
   quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Spontaneous symmetry breaking in phase transitions occurs when the system Hamiltonian is symmetric under a certain transformation, but the equilibrium states observed in nature are not. Here we build two noncommuting quantities from the order parameter of the transition and the symmetry operator that are constants of motion when such equilibrium states exist. Then, we derive a general equilibrium ensemble for the ordered phase and show that equilibrium states consisting of superpositions of different symmetry-breaking states, like positive and negative magnetized states, may exist. We propose an experimental realization of such equilibrium states with the state-of-the-art quantum technologies, and test it by means of numerical calculations. Finally, we show that a small symmetry-breaking perturbation in the Hamiltonian stabilizes the conservation of one of the two former quantities, implying that symmetry-breaking equilibrium states become stable even in small quantum systems.

AB We derive a set of functionals for optimization towards an arbitrary cat state and demonstrate their application by optimizing the dynamics of a Kerr-nonlinear Hamiltonian with two-photon driving. The versatility of our framework allows us to adapt our functional towards optimization of maximally entangled cat states, applying it to a Jaynes-Cummings model. We identify the strategy of the obtained control fields and determine the quantum speed limit as a function of the cat state's excitation. Finally, we extend our optimization functionals to open quantum system dynamics and apply it to the Jaynes-Cummings model with decay on the oscillator. For strong dissipation and large cat radii, we find a change in the control strategy compared to the case without dissipation. Our results highlight the power of optimal control with functionals specifically crafted for complex physical tasks and the versatility of the quantum optimal control toolbox for practical applications in the quantum technologies.

AB Blatter radical derivativesare very attractive due to their potentialapplications, ranging from batteries to quantum technologies. In thiswork, we focus on the latest insights regarding the fundamental mechanismsof radical thin film (long-term) degradation, by comparing two Blatterradical derivatives. We find that the interaction with different contaminants(such as atomic H, Ar, N, and O and molecular H-2, N-2, O-2, H2O, and NH2) affectsthe chemical and magnetic properties of the thin films upon air exposure.Also, the radical-specific site, where the contaminant interactiontakes place, plays a role. Atomic H and NH2 are detrimentalto the magnetic properties of Blatter radicals, while the presenceof molecular water influences more specifically the magnetic propertiesof the diradical thin films, and it is believed to be the major causeof the shorter diradical thin film lifetime in air.

TI Anticipative measurements in hybrid quantum-classical computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Until large-scale fault-tolerant quantum devices become available, one has to find ways to make the most of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. One possibility is to seek smaller repetitive hybrid quantum -classical tasks with higher fidelity, rather than directly pursuing large complex tasks. We present an approach in this direction in which quantum computation is supplemented by a classical result. While the presence of the supplementary classical information is helpful in and of itself, taking advantage of its anticipation also leads to a distinct type of quantum measurement, which we call anticipative. Anticipative quantum measurements lead to an improved success rate compared with cases in which quantum measurements are optimized without assuming the subsequent arrival of supplementary information. Importantly, in an anticipative quantum measurement, we do not combine the results from classical and quantum computations until the end of the process, and there is no need for feedback from one computation to the other, thus both computations can be run in parallel. We demonstrate the method using an IBMQ device, and we show that it leads to an improved success rate even in a noisy setting.

AB We optimize silicon nano -antennas to enhance and direct the emission of local quantum sources. We combine global evolutionary optimization (EO) with frequency domain electrodynamical simulations and compare design strategies based on resonant and non -resonant building blocks. Specifically, we investigate the performance of models with different degrees of freedom but comparable amounts of available material. We find that simpler geometric models allow significantly faster convergence of the optimizer, which, expectedly, comes at the cost of a reduced optical performance. We finally analyze the physical mechanisms underlying the directional emission that also comes with an emission rate enhancement and find a surprising robustness against perturbations of the source emitter location. This makes the structures highly interesting for actual nano -fabrication. We believe that optimized, all -dielectric silicon nano -antennas have high potential for genuine breakthroughs in a multitude of applications in nanophotonics and quantum technologies.

TI Zero-field quantum beats and spin decoherence mechanisms in
   CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coherent optical manipulation of exciton states provides a fascinating approach for quantum gating and ultrafast switching. However, their coherence time for incumbent semiconductors is highly susceptible to thermal decoherence and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, we uncover zero-field exciton quantum beating and anomalous temperature dependence of the exciton spin lifetimes in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) ensembles. The quantum beating between two exciton fine-structure splitting (FSS) levels enables coherent ultrafast optical control of the excitonic degree of freedom. From the anomalous temperature dependence, we identify and fully parametrize all the regimes of exciton spin depolarization, finding that approaching room temperature, it is dominated by a motional narrowing process governed by the exciton multilevel coherence. Importantly, our results present an unambiguous full physical picture of the complex interplay of the underlying spin decoherence mechanisms. These intrinsic exciton FSS states in perovskite NCs present fresh opportunities for spin-based photonic quantum technologies.

TI Quantifying coherence with respect to general quantum measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Coherence is a cornerstone of quantum theory and a prerequisite for the advantage of quantum technologies. In recent work, the notion of coherence with respect to a general quantum measurement, i.e., positive operator-valued measure (POVM), was introduced and embedded into a resource-theoretic framework that generalizes the standard resource theory of coherence. In particular, POVM-incoherent (free) states and operations were established. In this work, we explore features of this framework which arise due to the rich structure of POVMs compared to projective measurements. Moreover, we introduce a rigorous, probabilisitic framework for POVM-based coherence measures and free operations. This leads to the introduction of strongly monotonic resource measures that neatly generalize well-known standard coherence measures. Finally, we show that the relative entropy of POVM coherence is equal to the cryptographic randomness gain, providing an important operational meaning to the concept of coherence with respect to a general measurement.

TI Highly directional single-photon source
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Single-photon emitters are a pivotal element in quantum technologies, but the generation of single photons along well-defined directions generally involves sophisticated configurations. Here, we propose a photon source capable of generating single photons with high efficiency along guided modes. Specifically, we consider a quantum emitter placed in a periodically patterned linear waveguide. The latter is designed to host a single guided mode over the spectral range of interest and display a divergence in the photonic density of states at an emission wavelength close to the period. Photons are preferentially emitted along the waveguide near that spectral region. We predict that nearly all of the emission can be made to occur along the waveguide with a reduction in the temporal uncertainty by two orders of magnitude. Our study opens a conceptually new direction in the production of single photons with a high degree of directionality and reduced temporal uncertainty.

TI Self-assembly of generative heterogeneous electric circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB An abstract model of electric circuit self-assembly that is amenable to exact analysis has been proposed in previous works in the circuit tile assembly model (cTAM) to understand self-assembled and self-controlled growth as emergent phenomena that are capable of complex behaviors, like self-replication. In the cTAMs, a voltage source represents a finite supply of energy that drives growth by attachment of a single circuit tile type until it is unable to overcome randomizing factors in the environment, represented by a threshold of hybridization at tip voltages. Here, the cTAM is extended to allow attachment of copies of any tile from a predetermined finite heterogeneous set of tile types, which may include resistors, inductances and/or capacitors. The system of circuits is fully solved analytically by novel methods and exact properties of the grown terminal circuits are established for size and response. These circuit models have found a number of applications in areas such as transmission lines, passive filters, topological insulators, bioelectric networks and even, quantum computation, so these results may apply to many other areas.

TI SPECIAL TOPIC-The 70th anniversary of National University of Defense
   Technology Research progress of intrinsic magnetic insulator
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The interaction between non-trivial topological states and the magnetic order of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators gives rise to various exotic physical properties, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator. These materials possess great potential applications in low-power topological spintronic devices and topological quantum computation. Since the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4, was discovered in 2019, this material system has received significant attention from researchers and sparked a research boom. This paper begins with discussing the fundamental properties of MnBi(2)Te(4)and then turns to important research findings related to this intrinsic magnetic topological insulator. Specifically, it focuses on the quantum anomalous Hall effect, axion insulating state, and Majorana zero energy mode exhibited by the MnBi(2)Te(4)series. Furthermore, this paper highlights other research directions and current challenges associated with this material system. Finally, this paper provides a summary and outlook for future research on MnBi2Te4, aiming to offer valuable references for researchers in related fields.

TI Delocalized states in three-terminal superconductor-semiconductor
   nanowire devices
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We fabricate three-terminal hybrid devices consisting of a semiconductor nanowire seg-ment proximitized by a grounded superconductor and having tunnel probe contacts on both sides. By performing simultaneous tunneling measurements, we identify delocal-ized states, which can be observed from both ends, and states localized near one of the tunnel barriers. The delocalized states can be traced from zero magnetic field to fields beyond 0.5 T. Within the regime that supports delocalized states, we search for corre-lated low-energy features consistent with the presence of Majorana zero modes. While both sides of the device exhibit ubiquitous low-energy features at high fields, no corre-lation is inferred. Simulations using a one-dimensional effective model suggest that the delocalized states, which extend throughout the whole system, have large characteris-tic wave vectors, while the lower momentum states expected to give rise to Majorana physics are localized by disorder. To avoid such localization and realize Majorana zero modes, disorder needs to be reduced significantly. We propose a method for estimating the disorder strength based on analyzing the level spacing between delocalized states.

TI Exploring non-linear correlators on AGP
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Single-reference methods such as Hartree-Fock-based coupled cluster theory are well known for their accuracy and efficiency for weakly correlated systems. For strongly correlated systems, more sophisticated methods are needed. Recent studies have revealed the potential of the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) as an excellent initial reference for the strong correlation problem. While these studies improved on AGP by linear correlators, we explore some non-linear exponential Ansatze in this paper. We investigate two approaches in particular. Similar to Wahlen-Strothman et al. [Phys. Rev. B 91, 041114(R) (2015)], we show that the similarity transformed Hamiltonian with a Hilbert-space Jastrow operator is summable to all orders and can be solved over AGP by projecting the Schrodinger equation. The second approach is based on approximating the unitary pair-hopper Ansatz recently proposed for application on a quantum computer. We report benchmark numerical calculations against the ground state of the pairing Hamiltonian for both of these approaches.

TI Dimension reduction in quantum sampling of stochastic processes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum technologies offer a promising route to the efficient sampling and analysis of stochastic processes, with potential applications across the sciences. Such quantum advantages rely on the preparation of a quantum sample state of the stochastic process, which requires a memory system to propagate correlations between the past and future of the process. Here, we introduce a method of lossy quantum dimension reduction that allows this memory to be compressed, not just beyond classical limits, but also beyond current state-of-the-art quantum stochastic sampling approaches. We investigate the trade-off between the saving in memory resources from this compression, and the distortion it introduces. We show that our approach can be highly effective in low distortion compression of both Markovian and strongly non-Markovian processes alike. We further discuss the application of our results to quantum stochastic modelling more broadly.

TI Synthesis of nanodiamonds using liquid-phase laser ablation of graphene
   and its application in resistive random access memory
SO CARBON TRENDS
AB Nanodiamonds (ND) are carbon particles with a size less than 100 nm, formed by sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms. They have attracted considerable research interest for their potential applications ranging from sensing and bioimaging to quantum computation due to its physical, chemical and surface characteristics. In this work, we report the synthesis of ND from graphene dispersions by liquid-phase laser ablation technique, using an Nd: YAG laser. ND samples exhibit a characteristic photo-absorption at 226 nm, and it shows an excitation dependent emission similar to the carbon dots. Employing Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy, the bandgap of ND is calculated to be 5.2 eV, and the work-function is around 4.2 eV. Further, we fabricated Resistive switching devices with ND film as the active layer, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as the bottom and silver (Ag) as the top electrodes. These FTO/ND/Ag devices show excellent memory characteristics with an on-offratio of 10(4) and reproducible cycling characteristics, demonstrating its potential for high-density memory applications.

TI Constricted junction based superconducting quantum interference devices
   via nano-laser direct writing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Thermal effects serve as universal stimuli for material transformation, capable of inducing processes, such as crystallization, evaporation, and melting in various materials. In this paper, we propose an efficient and cost-effective fabrication method based on nano-laser direct writing (NLDW) technology for the fabrication of Nb constricted junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices induced by thermal effects. By narrowing the spacing between laser paths step by step, the I-V characteristics of constricted junctions can be continuously adjusted from collective Cooper pair transport to Josephson junction behavior. Additionally, the heat-affected zones induced by laser irradiation were characterized by heat transfer simulations and electrical transport behavior. Furthermore, the flux noise spectral density of a patterned superconducting quantum interference device based on NLDW is 2.8 mu Phi (0) / Hz( 1 / 2 )in the white noise range, which exhibits comparable performance to devices based on traditional ion beam or electron beam etching processes. In this case, this technique could provide a reliable and reproducible pathway for scaling up the fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits, as well as an avenue to conduct nanoscale thermal engineering in superconducting materials research for basic science.

TI Blockwise optimization for projective variational quantum dynamics
   (BLOP-VQD): Algorithm and implementation for lattice systems
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We present an efficient approach to simulate real-time quantum dynamics using projected variational quantum dynamics, where the computational cost is reduced by strategically optimizing only a subset of the variational parameters at each time step. Typically, the variational Ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost. This new optimization strategy provides a promising path toward high-fidelity simulation of the time evolution of complex quantum systems with reduced computational resources.

TI Nanometer-thick ultraflat cantilever resonators
SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
AB Nanomechanical devices made from ultrathin materials are transforming diverse fields, including sensing, signal processing, and quantum technologies. However, as these materials become thinner, their low bending rigidity poses significant fabrication challenges, and achieving nanometer-thick flat cantilevers with consistent and predictable mechanical responses has remained elusive despite decades of research. Here we present nanometer-thick, ultraflat cantilever resonators fabricated using atomic layer deposition. By effectively mitigating the effects of uncontrollable built-in strain and geometric disorder, the ultraflat nanocantilevers exhibit resonance frequencies closely aligned with thin-plate theory predictions and display low sample-to-sample variability. These cantilevers maintain mechanical stability in both vacuum and air environments, even at large length-to-thickness ratios of up to 3000. The ultraflat nanocantilevers are approaching the thickness limit, beyond which thermal fluctuations at room temperature can spontaneously induce random ripples in otherwise flat films.

We investigate the effects of different parameters involved in the state preparation by using the fidelity, normalized second-order factorial moment of photon number for the heralded state (gh(2)), and photon-number parity as figures of merit. Especially, the photon-number parity offers a practical and robust tool for inferring the target state quality by capturing the contamination of all undesired photon-number contributions. We focus on expressing our results in terms of experimentally easily accessible parameters such as the coincidences-to-accidentals ratio and the detection efficiencies. Our results identify the optimal parameter regions for generating high quality photon-number states by heralding and provide useful insights for advancing their use in quantum technologies.

TI Electrically driven spin resonance of 4f electrons in a single
   atom on a surface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A pivotal challenge in quantum technologies lies in reconciling long coherence times with efficient manipulation of the quantum states of a system. Lanthanide atoms, with their well-localized 4f electrons, emerge as a promising solution to this dilemma if provided with a rational design for manipulation and detection. Here we construct tailored spin structures to perform electron spin resonance on a single lanthanide atom using a scanning tunneling microscope. A magnetically coupled structure made of an erbium and a titanium atom enables us to both drive the erbium's 4f electron spins and indirectly probe them through the titanium's 3d electrons. The erbium spin states exhibit an extended spin relaxation time and a higher driving efficiency compared to 3d atoms with spin 1/2 in similarly coupled structures. Our work provides a new approach to accessing highly protected spin states, enabling their coherent control in an all-electric fashion.

TI Enhancement of the microwave photon-magnon coupling strength for a
   planar fabricated resonator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Planar resonators have a wide usage in modern microwave technologies and perspectives in novel quantum technologies development. As was demonstrated earlier, their utilization allows to achieve high values of microwave photon-magnon coupling strength-an important parameter in technologies of information coherent transfer from electromagnetic GHz range to the optical range. In the present work, the achievement of the high value of the microwave photon-magnon coupling strength by exploiting the increase of the spatial concentration of the magnetic component of the planar resonator electromagnetic field is reported. Starting from the conventional planar split-ring resonator design we increased the coupling strength up to 40% by modifying the resonator shape. The numerical simulation and experimental verification showed a predicted increase in the spatial concentration of the microwave magnetic component and showed the increased value of the microwave photon-magnon coupling strength as a sequence.

AB We demonstrate the two-color cooling and trapping of alkaline-earth atoms in a grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT). The trap is formed by a single incident laser beam together with four secondary beams that are generated via diffraction from a nanostructured wafer. A grating structure for a GMOT operating with strontium atoms is optimized and fabricated. We trap 10(6) Sr-88 atoms on the S-1(0) -> P-1 (1) transition at 461nm and transfer 25% of these atoms to the second cooling stage on the narrower S-1(0) -> P-3 (1) intercombination transition at 689nm, preparing a sample of 2.5 x 10(5) atoms at 5 mu K. These results demonstrate the applicability of the GMOT technology in conjunction with two widely differing wavelengths and enable the continued miniaturization of alkaline-earth-based quantum technologies like optical atomic clocks.

TI Monitored long-range interacting systems: spin-wave theory for quantum
   trajectories
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Measurement-induced phases exhibit unconventional dynamics as emergent collective phenomena, yet their behavior in tailored interacting systems - crucial for quantum technologies - remains less understood. We develop a systematic toolbox to analyze monitored dynamics in long-range interacting systems, relevant to platforms like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. Our method extends spin-wave theory to general dynamical generators at the quantum trajectory level, enabling access to a broader class of states than approaches based on density matrices. This allows efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins and captures nonlinear dynamical features such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring entanglement phase transitions in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions in one and two dimensions, where the entanglement scaling changes from logarithm to volume law as the interaction range shortens, and by dwelling on how our method mitigates experimental post-selection challenges in detecting monitored quantum phases.

TI Engineering phase and density of Bose-Einstein condensates in curved
   waveguides with toroidal topology
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the effects of ellipticity-induced curvature on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates confined in quasi-one-dimensional closed-loop waveguides. Our theoretical study reveals intriguing phenomena arising from the interplay between curvature and interactions. Density modulations are observed in regions of high curvature, but these modulations are suppressed by strong repulsive interactions. Additionally, we observe phase accumulation in regions with the lowest curvature when the waveguide with superflow has high eccentricity. Furthermore, waveguides hosting vortices exhibit dynamic transformations between states with different angular momenta. These findings provide insights into the behavior of atomic condensates in curved waveguides, with implications for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. The interplay between curvature and interactions offers opportunities for exploring novel quantum phenomena and engineering quantum states in confined geometries.

TI Electron Quantum Optics with Beam Splitters and Waveguides in Dirac
   Matter
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An electron is a quantum particle and behaves as both a particle and a probability wave. On account of this it can be controlled in a similar way to a photon and electronic devices can be designed in analogy to those based on light when there is minimal excitation of the underlying Fermi sea. Here, splitting of the electron wavefunction is explored for systems supporting Dirac type physics, with a focus on graphene but being equally applicable to electronic states in topological insulators, liquid helium, and other systems described relativistically. Electron beam-splitters and superfocusers are analysed along with propagation through nanoribbons, demonstrating that the waveform, system geometry, and energies all need to balance to maximise the probability density and hence lifetime of the flying electron. These findings form the basis for novel quantum electron optics.

TI Scalable Platform for Nanocrystal-Based Quantum Electronics
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Unlocking the full potential of nanocrystals in electronic devices requires scalable and deterministic manufacturing techniques. A platform offering compelling paths to scalable production is microtomy, the technique of cutting thin lamellas with large areas containing embedded nanostructures. So far, this platform has not been used for the fabrication of electronic quantum devices. Here, microtomy is combined with vapor-liquid-solid growth of III/V nanowires to create a scalable platform that can deterministically transfer large arrays of single and fused nanocrystals-offering single unit control and free choice of the target substrate. Electronic devices are fabricated on cross-sectioned InAs nanowires with good yield, and their ability to exhibit quantum phenomena such as conductance quantization, single-electron charging, and wave interference are demonstrated. Finally, it is devised how the platform can host rationally designed semiconductor/superconductor networks relevant to emerging quantum technologies.

TI Reservoir-assisted energy migration through multiple spin domains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The transfer of energy through a network of nodes is fundamental to how both nature and current technology operate. Traditionally, we think of the nodes in a network being coupled to channels that connect them, in which energy is passed from node to channel to node until it reaches its targeted site. Here we introduce an alternate approach to this, where our channels are replaced by collective environments (or, actually, reservoirs) which interact with pairs of nodes. We show how energy initially located at a specific node can arrive at a target node-even though that environment may be at zero temperature. Further, we show that such a migration occurs on much faster timescales than the damping rate associated with a single spin coupled to the reservoir. Our approach shows the power of being able to tailor both the system and environment and the symmetries associated with them to provide new directions for future quantum technologies.

TI Phase transitions in the classical simulability of open quantum systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We introduce a Langevin unravelling of the density matrix evolution of an open quantum system over matrix product states, which we term the time-dependent variational principle-Langevin equation. This allows the study of entanglement dynamics as a function of both temperature and coupling to the environment. As the strength of coupling to and temperature of the environment is increased, we find a transition where the entanglement of the individual trajectories saturates, permitting a classical simulation of the system for all times. This is the Hamiltonian open system counterpart of the saturation in entanglement found in random circuits with projective or weak measurements. If a system is open, there is a limit to the advantage in simulating its behaviour on a quantum computer, even when that evolution harbours important quantum effects. Moreover, if a quantum simulator is in this phase, it cannot simulate with quantum advantage.

TI Spin-singlet topological superconductivity in the attractive
   Rashba-Hubbard model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Fully gapped, spin-singlet superconductors with antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling in a Zeeman magnetic field provide a promising route to realize superconducting states with non-Abelian topological order and therefore fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we use a quantum Monte Carlo dynamical cluster approximation to study the superconducting properties of a doped two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a Zeeman magnetic field. We generally find that the Rashba coupling has a beneficial effect towards s-wave superconductivity. In the presence of a finite Zeeman field, when superconductivity is suppressed by Pauli pair breaking, the Rashba coupling counteracts the spin imbalance created by the Zeeman field by mixing the spins, and thus restores superconductivity at finite temperatures. We show that this favorable effect of the spin-orbit coupling is traced to a spin-flip driven enhancement of the amplitude for the propagation of a pair of electrons in time-reversed states. Moreover, by inspecting the Fermi surface of the interacting model, we show that for sufficiently large Rashba coupling and Zeeman field, the superconducting state is expected to be topologically nontrivial.

TI Analyzing the Competition of HIV-1 Phenotypes with Quantum Game Theory
SO GAZI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which damages the immune system by reducing people's resistance to infections and diseases. Antiretroviral treatment methods are based on drug designs developed using inhibitors that suppress the dynamics that enable the maturation of the virus. However, studies are needed to improve treatment methods against infection because HIV-1 is frequently mutated and mutant viruses develop resistance to the treatment used. Therefore, it is important to model the evolutionary development of the virus. For this purpose, the developmental process and spread of HIV-1 are modeled as a game with the players of phenotypes in this study. The related searches known to be made so far have been carried out based on the rules of classical physics. However, games of survival are being played on the molecular level, where the rules of quantum mechanics work. Since the HIV-1 game is being played on the molecular level, the behaviors of the virus phenotypes are examined from the perspective of quantum computation.

TI Synaptic microenvironment and altered state of consciousness in
   schizophrenia: a possible link between synapse geometry and orchestrated
   objective reduction theory
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB In recent decades, studies have provided convincing evidence indicating abnormalities in some aspects of consciousness in schizophrenia patients. One of the pioneering theory, orchestrated objective reduction (OR) on the mechanism of consciousness has been proposed by Hameroff and Penrose. According to OR, consciousness roots in microtubules (MTs) which act as quantum computation apparatus. OR theory attribute the consciousness generation to MTs, while the "inception" of the events begins at synaptic level where other players regulate the signal transduction and neurotransmitters bioavailability at synaptic microenvironment. Homeostasis and geometry of synaptic microenvironment are actively regulated by glial cell particularly astrocytes. Experimental and post mortem studies have documented evidence indicating the involvement of main participants of synapse such as astrocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) in schizophrenia. This literature aims to review the role(s) of active participants of synaptic microenvironment and disturbed state of consciousness based on OR theory in schizophrenia.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics control of spin-1/2 system interacting with
   magnets
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The unavoidable interaction of an open quantum system with its surrounding environment may follow non-Markovian dynamics behavior, which causes its memory effects to play a key role in many quantum technologies. In this work, we first consider the dynamics control of a spin-1/2 system that simultaneously interacts with two magnets. Subsequently, we study in detail the evolution of a classically driven spin-1/2 system that is coupled with a magnet. Two dynamical crossovers of the spin system, namely, from Markovian dynamics to non-Markovian dynamics and from no-speedup evolution to speedup evolution, can be controlled in these two models. Slightly different from the previous quantum speedup scenarios with controllable non-Markovianity, the stronger non-Markovianity does not necessarily lead to the quantum speedup dynamics process of the spin system in our spin-magnet schemes.

TI Resonant escape in Josephson tunnel junctions under millimeter-wave
   irradiation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The microwave-driven dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction is now widely employed in superconducting qubits and quantum circuits. With their typical energy level separation frequency being several GHz, cooling these quantum devices to the ground state requires temperatures below 100 mK. Pushing the operation frequency of superconducting qubits up may allow for operation of superconducting qubits at 1 K and even higher temperatures. Here, we present measurements of the switching currents of niobium/aluminum-aluminum oxide/niobium Josephson junctions in the presence of millimeter-wave radiation at frequencies above 100 GHz. The observed switching current distributions display clear double-peak structures, which result from the resonant escape of the Josephson phase from a stationary state. We show that the data can be well explained by the strong-driving model including the irradiation-induced suppression of the potential barrier. While still being measured in the quasi-classical regime, our results point toward a feasibility of operating phase qubits around 100 GHz. (C) 2025 Author(s).

TI Anomalies of average symmetries: entanglement and open quantum systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools for understanding quantum systems. However, realistic systems are often subject to disorders, dissipation and decoherence. In many circumstances, symmetries are not exact but only on average. This work investigates the constraints on mixed states resulting from non-commuting average symmetries. We will focus on the cases where the commutation relations of the average symmetry generators are violated by nontrivial phases, and call such average symmetry anomalous. We show that anomalous average symmetry implies degeneracy in the density matrix eigenvalues, and present several lattice examples with average symmetries, including XY chain, Heisenberg chain, and deformed toric code models. In certain cases, the results can be further extended to reduced density matrices, leading to a new lower bound on the entanglement entropy. We discuss several applications in the contexts of many body localization, quantum channels, entanglement phase transitions and also derive new constraints on the Lindbladian evolution of open quantum systems.

TI Concentration Inequalities for Output Statistics of Quantum Markov
   Processes
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We derive new concentration bounds for time averages of measurement outcomes in quantum Markov processes. This generalizes wellknown bounds for classical Markov chains, which provide constraints on finite-time fluctuations of time-additive quantities around their averages. We employ spectral, perturbation and martingale techniques, together with non-commutative L-2 theory, to derive: (i) a Bernstein-type concentration bound for time averages of the measurement outcomes of a quantum Markov chain, (ii) a Hoeffding-type concentration bound for the same process, (iii) a generalization of the Bernstein-type concentration bound for counting processes of continuous-time quantum Markov processes, (iv) new concentration bounds for empirical fluxes of classical Markov chains which broaden the range of applicability of the corresponding classical bounds beyond empirical averages. We also suggest potential application of our results to parameter estimation and consider extensions to reducible quantum channels, multi-time statistics and time-dependent measurements, and comment on the connection to so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

TI Efficient population transfer in a quantum dot exciton under
   phonon-induced decoherence via shortcuts to adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below 20 K and pulse duration up to 10 ps, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-type equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. This work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.

TI Atomtronic multiterminal Aharonov-Bohm interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a multifunctional device for cold atoms consisting of a three-terminal ring circuit pierced by a synthetic magnetic flux, where the ring can be continuous or discretized. The flux controls the atomic current through the ring via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our device shows a flux-induced transition of reflections from an Andreev-like negative density to positive density. Further, the flux can direct the atomic current into specific output ports, realizing a flexible nonreciprocal switch to connect multiple atomic systems or sense rotations. By changing the flux linearly in time, we convert constant matter wave currents into an ac modulated current. This effect can be used to realize an atomic frequency generator and study fundamental problems related to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We experimentally demonstrate Bose-Einstein condensation into the light-shaped optical potential of the three-terminal ring. Our work opens up the possibility of atomtronic devices for practical applications in quantum technologies.

TI Dissipation and noise in strongly driven Josephson junctions
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, the quasiparticle-related losses in Josephson junctions are suppressed due to the gap in the superconducting density of states which is much higher than the typical energy of a microwave photon. In this work, we show that a strong drive even at a frequency lower than twice the superconductor gap parameter can activate dissipation in the junctions due to photon-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise strength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the junction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency of the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially attractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. We also predict pronounced memory effects in the driven Josephson junctions, which are appealing for both theoretical and experimental studies of non-Markovian physics in superconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by studying the spectral properties and the steady-state population of a low-impedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction: we show the emergence of non-Lorentzian spectral lines and broad tunability of effective temperature of the steady state.

TI Towards complexity of primary-deformed Virasoro circuits
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time-independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the K & auml;hler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.

TI Tunable formation of cold atomic clouds via dynamic detuning in the
   launch of 133Cs atoms
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The ballistic launch of cold atoms is crucial to a range of advanced investigations, serving as a highly precise source for timekeeping, gravimetry, and fundamental studies in quantum technologies. A detailed understanding of atomic dynamics during these launches is essential for furthering research in these fields. In this study, we investigate the ballistic launch of cold 133Cs atoms and observe a remarkable behavior in the launched atomic cloud. Following the launch, an abrupt change in frequency detuning caused the cold atomic cloud to segment into two parts with distinct velocities. Our work details and characterizes the effect of segmentation on the thermal and velocity properties of the atomic cloud. This non-adiabatic segmentation phenomenon has significant implications for improving the precision of quantum devices that rely on the precise control of free-flying atomic clouds.

TI Dual-frame optimization for informationally complete quantum
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Randomized measurement protocols such as classical shadows represent powerful resources for quantum technologies, with applications ranging from quantum state characterization and process tomography to machine learning and error mitigation. Recently, the notion of measurement dual frames, in which classical shadows are generalized to dual operators of positive operator-valued measure (POVM) effects, resurfaced in the literature. This brought attention to additional degrees of freedom in the postprocessing stage of randomized measurements that are often neglected by established techniques. In this work, we leverage dual frames to construct improved observable estimators from informationally complete measurement samples. We introduce novel classes of parametrized frame superoperators and optimization-free dual frames based on empirical frequencies, which offer advantages over their canonical counterparts while retaining computational efficiency. Remarkably, this comes at almost no quantum or classical cost, thus rendering dual frame optimization a valuable addition to the randomized measurement toolbox.

TI One-sided composite cavity on an optical nanocapillary fiber
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB We report on a numerical study of a one-sided cavity on an optical nanocapillary fiber (NCF) using a composite cavity. The composite cavity is formed by combining an optical NCF and an asymmetric defect mode grating. We design the cavity to realize the maximum channeling efficiency of up to-80% into one-sided NCF-guided modes while operating from under-to critical-and over-coupling regimes. For the maximum channeling efficiency case, we find the best performance parameters, such as quality factor, finesse, and one-pass loss of the cavity. The present platform may open a novel, to the best of our knowledge, route for designing fiber-based deterministic single-photon sources in quantum technologies. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Hardware Trojans in superconducting electronic circuits
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Hardware Trojans that exploit the unique characteristics of superconducting electronic (SCE) circuits are explored in this paper. Two types of hardware Trojan circuits are proposed: a magnetically-coupled data transmission Trojan embedded in single flux quantum full adder circuit and a pulse-interleaved Trojan implemented within a frequency divider. The working principles of how these Trojan circuits exploit the frequency-sensitive nature of SCE circuits are explained. The proposed Trojan circuits stay hidden during typical low-frequency testing, and only triggered and become active (and potentially dangerous) at higher frequencies. Extensive analysis demonstrate that these Trojans have a high chance of staying stealthy during testing, underscoring the need for more comprehensive security measures that account for the full range of operating frequencies for the protection of both classical superconducting systems and future quantum technologies.

TI Countering a fundamental law of attraction with quantum wave-packet
   engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Cold atoms hold much promise for the realization of quantum technologies, but still encounter many chal-lenges. In this work we show how the fundamental Casimir-Polder force, by which atoms are attracted to a surface, may be temporarily suppressed by utilizing a specially designed quantum potential, which is familiar from the hydrodynamic or Bohmian reformulations of quantum mechanics. We show that when harnessing the quantum potential via suitable atomic wave-packet engineering, the absorption by the surface can be dramatically reduced. As a result, the probing time of the atoms as sensors can increase. This is proven both analytically and numerically. Furthermore, an experimental scheme is proposed for achieving the required shape for the atomic wave packet. All these may assist existing applications of cold atoms in metrology and sensing and may also enable prospective ones. Finally, these results shed light on the notion of quantum potential and its significance.

SO MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Conjugated polymers (CPs) are electronic materials which always attract the joint attention of synthetic chemistry, physics, and engineering. The present article deals with "classical" CPs such as polyacetylenes and polyarylenes, and also with more sophisticated cases such as ladder polymers and graphene nanoribbons. CPs exhibit a wide variety of fascinating electrical and optical properties which qualify them as active components of devices. Their performance, however, is shown to sensitively depend upon structural perfection and purity as well as on the thin-film morphology, which is also influenced by processing procedures. Nowadays, the need for innovative energy technologies and sustainable materials and processes as well as the emerging new opportunities of quantum technologies, are adding further momentum to CP research.

TI Formation yield of germanium-vacancy centers in diamond upon keV ion
   nano-implantation and thermal annealing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Group-IV-related color centers in diamond are promising systems in the framework of solid-state quantum technologies. A key enabler for the integration of these emitters in real-world devices consists of their reliable fabrication by means of controlled engineering processes such as deterministic ion implantation. In this work, the formation yield of the negatively charged germanium-vacancy (GeV-) center in diamond upon keV ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing was investigated. A systematic fabrication approach was adopted, exploiting focused ion beam technology to take advantage of nanometric spatial accuracy and a controllable implantation fluence. The photoluminescence analysis of the implanted spots, including single emitter characterization, enables the direct quantification of the GeV- center formation yield under the implemented fabrication approach.

TI Nanocavity enhanced photon coherence of solid-state quantum emitters
   operating up to 30 K
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Solid-state emitters such as epitaxial quantum dots have emerged as a leading platform for efficient, on-demand sources of indistinguishable photons, a key resource for many optical quantum technologies. To maximise performance, these sources normally operate at liquid helium temperatures ( similar to 4 K ), introducing significant size, weight and power requirements that can be impractical for proposed applications. Here we experimentally resolve the two distinct temperature-dependent phonon interactions that degrade indistinguishability, allowing us to demonstrate that coupling to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at elevated temperatures up to 30 K that are compatible with compact cryocoolers. We derive a polaron model that fully captures the temperature-dependent influence of phonons observed in our experiments, providing predictive power to further increase the indistinguishability and operating temperature of future devices through optimised cavity parameters.

SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Bright and stable emitters of single indistinguishable photons are crucial for quantum technologies. The origin of the promising bright emitters recently observed in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) still remains unclear. This study reports pure single-photon sources in multi-layered hBN at room temperature that demonstrate high emission rates. The quantum emitters are introduced with argon beam treatment and air annealing of mechanically exfoliated hBN flakes with thicknesses of 5-100 nm. Spectral and time-resolved measurements reveal the emitters have more than 1 GHz of excited-to-ground state transition rate. The observed photoswitching between dark and bright states indicates the strong sensitivity of the emitter to the electrostatic environment and the importance of the indirect excitation for the photodynamics.

The D-dimensional hydrogenic system (i.e., a negatively-charged particle moving around a positively charged core under a Coulomb-like potential) is the main prototype of the physics of multidimensional quantum systems. In this work, we review the leading terms of the Heisenberg-like (radial expectation values) and entropy-like (Renyi, Shannon) uncertainty measures of this system at the limit of high D. They are given in a simple compact way in terms of the space dimensionality, the Coulomb strength and the state's hyperquantum numbers. The associated multidimensional position-momentum uncertainty relations are also revised and compared with those of other relevant systems.

TI Moving Dirac nodes by chemical substitution
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB Dirac fermions play a central role in the study of topological phases, for they can generate a variety of exotic states, such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators. The control and manipulation of Dirac fermions constitute a fundamental step toward the realization of novel concepts of electronic devices and quantum computation. By means of Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and ab initio simulations, here, we show that Dirac states can be effectively tuned by doping a transition metal sulfide, BaNiS2, through Co/Ni substitution. The symmetry and chemical characteristics of this material, combined with the modification of the charge-transfer gap of BaCo1-xNixS2 across its phase diagram, lead to the formation of Dirac lines, whose position in k-space can be displaced along the Gamma - M symmetry direction and their form reshaped. Not only does the doping x tailor the location and shape of the Dirac bands, but it also controls the metal-insulator transition in the same compound, making BaCo1-xNixS2 a model system to functionalize Dirac materials by varying the strength of electron correlations.

TI Blind Source Separation Based on Quantum Slime Mould Algorithm in
   Impulse Noise
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB In order to resolve engineering problems that the performance of the traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods deteriorates or even becomes invalid when the unknown source signals are interfered by impulse noise with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a more effective and robust BSS method is proposed. Based on dual-parameter variable tailing (DPVT) transformation function, moving average filtering (MAF), and median filtering (MF), a filtering system that can achieve noise suppression in an impulse noise environment is proposed, noted as MAF-DPVT-MF. A hybrid optimization objective function is designed based on the two independence criteria to achieve more effective and robust BSS. Meanwhile, combining quantum computation theory with slime mould algorithm (SMA), quantum slime mould algorithm (QSMA) is proposed and QSMA is used to solve the hybrid optimization objective function. The proposed method is called BSS based on QSMA (QSMA-BSS). The simulation results show that QSMA-BSS is superior to the traditional methods. Compared with previous BSS methods, QSMA-BSS has a wider applications range, more stable performance, and higher precision.

TI An Attack on Zawadzki's Quantum Authentication Scheme
SO ENTROPY
AB Identification schemes are interactive cryptographic protocols typically involving two parties, a prover, who wants to provide evidence of their identity and a verifier, who checks the provided evidence and decides whether or not it comes from the intended prover. Given the growing interest in quantum computation, it is indeed desirable to have explicit designs for achieving user identification through quantum resources. In this paper, we comment on a recent proposal for quantum identity authentication from Zawadzki. We discuss the applicability of the theoretical impossibility results from Lo, Colbeck and Buhrman et al. and formally prove that the protocol must necessarily be insecure. Moreover, to better illustrate our insecurity claim, we present an attack on Zawadzki's protocol and show that by using a simple strategy an adversary may indeed obtain relevant information on the shared identification secret. Specifically, through the use of the principal of conclusive exclusion on quantum measurements, our attack geometrically reduces the key space resulting in the claimed logarithmic security being reduced effectively by a factor of two after only three verification attempts.

TI Observation of Pairwise Level Degeneracies and the Quantum Regime of the
   Arrhenius Law in a Double-Well Parametric Oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB By applying a microwave drive to a specially designed Josephson circuit, we have realized a double-well model system: a Kerr oscillator submitted to a squeezing force. We have observed, for the first time, the spectroscopic fingerprint of a quantum double-well Hamiltonian when its barrier height is increased: a pairwise level kissing (coalescence) corresponding to the exponential reduction of tunnel splitting in the excited states as they sink under the barrier. The discrete levels in the wells also manifest themselves in the activation time across the barrier which, instead of increasing smoothly as a function of the barrier height, presents steps each time a pair of excited states is captured by the wells. This experiment illustrates the quantum regime of Arrhenius's law, whose observation is made possible here by the unprecedented combination of low dissipation, time-resolved state control, 98.5% quantum nondemolition single shot measurement fidelity, and complete microwave control over all Hamiltonian parameters in the quantum regime. Direct applications to quantum computation and simulation are discussed.

TI Topological Superconductivity Based on Antisymmetric Spin-Orbit Coupling
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Topological superconductivity (TSC) has drawn much attention for its fundamental interest and application in quantum computation. An outstanding challenge is the lack of intrinsic TSC materials with a p-wave pairing gap, which has led to the development of an effective p-wave theory of coupling s-wave gap with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). However, the RSOC-strict mechanism and materials pose still both fundamental and practical limitations. Here, we generalize this theory to antisymmetric SOC (ASOC). Using k center dot p perturbation theory, we demonstrate that 2D crystals, with point groups of C2, C4, C6, C2v, C4v, C6v, D2, D4, D6, S4, or D2d, can all facilitate the desired ASOC. Remarkably, this enables us to discover 314 TSC candidates by screening 2D material databases, which are further confirmed by first-principles calculations of Majorana boundary modes and the topological invariant of the superconducting gap. Our work fundamentally enriches TSC theory and greatly expands the classes of TSC materials for experimental exploration.

TI Geometric decomposition of geodesics and null-phase curves using
   Majorana star representation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Geodesics are the shortest curves between any two points on a given surface. Geodesics in the state space of quantum systems play an important role in the theory of geometric phases, as these are also the curves along which the acquired geometric phase is zero. Null-phase curves (NPCs) are the generalization of the geodesics, which are defined as the curves along which the acquired geometric phase is zero even though they need not be the shortest curves between two points. Here, we present a geometric decomposition of geodesics and NPCs in higher-dimensional state space, which allows understanding of the intrinsic symmetries of these curves. We use Majorana star representation to decompose a geodesic in the n-dimensional Hilbert space to n - 1 curves on the Bloch sphere and show that all the n - 1 curves are circular segments with specific properties that are determined by the inner product of the end states connected by the given geodesic. We also propose a method to construct infinitely many NPCs between any two arbitrary states for (n > 2)-dimensional Hilbert space using our geometric decomposition.

TI Quantum-classical distance as a tool to design optimal chiral quantum
   walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) provide a valuable model for quantum transport, universal quantum computation, and quantum spatial search, among others. Recently, the empowering role of new degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian generator of CTQWs, which are the complex phases along the loops of the underlying graph, was acknowledged for its interest in optimizing or suppressing transport on specific topologies. We argue that the quantum-classical distance, a figure of merit which was introduced to capture the difference in dynamics between a CTQW and its classical, stochastic counterpart, guides the optimization of parameters of the Hamiltonian to achieve better quantum transport on cycle graphs and spatial search for the quantum speed limit without an oracle on complete graphs, the latter also implying fast uniform mixing. We compare the variations of this quantity with the 1-norm of coherence and the inverse participation ratio, showing that the quantum-classical distance is linked to both, but in a topology-dependent relation, which is key to spot the most interesting quantum evolution in each case.

TI Inversion of the Chiroptical Responses of Chiral Gold Nanoparticles with
   a Gold Film
SO ACS NANO
AB The deposition of chiral nanoparticles (NPs) onto various substrates is crucial for the fabrication of high-density photonic devices. Understanding the interaction of chiral light and chiral NPs supported on substrates is essential for developing optical sensors and modulators. However, the chiroptical responses of plasmonic chiral NPs on substrates have remained elusive. Here we provide an important understanding of the correlation between the substrate material and the chiroptical response. The scattering dissymmetry factors of individual chiral Au nanocubes are inverted and enhanced with a gold film. Qualitative theories are proposed to analyze the observed variations in the chiroptical signals of chiral NPs on different substrates. Our results offer an encouraging route for modulating and amplifying the chiroptical signals in the use of chiral NPs in light control, light-based quantum technologies, and sensing.

TI Identifying nonclassicality from experimental data using artificial
   neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The fast and accessible verification of nonclassical resources is an indispensable step toward a broad utilization of continuous-variable quantum technologies. Here, we use machine learning methods for the identification of nonclassicality of quantum states of light by processing experimental data obtained via homodyne detection. For this purpose, we train an artificial neural network to classify classical and nonclassical states from their quadrature-measurement distributions. We demonstrate that the network is able to correctly identify classical and nonclassical features from real experimental quadrature data for different states of light. Furthermore, we show that nonclassicality of some states that were not used in the training phase is also recognized. Circumventing the requirement of the large sample sizes needed to perform homodyne tomography, our approach presents a promising alternative for the identification of nonclassicality for small sample sizes, indicating applicability for fast sorting or direct monitoring of experimental data.

TI Kinetic inductance in superconducting CoSi2 coplanar
   microwave transmission lines
SO APL MATERIALS
AB We have looked into cobalt disilicide (CoSi2) as a potential building block for superconducting quantum circuits. In order to achieve this, we annealed a thin layer of Co to create microwave cavities with thickness of d = 10-105 nm from CoSi2 embedded in the silicon substrate. The cavity properties were measured as a function of temperature and power. In the films measuring 10 and 25 nm, we find a significant kinetic inductance LK with a non-BCS power-law variation delta LK proportional to T4.3 +/- 0.2 at low temperatures. The quality factor of the studied microwave resonances varied from 3 x 103 (d = 10 nm) to similar to 5 x 104 (d = 105 nm) and increased as d(A - log d) with thickness, with two-level systems having very little effect. The power dependence of kinetic inductance was analyzed in terms of heat flow due to electron-phonon coupling, which was found to be stronger than estimated for heat relaxation by regular quasiparticles.

TI Quantifying Nonlocality: How Outperforming Local Quantum Codes Is
   Expensive
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising avenue to reduce the cost of constructing scalable quantum circuits. However, it is unclear how to implement these codes in practice. Seminal results of Bravyi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 050503 (2010)] have shown that quantum LDPC codes implemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension k and distance d. Here we address the complementary question of how many long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with parameters k and d. In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC code with distance d ?? n1/2+6 requires ??(n1/2+6) interactions of length ????(n6). Further, a code satisfying k ?? n with distance d ?? na requires ????(n) interactions of length ????(na/2). As an application of these results, we consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model, although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds on the distance and code dimension.

TI rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with input saturation
   power of-84 dBm across more than one octave in bandwidth
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs, our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previously reported devices. This shows that using rfSQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques, we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate the signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.

TI Absence of Barren Plateaus and Scaling of Gradients in the Energy
   Optimization of Isometric Tensor Network States
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.

TI A low-noise on-chip coherent microwave source
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB The scaling up of quantum computers operating in the microwave domain requires advanced control electronics, and the use of integrated components that operate at the temperature of the quantum devices is potentially beneficial. However, such an approach requires ultralow power dissipation and high signal quality to ensure quantum-coherent operations. Here we report an on-chip device that is based on a Josephson junction coupled to a spiral resonator and is capable of coherent continuous-wave microwave emission. We show that the characteristics of the device accurately follow a theory based on the perturbative treatment of a capacitively shunted Josephson junction as the gain element. The infidelity of typical quantum gate operations due to phase noise of this cryogenic 25 pW microwave source is less than 0.1% up to 10 ms evolution time, which is below the infidelity caused by dephasing in state-of-the-art superconducting qubits. Together with future cryogenic amplitude and phase modulation techniques, our approach may lead to scalable cryogenic control systems for quantum processors.
   An on-chip device that is based on a Josephson junction coupled to a fabricated superconducting resonator can provide a source of coherent microwave radiation for potential use in scaled quantum circuits.

TI Simulating spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates: A concise

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Cold ensembles of bosons are a useful platform for studying many-body quantum states present in quantum technologies, and simulations of these systems are convenient for streamlining design of such technologies. This paper provides an overview of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), along with an overview of simulation methods and a case study on a novel "microemulsion" phase. These SOC-BECs are further described in the context of coherent states quantum field theory, utilizing the complex Langevin sampling scheme as a numerical algorithm. This approach for studying SOC BECs is a versatile and powerful alternative to particle-based methods and has promise for simulating other bosonic quantum states. This paper does not introduce new research findings or perspectives but instead simply serves as a concise summary of recent literature on the topic.

CL Yokohama, JAPAN
AB Quantum technologies have been considered as a method to enhance cyber-security due to the unique properties of quantum systems. However, quantum systems themselves could also suffer from strategic attacks. In this paper, we formulate the relationship between the strategic attacker and a passive quantum detector into a Stackelberg game. By deriving the optimal detection rule at equilibrium, we study the detection performance of the detector under the setting of finite sample size of corrupted observations. Under mild assumptions, we show that the miss. We illustrate the general decaying results of the miss rate numerically, depicting that the passive detector manages to achieve a miss rate and a false alarm rate both exponentially decaying to zero given infinitely many quantum states, although at a much slower rate than a quantum non-adversarial counterpart. Finally, we adopt our formulations upon a case study of detection with quantum radars.

TI Rydberg-ion flywheel for quantum work storage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Trapped ions provide a platform for quantum technologies that offers long coherence times and high degrees of scalability and controllability. Here, we use this platform to develop a realistic model of a thermal device consisting of two laser-driven, strongly coupled Rydberg ions in a harmonic trap. We show that the translational degrees of freedom of this system can be utilized as a flywheel storing the work output that is generated by a cyclic thermodynamic process applied to its electronic degrees of freedom. Mimicking such a process through periodic variations of external control parameters, we use a mean-field approach underpinned by numerical and analytical calculations to identify relevant physical processes and to determine the charging rate of the flywheel. Our work paves the way for the design of microscopic thermal machines based on Rydberg ions that can be equipped with both many-body working media and universal work storages.

TI Quantum topological data analysis via the estimation of the density of
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) protocol based on the estimation of the density of states (DOS) of the combinatorial Laplacian. Computing topological features of graphs and simplicial complexes is crucial for analyzing data sets and building explainable artificial intelligence solutions. This task becomes computationally hard for simplicial complexes with over 60 vertices and high-degree topological features due to a combinatorial scaling. We propose to approach the task by embedding underlying hypergraphs as effective quantum Hamiltonians and evaluating their density of states from the time evolution. Specifically, we compose propagators as quantum circuits using the Cartan decomposition of effective Hamiltonians and sample overlaps of time-evolved states using multifidelity protocols. Next we develop various postprocessing routines and implement a Fourier-like transform to recover the rank (and kernel) of Hamiltonians. This enables us to estimate the Betti numbers, revealing the topological features of simplicial complexes. We test our protocol on noiseless and noisy quantum simulators and run examples on IBM quantum processors. We observe the resilience of the proposed QTDA approach to real-hardware noise even in the absence of error mitigation, showing the promise for near-term device implementations and highlighting the utility of global DOS-based estimators.

TI Grover on Scrypt
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper presents an optimized quantum circuit for the scrypt cryptographic algorithm. We applied various optimization techniques to reduce the DW cost, which is the product of the time and space complexity of quantum circuits. In our proposed method, the number of ancilla qubits was significantly reduced through the use of optimized inverse operations, while the depth was minimized by implementing parallel structures. For the SHA-256, we devised a structure that achieves a substantial reduction in the number of ancilla qubits with only a slight increase in quantum circuit depth. By cleaning the dirty ancilla qubits used in the previous round through inverse operations, we enabled their reuse in each subsequent round. Specifically, we reduced the number of 8128 ancilla qubits, achieving this with an increase of only 6 in the full depth of the quantum circuit. Additionally, within Salsa20/8 in SMix, we reused qubits through inverse operations and performed some operations in parallel to reduce both the number of qubits and the overall quantum circuit depth. Finally, our quantum circuit for scrypt demonstrates a significant reduction in the width (the number of qubits) with only a minimal increase in the full quantum circuit depth.

TI Non-Markovian Effects of Two-Level Systems in a Niobium Coaxial
   Resonator with a Single-Photon Lifetime of 10 milliseconds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Understanding and mitigating loss channels due to two-level systems (TLS) is one of the main cornerstones in the quest of realizing long photon lifetimes in superconducting quantum circuits. Typically, the TLS to which a circuit couples are modeled as a large bath without any coherence. Here we demonstrate that the coherence of TLS has to be considered to accurately describe the ring-down dynamics of a coaxial quarter-wave resonator with an internal quality factor of 0.5 x 10(9) at the single-photon level. The transient analysis reveals effective non-Markovian dynamics of the combined TLS and cavity system, which we can accurately fit by introducing a comprehensive TLS model. The fit returns an average coherence time of around T-2* approximate to 0.3 mu s for a total of N approximate to 10(9) TLS with power-law distributed coupling strengths. Despite the shortly coherent TLS excitations, we observe long-term effects on the cavity decay due to coherent elastic scattering between the resonator field and the TLS. Moreover, this model provides an accurate prediction of the internal quality factor's temperature dependence.

TI Method for rapid estimation of the energy-time covariance matrix of
   single electrons
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The ability to emit and control single electrons in a dynamical manner enables their use in electron quantum optics and sensing. To characterize the electron states emitted with energy far above the Fermi energy, a dynamic barrier has been used. In this work, we extract the energy-time covariance matrix of single electrons by analyzing the energy variance obtained from the transconductance through the dynamic barrier. This method enables efficient and precise characterization of electron states, especially when a sinusoidal waveform is used. An effective phase-space area and the elliptical distribution are constructed from the covariance matrix and qualitatively compared with the distribution reconstructed from a tomographic method. The area constrained by the uncertainty relation serves as a measure of proximity to the quantum limit. Our results demonstrate an efficient method for characterizing electron states, paving the way for their application in quantum technologies.

TI Robust and broadband UV laser utilizing Cerenkov phase matching on a
   hybrid photonic chip
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a detailed characterization of a hybrid photonic platform for robust and broadly tunable ultraviolet (UV) laser generation using Cerenkov nonlinear frequency conversion (CNFC). By integrating silicon nitride waveguides with barium borate (BBO) cladding, the platform achieves UV emission across an unprecedented wavelength range of 204-319 nm. Compared to state-of-the-art UV photonic devices, our approach addresses longstanding challenges in spectral range, tunability, and integration. Theoretical modeling and experimental validation demonstrate remarkable fabrication tolerance, maintaining phase matching over a 1500 nm waveguide width variation. Angle-resolved far-field mapping reveals key trade-offs in waveguide design and emission profile. These findings offer a compact, scalable solution addressing critical needs in disinfection, quantum technologies, and free-space optical communication.

TI Vibration induced transparency: Simulating an optomechanical system via
   the cavity QED setup with a movable atom
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB We simulate an optomechanical system via a cavity QED scenario with a movable atom and investigate its ap-plication in the tiny mass sensing. We find that the steady-state solution of the system exhibits a multiple sta-bility behavior, which is similar to that in the optomechanical system. We explain this phenomenon by the opto-mechanical interaction term in the effective Hamiltonian. Due to the dressed states formed by the effective coupling between the vibration degree of the atom and the optical mode in the cavity, we observe a narrow transparent window in the output field. We utilize this vibration induced transparency phenomenon to perform the tiny mass sensing. We hope our study will broaden the application of the cavity QED system to quantum technologies.

TI Quantifying the Efficiency of State Preparation via Quantum Variational
   Eigensolvers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recently, there has been much interest in the efficient preparation of complex quantum states using low-depth quantum circuits, such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). While it has been numerically shown that such algorithms prepare certain correlated states of quantum spins with surprising accuracy, a systematic way of quantifying the efficiency of the QAOA in general classes of models has been lacking. Here, we propose that the success of the QAOA in preparing ordered states is related to the interaction distance of the target state, which measures how close that state is to the manifold of all Gaussian states in an arbitrary basis of single-particle modes. We numerically verify this for several examples of nonintegrable quantum models, including Ising models with two- and three-spin interactions and the cluster model in an external field. Our results suggest that the structure of the entanglement spectrum, as witnessed by the interaction distance, correlates with the success of QAOA state preparation, and that this correlation also contains information about different phases present in the model. We conclude that the QAOA typically finds a solution that perturbs around the closest free-fermion state.

TI Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing
   low-lying eigenenergies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to many applications in the natural sciences, particularly in quantum physics and chemistry, where determining low-lying energy spectra is key to characterizing physical and chemical properties. Toward this end, we present and investigate the quantum block compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones. We propose three compact quantum circuits, each suited to different problem settings, for evaluating the necessary expectation values. In contrast to previous multireference quantum Krylov methods, QBKSP achieves linear scaling with respect to the number of Krylov iterations instead of a quadratic one, and furthermore reduces the scaling with respect to the number of references by half for real Hamiltonians and reference states. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as the QBKSP performance in different parameter regimes, we perform both error-free and sampling noise-limited simulations. Our results demonstrate that employing multiple reference states significantly improves convergence, particularly in noisy scenarios or when a single reference fails to capture all target eigenstates. Moreover, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.

TI Artificial-intelligence-driven shot reduction in quantum measurement
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) provides a powerful solution for approximating molecular ground state energies by combining quantum circuits and classical computers. However, estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots), incurring significant costs as accuracy increases. Optimizing shot allocation is thus critical for improving the efficiency of VQE. Current strategies rely heavily on hand-crafted heuristics requiring extensive expert knowledge. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach that automatically learns shot assignment policies to minimize total measurement shots while achieving convergence to the minimum of the energy expectation in VQE. The RL agent assigns measurement shots across VQE optimization iterations based on the progress of the optimization. This approach reduces VQE's dependence on static heuristics and human expertise. When the RL-enabled VQE is applied to a small molecule, a shot reduction policy is learned. The policy demonstrates transferability across systems and compatibility with other wavefunction Ansatze. In addition to these specific findings, this work highlights the potential of RL for automatically discovering efficient and scalable quantum optimization strategies. C2024 Author(s).

TI Native defects and impurities in talcum quasi-2D layers
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Layered semiconductors have recently emerged as capable host materials for novel quantum applications ranging from photonics to sensing. Most studies have focused on artificial layered materials, while natural layered materials, such as talc and other silicates, have remained largely unexplored despite their desirable properties, e.g., wide direct bandgap, low concentration of optically active defects, and low abundance of nuclear spins. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive computational study of pristine and defective talc layers and discuss their potential applications. After investigating bulk properties, such as lattice parameters, band structure, and dielectric constant, we study the electronic structure, charge states, spin and optical properties of vacancy defects, metal, metalloid, and non-metallic impurities. Our results establish the basis for identifying color centers, electron paramagnetic resonance centers, potential spin quantum bits, and p and n-type dopants. These findings mature the theory of talc and point toward potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Interacting Circular Rydberg Atoms Trapped in Optical Tweezers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs), i.e., Rydberg atoms with maximal orbital momentum, ideally combine long coherence times and strong interactions, a key property of quantum systems, in particular for the development of quantum technologies. However, the dipole-dipole interaction between CRAs has not been observed so far. We report the measurement and characterization of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two CRAs, individually trapped in optical tweezers, and find excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate a dynamic control over the strength of the interaction by tuning the orientation of an electric field. We use the interaction between the CRAs as a meter for the interatomic distance, and record the relative motion between two atoms in their traps. This motion, that we induce through the interaction between Rydberg levels with permanent electric dipoles, transiently populated during the preparation of the circular states, is a signature of spin-motion coupling.

TI Direct generation of time-energy-entangled W triphotons in atomic vapor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Entangled multiphoton sources are essential for both fundamental tests of quantum foundations and building blocks of contemporary optical quantum technologies. While efforts over the past three decades have focused on creating multiphoton entanglement through multiplexing existing biphoton sources with linear optics and postselections, our work presents a groundbreaking approach. We observe genuine continuous-mode time-energy-entangled W-class triphotons with an unprecedented production rate directly generated through spontaneous six-wave mixing (SSWM) in a four-level triple-Lambda atomic vapor cell. Using electromagnetically induced transparency and coherence control, our SSWM scheme allows versatile narrowband triphoton generation with advantageous properties, including long temporal coherence and controllable waveforms. This advancement is ideal for applications like long-distance quantum communications and information processing, bridging single photons and neutral atoms. Most importantly, our work establishes a reliable and efficient genuine triphoton source, facilitating accessible research on multiphoton entanglement.

TI Coarse-Grained Effective Hamiltonian via the Magnus Expansion for a
   Three-Level System
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum state processing is one of the main tools of quantum technologies. While real systems are complicated and/or may be driven by non-ideal control, they may nevertheless exhibit simple dynamics approximately confined to a low-energy Hilbert subspace. Adiabatic elimination is the simplest approximation scheme allowing us to derive in certain cases an effective Hamiltonian operating in a low-dimensional Hilbert subspace. However, these approximations may present ambiguities and difficulties, hindering a systematic improvement of their accuracy in larger and larger systems. Here, we use the Magnus expansion as a systematic tool to derive ambiguity-free effective Hamiltonians. We show that the validity of the approximations ultimately leverages only on a proper coarse-graining in time of the exact dynamics. We validate the accuracy of the obtained effective Hamiltonians with suitably tailored fidelities of quantum operations.

TI Evidence of Josephson Coupling in a Few-Layer Black Phosphorus Planar
   Josephson Junction
SO ACS NANO
AB Setting up strong Josephson coupling in van der Waals materials in close proximity to superconductors offers several opportunities both to inspect fundamental physics and to develop cryogenic quantum technologies. Here we show evidence of Josephson coupling in a planar few-layer black phosphorus junction. The planar geometry allows us to probe the junction behavior by means of external gates, at different carrier concentrations. Clear signatures of Josephson coupling are demonstrated by measuring supercurrent flow through the junction at milli-Kelvin temperatures. Manifestation of a Fraunhofer pattern with a transverse magnetic field is also reported, confirming the Josephson coupling. These findings represent evidence of proximity Josephson coupling in a planar junction based on a van der Waals material beyond graphene and will expedite further studies, exploiting the peculiar properties of exfoliated black phosphorus thin flakes.

TI Fabrication of 15NV- centers in diamond using a
   deterministic single ion implanter
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a platform for several important quantum technologies, including sensing, communication and elementary quantum processors. In this letter we demonstrate the creation of NV centers by implantation using a deterministic single ion source. For this we sympathetically laser-cool single N-15(2)+ molecular ions in a Paul trap and extract them at an energy of 5.9 keV. Subsequently the ions are focused with a lateral resolution of 121(35) nm and are implanted into a diamond substrate without any spatial filtering by apertures or masks. After high-temperature annealing, we detect the NV centers in a confocal microscope and determine a conversion efficiency of about 0.6%. The (NV)-N-15 centers are characterized by optically detected magnetic resonance on the hyperfine transition and coherence time.

TI Adaptive quantum error mitigation using pulse-based inverse evolutions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) enables the extraction of high-quality results from the presently-available noisy quantum computers. In this approach, the effect of the noise on observables of interest can be mitigated using multiple measurements without additional hardware overhead. Unfortunately, current QEM techniques are limited to weak noise or lack scalability. In this work, we introduce a QEM method termed 'Adaptive KIK' that adapts to the noise level of the target device, and therefore, can handle moderate-to-strong noise. The implementation of the method is experimentally simple - it does not involve any tomographic information or machine-learning stage, and the number of different quantum circuits to be implemented is independent of the size of the system. Furthermore, we have shown that it can be successfully integrated with randomized compiling for handling both incoherent as well as coherent noise. Our method handles spatially correlated and time-dependent noise which enables us to run shots over the scale of days or more despite the fact that noise and calibrations change in time. Finally, we discuss and demonstrate why our results suggest that gate calibration protocols should be revised when using QEM. We demonstrate our findings in the IBM quantum computers and through numerical simulations.

TI Experimental realization of on-chip few-photon control around
   exceptional points
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-Hermitian physical systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their unique properties around exceptional points (EPs), where the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system coalesce. Phase transitions near exceptional points can lead to various interesting phenomena, such as unidirectional wave transmission. However, most of those studies are in the classical regime and whether these properties can be maintained in the quantum regime is still a subject of ongoing studies. Using a non-Hermitian on-chip superconducting quantum circuit, here we observe a phase transition and the corresponding exceptional point between the two phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unidirectional microwave transmission can be achieved even in the few-photon regime within the broken symmetry phase. This result holds some potential applications, such as on-chip few-photon microwave isolators. Our study reveals the possibility of exploring the fundamental physics and practical quantum devices with non-Hermitian systems based on superconducting quantum circuits.
   The authors observe an exceptional point and the corresponding phase transition in a superconducting non-Hermitian circuit. They find non-reciprocal microwave transmission can be achieved within the broken symmetry phase in the few-photon regime.

TI Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed
   circuits and fewer measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parametrized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the tiling efficient trial circuits with rotations implemented simultaneously technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models and compare with an alternative adaptive variational approach on quantum resource requirement. Quantum dynamical simulations implementing realistic noise channels are also reported. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.

TI From nonreciprocal to charge-4e supercurrent in Ge-based Josephson
   devices with tunable harmonic content
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid superconductor(S)-semiconductor(Sm) devices bring a range of functionalities into superconducting circuits. In particular, hybrid parity-protected qubits and Josephson diodes were recently proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such devices leverage the nonsinusoidal character of the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) in highly transparent S-Sm-S junctions. Here, we report an experimental study of superconducting quantum-interference devices (SQUIDs) embedding Josephson field-effect transistors fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe heterostructure grown on a 200-mm silicon wafer. The single-junction CPR shows up to three harmonics with gate-tunable amplitude. In the presence of microwave irradiation, the ratio of the first two dominant harmonics, corresponding to single and double Cooper-pair transport processes, is consistently reflected in relative weight of integer and half-integer Shapiro steps. A combination of magnetic-flux and gate-voltage control enables tuning the SQUID functionality from a nonreciprocal Josephson-diode regime with 27% asymmetry to a pi-periodic Josephson regime suitable for the implementation of parity-protected superconducting qubits. These results illustrate the potential of Ge-based hybrid devices as versatile and scalable building blocks of superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Calculating nonadiabatic couplings and Berry's phase by variational
   quantum eigensolvers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm to find eigenenergies and eigenstates of systems in quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics. The VQE is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum devices to investigate such systems. Here we propose an extension of the VQE to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings of molecules in quantum chemical systems and Berry's phase in quantum many-body systems. Both quantities play an important role in understanding the properties of a system beyond the naive adiabatic picture, e.g., nonadiabatic dynamics and topological phase of matter. We provide quantum circuits and classical postprocessings to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings and Berry's phase. Specifically, we show that the evaluation of the nonadiabatic couplings reduces to that of expectation values of observables while that of Berry's phase also requires one additional Hadamard test. Furthermore, we simulate the photodissociation dynamics of a lithium fluoride molecule using the nonadiabatic couplings evaluated on a real quantum device. Our proposal widens the applicability of the VQE and the possibility of near-term quantum devices to study molecules and quantum many-body systems.

TI Input-dependence in quantum reservoir computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Quantum reservoir computing is an emergent field in which quantum dynamical systems are exploited for temporal information processing. Previous work found a feature that makes a quantum reservoir valuable: contractive dynamics of the quantum reservoir channel toward input-dependent fixed points. These results are enhanced in this paper by finding conditions that guarantee a crucial aspect of the reservoir's design: distinguishing between different input sequences to ensure a faithful representation of temporal input data. This is implemented by finding a condition that guarantees injectivity in reservoir computing filters, with a special emphasis on the quantum case. We provide several examples and focus on a family of quantum reservoirs that is much used in the literature; it consists of an input-encoding quantum channel followed by a strictly contractive channel that enforces the echo state and the fading memory properties. This work contributes to analyzing valuable quantum reservoirs in terms of their input-dependence.

TI Parameter estimation with reluctant quantum walks: a maximum likelihood
   approach
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The parametric maximum likelihood estimation problem is addressed in the context of quantum walk theory for quantum walks on the lattice of integers. A coin action is presented, with the real parameter theta to be estimated identified with the angular argument of an orthogonal reshuffling matrix. We provide analytic results for the probability distribution for a quantum walker to be displaced by d units from its initial position after k steps. For k large, we show that the likelihood is sharply peaked at a displacement determined by the ratio d/k which is correlated with the reshuffling parameter theta. We suggest that this 'reluctant walker' behaviour provides the framework for maximum likelihood estimation analysis, allowing for robust parameter estimation of theta via return probabilities of closed evolution loops and quantum measurements of the position of quantum walker with 'reluctance index' r = d/k.

TI Programmable photonic unitary circuits for light computing
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Unitarity serves as a fundamental concept for characterizing linear and conservative wave phenomena in both classical and quantum systems. Developing platforms that perform unitary operations on light waves in a universal and programmable manner enables the emulation of complex light-matter interactions and the execution of general-purpose functionalities for wave manipulations, photonic computing, and quantum circuits. Recently, numerous approaches to implementing programmable photonic unitary circuits have been proposed and demonstrated, each employing different design strategies that distinctly impact overall device performance. Here, we review foundational design principles and recent achievements in the implementation of programmable photonic unitary circuits, with a particular focus on integrated photonic platforms. We classify the design strategies based on the dimensionality of nontrivial unit operations in their building blocks: lower-dimensional unitary units, such as SU(2) operations, and higher-dimensional ones, such as Fourier transforms. In each category, recent efforts to leverage alternative physical axes, such as the temporal and frequency domains, to address scalability challenges are also reviewed. We discuss the underlying concepts, design procedures, and trade-offs of each design strategy, especially in relation to light-based computing.

TI On the application of a Silicon photomultiplier-based receiver for
   binary phase-shift-keying protocols
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Over the past decade, binary phase-shift-keying encoding has been used as a benchmark to test the performance of different detection strategies to address the problem of state discrimination. In this context, hybrid devices, giving access to both particle- and wave-like properties of light, could offer the possibility to better discriminate the sent signals. In this work, we consider a quantum channel exploiting a hybrid receiver embedding Silicon photomultipliers as photon-number-resolving detectors. We retrieve the discrimination error probability and the mutual information between sender and receiver as functions of some relevant experimental parameters in the case of binary phase-shifted coherent states. Our promising results, supported also with numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, foster further using this kind of hybrid receiver in more complex detection schemes.

TI Above the Energy Gap Law: Heavy Chalcogenide Substitution in NIR
   II-Emissive Diradicaloid Qubits
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Near-infrared (NIR, 700-1700 nm)- and telecom (similar to 1260-1625 nm)-emissive molecules are good candidates for biological imaging and quantum sensing applications, respectively; however, bright low energy emission is rare due to exponentially increasing nonradiative decay rates in these regions, a phenomenon known as the energy gap law. Recent literature has emphasized the importance of minimizing skeletal modes to prevent increased nonradiative decay rates, but most organic lumiphores in these regions utilize large, conjugated scaffolds containing many C=C modes. Here we report a compact, telecom-emissive scaffold, tetrathiafulvalene-2,3,6,7-tetraselenate, or TTFts, that displays remarkable air, water, and acid stability, exhibits record quantum yields and brightness values, and retains quantum coherence under ambient conditions. These properties are enabled through methodical selenium substitution, which bathochromically shifts emission while shifting skeletal vibrations to lower energies. This new scaffold validates heavy heteroatom substitution strategies and establishes a new class of bright telecom emitters and robust qubits.

TI Nanoscale Magnetic Ordering Dynamics in a High Curie Temperature
   Ferromagnet
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Thermally driven transitions between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases are characterized by critical behavior with divergent susceptibilities, long-range correlations, and spin dynamics that can span kHz to GHz scales as the material approaches the critical temperature T c, but it has proven technically challenging to probe the relevant length and time scales with most conventional measurement techniques. In this study, we employ scanning nitrogen-vacancy center based magnetometry and relaxometry to reveal the critical behavior of a high-T c ferromagnetic oxide near its Curie temperature. Cluster analysis of the measured temperature-dependent nanoscale magnetic textures points to a 3D universality class with a correlation length that diverges near T c. Meanwhile, the temperature-dependent spin dynamics, measured through all optical relaxometry suggest that the phase transition is in the XY universality class. Our results capture both static and dynamic aspects of critical behavior, providing insights into universal properties that govern phase transitions in magnetic materials.

TI The concentration estimation for ensemble of NV- color
   centers with spin coherent manipulation
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The concentration and distribution of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy color centers (NV-) directly affect the sensitivity and resolution of quantum sensing. In this paper, a simple method is proposed to estimate the concentration of the ensemble of NV- centers with spin coherent manipulation. The stray fluorescence is eliminated by separating the fluorescence near the NV- zero-phonon line. By introducing a single NV- fluorescence quantitative model, the number of NV- centers in the diamond under test can be obtained. The average concentration of the ensemble of NV- centers in the sample can be obtained by combining the detection volume. Compared with the results measured by electron spin resonance, the concentration of NV- centers measured by our method can be verified, and the maximum error between the two methods is less than 4.3%. The results show that the method provides an effective reference for accurately characterizing the concentration distribution characteristics of the NV- ensemble.

TI Imaging beyond the surface region: Probing hidden materials via atomic
   force microscopy
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Probing material properties at surfaces down to the single-particle scale of atoms and molecules has been achieved, but high-resolution subsurface imaging remains a nanometrology challenge due to electromagnetic and acoustic dispersion and diffraction. The atomically sharp probe used in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has broken these limits at surfaces. Subsurface imaging is possible under certain physical, chemical, electrical, and thermal gradients present in the material. Of all the SPM techniques, atomic force microscopy has entertained unique opportunities for nondestructive and label-free measurements. Here, we explore the physics of the subsurface imaging problem and the emerging solutions that offer exceptional potential for visualization. We discuss materials science, electronics, biology, polymer and composite sciences, and emerging quantum sensing and quantum bio-imaging applications. The perspectives and prospects of subsurface techniques are presented to stimulate further work toward enabling noninvasive high spatial and spectral resolution investigation of materials including meta- and quantum materials.

TI Search for exotic parity-violation interactions with quantum spin
   amplifiers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum sensing provides sensitive tabletop tools to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the standard model, which have attracted great attention in theories and experiments. Here, we develop a technique based on Spin Amplifier for Particle PHysIcs REsearch (SAPPHIRE) to resonantly search for exotic interactions, specifically parity-odd spin-spin interactions. The present technique effectively amplifies exotic interaction fields by a factor of about 200 while being insensitive to spurious magnetic fields. Our studies, using such a quantum amplification technique, explore the parity-violation interactions mediated by a new vector boson in the challenging parameter space (force range between 3 mm and 1 km) and set the most stringent constraints on axial-vector electron-neutron couplings, substantially improving previous limits by five orders of magnitude. Moreover, our constraints on axial-vector couplings between nucleons reach into a hitherto unexplored parameter space. The present constraints complement the existing astrophysical and laboratory studies on potential standard model extensions.

TI Recent Developments of Nanodiamond Quantum Sensors for Biological
   Applications
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Measuring certain quantities at the nanoscale is often limited to strict conditions such as low temperature or vacuum. However, the recently developed nanodiamond (ND) quantum sensing technology shows great promise for ultrasensitive diagnosis and probing subcellular parameters at ambient conditions. Atom defects (i.e., N, Si) within the ND lattice provide stable emissions and sometimes spin-dependent photoluminescence. These unique properties endow ND quantum sensors with the capacity to detect local temperature, magnetic fields, electric fields, or strain. In this review, some of the recent, most exciting developments in the preparation and application of ND sensors to solve current challenges in biology and medicine including ultrasensitive detection of virions and local sensing of pH, radical species, magnetic fields, temperature, and rotational movements, are discussed.

TI How symmetry-breaking can amplify the magnetosensitivity of dipolarly
   coupled n-radical systems
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In systems of more than two reactive radicals, the radical recombination probability can be magnetosensitive due to the mere effect of the inter-radical electron-electron dipolar coupling. Here, we demonstrate that this principle, previously established for three-radical systems, generalizes to n-radical systems. We focus on radical systems in the plane and explore the effects of symmetry, in particular its absence, on the associated magnetic field effects of the recombination yield. We show, by considering regular configurations and slightly distorted geometries, that the breaking of geometric symmetry can lead to an enhancement of the magnetosensitivity of these structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of effects at low-field that are abolished in the highly symmetric case. This could be important to the understanding of the behavior of radicals in biological environments in the presence of weak magnetic fields comparable to the Earth's, as well as the construction of high-precision quantum sensing devices.

TI Coherent phase slips in coupled matter-wave circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum phase slips are a dual process of particle tunneling in coherent networks. Besides being of central interest to condensed matter physics, quantum phase slips are resources that are sought to be manipulated in quantum circuits. Here, we devise a specific matter-wave circuit enlightening quantum phase slips. Specifically, we investigate the quantum many-body dynamics of two side-by-side ring-shaped neutral bosonic systems coupled through a weak link. By imparting a suitable magnetic flux, persistent currents flow in each ring with given winding numbers. We demonstrate that coherent phase slips occur as winding number transfer among the two rings, with the populations in each ring remaining nearly constant. Such a phenomenon occurs as a result of a specific entanglement of circulating states, that, as such, cannot be captured by a mean-field treatment of the system. Our work can be relevant for the observation of quantum phase slips in cold-atom experiments and their manipulation in matter-wave circuits. To make contact with the field, we show that the phenomenon has clear signatures in the momentum distribution of the system providing the time-of-flight image of the condensate.

TI Emergent Statistical Mechanics from Properties of Disordered Random
   Matrix Product States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The study of generic properties of quantum states has led to an abundance of insightful results. A meaningful set of states that can be efficiently prepared in experiments are ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians, which are well approximated by matrix product states. In this work, we introduce a picture of generic states within the trivial phase of matter with respect to their nonequilibrium and entropic properties. We do so by rigorously exploring nontranslation-invariant matrix product states drawn from a local independent and identically distributed Haar measure. We arrive at these results by exploiting techniques for computing moments of random unitary matrices and by exploiting a mapping to partition functions of classical statistical models, a method that has lead to valuable insights on local random quantum circuits. Specifically, we prove that such disordered random matrix product states equilibrate exponentially well with overwhelming probability under the time evolution of Hamiltonians featuring a nondegenerate spectrum. Moreover, we prove two results about the entanglement Renyi entropy: the entropy with respect to sufficiently disconnected subsystems is generically extensive in the system size, and for small connected systems, the entropy is almost maximal for sufficiently large bond dimensions.

TI Quantum approximate optimization via learning-based adaptive
   optimization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard to solve in general. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the discrete optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over continuous circuit parameters. QAOA objective landscape is notorious for pervasive local minima, and its viability significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical optimizer. In this work, we design double adaptive-region Bayesian optimization (DARBO) for QAOA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly outperforms conventional optimizers in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability. We also address the issues of measurement efficiency and the suppression of quantum noise by conducting the full optimization loop on a superconducting quantum processor as a proof of concept. This work helps to unlock the full power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum advantage in practical classical tasks.
   There is no universal way of optimizing the variation quantum circuits used in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) applications. In this paper the authors introduce a new classical Bayesian optimizer, which converges much more quickly than conventional approaches, and test it for solving the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) problem.

TI A (quasi-)polynomial time heuristic algorithm for synthesizing T-depth
   optimal circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We investigate the problem of synthesizing T-depth optimal quantum circuits for exactly implementable unitaries over the Clifford +T gate set. We construct a subset, Vn, of T-depth 1 unitaries. T-depth-optimal decomposition of unitary U is e(i phi) (Pi V-i(i)) C, V-i is an element of V-n, C is Clifford and vertical bar V-n vertical bar <= n . 2(5.6n). We use nested meet-in-the-middle technique to synthesize provably depth-optimal and T-depthoptimal circuits. For the latter, we achieve space and time complexity O((4(n2))(inverted right perpendiculard/cinverted left perpendicular)) and O((4(n2))((c-1)inverted right perpendiculard/cinverted left perpendicular)) respectively (d is the minimum T-depth, c >= 2 a constant). The previous best algorithm had complexity O(3n . 2(kn2))(inverted right perpendiculard/2inverted left perpendicular) . 2(kn2))(k > 2.5 a constant). We design a more efficient algorithm with space and time complexity poly(n, 2(5.6n), d) (or polyon(log n); 2(5:6n); d) with weaker assumptions). The claimed efficiency, optimality depends on conjectures.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this work, our prime objective is to study the phenomena of quantum chaos and complexity in the machine learning dynamics of Quantum Neural Network (QNN). A Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) in the hybrid quantum-classical framework is introduced as a universal function approximator to perform optimization with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We employ a statistical and differential geometric approach to study the learning theory of QNN. The evolution of parametrized unitary operators is correlated with the trajectory of parameters in the Diffusion metric. We establish the parametrized version of Quantum Complexity and Quantum Chaos in terms of physically relevant quantities, which are not only essential in determining the stability, but also essential in providing a very significant lower bound to the generalization capability of QNN. We explicitly prove that when the system executes limit cycles or oscillations in the phase space, the generalization capability of QNN is maximized. Finally, we have determined the generalization capability bound on the variance of parameters of the QNN in a steady state condition using Cauchy Schwartz Inequality.

TI Detecting quantum resources in a semi-device-independent framework
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate whether one can detect the presence of a quantum resource in some operational task or equivalently whether every quantum resource provides an advantage over its free counterpart in some black box scenarios where one does not have much information about the devices. For any dimension d, we find that for any resource theory with less than d2 number of linearly independent free states or free operations, there exist correlations that can detect the presence of a quantum resource. For this purpose, we introduce the framework for detecting quantum resources semidevice independently by considering the prepare-and-measure scenario with the restriction on the dimension of the quantum channel connecting the preparation box with the measurement box. We then explicitly construct witnesses to observe the presence of various quantum resources. We expect these results will open avenues for detecting and finding uses of quantum resources in general operational tasks.

TI A note on tight projective 2-designs
SO JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL DESIGNS
AB We study tight projective 2-designs in three different settings. In the complex setting, Zauner's conjecture predicts the existence of a tight projective 2-design in every dimension. Pandey, Paulsen, Prakash, and Rahaman recently proposed an approach to make quantitative progress on this conjecture in terms of the entanglement breaking rank of a certain quantum channel. We show that this quantity is equal to the size of the smallest weighted projective 2-design. Next, in the finite field setting, we introduce a notion of projective 2-designs, we characterize when such projective 2-designs are tight, and we provide a construction of such objects. Finally, in the quaternionic setting, we show that every tight projective 2-design for H d determines an equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame of d ( 2 d - 1 ) subspaces of R d ( 2 d + 1 ) of dimension 3.

TI Steps toward quantum simulations of hadronization and energy loss in
   dense matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the timedependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.

TI Phase-dependent microwave response of a graphene Josephson junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Gate-tunable Josephson junctions embedded in a microwave environment provide a promising platform to in situ engineer and optimize novel superconducting quantum circuits. The key quantity for the circuit design is the phase-dependent complex admittance of the junction, which can be probed by sensing a radio frequency SQUID with a tank circuit. Here, we investigate a graphene-based Josephson junction as a prototype gate-tunable element enclosed in a SQUID loop that is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator operating at 3 GHz. With a concise circuit model that describes the dispersive and dissipative response of the coupled system, we extract the phase-dependent junction admittance corrected for self-screening of the SQUID loop. We decompose the admittance into the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent loss, and as these quantities are dictated by the spectrum and population dynamics of the supercurrent-carrying Andreev bound states, we gain insight to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms in the junction. We theoretically reproduce the experimental results by considering a short, diffusive junction model that takes into account the interaction between the Andreev spectrum and the electromagnetic environment, from which we estimate lifetimes on the order of similar to 10 ps for nonequilibrium populations.

TI χ2-based AlGaAs phase sensitive amplifier with record gain,
   noise, and sensitivity
SO OPTICA
AB Phase sensitive amplifiers (PSAs) have the potential to empower substantial advances in emerging generations of optical communication systems as well as classical and quantum on-chip signal processing. While second order nonlinearity (chi(2)) is stronger than third order nonlinearity (chi(3)), it is seldom utilized in semiconductors to realize PSAs owing to the challenges of effectively phase matching the interacting waves as well as countering the two-photon absorption of the pump. In this work, we demonstrate the successful design, fabrication, and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first chi(2)-based semiconductor PSA using an efficient phase matching approach and a pulsed pump, in an AlGaAs Bragg reflection waveguide. The reported AlGaAs PSA achieves on-chip in-phase gain approaching 30 dB, with a sensitivity of 0.005 photons per pulse. Its performance also approaches the theoretical minimal noise figure of 0 dB. With such performance metrics and its capability to operate in the single mode regime, this PSA could usher in a new era of on-chip quantum circuits.

TI Exact solution of long-range stabilizer Renyi entropy in the
   dual-unitary XXZ model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum systems can not be efficiently simulated classically due to the presence of entanglement and nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic. Here we study the generation of magic under evolution by a quantum circuit. To be able to provide exact solutions, we focus on the dual-unitary XXZ model and a measure of magic called stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy (SRE). Moreover, we focus also on long-range SRE, which cannot be removed by short-depth quantum circuits. To obtain exact solutions we use a ZX-calculus representation and graphical rules for the evaluation of the required expressions. We obtain exact results for SRE after short-time evolution in the thermodynamic limit and for long-range SRE for all times and all R & eacute;nyi parameters for a particular partition of the state. Since the numerical evaluation of these quantities is exponentially costly in the R & eacute;nyi parameter, we verify this numerically for low R & eacute;nyi parameters and accessible system sizes and provide numerical results for the long-range SRE in other partitions.

TI Counterexamples to the extendibility of positive unital norm-one maps
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Arveson's extension theorem guarantees that every completely positive map defined on an operator system can be extended to a completely positive map defined on the whole C* -algebra containing it. An analogous statement where complete positivity is replaced by positivity is known to be false. A natural question is whether extendibility could still hold for positive maps satisfying stronger conditions, such as being unital and norm 1. Here we provide three counterexamples showing that positive norm-one unital maps defined on an operator subsystem of a matrix algebra cannot be extended to a positive map on the full matrix algebra. The first counterexample is an unextendible positive unital map with unit norm, the second counterexample is an unextendible positive unital isometry on a real operator space, and the third counterexample is an unextendible positive unital isometry on a complex operator space.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI Decay of quantum conditional mutual information for purely generated
   finitely correlated states
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The connection between quantum state recovery and quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI) is studied for the class of purely generated finitely correlated states (pgFCSs) of one-dimensional quantum spin chains. For a tripartition of the chain into two subsystems separated by a buffer region, it is shown that a pgFCS is an approximate quantum Markov chain (QMC) and, stronger, may be approximated by a quantum Markov chain in trace distance, with an error exponentially small in the buffer size. This implies that (1) a locally corrupted state can be approximately recovered by action of a quantum channel on the buffer system, and (2) QCMI is exponentially small in the size of the buffer region. Bounds on the exponential decay rate of QCMI and examples of quantum recovery channels are presented. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Complete Entropic Inequalities for Quantum Markov Chains
SO ARCHIVE FOR RATIONAL MECHANICS AND ANALYSIS
AB We prove that every GNS-symmetric quantum Markov semigroup on a finite dimensional matrix algebra satisfies a modified log-Sobolev inequality. In the discrete time setting, we prove that every finite dimensional GNS-symmetric quantum channel satisfies a strong data processing inequality with respect to its decoherence free part. Moreover, we establish the first general approximate tensorization property of the relative entropy. This extends the famous strong subadditivity of the quantum entropy (SSA) of two subsystems to the general setting of two subalgebras. All three results are independent of the size of the environment and hence satisfy the tensorization property. They are obtained via a common, conceptually simple method for proving entropic inequalities via spectral or L-2-estimates. As an application, we combine our results on the modified log-Sobolev inequality and approximate tensorization to derive tight bounds for local generators.

TI Robust quantum compilation and circuit optimisation via energy
   minimisation
SO QUANTUM
AB We explore a method for automatically recompiling a quantum circuit A into a target circuit /3, with the goal that both circuits have the same action on a specific input i.e. B vertical bar in > = A vertical bar in >. This is of particular relevance to hybrid, NISQ-era algorithms for dynamical simulation or eigensolving. The user initially specifies B as a blank template: a layout of parameterised unitary gates configured to the identity. The compilation then proceeds using quantum hardware to perform an isomorphic energy-minimisation task, and an optional gate elimination phase to compress the circuit. If B is insufficient for perfect recompilation then the method will result in an approximate so- lution. We optimise using imaginary time evolution, and a recent extension of quantum natural gradient for noisy settings. We successfully recompile a 7-qubit circuit involving 186 gates of multiple types into an alternative form with a different topology, far fewer two-qubit gates, and a smaller family of gate types. Moreover we verify that the process is robust, finding that per-gate noise of up to 1% can still yield near-perfect recompilation. We test the scaling of our algorithm on up to 20 qubits, recompiling into circuits with up to 400 parameterized gates, and incorporate a custom adaptive timestep technique. We note that a classical simulation of the process can be useful to optimise circuits for today's prototypes, and more generally the method may enable 'blind' compilation i.e. harnessing a device whose response to control parameters is deterministic but unknown.
   The code and resources used to generate our results are openly available online [1, 2]. A simple Mathematica demonstration of our algorithm can be found at questlink .qtechtheory.org.

TI Spin-chain based quantum thermal machines
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).

TI Entanglement entropy and vacuum states in Schwarzschild geometry
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recently, it was proposed that there must be either large violation of the additivity conjecture or a set of disentangled states of the black hole in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper, we study the additivity conjecture for quantum states of fields around the Schwarzschild black hole. In the eternal Schwarzschild spacetime, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is calculated assuming that the vacuum state is the Hartle-Hawking vacuum. In the additivity conjecture, we need to consider the state which gives minimal output entropy of a quantum channel. The Hartle-Hawking vacuum state does not give the minimal output entropy which is consistent with the additivity conjecture. We study the entanglement entropy in other static vacua and show that it is consistent with the additivity conjecture.

TI Wafer-scale uniformity improvement of Dolan-bridge Josephson junction by
   shadow evaporation bias correction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the practical limitations of solid-state superconducting quantum processors is the collision of the qubit resonance frequencies, caused by their deviation from the design specifications due to the low reproducibility in qubit fabrication. Josephson junction 100 nm-scale nonlinear inductance of the qubits still suffers from Dolan-bridge shadow evaporation process. Here, we report on a robust wafer-scale Al/AlOx/Al Dolan-bridge Josephson junction (JJ) process using preliminary shadow evaporation bias resist mask correction and comprehensive oxidation optimization. We introduce a topology correction model for two-layer resist mask biasing at a wafer-scale, which takes into account an evaporation source geometry. It results in Josephson junction area variation coefficient (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{CV}_{A}$$\end{document}) improvement down to 1.1% for the critical dimensions from 130 x 170 nm2 to 130 x 670 nm2 over 70 x 70 mm2 (49 cm2) wafer working area. Next, we investigate JJ oxidation process (oxidation method, pressure and time) and its impact on the room temperature resistance reproducibility. Finally, we combine both shadow evaporation bias correction and oxidation best practices for 4-inch wafers, improving \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{CV}_{{R}_{N}}$$\end{document} down to 6.0/5.2/4.1% for 0.025 mu m2 JJ area and 4.0/3.4/2.3% for 0.090 mu m2 JJ area for 49/25/16 cm2 wafer working area correspondingly. The proposed model and oxidation method can be useful for robust wafer-scale superconducting quantum processors fabrication.

TI Channel discord and distortion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Discord, originally notable as a signature of bipartite quantum correlation, in fact can be nonzero classically, i.e. arising from noisy measurements by one of the two parties. Here we redefine classical discord to quantify channel distortion, in contrast to the previous restriction of classical discord to a state, and we then show a monotonic relationship between classical (channel) discord and channel distortion. We show that classical discord is equivalent to (doubly stochastic) channel distortion by numerically discovering a monotonic relation between discord and total-variation distance for a bipartite protocol with one party having a noiseless channel and the other party having a noisy channel. Our numerical method includes randomly generating doubly stochastic matrices for noisy channels and averaging over a uniform measure of input messages. Connecting discord with distortion establishes discord as a signature of classical, not quantum, channel distortion.

TI Wafer-Scale MgB2 Superconducting Devices
SO ACS NANO
AB Progress in superconducting device and detector technologies over the past decade has realized practical applications in quantum computers, detectors for far-infrared telescopes, and optical communications. Superconducting thin-film materials, however, have remained largely unchanged, with aluminum still being the material of choice for superconducting qubits and niobium compounds for high-frequency/high kinetic inductance devices. Magnesium diboride (MgB2), known for its highest transition temperature (T-c = 39 K) among metallic superconductors, is a viable material for elevated temperature and higher frequency superconducting devices moving toward THz frequencies. However, difficulty in synthesizing wafer-scale thin films has prevented implementation of MgB2 devices into the application base of superconducting electronics. Here, we report ultrasmooth (<0.5 nm root-mean-square roughness) and uniform MgB2 thin (<100 nm) films over 100 mm in diameter and present prototype devices fabricated with these films demonstrating key superconducting properties including an internal quality factor over 104 at 4.5 K and high tunable kinetic inductance in the order of tens of pH/sq in a 40 nm thick film. This advancement will enable development of elevated temperature, high-frequency superconducting quantum circuits, and devices.

TI Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for UWB Signal
   Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the increasing requirements for location-based services for Internet of things (IoT) applications, ultrawideband (UWB) technology provides accurate indoor positioning capabilities. However, indoor environments contain various obstacles leading to significant signal propagation effects. This results in errors in the time-of-arrival-based UWB positioning system. Specifically, a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal induces additional distance and position errors owing to the path delay compared to a line-of-sight (LOS) signal. Therefore, UWB signal classification is essential for improving positioning accuracy. Recently, various approaches have successfully classified UWB signals, including machine-learning-based methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM). This study proposes a hybrid quantum CNN (HQCNN) inspired by a CNN for UWB signal classification. HQCNN employs a classical layer before a quantum embedding circuit and variational quantum circuits for the convolutional filter. These structures enable efficient training and implementation. We used UWB channel impulse response data to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compared the benchmarks with HQCNN using the evaluation metrics. The results showed that the HQCNN outperformed the others.

TI Six-point functions and collisions in the black hole interior
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the eternal AdS black hole geometry, we consider two signals sent from the boundaries into the black hole interior shared between the two asymptotic regions. We compute three different out-of-time-order six-point functions to quantify various properties of the collision of these signals behind the horizons: (i) We diagnose the strength of the collision by probing the two-signal state on a late time slice with boundary operators. (ii) We quantify two-sided operator growth, which provides a dual description of the signals meeting in the black hole interior, in terms of the quantum butterfly effect and quantum circuits. (iii) We consider an explicit coupling between the left and right CFTs to make the wormhole traversable and extract information about the collision product from behind the horizon. At a technical level, our results rely on the method of eikonal resummation to obtain the relevant gravitational contributions to Lorentzian six-point functions at all orders in the G(N)-expansion. We observe that such correlation functions display an intriguing factorization property. We corroborate these results with geodesic computations of six-point functions in two- and three-dimensional gravity.

TI Measuring deviations from a perfectly circular cross section of an
   optical nanofiber at the angstrom scale
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Tapered optical fibers (TOFs) with sub-wavelength-diameter waists, known as optical nanofibers, are powerful tools for interfacing quantum emitters and nanophotonics. These applications demand stable polarization of the fiber-guided light field. However, the linear birefringence resulting from & Aring;ngstr & ouml;m-scale (& Aring;-scale) deviations in the nanofiber's ideally circular cross section can lead to significant polarization changes within mm of light propagation. Here, we experimentally investigate such deviations using two in situ approaches. First, we measure the resonance frequencies of hundreds of flexural modes along the nanofiber, which exhibit splitting due to the noncircular cross section. By analyzing the mean resonance frequencies of each pair and the corresponding frequency splitting, we conclude that the nanofiber can be well described as having an elliptical cross section with a mean radius of 255.2(8) nm, where the semiaxes differ by only about 2 & Aring;. Second, we monitor the polarization of the guided light field by imaging the light scattered out of the nanofiber and observe a periodic polarization change along it. From the linear birefringence due to the elliptical cross section, we infer a comparable difference in the semiaxes as the first method, and determine the orientation of the polarization eigenaxes. Our work is crucial for any fundamental or applied study that requires a well-controlled interaction between guided light and matter, in particular for quantum memories, frequency conversion, or lasing that require a large interaction length.

TI Time-adaptive phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Phase estimation is known to be a robust method for single-qubit gate calibration in quantum computers, while Bayesian estimation is widely used in devising optimal methods for learning in quantum systems. We present a Bayesian method that adaptively chooses a control phase and the time of coherent evolution. The uniqueness of the approach is to use analytics to implement an efficient numerical algorithm that offers exact calculation of the Bayesian probability and associated utility functions, even in the presence of noise. We determine the utility of control parameter values using functions of the prior probability of the phase that quantify expected knowledge gain in terms of either expected narrowing of the posterior or expected information gain. We find that by maximizing the rate of expected gain we obtain phase estimates having standard deviation a factor of 1.43 larger than the Heisenberg limit using a classical sequential strategy for noise-free experiments. In the presence of dephasing, we find near-optimal performance with respect to the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. We also demonstrate some robustness of the estimates to noise that is not accounted for in the model of the estimator, making the methods suitable for calibrating operations in quantum computers. The rate of gain can be adjusted to account for times in the experiment other than the coherent evolution of the unknown phase, such as times required for state preparation or readout. The combined features of the method make it well suited to single-qubit gate calibration in trapped-ion or neutral atom experiments and promises a wide range of other applications by offering near-optimal phase estimation that straightforwardly accounts for experimental imperfections.

TI Mitigating sloppiness in joint estimation of successive squeezing
   parameters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB When two successive squeezing operations with the same phase are applied to a field mode, reliably estimating the amplitude of each is impossible because the output state depends solely on their sum. In this case, the quantum statistical model becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular. However, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is subjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing operations. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of a phase-shift scrambling transformation, optimized to reduce sloppiness and maximize the overall estimation precision using only classical probes. We also compare the optimized precision bounds of joint estimation with those of stepwise estimation methods, finding that joint estimation retains an advantage despite the quantum noise induced by the residual parameter incompatibility. Finally, we analyze the precision achievable by general-dyne detection and find that it approaches the optimal precision when one of the two squeezing amplitudes is large enough.

TI Hot ion implantation to create dense NV center ensembles in diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Creating dense and shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles with good spin properties is a prerequisite for developing diamond-based quantum sensors exhibiting better performance. Ion implantation is a key enabling tool for precisely controlling spatial localization and density of NV color centers in diamond. However, it suffers from a low creation yield, while higher ion fluences significantly damage the crystal lattice. In this work, we realize N-2(+) ion implantation in the 30-40 keV range at high temperatures. At 800 degrees C, NV's ensemble photoluminescence emission is three to four times higher than room temperature implanted films, while narrow electron spin resonance linewidths of 1.5 MHz, comparable to well-established implantation techniques, are obtained. In addition, we found that ion fluences above 2 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) can be used without graphitization of the diamond film, in contrast to room temperature implantation. This study opens promising perspectives in optimizing diamond films with implanted NV ensembles that could be integrated into quantum sensing devices.

TI Characteristics of the phonon laser in the active levitated
   optomechanical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Phonon lasers, coherent oscillations of phonons, have gradually become one of the emerging frontiers in the last decades, and have promising applications in quantum sensing, information processing, and precise measurement. Recently, phonon lasers based on dissipative coupling have been realized in an active levitated optomechanical (LOM) system for the first time. Here, we further investigated the characteristics of the phonon laser in the system above regarding the oscillator amplitude and the phonon laser linewidth. We established both the experimental system and a physical model of the phonon laser. On the basis of simulations and experiments, the influences of pumping power, numerical aperture, the microsphere's diameter and refractive index on the performance of the phonon lasers are sufficiently discussed. Our work is of great significance for the high-quality phonon lasers generated by the appropriate parameters, which is the basis for the in-depth research and practical application.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Shared entanglement for three-party causal order guessing game
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In a variant of communication tasks, players cooperate in choosing their local strategies to compute a given task later, working separately. Utilizing quantum bits for communication and sharing entanglement between parties is a recognized method to enhance performance in these situations. In this work, we introduce the game for which three parties, Alice, Bob and Charlie, would like to discover the hidden order in which they make the moves. We show the advantage of quantum strategies that use shared entanglement and local operations over classical setups for discriminating operations' composition order. The role of quantum resources improving the probability of successful discrimination is also investigated. Our research provides a basis for examining computational model featuring a specific gate set while examining the diverse operations achievable through permutations of its elements.

TI Molecular Vibrational Polariton Dynamics: What Can Polaritons Do?
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: When molecular vibrational modes strongly couple to virtual states of photonic modes, new molecular vibrational polariton states are formed, along with a large population of dark reservoir modes. The polaritons are much like the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals when atomic orbitals form molecular bonds, while the dark modes are like nonbonding orbitals. Because the polariton states are half-matter and half-light, whose energy is shifted from the parental states, polaritons are predicted to modify chemistry under thermally activated conditions, leading to an exciting and emerging field known as polariton chemistry that could potentially shift paradigms in chemistry. Despite several published results supporting this concept, the chemical physics and mechanism of polariton chemistry remain elusive. One reason for this challenge is that previous works cannot differentiate polaritons from dark modes. This limitation makes delineating the contributions to chemistry from polaritons and dark states difficult. However, this level of insight is critical for developing a solid mechanism for polariton chemistry to design and predict the outcome of strong coupling with any given reaction. My group addressed the challenge of differentiating the dynamics of polaritons and dark modes by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. Specifically, (1) we found that polaritons can facilitate intra-and intermolecular vibrational energy transfer, opening a pathway to control vibrational energy flow in liquid-phase molecular systems, and (2) by studying a single-step isomerization event, we verified that indeed polaritons can modify chemical dynamics under strong coupling conditions, but in contrast, the dark modes behave like uncoupled molecules and do not change the dynamics. This finding confirmed the central concept of polariton chemistry: polaritons modify the potential energy landscape of reactions. The result also clarified the role of dark modes, which lays a critical foundation for designing cavities for future polariton chemistry. Aside from using 2D IR spectroscopy to study polariton chemistry, we also used the same technique to develop molecular polaritons into a potential quantum simulation platform. We demonstrated that polaritons have Rabi oscillations, and using a checkerboard cavity design, we showed that polaritons could have large nonlinearity across space. We further used the checkerboard polaritons to simulate coherence transfer and visualize it. A unidirectional coherence transfer was observed, indicating non Hermitian dynamics. The highlighted efforts in this Account provide a solid understanding of the capability of polaritons for chemistry and quantum information science. I conclude this Account by discussing a few challenges for moving polariton chemistry toward being predictable and making the polariton quantum platform a complement to existing systems.

TI Compressive Gate Set Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Flexible characterization techniques that provide a detailed picture of the experimental imperfections under realistic assumptions are crucial to gain actionable advice in the development of quantum computers. Gate set tomography self-consistently extracts a complete tomographic description of the implementation of an entire set of quantum gates, as well as the initial state and measurement, from experimental data. It has become a standard tool for this task but comes with high requirements on the number of sequences and their design, making it already experimentally challenging for only two qubits. In this work, we show that low-rank approximations of gate sets can be obtained from significantly fewer gate sequences and that it is sufficient to draw them at random. This coherent noise characterization however still contains the crucial information for improving the implementation. To this end, we formulate the data processing problem of gate set tomography as a rank-constrained tensor completion problem. We provide an algorithm to solve this problem while respecting the usual positivity and normalization constraints of quantum mechanics. For this purpose, we combine methods from Riemannian optimization and machine learning and develop a saddle-free second-order geometrical optimization method on the complex Stiefel manifold. Besides the reduction in sequences, we numerically demonstrate that the algorithm does not rely on structured gate sets or an elaborate circuit design to robustly perform gate set tomography. Therefore, it is more flexible than traditional approaches. We also demonstrate how coherent errors in shadow estimation protocols can be mitigated using estimates from gate set tomography.

TI Roadmap for unconventional computing with nanotechnology
SO NANO FUTURES
AB In the 'Beyond Moore's Law' era, with increasing edge intelligence, domain-specific computing embracing unconventional approaches will become increasingly prevalent. At the same time, adopting a variety of nanotechnologies will offer benefits in energy cost, computational speed, reduced footprint, cyber resilience, and processing power. The time is ripe for a roadmap for unconventional computing with nanotechnologies to guide future research, and this collection aims to fill that need. The authors provide a comprehensive roadmap for neuromorphic computing using electron spins, memristive devices, two-dimensional nanomaterials, nanomagnets, and various dynamical systems. They also address other paradigms such as Ising machines, Bayesian inference engines, probabilistic computing with p-bits, processing in memory, quantum memories and algorithms, computing with skyrmions and spin waves, and brain-inspired computing for incremental learning and problem-solving in severely resource-constrained environments. These approaches have advantages over traditional Boolean computing based on von Neumann architecture. As the computational requirements for artificial intelligence grow 50 times faster than Moore's Law for electronics, more unconventional approaches to computing and signal processing will appear on the horizon, and this roadmap will help identify future needs and challenges. In a very fertile field, experts in the field aim to present some of the dominant and most promising technologies for unconventional computing that will be around for some time to come. Within a holistic approach, the goal is to provide pathways for solidifying the field and guiding future impactful discoveries.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Optimization Strategy for Optimal Dispatch to
   Increase Heat and Power Efficiency
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING
AB Combined heat and power (CHP) systems are widely used in industries for their high energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. The optimal dispatch of CHP systems involves scheduling the operation of various equipment to minimize the total operational cost while meeting the heat and power demand of the facility. In this research work, a novel quantum-inspired optimization algorithm is proposed for the first time to solve the optimal dispatch problem of CHP systems. The proposed algorithm combines the principles of quantum mechanics with classical optimization algorithms to achieve a better solution. The algorithm uses quantum gates to perform quantum operations on the optimization variables, which allows for the exploration of a larger search space and potentially better solutions than classical algorithms. The proposed algorithm also incorporates a classical optimizer to refine the numerical evaluations acquired from the quantum operations. The performance of the adopted optimization technique was demonstrated by associating it with various other optimization techniques based on factors such as the speed of convergence, computational time, and the quality of the solution. The comparison is made on two standard CHP systems subjected to various quality and inequality constraints. The simulation results indicate that the quantum-inspired optimization technique surpassed the other algorithms in both solution quality and computational efficiency. The implemented algorithm provides a promising solution to the optimal dispatch problem of CHP systems. Future research can further explore the application of quantum-inspired optimization algorithms in other energy systems and optimize the algorithm's parameters to improve its performance.

TI Nonreciprocal transmission in hybrid atomic ensemble-optomechanical
   systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate perfect optical nonreciprocal transmission in a hybrid optomechanical system that incorporates an atomic ensemble. By introducing complex coupling strengths between the atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator, nonreciprocity is induced through interference between distinct optical pathways. The nonreciprocal transmission is governed by the real and imaginary components of the coupling constants, along with the relative phase differences between the optomechanical couplings. Our analysis reveals that, with precise tuning of system parameters, such as coupling strengths, detuning, and phase differences, perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. We derive the conditions necessary for optimal nonreciprocal transmission and demonstrate its dependence on the complex nature of the coupling. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of nonreciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, with potential applications in quantum communication, signal processing, and photonics.

Our method can not only be used for two-photon hyperentangled Bell state analysis and three-photon hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state analysis, but is also suitable for N-photon hyperentangledGHZstate analysis. In our protocols, the bit information of hyperentanglement is read out via the nonlinear interaction, and the phase information is obtained by using linear optical element and single photon detector.

AB Polarization rotator-splitters (PRSs) are crucial components for controlling the polarization states of light in classical and quantum communication systems. We design and experimentally demonstrate a broadband PRS based on the lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform. Both the rotator and splitter sections are based on adiabatically tapered waveguide structures, and the whole device only requires a single etching step. We show efficient PRS operation over an experimentally measured bandwidth of 130 nm at telecom wavelengths, potentially as wide as 500 nm according to simulation prediction, with relatively low polarization crosstalks of similar to-10 dB. Our PRS is highly compatible with the design constraints and fabrication processes of common LNOI photonic devices, and it could become an important element in future LNOI photonic integrated circuits.

TI Differential-phase-shift quantum digital signature without disclosing
   measurement information
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB A novel quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme using differential-phase-shift signal is presented. A sender broadcasts a weak coherent pulse train with 0 or pi phase to receivers, who measure its relative phases using delay interferometers with photon detectors and then employ the measurement results as authentication keys. The key distribution stage is completed with this signal transmission. Neither exchange of basis information between the sender and receivers nor exchange of a portion of a sifted key between the receivers with each other are conducted, unlike conventional QDS protocols. Therefore, our system is simpler than conventional ones. The security of the proposed scheme is discussed, and calculations evaluating system parameters to guarantee the QDS operation, such as the key length and authentication threshold, are presented.

TI From Dynamical to Steady-State Many-Body Metrology: Precision Limits and
   Their Attainability with Two-Body Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter theta via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body time-independent interactions enhance its theta sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the quantum Fisher information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding theta: (i) via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii) in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (timeaveraged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize trade-offs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.

AB In recent years, developments in quantum sensing, laser, and atomic sensor technologies have also enabled advancement in the field of quantum navigation. Atomic -based gyroscopes have emerged as one of the most critical atomic sensors in this respect. In this review, a brief technology statement of spin exchange relaxation free (SERF) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) type atomic comagnetometer gyroscope (CG) is presented. Related studies in the literature have been gathered, and the fundamental compositions of CGs with technical basics are presented. A comparison of SERF and NMR CGs is provided. A basic simulation of SERF CG was carried out because of its high theoretic bias stability limit. Besides, some highly critical challenges for CGs were examined and reported with compensation methods. The objective of this review is to offer a guide for researchers to develop high -precision atomic gyroscopes and to encourage further research.

AB The generation of single photons in the mid-infrared spectral region is attracting the interest of scientific and technological research, motivated by the potential improvements that many important and emerging applications, such as quantum sensing, metrology and communication, could benefit from. This review reports the progress in short and mid-infrared single photon generation, focusing on probabilistic sources based on the two non-linear processes of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four wave mixing (FWM). On one hand, numerical simulations of mid-infrared SPDC are described as a powerful tool to assist and guide the experimental realization, along with the implementation and engineering of novel non-linear materials. On the other hand, the advantages offered by FWM in silicon waveguides in terms of integration, miniaturization and manufacturability are presented, providing an optimal technology for integrated quantum applications.

TI Electronic and optical characterization of bulk single crystals of cubic
   boron nitride (cBN)
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a relatively less studied wide bandgap semiconductor despite its many promising mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. We report on the electronic, structural, and optical characterization of commercial cBN crystal platelets. Temperature dependent transport measurements revealed the charge limited diode behavior of the cBN crystals. The equilibrium Fermi level was determined to be 0.47 eV below the conduction band, and the electron conduction was identified as n-type. Unirradiated dark and amber colored cBN crystals displayed broad photoluminescence emission peaks centered around different wavelengths. RC series zero phonon line defect emission peaks were observed at room temperature from the electron beam irradiated and oxygen ion implanted cBN crystals, making this material a promising candidate for high power microwave devices, next generation power electronics, and future quantum sensing applications.

TI Nanotesla Magnetometry with the Silicon Vacancy in Silicon Carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Silicon carbide is a promising host material for spin-defect-based quantum sensors owing to its commercial availability and established techniques for electrical and optical microfabricated device integration. The negatively charged silicon vacancy is one of the leading spin defects studied in silicon carbide owing to its near-telecom photoemission, high spin number, and nearly temperature-independent ground-state zero-field splitting. We report the realization of nanotesla shot-noise-limited ensemble magnetometry based on optically detected magnetic resonance with the silicon vacancy in 4H silicon carbide. By coarsely optimizing the anneal parameters and minimizing power broadening, we achieve a sensitivity of 50 nT/root Hz and a theoretical shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 3.5 nT/ root Hz. This is accomplished without utilizing complex photonic engineering, control protocols, or applying excitation powers greater than a watt. This work demonstrates that the silicon vacancy in silicon carbide provides a low-cost and simple approach to quantum sensing of magnetic fields.

TI Identifying subsurface metal microstructure and its materials via
   quantum wide-field microscope
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Targeted detection of subsurface metal microstructure is crucial for evaluating the performance of engineering structures. This paper presents a nondestructive inspection method for characterizing subsurface metal microstructure by integrating quantum sensing, electromagnetic transmission theory, and optical field imaging. In a field of view of 1000x1000 mu m2, the induced microwave fields of six different metallic materials were characterized by NV centers, and the relationship between the induced microwave fields and the conductivity of the metallic materials was analyzed theoretically. Meanwhile, the induced microwave fields generated by different metallic defect structures were characterized, and the reasons for the differences in microwave fields were analyzed based on the microstrip transmission theory. This phenomenon verifies the feasibility of utilizing quantum, combined with optical field imaging, to characterize subsurface metallic materials and structures. The method is expected to be applied in materials evaluation and engineering maintenance, thus effectively enhancing quantum testing technology applications.

TI Entanglement-enhanced quantum lock-in detection achieving Heisenberg
   scaling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum lock-in detection (QLID) is a powerful technique for extracting weak oscillating signals within noise. While entanglement may enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), its integration with QLID is still an experimental challenge. Here we report the first experimental realization of entanglement-enhanced QLID using two trapped 40Ca+ ions. We prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using a M phi lmer-S phi rensen gate and then apply periodic multipulse sequences to execute QLID. Using the GHZ state, the measurement precision approaches the Heisenberg limit (Delta omega proportional to N-1), surpassing the SQL (Delta omega proportional to N-1/2) achievable with non-entangled states. Notably, QLID achieves a superior inverse-quadratic temporal scaling (Delta omega proportional to T-2), exceeding the conventional inverse-linear scaling (Delta omega proportional to T-1), regardless of entanglement. We further optimize pulse sequences for enhanced robustness against experimental errors. This work establishes a powerful pathway to Heisenberg-limited quantum sensing of weak oscillating signals within noise.

TI Entanglement-assisted multi-aperture pulse-compression radar for angle
   resolving detection
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entanglement has been known to boost target detection, despite it being destroyed by lossy-noisy propagation. Recently, Zhuang and Shapiro (2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 010501) proposed a quantum pulse-compression radar to extend entanglement's benefit to target range estimation. In a radar application, many other aspects of the target are of interest, including angle, velocity and cross section. In this study, we propose a dual-receiver radar scheme that employs a high time-bandwidth product microwave pulse entangled with a pre-shared reference signal available at the receiver, to investigate the direction of a distant object and show that the direction-resolving capability is significantly improved by entanglement, compared to its classical counterpart under the same parameter settings. We identify the applicable scenario of this quantum radar to be short-range and high-frequency, which enables entanglement's benefit in a reasonable integration time.

TI Quantum thermodynamics of boundary time-crystals
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Time-translation symmetry breaking is a mechanism for the emergence of non-stationary many-body phases, so-called time-crystals, in Markovian open quantum systems. Dynamical aspects of time-crystals have been extensively explored over the recent years. However, much less is known about their thermodynamic properties, also due to the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of these phases. Here, we consider the paradigmatic boundary time-crystal system, in a finite-temperature environment, and demonstrate the persistence of the time-crystalline phase at any temperature. Furthermore, we analyze thermodynamic aspects of the model investigating, in particular, heat currents, power exchange and irreversible entropy production. Our work sheds light on the thermodynamic cost of sustaining nonequilibrium time-crystalline phases and provides a framework for characterizing time-crystals as possible resources for, e.g. quantum sensing. Our results may be verified in experiments, for example with trapped ions or superconducting circuits, since we connect thermodynamic quantities with mean value and covariance of collective (magnetization) operators.

TI Quantum scaling atomic superheterodyne receiver
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Measurement sensitivity is one of the critical indicators for Rydberg atomic radio receivers. This work quantitatively studies the relationship between the atomic superheterodyne receiver's sensitivity and the number of atoms involved in the measurement. The atom number is changed by adjusting the length of the interaction area. The results show that for the ideal case where only interaction noise is present and the RF waves are uniformly distributed, the sensitivity of the atomic superheterodyne receiver exhibits a quantum scaling: the amplitude of its output signal is proportional to the atom number, and the amplitude of its read-out noise is proportional to the square root of the atom number. Hence, its sensitivity is inversely proportional to the square root of the atom number. This work also gives a detailed discussion of the properties of transit noise in atomic receivers and the influence of some non-ideal factors on sensitivity scaling. This work is significant in the field of atom-based quantum precision measurements.

TI Quantum gas magnifier for sub-lattice-resolved imaging of 3D quantum
   systems
SO NATURE
AB Imaging is central to gaining microscopic insight into physical systems, and new microscopy methods have always led to the discovery of new phenomena and a deeper understanding of them. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a quantum simulation platform, featuring a variety of advanced detection tools including direct optical imaging while pinning the atoms in the lattice(1,2). However, this approach suffers from the diffraction limit, high optical density and small depth of focus, limiting it to two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here we introduce an imaging approach where matter wave optics magnifies the density distribution before optical imaging, allowing 2D sub-lattice-spacing resolution in three-dimensional (3D) systems. By combining the site-resolved imaging with magnetic resonance techniques for local addressing of individual lattice sites, we demonstrate full accessibility to 2D local information and manipulation in 3D systems. We employ the high-resolution images for precision thermodynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices as well as studies of thermalization dynamics driven by thermal hopping. The sub-lattice resolution is demonstrated via quench dynamics within the lattice sites. The method opens the path for spatially resolved studies of new quantum many-body regimes, including exotic lattice geometries or sub-wavelength lattices(3-6), and paves the way for single-atom-resolved imaging of atomic species, where efficient laser cooling or deep optical traps are not available, but which substantially enrich the toolbox of quantum simulation of many-body systems.
   Existing techniques for high-resolution imaging of trapped quantum gases are limited to two-dimensional systems, but the approach described here works in three dimensions by magnifying the quantum gas with matter wave optics.

TI Tightly Trapped Atom Interferometer inside a Hollow-Core Fiber
SO PHOTONICS
AB We demonstrate a fiber-guided atom interferometer in a far-off-resonant trap (FORT) of 100 mu K. The differential light shift (DLS) introduced by the FORT leads to the inhomogeneous dephasing of the tightly trapped atoms inside a hollow-core fiber. The DLS-induced dephasing is greatly suppressed in pi/2-pi-pi/2 Doppler-insensitive interferometry. The spin coherence time is extended to 13.4 ms by optimizing the coupling of the trapping laser beam into a quasi-single-mode hollow-core anti-resonant fiber. The Doppler-sensitive interferometry shows a much shorter coherence time, indicating that the main limits to our fiber-guided atom interferometer are the wide axial velocity distribution and the irregular modes of the Raman laser beams inside the fiber. This work paves the way for portable and miniaturized quantum devices, which have advantages for inertial sensing at arbitrary orientations and in dynamic environments.

TI Stability of Near-Surface Nitrogen Vacancy Centers Using Dielectric
   Surface Passivation
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We study the photophysical stability of ensemble near-surface nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond under vacuum and air. The optically detected magnetic resonance contrast of the NV centers was measured following exposure to laser illumination, showing opposing trends in air compared to vacuum (increasing by up to 9% and dropping by up to 25%, respectively). Characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests a surface reconstruction: In air, atmospheric oxygen adsorption on a surface leads to an increase in NV- fraction, whereas in vacuum, net oxygen desorption increases the NV0 fraction. NV charge state switching is confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy. Deposition of similar to 2 nm alumina (Al2O3) over the diamond surface was shown to stabilize the NV charge state under illumination in either environment, attributed to a more stable surface electronegativity. The use of an alumina coating on diamond is therefore a promising approach to improve the resilience of NV sensors.

TI Unitary p-wave interactions between fermions in an optical
   lattice
SO NATURE
AB Exchange-antisymmetric pair wavefunctions in fermionic systems can give rise to unconventional superconductors and superfluids(1-3). The realization of these states in controllable quantum systems, such as ultracold gases, could enable new types of quantum simulations(4-8), topological quantum gates(9-11) and exotic few-body states(12-15). However, p-wave and other antisymmetric interactions are weak in naturally occurring systems(16,17), and their enhancement via Feshbach resonances in ultracold systems has been limited by three-body loss(18-24). Here we create isolated pairs of spin-polarized fermionic atoms in a multiorbital three-dimensional optical lattice. We spectroscopically measure elastic p-wave interaction energies of strongly interacting pairs of atoms near a magnetic Feshbach resonance. The interaction strengths are widely tunable by the magnetic field and confinement strength, and yet collapse onto a universal curve when rescaled by the harmonic energy and length scales of a single lattice site. The absence of three-body processes enables the observation of elastic unitary p-wave interactions, as well as coherent oscillations between free-atom and interacting-pair states. All observations are compared both to an exact solution using a p-wave pseudopotential and to numerical solutions using an ab initio interaction potential. The understanding and control of on-site p-wave interactions provides a necessary component for the assembly of multiorbital lattice models(25,26) and a starting point for investigations of how to protect such systems from three-body recombination in the presence of tunnelling, for instance using Pauli blocking and lattice engineering(27,28).

TI Multi-parameter estimation in critical quantum metrology
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Quantum metrology leverages the unique properties of quantum systems to enhance parameter estimation beyond classical limits. In this short review, we introduce the core concepts of quantum metrology, with a particular focus on its extension to multi-parameter estimation. We begin by outlining the foundational principles of quantum metrology and explore how quantum criticality can enhance measurement precision - especially near quantum phase transitions, where systems exhibit heightened sensitivity to external perturbations. Next, we consider the framework of multi-parameter quantum critical metrology, in which the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters near criticality can lead to further improvements in accuracy. Finally, we discuss measurement-induced phase transitions, a phenomenon emerging in the context of continuous quantum measurements that introduces non-Hermitian dynamics and fundamentally alters the system's behavior. This review provides a concise overview of these key developments and highlights their significance for future progress in quantum sensing technologies.

   INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS
AB We describe a method to automatically generate an ion implantation recipe, a set of energies and fluences, to produce a desired defect density profile in a solid using the fewest required energies. We simulate defect density profiles for a range of ion energies, fit them with an appropriate function, and interpolate to yield defect density profiles at arbitrary ion energies. Given N energies, we then optimize a set of N energy-fluence pairs to match a given target defect density profile. Finally, we find the minimum N such that the error between the target defect density profile and the defect density profile generated by the N energy-fluence pairs is less than a given threshold. Inspired by quantum sensing applications with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we apply our technique to calculate optimal ion implantation recipes to create uniform-density 1 mu m surface layers of N-15 or vacancies (using He-4).

TI Photostable triphenylmethyl-based diradicals with a degenerate
   singlet-triplet ground state and strong photoluminescence
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We present a new class of luminescent diradicals based on tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) cores symmetrically bridged by indolocarbazole donors. These diradicals exhibit pure diradical character y0 and unprecedented photoluminescence quantum yields phi of up to 18%, addressing key challenges in the development of stable, emissive organic diradicals. Light emitting diradicals represent a formidable challenge for synthetic chemists; for applications as molecular color centers in quantum sensing and as emitters in optoelectronics. Unlike conventional approaches that require the conversion of closed-shell precursors, we directly couple brominated TTM radicals via Buchwald-Hartwig coupling. The magnetic and optical properties of the resulting molecules are comprehensively characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance EPR, UV-vis absorption, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. This work unites the robust photophysics of discrete TTM radicals with the electronic versatility of donor-bridged multi-spin systems, offering a promising design strategy for functional open-shell emitters.

TI Quantum-enhanced sensing of displacements and electric fields with
   two-dimensional trapped-ion crystals
SO SCIENCE
AB Fully controllable ultracold atomic systems are creating opportunities for quantum sensing, yet demonstrating a quantum advantage in useful applications by harnessing entanglement remains a challenging task. Here, we realize a many-body quantum-enhanced sensor to detect displacements and electric fields using a crystal of similar to 150 trapped ions. The center-of-mass vibrational mode of the crystal serves as a high-Q mechanical oscillator, and the collective electronic spin serves as the measurement device. By entangling the oscillator and collective spin and controlling the coherent dynamics via amany-body echo, a displacement is mapped into a spin rotation while avoiding quantum back-action and thermal noise. We achieve a sensitivity to displacements of 8.8 +/- 0.4 decibels below the standard quantum limit and a sensitivity for measuring electric fields of 240 +/- 10 nanovolts per meter in 1 second. Feasible improvements should enable the use of trapped ions in searches for dark matter.

TI A novel gas sensing principle based on quantum fluctuations
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a model of a novel measurement scheme to detect small amounts of a gas species via the ground-state fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (dispersion forces) depending on the entire spectral properties of all objects.Here, we describe an a theoretical measurement scheme of optically trapped nanoparticles in a hollow-core fibre. We calculate the effects of the gases on the thermal motion of the nanoparticles and present a neural network-based method for reconstructing the gas concentrations. We present an example of one possible setup capable of detecting concentrations of CO2 down to 0.01 volume per cent with an accuracy of 1 ppm.Reliable detection of small concentrations of specific molecules in a gas is essential for numerous applications such as security and environmental monitoring, medical tests, and production processes. Unlike other measurement schemes, such as surface plasmons or functionalised surfaces, this could allow fast, continuous monitoring and using small sample quantities, without influencing the probe or the sensor system.

TI Electric-Field Fluctuations as the Cause of Spectral Instabilities in
   Colloidal Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spectral diffusion (SD) represents a substantial obstacle toward implementation of solid-state quantum emitters as a source of indistinguishable photons. By performing high-resolution emission spectroscopy for individual colloidal quantum dots at cryogenic temperatures, we prove the causal link between the quantum-confined Stark effect and SD. Statistically analyzing the wavelength of emitted photons, we show that increasing the sensitivity of the transition energy to an applied electric field results in amplified spectral fluctuations. This relation is quantitatively fit to a straightforward model, indicating the presence of a stochastic electric field on a microscopic scale, whose standard deviation is 9 kV/cm, on average. The current method will enable the study of SD in multiple types of quantum emitters such as solid-state defects or organic lead halide perovskite quantum dots, for which spectral instability is a critical barrier for applications in quantum sensing.

TI Quantum Pulse Gate Attack on IM/DD Optical Key Distribution Exploiting
   Symbol Shape Distortion
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB Intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) optical key distribution (OKD) is a method to generate a secret key whose security against passive eavesdropping is guaranteed by the shot noise inherent to the photodetection process. Here the effects of intensity-dependent symbol shape distortion on the IM/DD OKD security are investigated assuming that the eavesdropper can implement temporal mode demultiplexing using e.g. the quantum pulse gating technique. The quantitative analysis includes key generation based on either hard- or soft-decoding of the detected signal as well as the impact of excess detection noise. A simple, rule-of-thumb relation between the severity of the symbol shape distortion and the signal strength required to ensure key security is presented.

TI Integrated Bragg grating filters based on
   silicon-Sb2Se3 with non-volatile bandgap
   engineering capability
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated optical filters show outstanding capability in integrated reconfigurable photonic applications, including wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), programmable photonic processors, and on-chip quantum photonic networks. Present schemes for reconfigurable filters either have a large footprint or suffer from high static power consumption, hindering the development of reconfigurable photonic integrated systems. Here, a reconfigurable hybrid Bragg grating filter is elaborately designed through a precise, modified coupling mode theory. It is also experimentally presented by integrating non-volatile phase change material (PCM) Sb2Se3 on silicon to realize compact, low-loss, and broadband engineering operations. The fabricated filter holds a compact footprint of 0.5 mu m x 43.5 mu m and maintains a low insertion loss of < 0.5 dB after multiple levels of engineering to achieve crystallization. The filter is able to switch from a low-loss transmission state to the Bragg reflection state, making it a favorable solution for large-scale reconfigurable photonic circuits. With a switching extinction ratio over 30 dB at 1504.85 nm, this hybrid filter breaks the tradeoff between insertion loss and tuning range. These results reveal its potential as a new candidate for a basic element in large-scale non-volatile reconfigurable systems.

TI Electrical operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits in an in-plane
   magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors, especially Ge and Si, are actively investigated as platforms for ultrafast electrical spin manipulation thanks to their strong spin-orbit coupling. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of spin dynamics in these systems is in the early stages of development, particularly for in-plane magnetic fields as used in the vast majority of experiments. In this work, we present a comprehensive theory of spin physics in planar Ge hole quantum dots in an in-plane magnetic field, where the orbital terms play a dominant role in qubit physics, and provide a brief comparison with experimental measurements of the angular dependence of electrically driven spin resonance. We focus the theoretical analysis on electrical spin operation, phonon-induced relaxation, and the existence of coherence sweet spots. We find that the choice of magnetic field orientation makes a substantial difference for the properties of hole spin qubits. Specifically, we find that (i) EDSR for in-plane magnetic fields varies nonlinearly with the field strength and weaker than for perpendicular magnetic fields. (ii) The EDSR Rabi frequency is maximized when the a.c. electric field is aligned parallel to the magnetic field, and vanishes when the two are perpendicular. (iii) The orbital magnetic field terms make the in-plane g-factor strongly anisotropic in a squeezed dot, in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. (iv) Focusing on random telegraph noise, we show that the effect of noise in an in-plane magnetic field cannot be fully mitigated, as the orbital magnetic field terms expose the qubit to all components of the defect electric field. These findings will provide a guideline for experiments to design ultrafast, highly coherent hole spin qubits in Ge.

TI Darwinian standard model of physics obtains general relativity
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A Darwinian perspective of the standard model of physics (SMP) quantum fields (QFs) is proposed, called the physics-cell (PC) approach. BecauseDarwinian evolution is not deterministic, the PC approach allows for the violation of the charge-paritytime symmetry. In the PC approach, the SMP laws are contained in the PCs which receive and emit QFs through the PCs' outer surface which is necessarily constrained by Bekenstein's surface-information limit. The establishment of gauge invariance-compatible communication protocol-agreements between the PCs obtains an average correlation ofQFs that is equivalent to an asymmetric metric tensor with the symmetric component being equivalent to general relativity and the anti-symmetric component being very small but still large enough to allow for enough ex-nihilo mass-creation to explain dark matter. Based on experimental data, the PC minimum-size is 1.5 . 10(-31) m which is similar to the scale at which the grand unified theory force convergence occurs. Plus, the cosmological constant energy density is equal to the energy density of the discreteness-correction QF alterations that constitute the dark energy and are caused by the finiteness of the PC time-step which equals 5.0 . 10(-40) s, hence obtaining a PC maximum information processing rate of 6.6 . 10(47) qubit/s. Moreover, the PC approach obtains that the minimum mass for black holes is 2.1 . 10(9) larger than the maximum mass for which the no-hiding theorem can apply and that the maximum capacity for quantum computers is about 29.0 . 10(12) qubit.

TI Large mode volume integrated Brillouin lasers for scalable ultra-low
   linewidth and high power
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ultra-low linewidth, high output power, integrated single mode lasers, that operate from the visible to shortwave-IR, are critical for future compact, portable, precision applications. Achieving this performance in a CMOS compatible integration platform that can also enable scaling to lower linewidths and higher powers remains a key challenge. We report demonstration of a class of integrated laser with a 31 mHz instantaneous linewidth, 41 mW output power, and 73 dB sidemode suppression ratio, tunable over 22.5 nm. This performance is possible due to Brillouin nonlinear laser dynamics in a large mode volume, meter-scale, MHz free spectral range, low loss silicon nitride coil resonator with the potential to scale to an operating regime of mHz fundamental linewidth and Watt class lasers. Such lasers hold promise to unlock new sensitivity and fidelity for quantum sensing and computing, ultra-low-noise mmWave and RF generation, fiber sensing, and atomic, molecular, and optical physics.

TI Universal time scalings of sensitivity in Markovian quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Assuming Markovian time evolution of a quantum sensing system, we study the general characterization of the optimal sensitivity scalings with time, under most general quantum control protocols. We allow the estimated parameter to influence both the Hamiltonian as well as the dissipative part of the quantum master equation and focus on the asymptotic-time along with the short-time sensitivity scalings. We find that via simple algebraic conditions (in terms of the Hamiltonian, the jump operators as well as their parameter derivatives), one can characterize the four classes of metrological models that represent: quadratic-linear, quadratic-quadratic, linearlinear, and linear-quadratic time scalings. We also investigate the relevant time scales on which the transition between the two regimes appears. Additionally, we provide universal numerical methods to obtain quantitative bounds on sensitivity that are the tightest that exist in the literature. Simplicity and universality of our results make it suitable for diverse applications in quantum metrology.

TI Dynamic Polarizability of the 85Rb
   5D3/2-State in 1064 nm Light
SO ATOMS
AB We report a measurement of the dynamic (ac) scalar polarizability of the 5D(3/2) state in Rb-85 atoms at a laser wavelength of 1064 nm. Contrary to a recent measurement in Phys. Rev. A 104, 063304 (2021), the experiments are performed in a low-intensity regime in which the ac shift is less than the 5D(3/2) state's hyperfine structure, as utilized in numerous experiments with cold, trapped atoms. The extracted ac polarizability is alpha(5D3/2)=-499 +/- 59 a.u., within the uncertainty of the aforementioned previous result. The calibration of the 1064 nm light intensity, performed by analyzing light shifts of the D1 line, is the main source of uncertainty. Our results are useful for applications of the Rb 5D(3/2) state in metrology, quantum sensing, and fundamental-physics research on Rydberg atoms and molecules.

TI DNA-mediated assembly of Au bipyramids into anisotropic light emitting
   kagome superlattices
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA allows one to design diverse superlattices with tunable lattice symmetry, composition, and spacing. Most of these structures follow the complementary contact model, maximizing DNA hybridization on building blocks and producing relatively close-packed lattices. Here, low-symmetry kagome superlattices are assembled from DNA-modified gold bipyramids that can engage only in partial DNA surface matching. The bipyramid dimensions and DNA length can be engineered for two different superlattices with rhombohedral unit cells, including one composed of a periodic stacking of kagome lattices. Enabled by the partial facet alignment, the kagome lattices exhibit lattice distortion, bipyramid twisting, and planar chirality. When conjugated with Cy-5 dyes, the kagome lattices serve as cavities with high-density optical states and large Purcell factors along lateral directions, leading to strong dipole radiation along the z axis and facet-dependent light emission. Such complex optical properties make these materials attractive for lasers, displays, and quantum sensing constructs.

TI Maskless Generation of Single Silicon Vacancy Arrays in Silicon Carbide
   by a Focused He+ Ion Beam
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Precise generation of spin defects in solid-state systems is essential for nanostructure fluorescence enhancement. We investigated a method for creating single silicon vacancy defect arrays in silicon carbide using a helium-ion microscope. Maskless and targeted generation can be realized by precisely controlling the focused He+ ion beam with an implantation uncertainty of 60 nm. The generated silicon vacancies were identified by measuring the optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum and room temperature photoluminescence spectrum. We systematically studied the effects of the implantation ion dose on the generated silicon vacancies. After optimization, a conversion yield of similar to 6.95% and a generation rate for a single silicon vacancy of similar to 35% were realized. This work paves the way for the integration and engineering of color centers to photonic structures and the application of quantum sensing based on spin defects in silicon carbide.

TI Adjoint-optimized nanoscale light extractor for nitrogen-vacancy centers
   in diamond
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We designed a nanoscale light extractor (NLE) for the efficient outcoupling and beaming of broadband light emitted by shallow, negatively charged nitrogenvacancy (NV) centers in bulk diamond. The NLE consists of a patterned silicon layer on diamond and requires no etching of the diamond surface. Our design process is based on adjoint optimization using broadband time-domain simulations and yields structures that are inherently robust to positioning and fabrication errors. Our NLE functions like a transmission antenna for the NV center, enhancing the optical power extracted from an NV center positioned 10 nm below the diamond surface by a factor of more than 35, and beaming the light into a +/- 30 degrees cone in the far field. This approach to light extraction can be readily adapted to other solid-state color centers.

TI Single-Mode Phase-Conjugate Receiver for Microwave Quantum Illumination
   with a Lossy Optical Memory
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Microwave quantum illumination with entangled pairs of microwave signal and optical idler modes can achieve sub-optimal performance with joint measurement of the signal and idler modes. Here, a testbed for microwave quantum illumination is proposed with an optical memory simulated with a delay line in the idler mode. It provides the amount of input two-mode squeezing necessary to compensate for the loss of optical memory while maintaining a quantum advantage over a coherent state. When the memory is lossy, the input two-mode squeezing has to be higher through high cooperativity in the optical mode. Under the testbed, a single-mode phase conjugate receiver is proposed consisting of a low-reflectivity beam splitter, an electro-optomechanical phase conjugator, and a photon number-resolving detector. The performance of the newly proposed receiver approaches the sub-optimal quantum advantage of 3 dB. Furthermore, the receiver achieves the quantum advantage even with an on-off detection while being robust against the loss of the memory.

TI Topological Edge State Ring Resonator for Mid-Infrared(MI) Refractive
   Indices Biosensor for detection of Brain Tumors
SO ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The unique properties of light underlie the perspectives of quantum photonic technologies, optical interconnects, and a wide range of new sensors.Some of the most dangerous and deadly diseases are tumors, cancers, and brain lesions, which are expensive to detect and treat. Therefore, a low-cost and accurate method to diagnose them can prevent and treat the progress of this disease. In this work, we used the precise topological valley photonic crystal (TVPC) method for detection. TVPC is an important method for transmitting and controlling light in the optical device. The valley-spin locking in the topology state provides robust transfer and low propagation loss at the desired path.In order to design, by finding the edge band within the first bulk band gap of 146.4 THz-155.9 THz, the model and design of the topological ring resonator (TRS)were realized. We proposed a topological biosensorbyusing the hexagonal lattice air holes in the silicon slab with a compact size of 22.95 mu m x 10 mu m. the quality factor and sensitivity at best value are 2.905 x 104 and 9021 nm RIU-1 respectively. This design can be implemented on the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology as a high-sensitivity optical device.

TI Reviving Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond via Local Surface
   Modification
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Surface termination of semiconductors is important for their applications in electronics because it governs electrical properties at interfaces. For quantum sensors and qubits based on spins in solids, this is crucial when they are located a few nanometers below the crystal surface. In the case of diamond, oxygen termination is preferential for quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. Here, we present local surface modification of a nonconductive diamond surface utilizing conductive atomic force microscopy under laser illumination. By applying this method, we demonstrate not only a removal of fluorescence background but also control over the charge state of single NV centers. The latter show an improvement of the optically detected magnetic resonance contrast from 1% up to 29% after the treatment. We assume that local surface oxidation is happening on the diamond, which has already been demonstrated for conducting hydrogenated surfaces, but its implementation to nonconductive surfaces remains challenging.

TI Optical levitation of fluorescent silicon carbide nanoparticles in
   vacuum
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Levitated optomechanics is an emerging field in quantum science that explores the quantum motion of mesoscopic particles levitated in a vacuum. Expanding this approach to particles with intrinsic quantum defects opens exciting opportunities for quantum sensing and nontrivial quantum state generation. Here, we explore silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles as a promising platform that offers a range of controllable quantum defects and material tunability. We demonstrate stable optical levitation of 3C-polytype SiC nanoparticles containing single photon emitters in a vacuum. We observe stable fluorescence from the levitated particle, confirming the preservation of the emitters in the levitated state. We also investigate particle loss at low pressure and explore thermal annealing as a potential method to improve trapping stability. Our results establish SiC as a viable platform for levitated optomechanics, providing additional quantum degrees of freedom and material engineering capabilities. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Optimisation of electron irradiation for creating spin ensembles in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Boron vacancy centre ( VB- ) ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted recent interest for their potential as two-dimensional solid-state quantum sensors. Irradiation is necessary for VB- creation, however, to date only limited attention has been given to optimising the defect production process, especially in the case of bulk irradiation with high-energy particles, which offers scalability through the potential for creating ensembles in large volumes of material. Here we systematically investigate the effect of electron irradiation by varying the dose delivered to a range of hBN samples, which differ in their purity, and search for an optimum in measurement sensitivity. We find that moderate electron irradiation doses ( approximate to 5x1018 cm-2) appear to offer the best sensitivity, and also observe a dependence on the initial crystal purity. These results pave the way for the scalable and cost-effective production of hBN quantum sensors, and provide insight into the mechanisms limiting VB- spin properties.

AB Defects are usually considered flaws in materials-but what if a tiny disruption could unlock the door to the quantum future? That's the promise of organic color centers (OCCs), also known as quantum defects, in carbon nanotubes. Introduced as chemical defects, OCCs transform these nanostructures into powerful quantum platforms that trap excitons and convert them into quantum light-one photon at a time. These nanoscale emitters work at room temperature, shine in the near-infrared (including telecommunications) bands, and can be tailored with organic chemistry. Sitting at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and engineering, OCCs open doors to quantum communication, sensing, and bioimaging-and light the way toward a bright quantum future.

TI Single Quantum Dot Selection and Tailor-Made Photonic Device Integration
   using a Nanoscale-Focus Pinspot
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large-scale photonic platforms. In this work, a methodology is presented to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor-made photonic structures. A nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale-focus pinspot (NFP) is applied using helium-ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. A single QD emission is only extracted out of the high-density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor-made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector (CBR) is designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP-selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

TI Surface NMR using quantum sensors in diamond
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB NMR is a noninvasive, molecular-level spectroscopic technique widely used for chemical characterization. However, it lacks the sensitivity to probe the small number of spins at surfaces and interfaces. Here, we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as quantum sensors to optically detect NMR signals from chemically modified thin films. To demonstrate the method's capabilities, aluminum oxide layers, common supports in catalysis and materials science, are prepared by atomic layer deposition and are subsequently functionalized by phosphonate chemistry to form self-assembled monolayers. The surface NV-NMR technique detects spatially resolved NMR signals from the monolayer, indicates chemical binding, and quantifies molecular coverage. In addition, it can monitor in real time the formation kinetics at the solid-liquid interface. With our approach, we show that NV quantum sensors are a surface-sensitive NMR tool with femtomole sensitivity for in situ analysis in catalysis, materials, and biological research.

TI Boson sampling with random numbers of photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Multiphoton interference is at the very heart of quantum foundations and applications in quantum sensing and information processing. In particular, boson-sampling experiments have the potential to demonstrate quantum computational supremacy while relying on only multiphoton interference in linear optical interferometers. However, even when photonic losses are negligible, scalable experiments are challenged by the rapid decrease of the probability of the success of current schemes with probabilistic sources for a large number of single photons in each experimental sample. Remarkably, we show a boson sampling scheme in which the probability of success increases instead of decreasing with the number of input photons, eventually approaching a unit value even with nondeterministic sources. It is achieved by sampling measurements not only at the interferometer output but also over all the possible numbers of photons at each input port and, different from scattershot boson sampling, allowing a random number of occupied input ports from one experimental run to another. Therefore, these results provide an exciting route toward future demonstrations of quantum computational supremacy with scalable experimental resources.

TI Floquet engineering ultracold polar molecules to simulate topological
   insulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantitative, near-term experimental blueprint for the quantum simulation of topological insulators using lattice-trapped ultracold polar molecules. In particular, we focus on the so-called Hopf insulator, which represents a three-dimensional topological state of matter existing outside the conventional tenfold way and crystalline-symmetry-based classifications of topological insulators. Its topology is protected by a linking number invariant, which necessitates long-range spin-orbit-coupled hoppings for its realization. While these ingredients have so far precluded its realization in solid-state systems and other quantum simulation architectures, in an accompanying Letter [T. Schuster et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 015301 (2021)], we predict that Hopf insulators can arise naturally from the dipolar interaction. Here, we investigate a specific polar molecule architecture, where the effective "spin" is formed from sublattice degrees of freedom. We introduce two techniques that allow one to optimize dipolar Hopf insulators with large band gaps, and which should also be readily applicable to the simulation of other exotic band structures. First, we describe the use of Floquet engineering to control the range and functional form of dipolar hoppings and, second, we demonstrate that molecular AC polarizabilities (under circularly polarized light) can be used to precisely tune the resonance condition between different rotational states. To verify that this latter technique is amenable to current-generation experiments, we calculate, from first principles, the AC polarizability for sigma(+) light for (KRb)-K-40-Rb-87. Finally, we show that experiments are capable of detecting the unconventional topology of the Hopf insulator by varying the termination of the lattice at its edges, which gives rise to three distinct classes of edge mode spectra.

TI AlGaAs Nonlinear Integrated Photonics

AB Practical applications implementing integrated photonic circuits can benefit from nonlinear optical functionalities such as wavelength conversion, all-optical signal processing, and frequency-comb generation, among others. Numerous nonlinear waveguide platforms have been explored for these roles; the group of materials capable of combining both passive and active functionalities monolithically on the same chip is III-V semiconductors. AlGaAs is the most studied III-V nonlinear waveguide platform to date; it exhibits both second- and third-order optical nonlinearity and can be used for a wide range of integrated nonlinear photonic devices. In this review, we conduct an extensive overview of various AlGaAs nonlinear waveguide platforms and geometries, their nonlinear optical performances, as well as the measured values and wavelength dependencies of their effective nonlinear coefficients. Furthermore, we highlight the state-of-the-art achievements in the field, among which are efficient tunable wavelength converters, on-chip frequency-comb generation, and ultra-broadband on-chip supercontinuum generation. Moreover, we overview the applications in development where AlGaAs nonlinear functional devices aspire to be the game-changers. Among such applications, there is all-optical signal processing in optical communication networks and integrated quantum photonic circuits.

AB We report an unusual buildup of the quantum coherence in a qubit subjected to non-Hermitian evolution generated by a parity-time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian, which is reinterpreted as a Hermitian system in a higher dimensional space using Naimark dilation. The coherence is found to be maximum about the exceptional points (EPs), i.e. the points of coalescence of the eigenvalues aswell as the eigenvectors. The nontrivial physics about EPs has been observed in various systems, particularly in photonic systems. As a consequence of enhancement in coherence, the various formulations of Leggett-Garg inequality tests show maximal violation about the EPs.

TI Microwave-mediated magnon-atom interactions: Two-mode higher-order
   squeezing of two YIG spheres
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose an efficient scheme to realize almost perfect higher-order squeezing of two YIG spheres via microwave-mediated magnon-atom interactions. It is assumed that two microwave cavity modes are coupled to two YIG spheres by the magnetic dipole interaction and a superconducting artificial atom by the electric dipole interaction, respectively. When the microwave cavity fields are tuned to be far detuned from the dressed atomic Rabi sidebands and the magnon frequencies, the coherent coupling between two magnons and the artificial atom can be established via virtual photon exchange. We find that a pair of Bogoliubov modes composed of two magnon modes are cooled to the vacuum state through the atomic engineered dissipation, resulting in an ideal two-mode higher-order squeezing state of the YIG spheres. The solid-state device may find realistic applications in high-precision measurement and quantum sensing technology.

TI Quantum non-Gaussianity of light and atoms
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons are conclusive and direct witnesses of higher-than-quadratic nonlinearities in optical and mechanical processes. Moreover, they are proven resources for quantum sensing, communication and error correction with diverse continuous-variable systems. This review introduces theoretical analyses of nonclassical and quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons. It recapitulates approaches used to derive operational criteria for photons tolerant to optical losses, their application in experiments and their nowadays extension to quantum non-Gaussian photon coincidences. It extends to a recent comparison of quantum non-Gaussianity, including robustness to thermal noise, and sensing capability for high-quality phononic Fock states of single trapped cooled ions. The review can stimulate further development in the criteria of quantum non-Gaussian states and experimental effort to prepare and detect such useful features, navigating the community to advanced quantum physics and technology.

TI Optimization of optical spin readout of the nitrogen-vacancy center in
   diamond based on spin relaxation model
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB For quantum sensing, it is vital to develop an efficient technique for determining the quantum state of the sensor. We optimize the weighting of the photoluminescence intensity for readout of the spin state of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We find that adopting a physical model that considers the optical transitions and relaxations of the NV center allows for an efficient readout. Our method improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the readout by 5.4% in a short time of 3 s, while the existing methods typically require 1 min of integration time. We also show that our technique enhances the readout of the nuclear spin memory. The demonstrated way is helpful for a wide range of measurements, from a few minutes to several days.

TI Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) is crucial for advancing molecular-level structural analysis, yet existing techniques relying on permanent magnets face limitations in controllability and resolution. This study addresses the gap by introducing a switchable magnetic field gradient on a scanning tip, enabling localized, high-gradient magnetic fields at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate a device combining a metal microwire on a quartz tip with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, achieving gradients up to 1 mu T nm-1 at fields below 200 mu T. This allows electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution, overcoming challenges like emitter contrast and sample preparation rigidity. The current-controlled gradient, switchable in 600 ns, enhances precision and flexibility. Additionally, the metallic tip modifies Rabi power spatially, enabling selective spin manipulation with varying microwave effects. This innovation paves the way for advanced nanoMRI applications, including high-resolution imaging and targeted spin control in quantum sensing and molecular studies.

TI Simulating large-size quantum spin chains on cloud-based superconducting
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently simulate large-scale quantum systems for which classical approaches are bound to fail. Even though several existing quantum devices now feature total qubit numbers of more than 100, their applicability remains plagued by the presence of noise and errors. Thus, the degree to which large quantum systems can successfully be simulated on these devices remains unclear. Here, we report on numerical results of physics-motivated variational ansatzes, as well as cloud simulations performed on several of IBM's superconducting quantum computers to simulate ground states of spin chains having a wide range of system sizes up to 102 qubits. Our numerical analysis shows that the accuracy of the ground-state energy and fidelity improves substantially by increasing the number of layers used in the ansatzes. From the cloud exper-iments, we find that the ground-state energies extracted from realizations across different quantum computers and system sizes reach the expected values to within errors that are small (i.e., on the percent level), including the inference of the energy density in the thermodynamic limit from these values. We achieve this accuracy through a combination of physics-motivated variational ansatzes, and efficient, scalable energy-measurement and error-mitigation protocols, including the use of a reference state in the zero-noise extrapolation. By using a 102-qubit system, we have been able to successfully apply up to 3186 CNOT gates in a single circuit when performing gate-error mitigation. Our accurate, error-mitigated results for random parameters in the ansatz states suggest that a standalone hybrid quantum-classical variational approach for large-scale XXZ models considered in this work is feasible.

TI Coherent harmonic generation of magnons in spin textures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Harmonic generation, a notable non-linear phenomenon, has promising applications in information processing. For spin-waves in ferromagnetic materials, great progress has been made in the generation higher harmonics, however probing the coherence of these higher harmonics is challenging. Here, using in-situ diamond sensors, we study the coherent harmonic generation of spin waves in a soft ferromagnet. High-order resonance lines are generated via a microwave input and detected by nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds. The phase coherence of the harmonic spin waves is verified by the Rabi oscillations of the NV electron spins. Numerical simulations indicate that the harmonic generation by microwaves below the ferromagnetic resonance frequency is associated with the nonlinear mixing of spin waves by magnetization structures at the film edge. Our finding of geometry-induced magnon harmonic generation constitutes a new way to generate magnon combs with coherent high-order harmonics and may pave the way for magnon-based information processing and quantum sensing applications.

TI Practical ultra-low frequency noise laser system for quantum sensors
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The laser's frequency noise is crucial to the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Two commonly used methods to suppress the laser's frequency noise are locking the laser to an atomic transition by the lock-in technique or to an ultra-low thermal expansion (ULE) glass cavity by the PDH technique. The former cannot suppress rapidly changing frequency noise and hardly meets the needs; the latter has powerful performance but a heightened cost. The lack of high-performance and low-cost laser noise suppression methods dramatically limits the practical application of quantum sensors. This work demonstrates that, in many quantum sensing applications such as the Rydberg atomic superheterodyne receiver, by cascade locking the laser to both the atomic transition and a low-cost (LC) cavity, the same performance as locking to the ULE cavity can be achieved. This work is significant in promoting the practical application of quantum sensors.

TI Imaging Nanomechanical Vibrations and Manipulating Parametric Mode
   Coupling via Scanning Microwave Microscopy
SO NANO LETTERS
AB In this study, we present a novel platform based on scanning microwave microscopy for manipulating and detecting tiny vibrations of nanoelectromechanical resonators using a single metallic tip. The tip is placed on the top of a grounded silicon nitride membrane, acting as a movable top gate of the coupled resonator. We demonstrate its ability to map mechanical modes and investigate mechanical damping effects in a capacitive coupling scheme, based on its spatial resolution. We also manipulate the energy transfer coherently between the mode of the scanning tip and the underlying silicon nitride membrane, via parametric coupling. Typical features of optomechanics, such as anti-damping and electromechanically induced transparency, have been observed. Since the microwave optomechanical technology is fully compatible with quantum electronics and very low temperature conditions, it should provide a powerful tool for studying phonon tunnelling between two spatially separated vibrating elements, which could potentially be applied to quantum sensing.

TI Organic quantum materials: A review

AB Interests in organic quantum materials (OQMs) have been explosively growing in the field of condensed physics of matter due to their rich chemistry and unique quantum properties. They are strongly correlated systems and show novel electromagnetic performance such as high-temperature superconducting, quantum sensing, spin electronics, quantum dots, topological insulating, quantum Hall effects, spin liquids, qubits, and so forth, which exhibit promising prospects in information communication and thus facilitate the construction of a modern intelligent society. This article reviews recent developments in the research on the electromagnetic characteristics of OQMs. We mainly give an overview on the progress of superconductors and quantum spin liquids based on organic materials and describe their possible mechanisms. Numerous experimental findings exhibit new exciton interactions and provide insights into exotic electronic properties. Finally, their association and strategies for realizing multiple quantum states in one system are discussed.

TI Majorana Qubits and Non-Abelian Physics in Quantum Dot-Based Minimal
   Kitaev Chains
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The possibility of engineering artificial Kitaev chains in arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting regions has emerged as an attractive way to overcome the disorder issues that complicate the realization and detection of topological superconducting phases in other platforms. Although a true topological phase would require long chains, a two-site chain realized in a double quantum dot can already be tuned to points in parameter space where it hosts zero-energy states that seem identical to the Majorana bound states that characterize a topological phase. These states have been named "poor man's Majorana bound states" (PMMs) because they lack formal topological protection. In this work, we propose a pathway for next-generation experiments on PMMs. The pathway starts with experiments to characterize a single pair of PMMs by measuring the Majorana quality and then moves on to initialization and readout of the parity of a PMM pair, which allows the measurement of quasiparticle poisoning times. The next step is to couple two PMM systems to form a qubit. We discuss measurements of the coherence time of such a qubit, as well as a test of Majorana fusion rules in the same setup. Finally, we propose and analyze three different types of braidinglike experiments that require more complex device geometries. Our conclusions are supported by calculations based on a realistic model with interacting and spinful quantum dots, as well as by simpler models to gain physical insight. Our calculations show that it is indeed possible to demonstrate non-Abelian physics in minimal two-site Kitaev chains despite the lack of a true topological phase. However, our findings also reveal that doing so requires some extra care, appropriately modified protocols, and awareness of the details of this particular platform.

AB Quantum nonlinear interferometers play an important role in quantum imaging and sensing applications. Here, we demonstrate the tailoring of the frequency-angular spectrum of such a device, where we use a linear dispersive medium as a phase corrector. By changing the thickness of the dispersive medium, we tune the phase of the interferometer, enabling control over the frequency-angular spectrum and visibility of the interference fringes. Utilizing the enhanced visibility achieved through our proposed technique, we show the application of a simple interferometer in spectroscopy with an undetected photon scheme. We distinguish different polymers by measuring their characteristic absorption features in the mid-infrared spectral range above 6 mu m while detecting only photons in the visible range.

AB Quantum illumination is one of the main paradigms for implementing quantum radar in the low-frequency spectrum. Here, we discuss how to ease the open-air application of the protocol. I first define an experimentally feasible receiver for an entangled signal-idler transmitter. This consists of measuring heterodyne the received signal and adaptively measuring homodyne the idler, reaching a maximal quantum advantage of 3 dB in the error probability exponent with respect to the optimal classical strategy. Our receiver requires only a single tunable JPA. To relax the bandwidth requirement at the transmitter level, we discuss a sequential protocol that uses patches of modes sequentially to probe the target region. We show that, in a practical scenario, the sequential protocol needs two orders of magnitude less bandwidth with respect to the non-sequential protocol, while keeping the same quantum advantage. We finally briefly discuss possible applications of quantum illumination for backscatter communication and covert communication.

TI Coupling between 2D Materials and Nanophotonic Cavities
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Cavities are the ideal platform to investigate the light-matter interactions because they strongly confine and modulate the photons. Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitrite have unique electronic and optical properties, exhibiting excellent optical performance at the atomically thin nanoscale. The integration of 2D materials into cavities raises challenges in both the design and fabrication technologies. In this manuscript, the recent results of 2D-material cavities are reviewed, in which the quality factor (Q-factor) and smaller mode volume have been greatly improved. The nanostructure of cavities has been optimized to provide the homogeneous environment by encapsulating the 2D materials with hBN or polymer, which is crucial to improve the excitonic qualities and emission stability. These cavities are capable to integrate the 2D materials and their heterostructures, and enable the novel light-matter interaction phenomena such as the Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-photon polaritons. In addition, 2D materials are sensitive to the local environment such as the deformation arising from the strain or vibration, and thereby, enable the multi-modal interaction with other physical degrees of freedom. These 2D-material cavities indicate great potentials in the applications in quantum optical devices and quantum photonic technologies.

TI Steady state entanglement of distant nitrogen-vacancy centers in a
   coherent thermal magnon bath
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate steady state entanglement (SSE) between two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center defects in a diamond host on an ultrathin yttrium iron garnet (YIG) strip. We determine the dephasing and dissipative interactions of the qubits with the quanta of spin waves (magnon bath) in the YIG depending on the qubit positions on the strip. We show that the magnon's dephasing effect can be eliminated, and we can transform the bath into a multimode displaced thermal state using external magnetic fields. Entanglement dynamics of the qubits in such a displaced thermal bath have been analyzed by deriving and solving the master equation. An additional electric field is considered to engineer the magnon dispersion relation at the band edge to control the Markovian character of the open system dynamics. We determine the optimum geometrical parameters of the system of distant qubits and the YIG strip to get SSE. Furthermore, parameter regimes for which the shared displaced magnon bath can sustain significant SSE against the local dephasing and decoherence of NV centers to their nuclear spin environments have been determined. Along with SSE, we investigate the steady state coherence (SSC) and explain the physical mechanism of how delayed SSE appears following a rapid generation and sudden death of entanglement using the interplay of decoherence-free subspace states, system geometry, displacement of the thermal bath, and enhancement of the qubit dissipation near the magnon band edge. A nonmonotonic relation between bath coherence and SSE is found, and critical coherence for maximum SSE is determined. Our results illuminate the efficient use of system geometry, band edge in bath spectrum, and reservoir coherence to engineer system-reservoir interactions for robust SSE and SSC.

TI Plasmon Enhanced Quantum Properties of Single Photon Emitters with
   Hybrid Hexagonal Boron Nitride Silver Nanocube Systems
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising ultrathin host of single photon emitters (SPEs) with favorable quantum properties at room temperature, making it a highly desirable element for integrated quantum photonic networks. One major challenge of using these SPEs in such applications is their low quantum efficiency. Recent studies have reported an improvement in quantum efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude when integrating an ensemble of emitters such as boron vacancy defects in multilayered hBN flakes embedded within metallic nanocavities. However, these experiments have not been extended to SPEs and are mainly focused on multiphoton effects. Here, the quantum single-photon properties of hybrid nanophotonic structures composed of SPEs created in ultrathin hBN flakes coupled with plasmonic silver nanocubes (SNCs) are studied. The authors demonstrate 200% plasmonic enhancement of the SPE properties, manifested by a strong increase in the SPE fluorescence. Such enhancement is explained by rigorous numerical simulations where the hBN flake is in direct contact with the SNCs that cause the plasmonic effects. The presented strong and fast single photon emission obtained at room temperature with a compact hybrid nanophotonic platform can be very useful to various emerging applications in quantum optical communications and computing.

TI Noise-robust single-pixel imaging in the photon counting regime with a
   pulsed source
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a method to classically enhance the noise robustness of single-pixel imaging in the photon counting regime with a pulsed source. By using time-domain cross correlations between temporal profiles of a pulsed source and received signals, our scheme classically imitates the noise rejection concept of quantum imaging. Under a strong noise environment in which the background noise intensity is up to 120 times higher than the signal one, we compare three different images obtained by conventional, quantum-enhanced, and classically enhanced, schemes. The results show that the classically enhanced scheme can be remarkably robust against noise in image formation, which is comparable to the quantum scheme.

TI Reduced-order modeling of two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard flow
   by hybrid quantum-classical reservoir computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two hybrid quantum-classical reservoir computing models are presented to reproduce the low-order statistical properties of a two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection flow at a Rayleigh number Ra = 105 and Prandtl number Pr = 10. These properties comprise the mean vertical profiles of the root mean square velocity and temperature and the turbulent convective heat flux. The latter is composed of vertical velocity and temperature and measures the global turbulent heat transfer across the convection layer; it manifests locally in coherent hot and cold thermal plumes that rise from the bottom and fall from the top boundaries. Both quantum algorithms differ by the arrangement of the circuit layers of the quantum reservoir, in particular the entanglement layers. The second of the two quantum circuit architectures, denoted H2, enables a complete execution of the reservoir update inside the quantum circuit without the usage of external memory. Their performance is compared with that of a classical reservoir computing model. Therefore, all three models have to learn the nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the turbulent flow at hand in a lower-dimensional latent data space which is spanned by the time-dependent expansion coefficients of the 16 most energetic proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. These training data are generated by a POD snapshot analysis from direct numerical simulations of the original turbulent flow. All reservoir computing models are operated in the reconstruction or open-loop mode, i.e., they receive three POD modes as an input at each step and reconstruct the 13 missing modes. We analyze different measures of the reconstruction error in dependence on the hyperparameters which are specific for the quantum cases or shared with the classical counterpart, such as the reservoir size and the leaking rate. We show that both quantum algorithms are able to reconstruct the essential statistical properties of the turbulent convection flow successfully with similar performance compared with the classical reservoir network. Most importantly, the quantum reservoirs are by a factor of four to eight smaller in comparison with the classical case.

TI Decoupling light redistribution from absorption via waveguide-integrated
   bilayer metagratings
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Integrated optical systems, encompassing microwave photonics, optical communication receivers, and optical sensing, require photodetectors with high saturation power and responsivity. Achieving uniform and efficient light absorption is essential for realizing these properties. However, traditional waveguide-coupled photodetectors struggle with a trade-off between absorption efficiency and uniformity due to exponential intensity decay in the waveguide direction. In this work, we propose waveguide-integrated bilayer metagratings that decouple light redistribution from absorption, achieving uniform and efficient absorption simultaneously. By elucidating the fundamental physics governing resonant mode coupling between the upper silicon metagrating (Si MG) and waveguide, we demonstrate that the Si MG couples out the waveguide mode and redistributes its intensity uniformly with 84% coupling efficiency. The lower germanium metagrating (Ge MG), serving as the absorber, achieves 90% absorption efficiency via guided-mode resonance. Compared with traditional evanescent coupling, this design enhances light intensity uniformity in the germanium absorption region while maintaining >70% overall efficiency. This approach holds promise for resolving the uniformity-efficiency trade-off in waveguide-coupled photodetectors, while extending beyond germanium systems to provide a strategy for III-V/Si hybrid integration in applications ranging from LIDAR receivers to quantum photonic processors.

TI Fabrication of Sawfish photonic crystal cavities in bulk diamond
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Color centers in diamonds are quantum systems with optically active spin-states that show long coherence times and are, therefore, a promising candidate for the development of efficient spin-photon interfaces. However, only a small portion of the emitted photons is generated by the coherent optical transition of the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which limits the overall performance of the system. Embedding these emitters in photonic crystal cavities improves the coupling to the ZPL photons and increases their emission rate. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication process of "Sawfish" cavities, a design recently proposed that has the experimentally realistic potential to simultaneously provide a high waveguide coupling efficiency and significantly enhance the emission rate. The presented process allows for the fabrication of fully suspended devices with a total length of 20.5 mu m and feature sizes as small as 40 nm. The optical characterization shows fundamental mode resonances that follow the behavior expected from the corresponding design parameters and quality (Q) factors as high as (3800 +/- 1200). Finally, we investigate the effects of nanofabrication on the devices and show that, despite a noticeable erosion of the fine features, the measured cavity resonances deviate by only 0.8 (1.2)% from the values estimated by simple inspection via scanning electron microscopy. This proves that the Sawfish design is robust against fabrication imperfections, which makes it an attractive choice for the development of quantum photonic networks.

TI The anisotropic nature of singlet fission in single crystalline organic
   semiconductors
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The escalating global energy predicament implores for a revolutionary resolution-one that converts sunlight into electricity-holding the key to supreme conversion efficiency. This comprehensive review embarks on the exploration of the principle of generating multiple excitons per absorbed photon, a captivating concept that possesses the potential to redefine the fundamental confines of conversion efficiency, albeit its application remains limited in photovoltaic devices. At the nucleus of this phenomenon are two principal processes: multiple exciton generation (MEG) within quantum-confined environments, and singlet fission (SF) inside molecular crystals. The process of SF, characterized by the cleavage of a single photogenerated singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, holds promise to potentially amplify photon-to-electron conversion efficiency twofold, thereby laying the groundwork to challenge the detailed balance limit of solar cell efficiency. Our discourse primarily dissects the complex nature of SF in crystalline organic semiconductors, laying special emphasis on the anisotropic behavior of SF and the diffusion of the subsequent triplet excitons in single-crystalline polyacene organic semiconductors. We initiate this journey of discovery by elucidating the principles of MEG and SF, tracing their historical genesis, and scrutinizing the anisotropy of SF and the impact of quantum decoherence within the purview of functional mode electron transfer theory. We present an overview of prominent techniques deployed in investigating anisotropic SF in organic semiconductors, including femtosecond transient absorption microscopy and imaging as well as stimulated Raman scattering microscopies, and highlight recent breakthroughs linked with the anisotropic dimensions of Davydov splitting, Herzberg-Teller effects, SF, and triplet transport operations in single-crystalline polyacenes. Through this comprehensive analysis, our objective is to interweave the fundamental principles of anisotropic SF and triplet transport with the current frontiers of scientific discovery, providing inspiration and facilitating future ventures to harness the anisotropic attributes of organic semiconductor crystals in the design of pioneering photovoltaic and photonic devices.

TI Light detection and ranging with entangled photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a key technology for depth imaging through complex environments. Despite recent advances, an open challenge is the ability to isolate the LiDAR signal from other spurious sources including background light and jamming signals. Here we show that a time-resolved coincidence scheme can address these challenges by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations between entangled photon pairs. We demonstrate that a photon-pair-based LiDAR can distill desired depth information in the presence of both synchronous and asynchronous spurious signals without prior knowledge of the scene and the target object. This result enables the development of robust and secure quantum LiDAR systems and paves the way to time-resolved quantum imaging applications.

TI Quantum Fisher Information Dynamics in Squeezed Reservoirs: Mathematical
   Insights and Quantum Applications
SO AXIOMS
AB This work explores the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) in open quantum systems coupled to squeezed reservoirs, providing a mathematical framework for analyzing parameter estimation precision under decoherence. We analyze QFI in two-qubit systems undergoing pure dephasing, considering the effects of squeezing parameter, phase difference, and coupling strength within an Ohmic spectral density model. The decoherence factor shows how reservoir engineering influences coherence loss. Numerical results demonstrate that optimal squeezing and local bath configurations enhance QFI preservation, while collective couplings accelerate decay. We also examine the interplay with von Neumann entropy, highlighting their inverse correlation, where increased mixedness reduces metrological sensitivity.

TI Critical Quantum Metrology in the Non-Linear Quantum Rabi Model
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum Rabi model (QRM) with linear coupling between light mode and qubit exhibits the analog of a second-order phase transition for vanishing mode frequency which allows for criticality-enhanced quantum metrology in a few-body system. We show that the QRM including a nonlinear coupling term exhibits much higher measurement precisions due to its first-order-like phase transition at finite frequency, avoiding the detrimental slowing-down effect close to the critical point of the linear QRM. When a bias term is added to the Hamiltonian, the system can be used as a fluxmeter or magnetometer if implemented in circuit QED platforms.

TI Exact block encoding of imaginary time evolution with universal quantum
   neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary time propagator is implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons (auxiliary qubits) creates the nonunitary action on the visible layer. Then, we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture in which the hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We prove that this wave-function Ansatz is closed under the action of the imaginary time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the Ansatz yields the ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the number of interactions and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can be readily implemented on quantum hardware via midcircuit measurements of auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and number of interactions, while the width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits linearly proportional to the number of interactions, and circuit depth grows linearly with imaginary time only. Every midcircuit measurement has a postselection success probability, and the overall success probability is equal to the product of the probabilities of the midcircuit measurements.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We have realized submicron tunnel ferromagnetic Al/AlOx/Al/Ni80Fe20/Al Josephson junctions (JJs) in Manhattan-style configuration for qubit applications. These junctions have been designed to lie within the energy range of transmons. The current-voltage characteristics of these junctions are comparable with those of standard JJs implemented in state-of-the-art transmons, thus confirming the high quality of the devices and marking a significant step toward the realization of the ferrotransmon. Low-frequency characterization confirms that our junctions operate in the quantum phase diffusion limit, as tunnel JJs in conventional transmons with similar characteristic energies. Ultimately, mitigation of quantum phase fluctuations will represent a key for advancing the entire field of superconducting quantum circuit architectures.

TI On multivariate polynomials achievable with quantum signal processing
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a framework which was proven to unify and simplify a large number of known quantum algorithms, as well as discovering new ones. QSP allows one to transform a signal embedded in a given unitary using polynomials. Characterizing which polynomials can be achieved with QSP protocols is an important part of the power of this technique, and while such a characterization is well-understood in the case of univariate signals, it is unclear which multivariate polynomials can be constructed when the signal is a vector, rather than a scalar. This work uses a slightly different formalism than what is found in the literature, and uses it to find simpler necessary conditions for decomposability, as well as a sufficient condition the first, to the best of our knowledge, proven for a (generally inhomogeneous) multivariate polynomial in the context of quantum signal processing.

TI Pulse engineering via projection of response functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an iterative optimal control method of quantum systems, aimed at an implementation of a desired operation with optimal fidelity. The update step of the method is based on the linear response of the fidelity to the control operators, and its projection onto the mode functions of the corresponding operator. Our method extends methods such as gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) and variational quantum algorithms, by determining the fidelity gradient in a hyperparameter-free manner, and using it for a multiparameter update, capitalizing on the multimode overlap of the perturbation and the mode functions. This directly reduces the number of dynamical trajectories that need to be evaluated in order to update a set of parameters. We demonstrate this approach, and compare it to the standard GRAPE algorithm, for the example of a quantum gate on two qubits, demonstrating a clear improvement in convergence and optimal fidelity of the generated protocol.

TI Quantifying computational advantage of Grover's algorithm with the trace
   speed
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Despite intensive research, the physical origin of the speed-up offered by quantum algorithms remains mysterious. No general physical quantity, like, for instance, entanglement, can be singled out as the essential useful resource. Here we report a close connection between the trace speed and the quantum speed-up in Grover's search algorithm implemented with pure and pseudo-pure states. For a noiseless algorithm, we find a one-to-one correspondence between the quantum speed-up and the polarization of the pseudo-pure state, which can be connected to a wide class of quantum statistical speeds. For time-dependent partial depolarization and for interrupted Grover searches, the speed-up is specifically bounded by the maximal trace speed that occurs during the algorithm operations. Our results quantify the quantum speed-up with a physical resource that is experimentally measurable and related to multipartite entanglement and quantum coherence.

TI Analyzing the Rydberg-based optical-metastable-ground architecture for
   171Yb nuclear spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Neutral alkaline earth(like) atoms have recently been employed in atomic arrays with individual readout, control, and high-fidelity Rydberg-mediated entanglement. This emerging platform offers a wide range of new quantum science applications that leverage the unique properties of such atoms: ultranarrow optical "clock" transitions and isolated nuclear spins. Specifically, these properties offer an optical qubit (o) as well as ground (g) and metastable (m) nuclear spin qubits, all within a single atom. We consider experimentally realistic control of this omg architecture and its coupling to Rydberg states for entanglement generation, focusing specifically on ytterbium-171 (Yb-171) with nuclear spin I = 1/2. We analyze the S-series Rydberg states of Yb-171, described by the three spin-1/2 constituents (two electrons and the nucleus). We confirm that the F = 3/2 manifold, a unique spin configuration, is well suited for entangling nuclear spin qubits. Further, we analyze the F = 1/2 series, described by two overlapping spin configurations, using a multichannel quantum defect theory. We study the multilevel dynamics of the nuclear spin states when driving the clock or Rydberg transition with Rabi frequency Omega(c) = 2 pi x 200 kHz or Omega(R) = 2 pi x 6 MHz, respectively, finding that a modest magnetic field (approximate to 200 G) and feasible laser polarization intensity purity (less than or similar to 0.99) are sufficient for gate fidelities exceeding 0.99. We also study singlebeam Raman rotations of the nuclear spin qubits and identify a "magic" linear polarization angle with respect to the magnetic field at which purely ax rotations are possible.

TI Pulsed laser deposition of Ho2O3 thin films as
   Ro<spacing diaeresis>ntgen material for X-ray nano-photonics
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Scalable and stoichiometrically controlled synthesis of epitaxial rare-earth oxide thin films is promising for advancing next-generation optoelectronic and quantum photonic technologies, including miniature X-ray laser systems. The growth of high-quality holmium oxide (Ho2O3) thin films on (001)-oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was investigated, employing both KrF excimer (248 nm) and frequency-doubled Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser sources. Detailed structural characterization using highresolution X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping confirms the formation of (00l)-oriented, relaxed epitaxial films with excellent crystallinity and lattice parameters closely matching bulk Ho2O3. The impact of laser wavelength on film quality and growth dynamics was investigated, revealing that the lambda = 532 nm laser yields film quality comparable to that achieved with excimer-laser-grown films. Elemental analysis using oxygen16 resonance Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) demonstrates precise control over the Ho:O stoichiometry under optimized deposition conditions. The successful use of both ultraviolet and visible laser sources highlights the versatility of PLD for rare-earth oxide film growth, while offering flexibility in equipment accessibility. This study establishes a scalable, tunable pathway for fabricating stoichiometric, epitaxial Ho2O3 thin films, with promising implications for X-ray nano-photonic devices.

TI Entanglement and coherence in pure and doped Posner molecules
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The potential role of spin in biological systems is a primary topic in quantum biology. However, much of this research focuses on electron spin. A recent hypothesis suggests that nuclear spin may be better suited to biological processes, being less sensitive to decoherence. The hypothesis details how phosphorus nuclei might be prepared in a spin entangled state, how this entanglement is protected by assembly into calcium phosphate (Posner) molecules, and how this entanglement might modulate calcium ion production and concomitant neural activation. In this paper we investigate the robustness of quantum effects such as coherence and entanglement in Posner molecules. We investigate how these effects are directly dependent on specific parameters such as spin-spin coupling strengths and Posner molecule symmetry. We also investigate how lithium isotope doped Posner molecules differentially modulate quantum resources such as coherence and entanglement and whether this is a viable explanation for lithium's mechanism of action in bipolar disease. Finally we illustrate how entanglement might possibly be preserved through exploitation of the biological environment.

TI MPd5 kagome superconductors studied by density functional
   calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties; exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a type of kagome superconductor, MPd5 (M is a group-IIA metal element), and identify that it exhibits coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial topological properties. We uncover its phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors, predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. These Tc can be effectively tuned through the application of external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have topological properties; e.g., CaPd5 shows topological nontrivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.

TI Module Lattice-Based Post Quantum Secure Blockchain Empowered
   Authentication Framework for Autonomous Truck Platooning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Truck platooning uses networking technology and automated driving support systems to join multiple trucks in a group. When these vehicles interact for particular journey stages, such as on highways, they autonomously maintain a predefined, tight spacing among themselves. Platooning improves transportation by making better use of highways, delivering cargo faster, and minimizing congestion in traffic. Therefore, safety and platooning are two important attributes of an intelligent truck system. This paper discusses a quantum-safe blockchain-empowered authentication mechanism for autonomous truck platooning. The proposed idea is to use blockchain to combine multiple nodes and ensure authenticity with the help of an aggregation technique. The proposed design ensures authenticity to the system due to hard assumptions:1) Learning With Error (LWE) and 2) Short Integer Solution (SIS) on random module generated lattice. This paper uses operations over module lattices to be more efficient than general lattices. We can perform operations on module lattices with the help of fast algorithms for polynomial arithmetic.

AB Computing with light using integrated optics has seen huge progress over the last 3-4 years in multiple fields such as neuromorphic computing, quantum computing and on-chip data storage. This has created a vast ecosystem that relies on high-speed reconfigurations of nanophotonic circuits (such as their use as synapses or routing applications) and ultrafast yet high-resolution, low-power photodetection. Currently, it is impossible to combine all these functionalities into an integrated platform that fits onto a single chip. In RESPITE, by utilizing superconducting Joule switches as neurons, multi-level phase change memory elements as synaptic weights, and superconducting single-photon detector arrays as retina we will demonstrate a novel platform which combines vision and cognition on a single chip. This new platform will allow in-sensor neuromorphic computing with unprecedented performance levels The platform will have attoJoule switching power consumption, sub-nanosecond latency, and compactness. To support the development of this platform, detailed heat transfer, electromagnetic, and phase change simulation studies are underway, utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software.

TI Phase Diffusion in Low-EJ Josephson Junctions at
   Milli-Kelvin Temperatures
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Josephson junctions (JJs) with Josephson energy E-J less than or similar to 1 K are widely employed as non-linear elements in superconducting circuits for quantum computing operating at milli-Kelvin temperatures. In the qubits with small charging energy E-C ( E-J/E-C >> 1 ), such as the transmon, the incoherent phase slips (IPS) might become the dominant source of dissipation with decreasing E-J. In this work, a systematic study of the IPS in low-E-J JJs at milli-Kelvin temperatures is reported. Strong suppression of the critical (switching) current and a very rapid growth of the zero-bias resistance due to the IPS are observed with decreasing E-J below 1 K. With further improvement of coherence of superconducting qubits, the observed IPS-induced dissipation might limit the performance of qubits based on low-E-J junctions. These results point the way to future improvements of such qubits.

TI Adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Cutting-Edge Technologies for
   Production System Sustainability: A Moderator-Mediation Analysis
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB Cutting-edge technologies like big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, blockchain, and digital twins have a profound impact on the sustainability of the production system. In addition, it is argued that turbulence in technology could negatively impact the adoption of these technologies and adversely impact the sustainability of the production system of the firm. The present study has demonstrated that the role of technological turbulence as a moderator could impact the relationships between the sustainability the of production system with its predictors. The study further analyses the mediating role of operational sustainability which could impact the firm performance. A theoretical model has been developed that is underpinned by dynamic capability view (DCV) theory and firm absorptive capacity theory. This model was verified by PLS-SEM with 412 responses from various manufacturing firms in India. There exists a positive and significant influence of AI and other cutting-edge technologies for keeping the production system sustainable.

TI Gate Set Tomography
SO QUANTUM
AB Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is calibration-free. GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a gate set simultaneously and selfconsistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details, but we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the pyGSTi implementation.

TI Reliability of IBM's Public Quantum Computers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA AND ARTIFICIAL
   INTELLIGENCE
AB One of the challenges of the current ecosystem of quantum computers (QC) is the stabilization of the coherence associated with the entanglement of the states of their inner qubits. In this empirical study, we monitor the reliability of IBM's public-access QCs network on a daily basis. Each of these state-of-the-art machines has a totally different qubit association, and this entails that for a given (same) input program, they may output a different set of probabilities for the assembly of results (including both the right and the wrong ones). Although we focus on the computing structure provided by the "Big Blue" company, our survey can be easily transferred to other currently available quantum mainframes. In more detail, we probe these quantum processors with an ad hoc designed computationally demanding quaternary search algorithm. As stated, this quantum program is executed every 24 hours (for nearly 100 days) and its goal is to put to the limit the operational capacity of this novel and genuine type of equipment. Next, we perform a comparative analysis of the obtained results according to the singularities of each computer and over the total number of executions. In addition, we subsequently apply (for 50 days) an improvement filtering to perform noise mitigation on the results obtained proposed by IBM. The Yorktown 5-qubit computer reaches noise filtering of up to 33% in one day, that is, a 90% confidence level is reached in the expected results. From our continuous and long-term tests, we derive that room still exists regarding the improvement of quantum calculators in order to guarantee enough confidence in the returned outcomes.

TI Darwinian Quantum Gravity dynamics of small particles
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB In Darwinian Quantum Gravity (DQG), a.k.a. Physics-Cell (PC) approach, the Standard Model of Physics (SMP) occurs through a Quantum Field (QF) array of all SMP QFs within a 3D. time-free medium, with alterations being emitted and received PCs, which are assumed to have a spherical format, by the emission and transmission of two types of QFs between PCS: OF array AV and OF scalar SP. The A from the PCs based on the rules of the SMP calculated within the PCs, thus requiring that each PC processes the information required for a 4-vertices Feynman diagram of the SMP plus General Relativity (GR); whereas the is associated to the communication of the correction necessary cancel the effects of the PC time-step size 1, with the energy density of a being found to be equal to the dark energy's density which is equal to the cosmological constant A. In PC approach, gravity occurs not through a QF but by synchronicity of QF quanta incoming onto PC with quanta of the same QF outgoing from that PC, with the photon QF generating most of the symmetric aspect of the metric tensor and the neutrino QF generating most of the antisymmetric aspect of the metric tensor. The consequences of the PC approach are that QF decoherence is caused by reaching. a pure-state maximum energy of Ex, as any pure-state wavelength must be larger than exp and so there is no physical fieaning for scales below. Therefore, there are quantum effects beyond GR for masses above. Thus, the quantum aspects of gravity occur only for very small masses, and such effects are described here. In the PC approach, there is no physical meaning to scales below and the spacetime is continuous through the interpolation process occurring by the communication between PCs of partial derivative Psi.

TI Quantum Non-Gaussianity of Multiphonon States of a Single Atom

AB Quantum non-Gaussian mechanical states are already required in a range of applications. The discrete building blocks of such states are the energy eigenstates???Fock states. Despite progress in their preparation, the remaining imperfections can still invisibly cause loss of the aspects critical for their applications. We derive and apply the most challenging hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria on the characterization of single trapped-ion oscillator mechanical Fock states with up to 10 phonons. We analyze the depth of these quantum non-Gaussian features under intrinsic mechanical heating and predict their requirement for reaching quantum advantage in the sensing of a mechanical force.

TI Parity-Symmetry-Protected Multiphoton Bundle Emission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate symmetry protected multiphoton bundle emission in the cavity QED system under the ultrastrong coupling regime. Our proposal only enables the super-Rabi oscillations with periodic generation of even correlated photons in the cavity, which is realized by combining the laser driven flip of qubit and the symmetry conserved transitions induced by Rabi interaction with parity symmetry. Combined with dissipation, only 2n-photon bundle emissions are allowed, due to the almost perfect suppression of bundle emissions with odd correlated photons. Meanwhile, the corresponding purities are significantly enhanced by the parity symmetry. This work extends multiphoton bundle emission to the ultrastrong coupling regime, and offers the prospect of exploring symmetry-protected multiphoton physics.

TI Hybrid post-quantum Transport Layer Security formal analysis in
   Maude-NPA and its parallel version
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This article presents a security formal analysis of the hybrid post-quantum Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, a quantum-resistant version of the TLS protocol proposed by Amazon Web Services as a precaution in dealing with future attacks from quantum computers. In addition to a classical key exchange algorithm, the proposed protocol uses a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism, which is believed invulnerable under quantum computers, so the protocol's key negotiation is called the hybrid key exchange scheme. One of our assumptions about the intruder's capabilities is that the intruder is able to break the security of the classical key exchange algorithm by utilizing the power of large quantum computers. For the formal analysis, we use Maude-NPA and a parallel version of Maude-NPA (called Par-Maude-NPA) to conduct experiments. The security properties under analysis are (1) the secrecy property of the shared secret key established between two honest principals with the classical key exchange algorithm, (2) a similar secrecy property but with the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism, and (3) the authentication property. Given the time limit T = 1,722 h (72 days), Par-Maude-NPA found a counterexample of (1) at depth 12 in T, while Maude-NPA did not find it in T. At the same time T, Par-Maude-NPA did not find any counterexamples of (2) and (3) up to depths 12 and 18, respectively, and neither did Maude-NPA. Therefore, the protocol does not enjoy (1), while it enjoys (2) and (3) up to depths 12 and 18, respectively. Subsequently, the secrecy property of the master secret holds for the protocol up to depth 12.

TI The scaling law of the arrival time of spin systems that present pretty
   good transmission
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The pretty good transmission (PGT) scenario implies that the probability of sending one excitation from one extreme of a spin chain to the other can reach values arbitrarily close to the unity just by waiting a time long enough. The conditions that ensure the appearance of this scenario are known for chains with different interactions and lengths. Sufficient conditions for the presence of PGT depend on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the spin chain. Some works suggest that the time t e at which the PGT takes place scales as 1/(|epsilon|)f(N) , where e is the difference between the probability that a single excitation propagates from one extreme of the chain to the other and the unity, while f(N) is an unknown function of the chain length. In this paper, we show that the exponent is not a simple function of the chain length but a power law of the number of linearly independent irrational eigenvalues of the one-excitation block of the Hamiltonian that enter into the expression of the probability of transmission of one excitation. We explicitly provide examples of a chain showing that the exponent changes when the couplings between the spins change while the length remains fixed. For centrosymmetric spin chains the exponent is at most N/2 .

   FETs
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum dots can be formed in simple GaN/AlGaN FETs by disordered potential induced by impurities and defects. Here, we investigate the channel length dependence of the formation of quantum dots. We observe a decrease in the number of formed quantum dots with a decrease in the FET channel length. A few quantum dots are formed in the case with a gate length of 0.05 & mu;m and we evaluate the dot parameters and the disordered potential. We also investigate the effects of a thermal cycle and illumination of light and reveal the change of the disordered potential.

TI Development of Accurate Electron Correlation Calculation Method Using
   Annealing Machine and Machine Learning
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER CHEMISTRY-JAPAN
AB The Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) transformation, which maps the second quantized Hamiltonian into the Ising Hamiltonian, is a method for optimizing the configuration interaction ( CI) wave function using an annealing computer. In this method, r replicas of qubit sequences, each of which corresponds to a Slater determinant, are used for mapping. To express a CI wave function with determinants having different magnitudes of coefficients, r should be increased. We developed a low-cost and highly-accurate ABCI (Annealing + Bayesian-optimization CI) method by introducing weight bits into the XBK method, which are determined by the Bayesian optimization.

TI Beyond sequence: A physics-informed machine learning framework for
   predicting DNA mutations
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB This paper investigates how incorporating information from a quantum tight-binding model can enhance the predictive capability of machine learning models for identifying mutation-prone sites in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We employ quantum Hamiltonian techniques and machine learning to explore mutations in mitochondrial DNA's hypervariable segment 1 (HVR1). This region is recognized for its high variability and is frequently used in genealogical DNA testing and research. Our approach considers the local energy associated with each base pair, as well as the interactions among electrons within the DNA chain. For this study, we analyze data from the Mitomap database. Our findings suggest that both the local ionization energies and the context-dependent nature of the base pairs significantly influence the locations of mutations within DNA. Specifically, our machine learning model can extract valuable insights when examining homopolymeric runs-regions where a single base pair repeats multiple times within a sequence.

TI Laser Terminals on CubeSats: Developments for Telecommunications and
   Quantum Links
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Satellite-based laser communication is an emerging technology that is finding its way from research to industry. Compared to radio frequency (RF) systems, it has a more efficient size, weight, and power budget and, furthermore, is license free. The required space laser terminals can be designed in different sizes, depending on the mission needs. Data rate requirements range from CubeSats with Mb/s to large satellites with Gb/s data rates and sometimes even Tb/s. This enables, for example, the use of high-resolution imagers even in CubeSats or mega-constellation networks with high-rate intersatellite links. Space laser terminals are also necessary for satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is increasingly important for the development of future quantum-safe networks. In contrast to classical optical links for data transmission, link budget constraints cannot be overcome by simply amplifying the power, but the end-to-end loss needs to be minimized. This is possible with high antenna gains defined by the transmit and receive optics size. Therefore, the optics size of the laser terminal is one of the most important parameters. Building optical terminals with large apertures for use in space is expensive and requires at least a small satellite platform, increasing the cost of development and launch. The New Space approach using a CubeSat platform is a cost-effective alternative because many components can be selected off-the-shelf. This paper reviews developments of laser communication terminals for CubeSats in space to ground and intersatellite scenarios with applications in quantum communications and telecommunications. The systems are selected with respect to clear space deployment, and their core parameters are compared. Special focus and detailed insight are given for the development OSIRIS4CubeSat (O4C).

TI Reconciliation Efficiency Impact on Discrete Modulated CV-QKD Systems
   Key Rates
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) allows the distribution of symmetric keys in a secure manner. CV-QKD systems can extract keys at its maximum rate when using Gaussian modulation (GM). Nonetheless, GM demands high-capacity random number sources and tends to be very hard to approach in practice. To circumvent these disadvantages, higher-order probabilistic-shaped discrete modulation (DM) can be used. State-of-the-art works compute the key rates of DM-CV-QKD systems considering a fixed value for the reconciliation efficiency and do not take into account the frame error rate (FER) of the system, thus over or under estimating the key rates. In this work, we study the security bounds of CV-QKD systems considering probabilistic shaped DM formats with 256-symbols in the finite-size regime. This accounting for the true value of the reconciliation efficiency, and the FER of the information reconciliation step. Both conventional and hexagonal 256-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations yield higher key rates than 256-amplitude and phase shift keying (APSK) constellations, with 256-QAM constellations being indistinguishable in performance with GM for high transmission distances. Minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values were fixed from a FER analysis through a CV-QKD simulation allowing for key extraction considering different FER levels. Lower FER values are associated with higher SNRs in the system and thus lower achievable transmission distances. Nonetheless, the FER maximizing the extraction key rate is not null. Our results show that the extraction key rate is maximized by SNR adjustment which should have in account both the reconciliation efficiency and the FER.

TI Accuracy of Entanglement Detection via Artificial Neural Networks and
   Human-Designed Entanglement Witnesses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The detection of entangled states is essential in both fundamental and applied quantum physics. However, this task proves to be challenging, especially for general quantum states. One can execute full state tomography but this method is time demanding, especially in complex systems. Other approaches use entanglement witnesses: these methods tend to be less demanding but lack reliability. Here, we demonstrate that artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a balance between the two approaches. In this paper, we make a comparison of ANN performance with witness-based methods for random general two-qubit quantum states without any prior information on the states. Furthermore, we apply our approach to a real experimental data set.

TI Photon-Instanton Collider Implemented by a Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Instantons, spacetime-localized quantum field tunneling events, arc ubiquitous in correlated condensed matter and high-energy systems. However, their direct observation through collisions with conventional particles has not been considered possible. We show how recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, specifically, the realization of galvanic coupling of a transmon qubit to a high-impedance transmission line, allows the observation of inelastic collisions of single microwave photons with instantons (phase slips). We develop a formalism for calculating the photon-instanton cross section, which should be useful in other quantum field theoretical contexts. In particular, we show that the inelastic scattering probability can significantly exceed the effect of conventional Josephson quartic anharmonicity and mach order-unity values.

AB We propose an analog quantum simulation for studying the collapse and bounce of a star from infinity. In this spacetime, which encompasses both a black hole and a white hole, we place a massless scalar field that propagates at the speed of light, which is modified by the curvature. We simulate this system using an SQUID array, in which we can alter the propagation of light using an external magnetic field. We consider both infalling and outfalling radiation, giving rise to two different scenarios: downstream and upstream radiation. We compute the magnetic flux profile required by the simulation in both cases and find out that the former is more experimentally suitable.

TI In Situ Magnetic Detection of van der Waals Magnetic
   Materials Based on Solid-State Color Center Systems (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Solid-state color center systems represented by diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers, silicon carbide silicon-vacancy centers, and boron nitride boron-vacancy centers demonstrate unique advantages in quantum precision measurement and spintronics, due to their excellent spin manipulation properties and long spin coherence time. As an emerging class of two-dimensional magnetic systems, van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials provide an ideal platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena, owing to their low dimensionality and diverse magnetic order structures. Solid-state color center spin systems offer a transformative approach for probing vdW magnetic materials, addressing several critical challenges in low-dimensional magnetism. Their exceptional spatial resolution, quantum-limited sensitivity, and compatibility with ambient or extreme environments enable direct, non-invasive access to local magnetic textures and spin dynamics at the nanoscale. As such, this approach not only deepens our understanding of fundamental magnetism in low-dimensional systems but also advances the development of quantum sensors and vdW spintronic technologies. Progress In this paper, we review the recent research progress in magnetic detection of vdW magnetic materials based on solid-state color center systems. We first discuss the physical mechanisms underlying quantum sensing with solid-state color centers, focusing on the principles of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), spin coherence time (T2), and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1). We then summarize recent experimental advances using solid-state color centers, such as NV-centers in diamond, boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and silicon vacancies in silicon carbide, for in situ magnetic detection of various vdW systems, including ferromagnetic materials, antiferromagnets, and twisted Moir & eacute; superlattices. Special attention is given to techniques that combine NV--based magnetometry with atomic force microscopy for high-resolution magnetic imaging, and to studies employing diamond anvil cells (DACs) to investigate magnetic phase transitions under extreme pressures. Furthermore, we discuss emerging approaches for chip-scale integration of color centers for on-device sensing and outline the challenges and future directions of applying these quantum sensors to vdW magnetic systems. These developments offer new opportunities to probe quantum magnetism at the nanoscale and to advance quantum sensing technologies in condensed matter physics. Conclusions and Prospects In recent years, solid-state spin quantum systems, such as NV-centers in diamond, boron vacancy color centers in hBN, and silicon vacancy color centers in silicon carbide have demonstrated significant advantages for nanoscale detection of magnetic, thermal, and stress fields. These advantages arise from their atomic-scale spatial resolution, stable operation at room temperature, and high sensitivity to weak signals. These capabilities allow researchers to reveal the microscopic mechanisms of two-dimensional vdW materials, such as interlayer coupling, topological order, and magnetoelectric response, at the monolayer limit, to analyze their intrinsic properties, and to expand experimental exploration of novel quantum phenomena in two-dimensional materials. Compared with traditional characterization methods, solid-state color center spin systems offer remarkable advantages, including non-invasiveness, high sensitivity, and high spatial resolution.
   We systematically review the application progress of color center spin detection technology in the field of vdW materials, covering the measurement of vdW ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and Moir & eacute; superlattice material properties by solid-state color centers, the performance of vdW materials under high-pressure environments, and the magnetic detection of vdW materials by probes prepared based on solid-state color centers. Looking ahead, although challenges remain, the application of solid-state spin systems in vdW materials and related quantum systems shows broad potential. This system not only provides new characterization methods for the properties of vdW magnetic materials but also lays a material foundation and methodological support for the practical application of quantum sensing technologies.

TI Non-classical correlations between a quantum probe and complex quantum

AB Non-classical correlations generated within a quantum probe system when it interacts with a large, macroscopic system can signal the presence of quantum features in the latter. Theoretical models have considered how entanglement generated in photosynthetic bacteria can be probed using light that interacts with them. More recently, a tardigrade was entangled to a transmon qubit. We consider a detailed model including noise for such systems wherein a small quantum probe interacts with a large system in order to delineate the regimes with respect to coupling strengths and noise levels in which such signatures of quantumness in macroscopic systems can realistically be detected.

Two generic frames for qubit tomography are considered - one composed of the elements of the SIC-POVM and the other defined by the vectors from the mutually unbiased bases. Both frames are combined with the method of least squares in order to reconstruct a sample of input qubits with imperfect measurements. The accuracy of each frame is quantified by the average fidelity and purity. The efficiency of the frames is compared and discussed.

TI Satellite-based communications security: A survey of threats, solutions,
   and research challenges
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services.
   In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.

TI High-Speed Variable Polynomial Toeplitz Hash Algorithm Based on FPGA
SO ENTROPY
AB In the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network, authentication protocols play a critical role in safeguarding data interactions among users. To keep pace with the rapid advancement of QKD technology, authentication protocols must be capable of processing data at faster speeds. The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), which functions as a cryptographic hash function, is a key technology in digital authentication. Irreducible polynomials can serve as characteristic functions of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to rapidly generate pseudo-random sequences, which in turn form the foundation of the hash algorithm. Currently, the most prevalent approach to hardware implementation involves performing block computations and pipeline data processing of the Toeplitz matrix in the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to reach a maximum computing rate of 1 Gbps. However, this approach employs a fixed irreducible polynomial as the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR, which results in computational inefficiency as the highest bit of the polynomial restricts the width of parallel processing. Moreover, an attacker could deduce the irreducible polynomials utilized by an algorithm based on the output results, creating a serious concealed security risk. This paper proposes a method to use FPGA to implement variational irreducible polynomials based on a hashing algorithm. Our method achieves an operational rate of 6.8 Gbps by computing equivalent polynomials and updating the Toeplitz matrix with pipeline operations in real-time, which accelerates the authentication protocol while also significantly enhancing its security. Moreover, the optimization of this algorithm can be extended to quantum randomness extraction, leading to a considerable increase in the generation rate of random numbers.

AB Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry Rep(D8). This model not only captures the essential features of noninvertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.

TI A coherent approach to quantum-classical optimization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Hybrid quantum-classical optimization techniques, which incorporate the pre-optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms using Tensor Networks, have been shown to allow for the reduction of quantum computational resources. In the particular case of large optimization problems, commonly found in real-world use cases, this strategy is almost mandatory to reduce the otherwise unfathomable execution costs and improve the quality of the results. We identify the coherence entropy as a crucial metric in determining the suitability of quantum states as effective initialization candidates. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical tests for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, in which we find that the optimal initialization states are pure Gibbs states. Further, these results are explained with the inclusion of a simple notion of expressivity adapted to classical optimization problems. Based on this finding, we propose a quantum-classical optimization protocol that significantly improves the effectiveness of the quantum subroutine.

TI Embedding the Yang-Lee quantum criticality in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Yang-Lee edge singularity is a quintessential nonunitary critical phenomenon characterized by anomalous scaling. However, an imaginary magnetic field involved in this phenomenon makes its physical implementation nontrivial. By embedding the original classical system which exhibits the Yang-Lee edge singularity in a quantum system with an ancilla qubit and by invoking the quantum-classical correspondence, we demonstrate a physical realization of the nonunitary quantum criticality in an open quantum system, where the nonuni-tary criticality is identified with the singularity at an exceptional point caused by postselection of quantum measurement.

TI Security and Privacy in the Internet of Everything (IoE): A Review on
   Blockchain, Edge Computing, AI, and Quantum-Resilient Solutions
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The IoE forms the foundation of the modern digital ecosystem by enabling seamless connectivity and data exchange among smart devices, sensors, and systems. However, the inherent nature of this structure, characterized by high heterogeneity, distribution, and resource constraints, renders traditional security approaches insufficient in areas such as data privacy, authentication, access control, and scalable protection. Moreover, centralized security systems face increasing fragility due to single points of failure, various AI-based attacks, including adversarial learning, model poisoning, and deepfakes, and the rising threat of quantum computers to encryption protocols. This study systematically examines the individual and integrated solution potentials of technologies such as Blockchain, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum-Resilient Cryptography within the scope of IoE security. Comparative analyses are provided based on metrics such as energy consumption, latency, computational load, and security level, while centralized and decentralized models are evaluated through a multi-layered security lens. In addition to the proposed multi-layered architecture, the study also structures solution methods and technology integrations specific to IoE environments. Classifications, architectural proposals, and the balance between performance and security are addressed from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Furthermore, a future vision is presented regarding federated learning-based privacy-preserving AI solutions, post-quantum digital signatures, and lightweight consensus algorithms. In this context, the study reveals existing vulnerabilities through an interdisciplinary approach and proposes a holistic framework for sustainable, scalable, and quantum-compatible IoE security.

TI Generalized Centered Binomial Distribution for Bimodal Lattice
   Signatures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In CRYPTO 2013, Ducas et al. introduced a bimodal discrete Gaussian distribution into the Fiat-Shamir with abort paradigm, proposing a signature scheme called BLISS, which significantly improved rejection sampling efficiency and reduced the number of required abort steps compared to all previously proposed (uni-modal) lattice-based signature schemes. Although the theoretical structure of the bimodal distribution is elegant, the BLISS implementation suffers from several side-channel vulnerabilities. The primary issue arises from the fact that the probability mass function of the bimodal discrete Gaussian distribution is a transcendental function, which makes it difficult to implement solely with integers in constant-time. To address this issue, we introduce a new distribution called 'Generalized Centered Binomial Distribution (GCBD)' that can replace the (bimodal) discrete Gaussian distribution. As a generalized form of the centered binomial distribution (CBD), GCBD is simple and efficient in sampling integers from distributions with large standard deviations. GCBD sampling consists of sampling uniformly random bit-strings and integer addition/subtraction operations, allowing for efficient constant-time implementation. Furthermore, bimodal rejection sampling using GCBD can be implemented only with integer operations in constant-time, with the help of the Newton-Raphson method. By incorporating the bimodal GCBD rejection sampling into BLISS, we present a new variant of BLISS that can be implemented in constant-time, thereby eliminating the side-channel vulnerabilities associated with timing attacks. Finally, we compare the performance of our variant to GALACTICS, a previous constant-time implementation of BLISS. While the signing algorithm of our variant is about 3.3 times slower than that of GALACTICS, GCBD can serve as an alternative to the discrete Gaussian distribution for designing bimodal lattice signatures.

AB Code-based public-key cryptosystems are promising candidates for standardization as quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. Their security is based on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem. Computing the syndrome in a finite field, usually F-2, guarantees the security of the constructions. We show in this article that the problem becomes considerably easier to solve if the syndrome is computed in N instead. By means of laser fault injection, we illustrate how to compute the matrix-vector product in N by corrupting specific instructions, and validate it experimentally. To solve the syndrome decoding problem in N, we propose a reduction to an integer linear programming problem. We leverage the computational efficiency of linear programming solvers to obtain real-time message recovery attacks against the code-based proposal to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization challenge. We perform our attacks in the worst-case scenario, i.e. considering random binary codes, and retrieve the initial message within minutes on a desktop computer.
   Our attack targets the reference implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem in the NIST PQC competition finalist Classic McEliece and is practically feasible for all proposed parameters sets of this submission. For example, for the 256-bit security parameters sets, we successfully recover the message in a couple of seconds on a desktop computer Finally, we highlight the fact that the attack is still possible if only a fraction of the syndrome entries are faulty. This makes the attack feasible even though the fault injection does not have perfect repeatability and reduces the computational complexity of the attack, making it even more practical overall.

   171Yb atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We report on the observation of the spin-exchange dynamics of Yb-171 atoms in the ground state S-1(0) and in the metastable state P-3(0). We implement the mixed-dimensional two-orbital system using near-resonant and magic-wavelength optical lattices, where the S-1(0) and P-3(0) atoms are itinerant in a one-dimensional tube and localized in three dimensions, respectively. By exploiting an optical Stern-Gerlach method, we observe the spin depolarization of the S-1(0) atoms induced by the spin-exchange interaction with the P-3(0) atom. Our work could pave the way to the quantum simulation of the Kondo effect.

AB Tensor network methods have demonstrated their suitability for the study of equilibrium properties of lattice gauge theories, even close to the continuum limit. We use them in an out-of-equilibrium scenario, much less explored so far, by simulating the real-time collisions of composite mesons in the lattice Schwinger model. Constructing wave-packets of vector mesons at different incoming momenta, we observe the opening of the inelastic channel in which two heavier mesons are produced and identify the momentum threshold. To detect the products of the collision in the strong coupling regime we propose local quantitites that could be measured in current quantum simulation platforms.

TI Challenges and opportunities in quantum optimization
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers have demonstrable ability to solve problems at a scale beyond brute-force classical simulation. Interest in quantum algorithms has developed in many areas, particularly in relation to mathematical optimization - a broad field with links to computer science and physics. In this Review, we aim to give an overview of quantum optimization. Provably exact, provably approximate and heuristic settings are first explained using computational complexity theory, and we highlight where quantum advantage is possible in each context. Then, we outline the core building blocks for quantum optimization algorithms, define prominent problem classes and identify key open questions that should be addressed to advance the field. We underscore the importance of benchmarking by proposing clear metrics alongside suitable optimization problems, for appropriate comparisons with classical optimization techniques, and discuss next steps to accelerate progress towards quantum advantage in optimization.

TI Scaling of errors in digitized counterdiabatic driving
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study errors caused by digitization of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counterdiabatic driving. We find possibility of error scaling O(M-2) with the number of time slices M, whereas worse error scaling O(M-1) is predicted in the conventional theory of the first-order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. We point out this possibility by considering a state-dependent error bound and confirm emergence of this error scaling O(M-2) by numerical simulation. Moreover, we numerically show that intermediate error scaling can be observed in digitization of approximate counterdiabatic driving. These results reveal usefulness of digitized counterdiabatic driving from the viewpoints of both cost and performance.

TI Faithful Simulation of Distributed Quantum Measurements With
   Applications in Distributed Rate-Distortion Theory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We consider the task of faithfully simulating a distributed quantum measurement, wherein we provide a protocol for the three parties, Alice, Bob and Charlie, to simulate a repeated action of a distributed quantum measurement using a pair of non-product approximating measurements by Alice and Bob, followed by a stochastic mapping at Charlie. The objective of the protocol is to utilize minimum resources, in terms of classical bits needed by Alice and Bob to communicate their measurement outcomes to Charlie, and the common randomness shared among the three parties, while faithfully simulating independent repeated instances of the original measurement. To achieve this, we develop a mutual covering lemma and a technique for random binning of distributed quantum measurements, and, in turn, characterize a set of sufficient communication and common randomness rates required for asymptotic simulatability in terms of single-letter quantum information quantities. In the special case, where the Charlie's action is restricted to a deterministic mapping, we develop a one-shot performance characterization of the distributed faithful simulation problem. Furthermore, using these results we address a distributed quantum rate-distortion problem, where we characterize the achievable rate distortion region through a single-letter inner bound. Finally, via a technique of single-letterization of multi-letter quantum information quantities, we provide an outer bound for the rate-distortion region.

TI Electronic excited states from a variance-based contracted quantum
   eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Electronic excited states of molecules are central to many physical and chemical processes, and yet they are typically more difficult to compute than ground states. In this paper we leverage the advantages of quantum computers to develop an algorithm for the highly accurate calculation of excited states. We solve a contracted Schrodinger equation (CSE)-a contraction (projection) of the Schrodinger equation onto the space of two electrons-whose solutions correspond identically to the ground and excited states of the Schrodinger equation. While recent quantum algorithms for solving the CSE, known as contracted quantum eigensolvers (CQEs), have focused on ground states, we develop a CQE based on the variance that is designed to optimize rapidly to a ground or excited state. We apply the algorithm to compute the ground and excited states of H2, H4, and BH.

TI Stabilization of Multimode Schrodinger Cat States Via Normal-Mode
   Dissipation Engineering
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Non-Gaussian quantum states have been deterministically prepared and autonomously stabilized in single- and two-mode circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures via engineered dissipation. However, it is currently unknown how to scale up this technique to multimode non-Gaussian systems. Here, we upgrade dissipation engineering to collective (normal) modes of nonlinear resonator arrays and show how to stabilize multimode Schrodinger cat states. These states are multiphoton and multimode quantum superpositions of coherent states in a single normal mode delocalized over an arbitrary number of cavities. We consider tailored dissipative coupling between resonators that are parametrically driven and feature an on-site nonlinearity, which is either a Kerr-type nonlinearity or an engineered two-photon loss. For both types of nonlinearity, we find the same exact closed-form solutions for the two-dimensional steady-state manifold spanned by superpositions of multimode Schrodinger cat states. We further show that, in the Zeno limit of strong dissipative coupling, the even-parity multimode cat state can be deterministically prepared from the vacuum. Remarkably, engineered two-photon loss gives rise to a fast relaxation toward the steady state, protecting the state preparation against decoherence due to intrinsic single-photon losses and imperfections in tailored dissipative coupling, which sets in at longer times. The relaxation time is independent of system size making the state preparation scalable. Multimode cat states are naturally endowed with a noise bias that increases exponentially with system size and can thus be exploited for enhanced robust encoding of quantum information.

TI Cavity-enhanced optical manipulation of antiferromagnetic magnon pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The optical manipulation of magnon states in antiferromagnets (AFMs) holds significant potential for advancing AFM-based computing devices. In particular, two-magnon Raman scattering processes are known to generate entangled magnon pairs with opposite momenta. We propose to harness the dynamical backaction of a driven optical cavity coupled to these processes, to obtain steady states of squeezed magnon pairs, represented by squeezed Perelomov coherent states. The system's dynamics can be controlled by the strength and detuning of the optical drive and by the cavity losses. In the limit of a fast (or lossy) cavity, we obtain an effective equation of motion in the Perelomov representation, in terms of a light-induced frequency shift and a collective induced dissipation which sign can be controlled by the detuning of the drive. In the red-detuned regime, a critical power threshold defines a region where magnon-pair operators exhibit squeezing, a resource for quantum information, marked by distinct attractor points. Beyond this threshold, the system evolves to limit cycles of magnon pairs. In contrast, for resonant and blue detuning regimes, the magnon-pair dynamics exhibits limit cycles and chaotic phases, respectively, for low and high pump powers. Observing strongly squeezed states, auto-oscillating limit cycles, and chaos in this platform presents promising opportunities for future quantum information processing, communication developments, and materials studies.

TI Conformal Field Theory from Lattice Fermions
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We provide a rigorous lattice approximation of conformal field theories given in terms of lattice fermions in 1+1-dimensions, focussing on free fermion models and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. To this end, we utilize a recently introduced operator-algebraic framework for Wilson-Kadanoff renormalization. In this setting, we prove the convergence of the approximation of the Virasoro generators by the Koo-Saleur formula. From this, we deduce the convergence of lattice approximations of conformal correlation functions to their continuum limit. In addition, we show how these results lead to explicit error estimates pertaining to the quantum simulation of conformal field theories.

TI Compressed Gate Characterization for Quantum Devices with
   Time-Correlated Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB As quantum devices make steady progress towards intermediate scale and fault-tolerant quantum com-puting, it is essential to develop rigorous and efficient measurement protocols that account for known sources of noise. Most existing quantum characterization protocols such as gate-set tomography and ran-domized benchmarking assume the noise acting on the qubits is Markovian. However, this assumption is often not valid, as for the case of 1/f charge noise or hyperfine nuclear spin noise. Here, we present a general framework for quantum process tomography (QPT) in the presence of time-correlated noise. We further introduce fidelity benchmarks that quantify the relative strength of different sources of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. As an application of our method, we perform a comparative theoretical and experimental analysis of silicon spin qubits. We first develop a detailed noise model that accounts for the dominant sources of noise and validate the model against experimental data. Applying our framework for time-correlated QPT, we find that the number of independent parameters needed to characterize one-and two-qubit gates can be compressed by 10x and 100x, respectively, when compared to the fully generic case. These compressions reduce the amount of tomographic measurements needed in experiment, while also significantly speeding up numerical simulations of noisy quantum circuit dynamics compared to time -dependent Hamiltonian simulation. Using this compressed noise model, we find good agreement between our theoretically predicted process fidelities and two-qubit interleaved randomized benchmarking fideli-ties of 99.8% measured in recent experiments on silicon spin qubits. More broadly, our formalism can be directly extended to develop efficient and scalable tuning protocols for high-fidelity control of large arrays of quantum devices with non-Markovian noise.

TI Green indoor optical wireless communication systems: Pathway towards
   pervasive deployment
SO DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB The Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) offers the high capacity of optical fiber communication with the flexibility of wireless communication. Since it works in the optical region of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) spectrum, it guarantees safety and security which are critical in radio and microwave frequency communication. The principal objective of this paper is to analyze the indoor OWC systems on these guaranteed features, and safety and security are jointly denoted by the term green. The high obstacle impermeability of optical signals and their directivity strengthen the security of indoor OWC data transmission. The confidentiality and authenticity of optical wireless data can also be preserved with the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This paper provides a technological overview and a review of literature about the OWC system that helps to identify the challenges in the path of a ubiquitous deployment of green wireless communication systems. Significant advancements in the sources and detectors are discussed together with the coding, modulation and multiplexing techniques for making highly robust OWC links. The ubiquitous deployment of green OWC necessitates the development of optical transmitters and receivers, performance enhancement techniques, incorporation of uplink and energy harvesting abilities, and safety and security enhancement techniques. Hence, a special emphasis is placed on these aspects and their challenges towards the green implementation. Furthermore, the paper explores some significant indoor applications based on the OWC that have great impacts on the Next Generation Networks (NGN) and the Internet of Things (IoT).

TI An open-endcap blade trap for radial-2D ion crystals
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present the design and experimental demonstration of an open-endcap radio frequency trap to confine ion crystals in the radial-two dimensional (2D) structural phase. The central axis of the trap is kept free of obstructions to allow for site-resolved imaging of ions in the 2D crystal plane, and the confining potentials are provided by four segmented blade electrodes. We discuss the design challenges, fabrication techniques, and voltage requirements for implementing this open-endcap trap. Finally, we validate its operation by confining up to 29 ions in a 2D triangular lattice, oriented such that both in-plane principal axes of the 2D crystal lie in the radial direction.

TI Exploring multiscale quantum media: high-precision numerical solution of
   the fractional Schrödinger equation, eigenfunctions with physical
   potentials, and fractionally-enhanced quantum tunneling
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Fractional evolution equations lack generally accessible and well-converged codes excepting anomalous diffusion. A particular equation of strong interest to the growing intersection of applied mathematics and quantum information science and technology is the fractional Schr & ouml;dinger equation, which describes sub-and super-dispersive behavior of quantum wavefunctions induced by multiscale media. We derive a computationally efficient sixth-order split-step numerical method to converge the eigenfunctions of the FSE to arbitrary numerical precision for arbitrary fractional order derivative. We demonstrate applications of this code to machine precision for classic quantum problems such as the finite well and harmonic oscillator, which take surprising twists due to the non-local nature of the fractional derivative. For example, the evanescent wave tails in the finite well take a Mittag-Leffer-like form which decay much slower than the well-known exponential from integer-order derivative wave theories, enhancing penetration into the barrier and therefore quantum tunneling rates. We call this effect fractionally enhanced quantum tunneling. This work includes an open source code for communities from quantum experimentalists to applied mathematicians to easily and efficiently explore the solutions of the fractional Schr & ouml;dinger equation in a wide variety of practical potentials for potential realization in quantum tunneling enhancement and other quantum applications.

TI Rydberg atom arrays as quantum simulators for molecular dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezer arrays combine vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom that can be coupled and manipulated at a microscopic level. This opens opportunities for the quantum simulation of artificial molecular systems and offers in particular a platform for probing complex vibronic dynamics in controlled settings with increasing complexity. Tailored interatomic interactions and electron-phonon couplings yield handles for designing electronic state manifolds, for studying structural transitions, and for exploring nonclassical vibrational states near molecular instabilities. Furthermore, this quantum simulator opens opportunities for testing and quantifying the validity of fundamental concepts, such as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and quantum corrections to it.

TI Quantum squeezing via self-induced transparency in a photonic crystal
   fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the quantum squeezing produced in self-induced transparency in a photonic crystal fiber by performing a fully quantum simulation based on the positive P representation. The amplitude squeezing depends on the area of the initial pulse: When the area is 2 pi, there is no energy absorption and no amplitude squeezing. However, when the area is between 2 pi and 3 pi, one observes amplitude-dependent energy absorption and a significant amount of squeezing. We also investigate the effect of damping, detuning, and temperature: The results indicate that a heightened atom-pulse coupling, caused by an increase in the spontaneous emission ratio, reduces the amplitude squeezing.

TI Uncovering measurement-induced entanglement via directional adaptive
   dynamics and incomplete information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The rich entanglement dynamics and transitions exhibited by monitored quantum systems typically only exist in the conditional state, making observation extremely difficult. In this Letter, we construct a general recipe for mimicking the conditional entanglement dynamics of a monitored system in a corresponding measurement-free dissipative system involving directional interactions between the original system and a set of auxiliary register modes. This mirror setup autonomously implements a measurement-feedforward dynamics that effectively retains a coarse-grained measurement record. We illustrate our ideas in a bosonic system featuring a competition between entangling measurements and local unitary dynamics, and also discuss extensions to qubit systems and truly many-body systems.

TI Improving Steerability Detection via an Aggregate Class Distribution
   Neural Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we establish an aggregate class distribution neural network (AGGNN) structure to determine whether an arbitrary two-qubit quantum state is steerable. Compared to the classification results obtained using a support vector machine (SVM) and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), we obtain higher-accuracy quantum-steering classification models via the AGGNN, as well as steerability bounds of generalized Werner states, which are more similar to the theoretical bounds. In particular, when we only know partial information about the quantum states, higher-performance quantum-steering classifiers are obtained compared to those via SVM and BPNN.

TI Efficient sparse state preparation via quantum walks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on dynamic graphs, referred to as dynamic CTQWs, are a recently introduced universal model of computation that offers a new paradigm in which to envision quantum algorithms. In this work, we develop an algorithm that converts single-edge and self-loop dynamic CTQWs to the gate model of computation. We use this mapping to introduce an efficient sparse quantum state preparation framework based on dynamic CTQWs. Our approach utilizes combinatorics techniques such as minimal hitting sets, minimum spanning trees, and shortest Hamiltonian paths to reduce the number of controlled gates required to prepare sparse states. We show that our framework encompasses the current state of the art ancilla-free sparse state preparation method by reformulating this method as a CTQW. This CTQW-based framework offers an alternative to the uniformly controlled rotation method used by Qiskit by requiring fewer CX gates when the target state has a polynomial number of non-zero amplitudes.

TI Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)-Decalcified, Formalin-Fixed
   Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tumor Tissue Shows Comparable Quality and
   Quantity of DNA to Non-Decalcified Tissue in Next-Generation Sequencing
   (NGS)
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
AB Background: Bone tissue decalcification is essential for histopathological evaluation, but conventional methods using inorganic acids degrade nucleic acids, limiting molecular testing. EDTA is known to better preserve DNA, but its suitability for next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical settings remains to be validated. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated 752 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples undergoing NGS between January 2022 and October 2024. Of these, 31 were decalcified using EDTA (Osteosoft, Merck, Germany). DNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep (R) kit and quantified using Qubit and NanoDrop. Libraries were prepared with a custom 30-gene Ampliseq panel and sequenced on the Ion Torrent platform. Sequencing was deemed suboptimal if <95% of target regions reached >= 250X depth. Results were compared to 721 non-decalcified FFPE samples. Results: Suboptimal sequencing occurred in 9.7% of EDTA-decalcified and 9.0% of non-decalcified cases (p = 0.9). DNA concentration (Qubit) and NanoDrop 260/280 ratios were not significantly different (p = 0.4 and p = 0.8, respectively), though EDTA cases had lower DNA concentrations (NanoDrop, p = 0.006) and 260/230 ratios (p = 0.002). Mutation detection in decalcified samples was consistent with known mutation profiles for respective tumor types. Conclusions: EDTA-decalcified FFPE bone tissues produce NGS results comparable to non-decalcified specimens, with similar sequencing success rates and acceptable DNA quality. These findings support the use of EDTA as a suitable decalcification method for molecular diagnostics, enabling broader inclusion of bone specimens in clinical testing.

AB While the quantum query complexity of k-distinctness is known to be O(n(3/4-1/4 1/2k-1)) for any constant k >= 4 [Belovs, FOCS 2012], the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was (O) over tilde (n(1-1/k)). We give a new upper bound of (O) over tilde (n(3/4-1/4 1/2k-1)) on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in O (n) queries and O (n(2)) time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.

TI Prospects of quantum error mitigation for quantum signal processing
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) protocols have provably exponential bounds on the cost scaling; however, exploring which regimes QEM can recover usable results is still of sizable interest. Herein, we are interested in the performance of QEM with a template for quantum algorithms, quantum signal processing (QSP). We design a QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation of a modified Ising model under depolarizing noise for low precision and varying simulation times. We show for which of the explored noise and depth regimes our ZNE protocol can recover an approximation of the noiseless expectation value. We discuss existing bounds on the sample budget, eventually using a fixed number of shots. While this does not guarantee the success of QEM, it gives us usable results in relevant cases. Finally, we briefly discuss and present a numerical study on the region where ZNE is unusable, even given an unlimited sample budget.

TI 23Na relaxometry: An overview of theory and applications
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE LETTERS
AB 23Na is a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-active isotope with a nuclear spin quantum number of 3/2. 23Na relaxation phenomenon is at the core of 23Na NMR measurement and analysis. Due to the dominance of quadrupolar interaction, the relaxation behavior of 23Na is physically and mathematically more complex than that of a typical spin-1/2 isotope. In this review, we overview the semi-classical Redfield theory for deriving the formulations of 23Na relaxation. We show that the relaxation behaviors of 23Na can be quantitatively described by constructing the spectral density functions based on the second-order perturbation theory. In addition, we summarize the applications of 23Na relaxometry in different research fields, including biomedicine, sodium ion batteries, and quantum information processing. Because sodium is an essential element in our body, food and industrial materials, the research on sodium by 23Na NMR emerges as important future directions. The theoretical and practical understandings on 23Na relaxation are the step stones for mastering advanced 23Na NMR techniques. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Lattice reduction algorithms such as BKZ (Block-Korkine-Zolotarev) play a central role in estimating the security of lattice-based cryptography. The subroutine in BKZ which finds the shortest vector in a projected sublattice can be instantiated with enumeration algorithms. The enumeration procedure can be seen as a depth-first search on some "enumeration tree" whose nodes denote a partial assignment of the coefficients, corresponding to lattice points as a linear combination of the lattice basis with the coefficients. This work provides a concrete analysis for the cost of quantum lattice enumeration based on Montanaro's quantum tree backtracking algorithm. More precisely, we give a concrete implementation in the quantum circuit model. We also show how to optimize the circuit depth by parallelizing the components. Based on the circuit designed, we discuss the concrete quantum resource estimates required for lattice enumeration.

TI Polytope structures for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger diagonal states *
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We explore the polytope structures for genuine entanglement, biseparability, full biseparability and Bell inequality of multi-qubit GHZ diagonal states. We first show that biseparable GHZ diagonal states make hypersimplices inside the simplices consisting of all GHZ diagonal states. Next, we consider full biseparability which is equivalent to positive partial transpose for GHZ diagonal states, and show that they make the convex hulls of simplices and cubes. We also visualize which part of the simplex violates multipartite Bell inequality. Finally, we compute precise volumes for genuine entanglement, biseparability, full biseparability and states violating Bell inequality among all GHZ diagonal states.

TI Encoding the information in relative parameters
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We investigate the problem of communicating three parameters in the absence of shared reference frame. We explore two methods in which the relative angles of spins are used to encode the parameters. In the first method we use three spins that carry the information in their relative angles while in the second method we use three disjoint spin-pairs and the information is sent through the relative angles of each individual pair. We show that in the first method, the information conveyed by each qubit is more than the second one, and that is while it requires fewer particles. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Software Pipelining for Quantum Loop Programs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB We propose a method for performing software pipelining on quantum for-loop programs to exploit parallelism in and across iterations. We redefined concepts useful in program optimization, including array aliasing, instruction dependency, and resource conflict required in optimizing quantum programs. Using these concepts, we present a software pipelining framework exploiting instruction-level parallelism in quantum loop programs. This method is further enhanced with several improvements to reduce total gate count and program depth. The optimization method is then evaluated on some popular quantum algorithms like Grover and QAOA, and compared under different configurations and with several baseline compilers. The evaluation results show that our approach can schedule loop programs with depth close to the depth of the entire loop unrolling while generating smaller code sizes and consuming much less time. This is the first step towards optimization of a quantum program with such loop control flow, as far as we know.

TI Accelerating Dissipative State Preparation with Adaptive Open Quantum
   Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A wide variety of dissipative state preparation schemes suffer from a basic time-entanglement tradeoff: the more entangled the steady state, the slower the relaxation to the steady state. Here, we show how a minimal kind of adaptive dynamics can be used to completely circumvent this tradeoff, and allow the dissipative stabilization of maximally entangled states with a finite timescale. Our approach takes inspiration from simple fermionic stabilization schemes, which surprisingly are immune to entanglement- induced slowdown. We describe schemes for accelerated stabilization of many-body entangled qubit states (including spin squeezed states), both in the form of discretized Floquet circuits, as well as continuous time dissipative dynamics. Our ideas are compatible with a number of experimental platforms.

TI Disentangling the sources of ionizing radiation in superconducting
   qubits
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Radioactivity was recently discovered as a source of decoherence and correlated errors for the real-world implementation of superconducting quantum processors. In this work, we measure levels of radioactivity present in a typical laboratory environment (from muons, neutrons, and gamma-rays emitted by naturally occurring radioactive isotopes) and in the most commonly used materials for the assembly and operation of state-of-the-art superconducting qubits. We present a GEANT-4 based simulation to predict the rate of impacts and the amount of energy released in a qubit chip from each of the mentioned sources. We finally propose mitigation strategies for the operation of next-generation qubits in a radio-pure environment.

AB Various promising quantum algorithms, such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms, rely on a quantum oracle implementing a function, which is usually classical. Ideally, a complex oracle would be implemented in a high-level language with familiar control flow constructs. Since the oracle must be unitary and operates on inputs in superposition, the control flow must be reversible and must not measure the data it is conditioned on.
   We propose a scheme to compile a high-level reversible program-written in a language such as Janus-into either a control-flow graph with reversible control flow, or an instruction sequence with reversible branch instructions. Provided that the program has bounded execution time, either of these can then be executed as a quantum circuit which acts correctly on inputs in superposition. This builds on quantum stacks to support recursive function calls as one of the control flow constructs.

TI Bragg grating based entangled biphoton dispersion management
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In the realm of quantum information processing and precision measurements, a range of non-classical effects based on entangled photon pairs are employed. Non-local dispersion cancellation is one of these properties, in which the second photon (idler) can be manipulated to cancel the effects of dispersion on the first photon (signal). In the present study, a thorough investigation is conducted into non-local dispersion cancellation by using excitation modes within a Bragg grating slab waveguide. We present a complete theoretical analysis of non-local dispersion cancellation for frequency-limited entangled photon pairs. For the analysis of the effect of dispersion cancellation, we use a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon pair source with frequency correlation and anti-correlation as the entangled source. To evaluate the dispersion cancellation effect for information processing applications, the second correlation function is used and calculated as a practical and tangible metric. Considering different cases for Bragg Grating waveguide the results on both photons are extracted and discussed. Moreover, we will show that the physical parameters of the waveguide that the second photon is propagated inside will be effective in minimizing the width of the temporal correlation function. Hence, this study underscores the feasibility of achieving non-local dispersion cancellation through strategic optimization of optical and geometric parameters in the Bragg Grating waveguide, with potential implications for quantum information processing and high-resolution sensing endeavors.

TI Entanglement structures in disordered chains of nitrogen-vacancy centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A recent study [Ghassemizadeh et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 174111 (2022)] hypothesized the assembly, along a specific type of one-dimensional defects of diamond, of chains of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, potentially enabling the creation of qubit registers via their dipole-coupled electron spins. Here we investigate the connectivity of chains of up to 10 coupled spins, mediated by the bi- and multipartite entanglement of their eigenstates. Rather conveniently, for regularly spaced spins the vast majority of the eigenstates display strong connectivity, especially towards the center of the spectrum and for longer chains. Furthermore, positional disorder can change, and possibly reduce, the connectivity of the register but seldom suppresses it.

TI Ultracoherent Nanomechanical Resonators Based on Density Phononic
   Crystal Engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Micromechanical and nanomechanical systems with exceptionally low dissipation rates are enabling the next-generation technologies of ultrasensitive detectors and quantum information systems. New techniques and methods for lowering the dissipation rate have in recent years been discovered and allowed for the engineering of mechanical oscillators with phononic modes that are extremely well isolated from the environment and thus possess quality factors close to and beyond 1 x 109. A powerful strategy for isolating and controlling a single phononic mode is based on phononic crystal engineering. Here we propose a new method for phononic crystal engineering of nanomechanical oscillators that is based on a periodic variation of the material density. To circumvent the introduction of additional bending losses resulting from the variation of material density, the added mass constitutes an array of nanopillars in which the losses will be diluted. Using this novel technique for phononic crystal engineering, we design and fabricate corrugated mechanical oscillators with quality factors approaching 1 x 109 in a room temperature environment. The flexibility space of these new phononic crystals is large and further advancement can be attained through optimized phononic crystal patterning and strain engineering via topology optimization. This will allow for the engineering of mechanical membranes with quality factors beyond 1 x 109 at room temperature. Such extremely low mechanical dissipation rates will enable the development of radically new technologies such as quantum-limited atomic force microscopy at room temperature, ultrasensitive detectors of dark matter, spontaneous waveform collapses, gravity, and high-efficiency quantum information transducers.

TI Extending quantum coherence lifetimes in nonadiabatic dissipative
   molecular systems with chirped pulses
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherences play a central role in a broad range of fields, including functional energy materials, biological systems, and molecular quantum information science. Coherences encode critical information about the phase and dynamics of a system, and their interaction with its environment. Particularly, the ultrafast charge transfer process between electron donor and acceptor species in functional energy materials is influenced by vibronic coherences. A key limitation arises from the dephasing of coherences due to dissipation, causing loss of information and limiting applications of molecular systems. Extending and controlling coherence lifetimes would enable the rational design of smarter materials with optimised properties. Here we introduce a novel idea using chirped excitations as a pathway to extend quantum coherence lifetimes, enhancing their robustness against dissipation. A detailed analysis of the light-induced molecular quantum dynamics and wave packet evolution from first-principles models constructed at the donor-acceptor heterojunction of an organic photovoltaic blend is discussed. We demonstrate that tuning the chirp of the excitation pulse, vibronic coherence lifetimes can be extended up to the picosecond timescale. Chirped excitations also enable tunable spatial localisation of the induced wave packet, with localisation controlled by the chirp intensity. These effects are observed consistently across different donor-acceptor adducts selected from the molecular dynamics structure of the blend. Our results introduce a new degree of freedom for coherent control in molecular systems, offering a promising pathway toward the development of advanced functional energy materials and applications in molecular quantum information science.

The proposed structure comprises a single molecule within a plasmonic cavity, coupled to a 2D photonic crystal resonator. In this paper, we theoretically identify the ability of the scheme through calculating the second-order correlation function g2 (0) for four different coupling regimes. We demonstrate the quantum paths and the destructive interference mechanism through the selection of efficient and preferred basis. Furthermore, we find that the unconventional photon blockade effects can occur in weak molecular optomechanics coupling. This structure holds the potential to serve as an integrated single-photon source for quantum networks at room temperature.

   Combinatorial Optimization Problems
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Combinatorial optimization is of general interest for both theoretical study and real-world applications. Fast-developing quantum algorithms provide a different perspective on solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired tensor-network-based algorithm for general locally constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our algorithm constructs a Hamiltonian for the problem of interest, effectively mapping it to a quantum problem, then encodes the constraints directly into a tensor network state and solves the optimal solution by evolving the system to the ground state of the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate our algorithm with the open-pit mining problem, which results in a quadratic asymptotic time complexity. Our numerical results show the effectiveness of this construction and potential applications in further studies for general combinatorial optimization problems.

TI Noiseless linear amplifiers for multimode states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The entanglement structure between different frequency components within broadband quantum light pulses, forged at entanglement creation, represents a promising route to the practical delivery of many multipartite quantum information applications. However, the scalability of such applications is largely limited by the entanglement decoherence caused by photon loss. One promising method to combat such losses is noiseless linear amplification. However, while there have been various procedures that implement noiseless linear amplification on single-mode states, no realization has thus far been proposed for noiseless linear amplification on quantum states carrying a multimode structure. In this work we close this gap, proposing a noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) with photon catalysis (PC), namely, the PC-NLA. Constructing a multimode version of an existing NLA that uses quantum scissors (QS), the QS-NLA, we then show how the PC-NLA is compatible with the QS-NLA, even though the former uses half the physical resources of the latter. We then apply our multimode NLA frameworks to the problem of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement distillation, determining how the multimode structure of the entanglement impacts the performance of the NLAs. Different from single-mode NLA analyses, we find that a multimode NLA is only effective as a CV entanglement distillation strategy when the channel loss is beyond some threshold-a threshold largely dependent on the multimode structure. The results provided here will be valuable for real-world implementations of multipartite quantum information applications that utilize complex entanglement structure within broadband light pulses.

TI Exact Ansatz of Fermion-Boson Systems for a Quantum Device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present an exact Ansatz for the eigenstate problem of mixed fermion-boson systems that can be implemented on quantum devices. Based on a generalization of the electronic contracted Schr & ouml;dinger equation (CSE), our approach guides a trial wave function to the ground state of any arbitrary mixed Hamiltonian by directly measuring residuals of the mixed CSE on a quantum device. Unlike density functional and coupled cluster theories applied to electron-phonon or electron-photon systems, the accuracy of our approach is not limited by the unknown exchange-correlation functional or the uncontrolled form of the exponential Ansatz. To test the performance of the method, we study the TavisCummings model, commonly used in polaritonic quantum chemistry. Our results demonstrate that the CSE is a powerful tool in the development of quantum algorithms for solving general fermion-boson many-body problems.

TI Convergence Guarantees for Discrete Mode Approximations to Non-Markovian
   Quantum Baths
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Markovian effects are important in modeling the behavior of open quantum systems arising in solid-state physics, quantum optics as well as in study of biological and chemical systems. The non-Markovian environment is often approximated by discrete bosonic modes, thus mapping it to a Lindbladian or Hamiltonian simulation problem. While systematic constructions of such modes have been previously proposed, the resulting approximation lacks rigorous and general convergence guarantees. In this Letter, we show that under some physically motivated assumptions on the system-environment interaction, the finite-time dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system computed with a sufficiently large number of modes is guaranteed to converge to the true result. Furthermore, we show that this approximation error typically falls off polynomially with the number of modes. Our results lend rigor to classical and quantum algorithms for approximating non-Markovian dynamics.

TI Experimental anonymous quantum conferencing
SO OPTICA
AB Anonymous quantum conference key agreement (AQCKA) allows a group of users within a network to establish a shared cryptographic key without revealing their participation. Although this can be achieved using bipartite primitives alone, it is costly in the number of network rounds required. By allowing the use of multi -partite entanglement, there is a substantial efficiency improvement. We experimentally implement the AQCKA task in a six -user quantum network using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state entanglement and obtain a significant resource cost reduction in line with theory when compared to a bipartite -only approach. We also demonstrate that the protocol retains an advantage in a four -user scenario with finite key effects taken into account.

TI Action quantum speed limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce action quantum speed limits (QSLs) as a family of bounds on the minimal time to connect two states that, unlike the usual geometric approach, crucially depend on how the path is traversed, i.e., on the instantaneous speed. The two approaches provide consistent bounds when the instantaneous speed is optimized along a fixed path and we demonstrate this explicitly for the case of a thermalizing qubit employing techniques from optimal control theory. In addition, we critically analyze the interpretation of QSLs based on different choices of metric establishing that, in general, these open-system QSL times provide an indication of optimality with respect to the geodesic path, rather than necessarily being indicative of an achievable minimal time.

TI Review of vulnerabilities in quantum hardware
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB As quantum systems move towards practical deployment, there is a need to prioritize research focused on security risks and mitigation strategies. This paper presents the current literature on vulnerabilities in different hardware implementations of quantum computers and categorizes vulnerabilities based on underlying qubit technology. The review also examines attack methodology, source, impact and mitigation strategies for two types of hardware vulnerabilities: crosstalk and side channel attacks. The aim of this paper is to provide an understanding of the evolution of quantum vulnerability research at hardware level and to highlight the need to implement security into the design of quantum computers from its early stages.

TI Quantum combinatorial optimization beyond the variational paradigm:
   Simple schedules for hard problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and maximum 2-satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.

AB Manually debugging quantum programs is a difficult and time-intensive process. In this paper, we introduce an automated debugging technique, based on delta debugging and property-based testing, for quantum programs. Our technique automatically identifies the changes made within an update to a quantum program that cause a property-based regression test to fail. To evaluate our technique, we inject faults and semantic preserving changes into three quantum algorithms. We discuss the viability and efficacy of our approach after measuring the percentage of faults and semantic preserving changes. Our results indicate that our method has a high true positive (called sensitivity) and true negative rate (called specificity) and is robust in terms of the amount of changes introduced to the program. Moreover, the sensitivity of the method increases significantly with the number of properties. While the specificity remains stable when increasing the number of properties and inputs.

TI Anomalous Long-Distance Coherence in Critically Driven Cavity Magnonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Developing quantum networks necessitates coherently connecting distant systems via remote strong coupling. Here, we demonstrate long-distance coherence in cavity magnonics operating in the linear regime. By locally setting the cavity near critical coupling with traveling photons, nonlocal magnon-photon coherence is established via strong coupling over a 2-m distance. We observe two anomalies in this longdistance coherence: first, the coupling strength oscillates twice the period of conventional photon-mediated couplings; second, clear mode splitting is observed within the cavity linewidth. Both effects cannot be explained by conventional coupled-mode theory, which reveals the tip of an iceberg of photon-mediated coupling in systems under critical driving. Our Letter shows the potential of using critical phenomena for harnessing long-distance coherence in distributed systems.

TI Variational quantum linear solver with a dynamic ansatz
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms have found success in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era owing to their hybrid quantum-classical approach which mitigate the problems of noise in quantum computers. In our paper, we introduce the dynamic ansatz in the variational quantum linear solver for a system of linear algebraic equations. In this improved algorithm, the number of layers in the hardware efficient ansatz circuit is evolved, starting from a small and gradually increasing until convergence of the solution is reached. We demonstrate the algorithm advantage in comparison to the standard static ansatz by utilizing fewer quantum resources and with a smaller quantum depth on average in the presence and absence of quantum noise and in cases when the number of qubits or condition number of the system matrices are increased. The numbers of iterations and layers can be altered by a switching parameter. The performance of the algorithm in using quantum resources is quantified by a newly defined metric.

TI Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in
   holographic two-dimensional CFTs
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba & ntilde;ados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.

In this paper we use the CP decomposition to study unitary equivalence of higher order tensors and construct several invariants of local unitary equivalence for general higher order tensors. Based on this new method, we study the coefficient tensors of 3-qubit states and obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion for local unitary equivalence of general tripartite states in terms of the CP decomposition. We also generalize this method to obtain some invariants of local unitary equivalence for general multi-partite qudits.

TI Real-time non-adiabatic dynamics in the one-dimensional Holstein model:
   Trajectory-based vs exact methods
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We benchmark a set of quantum-chemistry methods, including multitrajectory Ehrenfest, fewest-switches surface-hopping, and multiconfigurational-Ehrenfest dynamics, against exact quantum-many-body techniques by studying real-time dynamics in the Holstein model. This is a paradigmatic model in condensed matter theory incorporating a local coupling of electrons to Einstein phonons. For the two-site and three-site Holstein model, we discuss the exact and quantum-chemistry methods in terms of the Born-Huang formalism, covering different initial states, which either start on a single Born-Oppenheimer surface, or with the electron localized to a single site. For extended systems with up to 51 sites, we address both the physics of single Holstein polarons and the dynamics of charge-density waves at finite electron densities. For these extended systems, we compare the quantum-chemistry methods to exact dynamics obtained from time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations with local basis optimization (DMRG-LBO). We observe that the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method, in general, only captures the ultrashort time dynamics accurately. In contrast, the surface-hopping method with suitable corrections provides a much better description of the long-time behavior but struggles with the short-time description of coherences between different Born-Oppenheimer states. We show that the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest method yields a significant improvement over the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method and can be converged to the exact results in small systems with moderate computational efforts. We further observe that for extended systems, this convergence is slower with respect to the number of configurations. Our benchmark study demonstrates that DMRG-LBO is a useful tool for assessing the quality of the quantum-chemistry methods.

This paper introduces the concept of quantum anonymous secret sharing (QASS) to enhance the practicality of such protocols. We propose a QASS protocol leveraging W states, ensuring both recover -security and anonymity of shared secrets. Our protocol undergoes rigorous evaluation verifying their accuracy and fortifying their security against scenarios involving the active adversary. Additionally, acknowledging the imperfections inherent in real -world communication channels, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of protocol security and efficacy in noisy quantum networks. Our investigations reveal that W states exhibit good performance in mitigating noise interference, making them apt for practical applications.

TI Ultratunable Quantum Frequency Conversion in Photonic Crystal Fiber

AB Quantum frequency conversion of single photons between wavelength bands is a key enabler to realizing widespread quantum networks. We demonstrate the quantum frequency conversion of a heralded 1551 nm photon to any wavelength within an ultrabroad (1226-1408 nm) range in a group-velocity-symmetric photonic crystal fiber, covering over 150 independent frequency bins. The target wavelength is controlled by tuning only a single pump laser wavelength. We find internal, and total, conversion efficiencies of 12 (1)% and 1.4(2)%, respectively. For the case of converting 1551 to 1300 nm we measure a heralded g((2))(0) = 0.25(6) for converted light from an input with g((2))(0) = 0.034(8). We expect that this photonic crystal fiber can be used for myriad quantum networking tasks.

From the simulated excited states, 'Bright', 'Spike', and 'Dark' defect configurations are classified based on their absorption spectrum features. Furthermore, machine learning molecular dynamics simulation provides insight into the possible diffusion mechanism of Ci and NV, showing that Ci can diffuse away or recombine with NV.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Achieving a broadband nonreciprocal device without gain and any external bias is very challenging and highly desirable for modern photonic technologies and quantum networks. Here we theoretically propose a passive and magnetic -free all -optical isolator for a femtosecond laser pulse by exploiting a new mechanism of unidirectional self-induced transparency, obtained with a nonlinear medium followed by a normal absorbing medium at one side. The transmission contrast between the forward and backward directions can reach 14.3 dB for a 2 pi - 5 fs laser pulse. The 20 dB bandwidth is about 56 nm, already comparable with a magneto -optical isolator. This work provides a new mechanism which may benefit non-magnetic isolation of ultrashort laser pulses.

FLW has proven to produce photonic integrated circuits with innovative design in a deterministic way for several applications, including quantum photonics and microfluidics. Although direct laser writing of waveguides has been extensively studied, there is still an intense search for methods to produce waveguides with lower losses and higher optical quality, because improvements in this sense will impact photonic research and technology. In this work, straight waveguides were directly inscribed into Eagle XG glass samples in a single process step at fabrication depths up to 370 mu m. The propagation loss and the mode profile for single-mode waveguides were obtained. The laser pulse energy threshold that triggers the optical breakdown as a function of the depth was measured and used to study its relationship with the resulting waveguide optical properties. A trend between the waveguide losses and the observed pulse energy threshold for optical breakdown was found, which is connected with the microscope objective spherical aberration. It can be useful for finding the best conditions for producing low-loss waveguides. Compared to the waveguides written with the corrected pulses, propagation losses up to 2.5 times smaller were observed in our experiments when applying the strategy presented here. Therefore, by taking advantage of the inherent spherical aberration, the FLW technique can be made capable of much more at even higher intensities than previously possible.

TI Simulation of open quantum systems via low-depth convex unitary
   evolutions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating physical systems on quantum devices is one of the most promising applications of quantum technology. Current quantum approaches to simulating open quantum systems are still practically challenging on NISQ-era devices, because they typically require ancilla qubits and extensive controlled sequences. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum -classical approach for simulating a class of open system dynamics called random -unitary channels. These channels naturally decompose into a series of convex unitary evolutions, which can then be efficiently sampled and run as independent circuits. The method does not require deep ancilla frameworks and thus can be implemented with lower noise costs. We implement simulations of open quantum systems up to dozens of qubits and with large channel ranks.

TI Calorimetry of a phase slip in a Josephson junction
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Josephson junctions are a central element in superconducting quantum technology; in these devices, irreversibility arises from abrupt slips of the quantum phase difference across the junction. This phase slip is often visualized as the tunnelling of a flux quantum in the transverse direction to the superconducting weak link, which produces dissipation. Here we detect the instantaneous heat release caused by a phase slip in a Josephson junction, signalled by an abrupt increase in the local electronic temperature in the weak link and subsequent relaxation back to equilibrium. Beyond the advance in experimental quantum thermodynamics of observing heat in an elementary quantum process, our approach could allow experimentally investigating the ubiquity of dissipation in quantum devices, particularly in superconducting quantum sensors and qubits.

TI Fast scrambling dynamics and many-body localization transition in an
   all-to-all disordered quantum spin model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the quantum thermalization and information scrambling dynamics of an experimentally realizable quantum spin model with homogeneous XX-type all-to-all interactions and random local potentials. We identify the thermalization-localization transition by changing the disorder strength, under a proper all-to-all interaction strength. The scrambling dynamics in the localization phase shows behaviors that are distinct from that of local models. The operator scrambling grows almost equally fast in the two phases. In the thermal phase, we show that fast scrambling is exhibited without appealing to the semiclassical limit. We also briefly discuss the experimental realization of the model using superconducting qubit quantum simulators.

TI Performance Analysis of Diverse Active Queue Management Algorithms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Congestion is a problem which can affect a computer's network performance, typically occurring when the available resources of the network cannot deal with arriving packets, thus deteriorating performance. Many research studies have acknowledged various Active Queue Management (AQM) methods to alleviate congested networks in an attempt to improve resource management and performance. However, the performance of AQM methods differs significantly and, more importantly, can be influenced by the level of congestion (light, moderate, or heavy). This paper empirically compares three different AQM methods, Curvilinear Random Early Detection (CLRED), Three-section Random Early Detection (TRED) based on nonlinear RED and Enhanced Adaptive Gentle Random Early Detection (Enhanced AGRED), to identify which method most effectively manages congestion in a single queue node system and also at a router buffer in a queueing network system. This router buffer may have more arriving packets than the departing packet. These methods are compared based on distinctive criteria including packet arrival probability, maximum packet-dropping probability and packet arrival probability (Alpha 1 or alpha 1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha1$$\end{document} ), among others. The comparisons suggest that Enhanced AGRED provides better performance results than CLRED and TRED, with respect to mean queue length, average queueing delay, and overflow packet loss probability, especially when there is high congestion, and for these performance measures, the most satisfactory results are obtained for Enhanced AGRED when the value of maximum packet-dropping probability is set to the smallest given value. In addition, this paper presents the Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in Networks to protect data traffic against conventional and quantum attacks.

TI Advances in Energy Storage, AI Optimisation, and Cybersecurity for
   Electric Vehicle Grid Integration
SO ENERGIES
AB The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids (SGs) is reshaping both energy systems and mobility infrastructures. This review presents a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary synthesis of current technologies, methodologies, and challenges associated with EV-SG interaction. Unlike prior reviews that address these aspects in isolation, this work uniquely connects three critical pillars: (i) the evolution of energy storage technologies, including lithium-ion, second-life, and hybrid systems; (ii) optimisation and predictive control techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time energy management and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination; and (iii) cybersecurity risks and post-quantum solutions required to safeguard increasingly decentralised and data-intensive grid environments. The novelty of this review lies in its integrated perspective, highlighting how emerging innovations, such as federated AI models, blockchain-secured V2G transactions, digital twin simulations, and quantum-safe cryptography, are converging to overcome existing limitations in scalability, resilience, and interoperability. Furthermore, we identify underexplored research gaps, such as standardisation of bidirectional communication protocols, regulatory inertia in V2G market participation, and the lack of unified privacy-preserving data architectures. By mapping current advancements and outlining a strategic research roadmap, this article provides a forward-looking foundation for the development of secure, flexible, and grid-responsive EV ecosystems. The findings support policymakers, engineers, and researchers in advancing the technical and regulatory landscape necessary to scale EV-SG integration within sustainable smart cities.

   dual-comb-based asynchronous linear optical sampling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrated an ultrafast time-resolved measurement method operating at the single-photon level and employing a two-color comb-based asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS) setup. We harnessed the two-color ASOPS photon counting approach to achieve long-term averaging of the ultralow intensity signal with a synchronized optical trigger signal, which minimizes residual timing jitter between the two combs. A pulse-width limited picosecond cross-correlation signal was successfully obtained with a power level of <1 photon/pulse. This approach enables the thorough study of ultrafast time-resolved detection of entangled photon pairs, quantum mechanical correlations in the time-frequency domain and finds wide use in optical quantum technology.

TI Experimental quantification of the robustness of adiabatic rapid passage
   for quantum state inversion in semiconductor quantum dots
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) is demonstrated in a single In(Ga)As quantum dot (QD) over a wide range of laser tuning relative to the exciton transition energy to assess the level of robustness of this quantum state inversion gate for practical QD systems. Our experiments indicate a drop in exciton inversion by only 5% for a detuning of 9.3 meV, indicating accessible detunings that span the typical inhomogeneous broadening of self-assembled QD ensembles. Our findings indicate that ARP is an ideal control protocol for synchronous triggering of quantum light sources for applications in photonic quantum technology.

TI SU(2)-Symmetric Exactly Solvable Models of Two Interacting Qubits
SO PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a two-qubit model derived from an SU(2)-symmetric 4x4 Hamiltonian. The resulting model is physically significant and, due to the SU(2) symmetry, is exactly solvable in both time-independent and time-dependent cases. Using the formal, general form of the related time evolution operator, the time dependence of the entanglement level for certain initial conditions is examined within the Rabi and Landau-Majorana-St & uuml;ckelberg-Zener scenarios. The potential for applying this approach to higher-dimensional Hamiltonians to develop more complex exactly solvable models of interacting qubits is also highlighted.

TI Generation of entangled photon pairs from a silicon bichromatic photonic
   crystal cavity
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Integrated quantum photonics leverages the on-chip generation of nonclassical states of light to realize key functionalities of quantum devices. Typically, the generation of such nonclassical states relies on whispering gallery mode resonators, such as integrated optical micro-rings, which enhance the efficiency of the underlying spontaneous nonlinear processes. While these kinds of resonators excel in maximizing either the temporal confinement or the spatial overlap between different resonant modes, they are usually associated with large mode volumes, imposing an intrinsic limitation on the efficiency and footprint of the device. Here, we engineer a source of time-energy entangled photon pairs based on a silicon photonic crystal cavity, implemented in a fully CMOS-compatible platform. In this device, resonantly enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing converts pump photon pairs into signal/idler photon pairs under the energy-conserving condition in the telecommunication C-band. The design of the resonator is based on an effective bichromatic confinement potential, allowing it to achieve up to nine close-to-equally spaced modes in frequency, while preserving small mode volumes, and the whole chip, including grating couplers and access waveguides, is fabricated in a single run on a silicon-on-insulator platform. Besides demonstrating efficient photon pair generation, we also implement a Franson-type interference experiment, demonstrating entanglement between signal and idler photons with a Bell inequality violation exceeding five standard deviations. The high generation efficiency combined with the small device footprint in a CMOS-compatible integrated structure opens a pathway toward the implementation of compact quantum light sources in all-silicon photonic platforms.(c) 2024 Author(s).

We propose quantum secret sharing with the capabilities in designing of access structures more flexibly and realizing higher efficiency beyond those of classical secret sharing, that can distribute some shares before a given secret.

TI IoT-Cloud Integration Security: A Survey of Challenges, Solutions, and
   Directions
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The confluence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing heralds a paradigm shift in data-driven applications, promising unprecedented insights and automation across critical sectors like healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. However, this transformative synergy introduces a complex tapestry of security vulnerabilities stemming from the intrinsic resource limitations of IoT devices and the inherent complexities of cloud infrastructures. This survey delves into the escalating threats-from conventional data breaches and Application programming interface (API) exploits to emerging vectors such as adversarial artificial intelligence (AI), quantum-resistant attacks, and sophisticated insider threats-that imperil the integrity and resilience of IoT-cloud ecosystems. We critically evaluated existing security paradigms, including encryption, access control, and service-level agreements, juxtaposed with cutting-edge approaches like AI-driven anomaly detection, blockchain-secured frameworks, and lightweight cryptographic solutions. By systematically mapping the landscape of security challenges and mitigation strategies, this work identified the following critical research imperatives: the development of standardized, end-to-end security architectures, the integration of post-quantum cryptography for resource-constrained IoT devices, and the fortification of resource isolation in multi-tenant cloud environments. A comprehensive comparative analysis of prior research, coupled with an in-depth case study on IoT-cloud security within the healthcare domain, illuminates the practical challenges and innovative solutions crucial for real-world deployment. Ultimately, this survey advocates for the development of scalable, adaptive security frameworks that leverage the synergistic power of AI and blockchain, ensuring the secure and efficient evolution of IoT-cloud ecosystems in the face of evolving cyber threats.

TI Variational approach to learning photonic unitary operators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Structured light, light tailored in its internal degrees of freedom, has become topical in numerous quantum and classical information processing protocols. In this work, we harness the high dimensional nature of structured light modulated in the transverse spatial degree of freedom to realize an adaptable scheme for learning unitary operations. Our approach borrows from concepts in variational quantum computing, where a search or optimization problem is mapped onto the task of finding a minimum ground state energy for a given energy/goal function. We achieve this by a pseudo-random walk procedure over the parameter space of the unitary operation, implemented with optical matrix-vector multiplication enacted on arrays of Gaussian modes by exploiting the partial Fourier transforming capabilities of a cylindrical lens in the transverse degree of freedom for the measurement. We outline the concept theoretically, and experimentally demonstrate that we are able to learn optical unitary matrices for dimensions d = 2, 4, 8, and 16 with average fidelities of >90%. Our work advances high dimensional information processing and can be adapted to both process and quantum state tomography of unknown states and channels.

TI Anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional valleytronic materials
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) can be used to explore and utilize valley degrees of freedom in materials, which has potential applications in fields such as information storage, quantum computing and optoelectronics. AVHE exists in two-dimensional (2D) materials possessing valley polarization (VP), and such 2D materials usually belong to the hexagonal honeycomb lattice. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve valleytronic materials with VP that are more readily to be synthesized and applicated experimentally. In this topical review, we introduce recent developments on realizing VP as well as AVHE through different methods, i.e., doping transition metal atoms, building ferrovalley heterostructures and searching for ferrovalley materials. Moreover, 2D ferrovalley systems under external modulation are also discussed. 2D valleytronic materials with AVHE demonstrate excellent performance and potential applications, which offer the possibility of realizing novel low-energy-consuming devices, facilitating further development of device technology, realizing miniaturization and enhancing functionality of them.

TI Lattice-Based Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme and Its Applications: A
   Survey
SO ELECTRONICS
AB As the most popular cryptographic scheme in the post-quantum field, lattices have received extensive attention and research. Not only do they provide quantum-resistant security, they also enable the construction of complex applications. Currently, lattice cryptography schemes based on different difficult problems have been applied in different fields. The threshold secret sharing (TSS) scheme is an important field of cryptography and has important application value and development prospects in key protection, secure multi-party computation, privacy protection, etc. However, with the rapid development of quantum computing, many existing cryptography-underlying technologies are facing huge difficulties and challenges. Therefore, post-quantum TSS has important research significance and value for the future development of cryptography. In this paper, we summarize the existing secret sharing schemes based on lattice-hard problems and the relevant applications of these schemes in the post-quantum realm. We classify existing lattice-based TSS according to different functions and introduce typical solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper on lattice-based TSS schemes.

TI Rh19-: A high-spin super-octahedron cluster
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Probing atomic clusters with magic numbers is of supreme importance but challenging in cluster science. Pronounced stability of a metal cluster often arises from coincident geometric and electronic shell closures. However, transition metal clusters do not simply abide by this constraint. Here, we report the finding of a magic-number cluster Rh-19(-) with prominent inertness in the sufficient gas-collision reactions. Photoelectron spectroscopy experiments and global-minimum structure search have determined the geometry of Rh19- to be a regular O-h-[Rh@Rh-12@ Rh-6](-) with unusual high-spin electronic configuration. The distinct stability of such a strongly magnetic cluster Rh-19(-) consisting of a nonmagnetic element is fully unveiled on the basis of its unique bonding nature and superatomic states. The 1-nanometer-sized O-h-Rh-19(-) cluster corresponds to a fragment of the face-centered cubic lattice of bulk rhodium but with altered magnetism and electronic property. This cluster features exceptional electron-spin state isomers confirmed in photoelectron spectra and suggests potential applications in atomically precise manufacturing involving spintronics and quantum computing.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical neural network with deep residual learning
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Inspired by the success of classical neural networks, there has been tremendous effort to develop classical effective neural networks into quantum concept. In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum- classical neural network with deep residual learning (Res-HQCNN) is proposed. We firstly analyse how to connect residual block structure with a quantum neural network, and give the corresponding training algorithm. At the same time, the advantages and disadvantages of transforming deep residual learning into quantum concept are provided. As a result, the model can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, analogue to the backpropagation in classical neural networks. To explore the effectiveness of Res-HQCNN , we perform extensive experiments for quantum data with or without noisy on classical computer. The experimental results show the Res-HQCNN performs better to learn an unknown unitary transformation and has stronger robustness for noisy data, when compared to state of the arts. Moreover, the possible methods of combining residual learning with quantum neural networks are also discussed. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB Intelligent technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are set to impact society, industries, and governments by changing organizational processes and interactions between citizens and organizations as well as by increasing economic, social, and political opportunities and risks. Although academia is closely following these trends, more research is needed to delve into the details of how different types of intelligent technologies shape the way government organizations around the world operate and to provide insights based on empirical evidence. This introductory article to the Special Issue "Intelligent Technologies, Governments, and Citizens", which includes the best papers presented at the 23rd Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research (dg.o 2022), aims to understand the opportunities and benefits as well as the challenges and risks associated with the implementation of intelligent technologies in government organizations. The ultimate goal of the article is to propose some ideas that contribute to the conversation about the use of intelligent technologies in government and that, therefore, add to the ongoing research agenda on this topic.

TI Fabrication of ultra-high-Q Ta2O5 microdisks by
   photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is widely recognized as a promising material platform for photonic integration. This is primarily attributed to its exceptional properties including large bandgap of 3.8 eV, broad transparency window ranging from 300 nm to 8000 nm, high nonlinear refractive index of similar to 7.2 x 10-19 m2/W, low optical loss, moderate refractive index of 2.05, low intrinsic material stress, compatibility with CMOS technology, and high solubility for rare-earth ions. However, dry etching of Ta2O5 is challenging and typically results in sidewall roughness with substantial scattering losses. Here, we report on fabrication of a high-Q whispering gallery mode (WGM) microdisk with a diameter of 120 mu m and a loaded Q factor of 1.92 x 106 by femtosecond laser photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) on amorphous Ta2O5 film. Thanks to the suppression of sidewall scattering, the loaded Q factor is two orders of magnitude higher than the best reported value in dispersion engineered Ta2O5 microresonators.

TI Multi-wavelength dual-polarization optical unitary processor using
   integrated multi-plane light converter
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB An optical unitary processor (OUP) is a programmable photonic circuit to achieve arbitrary unitary operation for various applications, including optical communication, deep learning, and quantum computing. Conventionally, OUPs are implemented by cascading 2 x 2 reconfigurable interferometers, but this scheme cannot easily be extended to multiple wavelength and polarization channels due to the strict requirement to employ 50:50 beam splitters. Here, we demonstrate that an OUP using multiport directional couplers (DCs) can realize independent unitary conversion of multiple wavelength and polarization channels simultaneously. This OUP is based on the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) principle, which does not require a specific transformation at each layer, unlike the conventional scheme. Thanks to this unique robustness of the MPLC method and strong wavelength/polarization dependence of multiport DCs, we numerically show that independent unitary transformations can be applied to up to 16 channels (2 polarization x 4 wavelengths) using a single device.

TI Investigating magnetic van der Waals materials using data-driven
   approaches
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB In this work, we investigate magnetic monolayers of the form A(i)A(ii)B(4)X(8) based on the well-known intrinsic topological magnetic van der Waals (vdW) material MnBi2Te4 (MBT) using first-principles calculations and machine learning techniques. We select an initial subset of structures to calculate the thermodynamic properties, electronic properties, such as the band gap, and magnetic properties, such as the magnetic moment and magnetic order using density functional theory (DFT). Data analytics approaches are used to gain insight into the microscopic origin of materials' properties. The dependence of materials' properties on chemical composition is also explored. For example, we find that the formation energy and magnetic moment depend largely on A and B sites whereas the band gap depends on all three sites. Finally, we employ machine learning tools to accelerate the search for novel vdW magnets in the MBT family with optimized properties. This study creates avenues for rapidly predicting novel materials with desirable properties that could enable applications in spintronics, optoelectronics, and quantum computing.

TI Metasurface-Based Quantum Searcher on a Silicon-On-Insulator Chip
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Optical analog computing has natural advantages of parallel computation, high speed and low energy consumption over traditional digital computing. To date, research in the field of on-chip optical analog computing has mainly focused on classical mathematical operations. Despite the advantages of quantum computing, on-chip quantum analog devices based on metasurfaces have not been demonstrated so far. In this work, based on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, we illustrated an on-chip quantum searcher with a characteristic size of 60 x 20 mu m(2). We applied classical waves to simulate the quantum search algorithm based on the superposition principle and interference effect, while combining it with an on-chip metasurface to realize modulation capability. The marked items are found when the incident waves are focused on the marked positions, which is precisely the same as the efficiency of the quantum search algorithm. The proposed on-chip quantum searcher facilitates the miniaturization and integration of wave-based signal processing systems.

TI A Valleytronic Diamond Transistor: Electrostatic Control of Valley
   Currents and Charge-State Manipulation of NV Centers
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The valley degree of freedom in many-valley semiconductors provides a new paradigm for storing and processing information in valleytronic and quantum-computing applications. Achieving practical devices requires all-electric control of long-lived valley-polarized states, without the use of strong external magnetic fields. Because of the extreme strength of the carbon-carbon bond, diamond possesses exceptionally stable valley states that provide a useful platform for valleytronic devices. Using ultrapure single-crystalline diamond, we demonstrate electrostatic control of valley currents in a dual-gate field-effect transistor, where the electrons are generated with a short ultraviolet pulse. The charge current and the valley current measured at the receiving electrodes are controlled separately by varying the gate voltages. We propose a model to interpret experimental data, based on drift-diffusion equations coupled through rate terms, with the rates computed by microscopic Monte Carlo simulations. As an application, we demonstrate valley-current charge-state modulation of nitrogen-vacancy centers.

TI Reconfigurable network for quantum transport simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We put forward a versatile, highly scalable, tunable electronic platform for the simulation of single-excitation quantum transport phenomena. Our system, comprising 10 state-of-the-art, fully reconfigurable electronic oscillators, is implemented by making use of functional blocks synthesized with operational amplifiers and passive linear electrical components. To test the robustness and precise control of our platform, we simulate different quantum transport protocols, such as the ballistic propagation of a single-excitation wave function in an ordered lattice, and its localization due to disorder. We implement the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to directly observe the emergence of topologically protected one-dimensional edge states. Furthermore, we present the realization of the so-called perfect transport protocol, a key milestone for the development of scalable quantum computing and communication. Finally, we show a simulation of the exciton dynamics in the B800 ring of the purple bacteria LH2 complex. The high fidelity of our simulations together with the low decoherence of our device make it a robust, versatile, and promising platform for the simulation of quantum transport phenomena.

TI Structural and electrical properties of SnTe nanoflakes and nanowires
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB SnTe is a topological crystalline insulator, hosting topologically non-trivial surface states with potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Nanowires, due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, offer an ideal geometry for measuring these states. However, distinction of conductance from these topological surface states from the trivial bulk is currently hindered by a high bulk carrier density. Due to the small dimensions of nanowires, accurate measurements of the carrier density in SnTe nanowires have been lacking. Here, we measure the carrier density in SnTe nanoflakes and nanowires using the Hall effect. We find that nanoflakes, which allow for easier device fabrication, exhibit carrier densities and mobilities comparable to those of nanowires grown under identical conditions. This suggests that nanoflakes can serve as reliable proxies for probing the electronic properties of nanowires. Additionally, we present a growth model explaining the formation mechanism of SnTe nanoflakes and nanowires. Together, these findings provide a foundation for systematic tuning of carrier density through growth parameter optimization.

TI Security Authentication Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks Based on
   NTRU
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have a wide range of applications, where issues related to data authentication and communication are critical for enhancing underwater resource utilization and ensuring secure data transmission. Sensor nodes face resource limitations and the threat of quantum computing attacks, making it challenging for traditional authentication protocols to balance security and computational efficiency. By employing the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) encryption scheme and incorporating Generalized One-Time Pad (GOTP) key encapsulation along with a node mobility model under ocean current environments, we propose a two-round mutual authentication protocol, named the NTRU-GOTP and Position-aware Authentication Protocol (NTRU-GOPA), to verify location information and enhance security. We verify the protocol's security using the random oracle model and analyze it through informal methods. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol is more secure and computationally efficient than existing methods. This method satisfies the requirements for defending against node capture and external network attacks, thereby making it suitable for complex and dynamic underwater network scenarios.

TI Realizing tunable Fermi level in SnTe by defect control
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The tuning of the Fermi level in tin telluride, a topological crystalline insulator, is essential for accessing its unique surface states and optimizing its electronic properties for applications such as spintronics and quantum computing. In this study, we demonstrate that the Fermi level in tin telluride can be effectively modulated by controlling the tin concentration during chemical vapor deposition synthesis. By introducing tin-rich conditions, we observed a blue shift in the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level peaks of both tin and tellurium, indicating an upward shift in the Fermi level. This shift is corroborated by a decrease in work function values measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming the suppression of Sn vacancies. Our findings provide a low-cost, scalable method to achieve tunable Fermi levels in tin telluride, offering a significant advancement in the development of materials with tailored electronic properties for next-generation technological applications.

TI Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths
   based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as-0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21 mu m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.

TI Topological Directional Coupler
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Interferometers and beam splitters are fundamental building blocks for photonic neuromorphic and quantum computing machinery. In waveguide-based photonic integrated circuits, beam-splitting is achieved with directional couplers that rely on transition regions where the waveguides are adiabatically bent to suppress back-reflection. In this study, a novel, compact approach for introducing guided mode coupling is presented. Along the multimodal domain wall between topological photonic crystals, the photonic spin is conserved to suppress back-reflection, and the topological protection of the valley degree of freedom is relaxed to implement tunable beam splitting. Rapid advancements in chip-scale topological photonics suggest that the proposed simultaneous utilization of multiple topological degrees of freedom could benefit the development of novel photonic computing platforms.
   This study presents a novel, compact approach for introducing guided mode coupling. Along the multimodal domain wall between topological photonic crystals, the protection of the valley degree of freedom is relaxed to implement tunable mode coupling. Meanwhile, the photonic spin remains largely conserved, ensuring robust propagation. The demonstrated topological directional coupler can pave the way for highly compact photonic circuits. image

TI Study of half-metallic ferromagnetism and transport characteristics of
   double perovskites Sr2AIrO6 (A = Y, Lu, Sc) for
   spintronic applications
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The precise manipulation of electromagnetic and thermoelectric characteristics in the miniaturization of electronic devices offers a promising foundation for practical applications in quantum computing. Double perovskites characterized by stability, non-toxicity, and spin polarization, have emerged as appealing candidates for spintronic applications. This study explores the theoretical elucidation of the influence of iridium's 5d electrons on the magnetic characteristics of Sr(2)AIrO(6) (A = Y, Lu, Sc) with WIEN2k code. The determined formation energies confirm the thermodynamic stability while an analysis of band structure and the density of states (DOS) reveals a half-metallic ferromagnetic character. This characteristic is comprehensible through the analysis of exchange constants and exchange energies. The current analysis suggests that crystal field effects, a fundamental hybridization process and exchange energies contribute to the emergence of ferromagnetism due to electron-spin interactions. Finally, assessments of electrical and thermal conductivities, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, figure of merit and magnetic susceptibility are conducted to assess the potential of the investigated materials for the applications in thermoelectric devices.

TI On the effect of oxygen on the creation of colour centres in swift heavy
   ion-irradiated AlN
SO NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM
   INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS
AB We readdress the nature and creation mechanism of the defects absorbing at 4.7 eV in Swift Heavy Ion (SHI)irradiated AlN semiconductor. Irradiations are performed in different controlled atmospheres (vacuum, oxygen, helium or argon partial pressure) to investigate the coupled effects of (i) the synergy between electronic excitations (Se) and nuclear collisions (Sn) for point defect creation and (ii) SHI-induced impurity introduction/ diffusion into the AlN layer. We found that the synergy, previously reported, between Se and Sn for defect formation must also be related to the presence of oxygen during irradiation. At the same Se, the synergy parameter is indeed increased by up to two orders of magnitude during irradiation under O2 compared to irradiation under vacuum. By SHI irradiation and by a fine-tuning of the irradiation atmosphere, we then control the activation or inhibition of these light-emitted point defects (oxygen-vacancy complexes) which can be used as qubits for applications in quantum computing.

AB With surging interest in quantum computing, space applications, and ultra-fast superconducting processors, the need for compatible cryogenic memory systems is skyrocketing. Among several concurrent candidates for cryogenic data storage solutions, quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) devices have garnered immense interest due to having topologically protected variation-tolerant quantum states. QAHE cells, in addition to being a promising nonvolatile storage technology, have several unique properties that make them ideal for in-memory computing operations. In this work, we propose a novel in-memory computing mechanism by harnessing the intrinsic voltage addition property of a QAHE memory array, implemented using twisted bi-layer graphene (tBLG) on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In addition, we extensively explore and implement ternary arithmetic operations utilizing the series-connected Hall voltages across devices for the first time. We propose two schemes for in-memory ternary computing namely IMFE and IMSE, and demonstrate balanced scalar multiplication, dot product operations, and ternary half adder with QAHE memory array.

TI A quantum system control method based on enhanced reinforcement learning
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Traditional quantum system control methods often face different constraints, and are easy to cause both leakage and stochastic control errors under the condition of limited resources. Reinforcement learning has been proved as an efficient way to complete the quantum system control task. To learn a satisfactory control strategy under the condition of limited resources, a quantum system control method based on enhanced reinforcement learning (QSC-ERL) is proposed. The states and actions in reinforcement learning are mapped to quantum states and control operations in quantum systems. By using new enhanced neural networks, reinforcement learning can quickly achieve the maximization of long-term cumulative rewards, and a quantum state can be evolved accurately from an initial state to a target state. According to the number of candidate unitary operations, the three-switch control is used for simulation experiments. Compared with other methods, the QSC-ERL achieves close to 1 fidelity learning control of quantum systems, and takes fewer episodes to quantum state evolution under the condition of limited resources.

TI A quantum strategy to compute the jet quenching parameter
   (q)over-cap
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Jet quenching, the modification of the properties of a QCD jet when the parton cascade takes place inside a medium, is an intrinsically quantum process, where color coherence effects play an essential role. Despite a very significant progress in the last years, the simulation of a full quantum medium induced cascade remains inaccessible to classical Monte Carlo parton showers. In this situation, alternative formulations are worth being tried and the fast developments in quantum computing provide a very promising direction. The goal of this paper is to introduce a strategy to quantum simulate single particle momentum broadening, the simplest building block of jet quenching. Momentum broadening is the modification of the quark or gluon transverse momentum due interactions with the underlying medium, modeled as a QCD background field. At the lowest order in alpha(s) that we consider here, momentum broadening does not involve parton splittings and particle number is conserved, greatly simplifying the quantum algorithmic implementation. This quantity is, however, very relevant for the phenomenology of RHIC, LHC or the future EIC.

TI Quantum supremacy and quantum phase transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Demonstrating the ability of existing quantum platforms to perform certain computational tasks intractable to classical computers represents a cornerstone in quantum computing. Despite the growing number of such proposed "quantum supreme" tasks, it remains an important challenge to identify their direct applications. In this work, we describe how the approach proposed by Tangpanitanon et al. [arXiv:2002.11946] for demonstrating quantum supremacy in generic driven analog many-body systems, such as those found in cold atom and ion setups, can be extended to explore dynamical quantum phase transitions. We show how key quantum supremacy signatures, such as the divergence between the output distribution and the Porter Thomas distribution, can be used as effective order parameters. We apply this approach to a periodically driven disordered one-dimensional Ising model and show that we can accurately capture the transition between the driven thermalized and many-body localized phases. This approach also captures the transition towards the Floquet prethermalized regime for high-frequency driving. Revisiting quantum phases of matter under the light of the recent discussions about quantum supremacy draws a link between complexity theory and analog many-body systems.

TI Electron Beam Restructuring of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise as a solid state, van der Waals host of single photon emitters for on-chip quantum photonics. The B-center defect emitting at 436 nm is particularly compelling as it can be generated by electron beam irradiation. However, the emitter generation mechanism is unknown, the robustness of the method is variable, and it has only been applied successfully to thick flakes of hBN (>> 10 nm). Here, it is used in situ time-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of B-center generation. It is shown that the generation of B-centers is accompanied by quenching of a carbon-related emission at approximate to 305 nm and that both processes are rate-limited by electromigration of defects in the hBN lattice. It identifies problems that limit the efficacy and reproducibility of the emitter generation method and solve them using a combination of optimized electron beam parameters and hBN pre-and postprocessing treatments. It is achieved B-center quantum emitters in hBN flakes as thin as 8 nm, elucidate the mechanisms responsible for electron beam restructuring of quantum emitters in hBN, and gain insights toward the identification of the atomic structure of the B-center quantum emitter.

TI Quantum magnetism of spin qubits in S <bold>=</bold> 1/2 Cu(II)
   systems in discrete complexes, chains, and metal-organic frameworks
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB In the last decade, S = 1/2 systems of Cu(II) complexes and Cu(II) ions in the solid state have been found to exhibit slow magnetic relaxations. The mechanism driving this magnetic behavior is different from that of high spin single-molecule magnets and that of bulk/nanoparticle magnets. This behavior is related to spin qubits and is considered to be a new type of quantum magnetism. This review focuses on the magnetic relaxation (tau), spin-lattice relaxation (T-1), and spin-spin relaxation (T-2 or T-m) of isolated Cu(II) complexes, Cu(II) 1D-chains, and Cu(II)-doped metal-organic frameworks. Although these properties have been well studied in isolated Cu(II) systems, studies on systems that exhibit magnetic interactions are still elusive. With the aim of progressing toward the entanglement of spin states and quantum computing using spin qubits, a greater number of studies on molecule-based spin qubits that exhibit magnetic interactions will be conducted and will be of increasing importance from now on.

TI Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization With Quantum-Inspired Quantum Walks
   for Robust Image Security
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we propose a novel image cryptosystem that combines the adapted Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with a quantum-inspired Discrete-time Quantum Walk (DTQW). The proposed approach leverages the strengths of both PSO and DTQW, integrating them to achieve high security and efficiency in image encryption. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of this unique cryptosystem. While previous approaches have separately explored PSO or DTQW, our integration of these two techniques offers a novel and innovative approach. By employing chaotic sequences generated by a 3-D chaotic system and a controlled DTQW model, our cryptosystem demonstrates a high sensitivity to even slight changes in the original image. This sensitivity ensures that minor modifications in the plaintext lead to significant changes in the ciphertext, enhancing the system's resistance against attacks. Simulation outcomes prove that the proposed encryption mechanism has high security as well as high effectiveness.This makes it well-suited for practical implementation in a post-quantum computing era.

TI Investigation of the dynamic features of a moveable ultrahigh-Q
   nanocavity
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Although the approach of forming an ultrahigh-Q nanocavity via local refractive index tuning in a PC waveguide was proposed a decade ago, it has not yet been employed to realize a moveable ultrahigh-Q nanocavity, thereby the dynamic physics related to a moving resonator remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that a dynamicallyformed cavity is essentially moveable, so that we can use this nanocavity to trap, store, and transfer signal photons, enabling free photon control. For a high cavity moving speed, we find the trapped signal energy will radiate out of the moving cavity. We think this interesting phenomenon originates from Doppler-effect-induced resonant frequency split in a moving resonator and the accompanied change of energy capacity. In addition, we present an analytical model to reveal why and how the trapping and storing processes are accompanied by significant spectral bandwidth compression and dynamic wavelength conversion, which are critical for achieving dynamic ultrahigh-Q nanocavity. This approach may find application in photon memories, quantum computing, and controllable light-matter interactions.

TI Extremely long-range, high-temperature Josephson coupling across a
   half-metallic ferromagnet
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB The Josephson effect results from the coupling of two superconductors across a spacer such as an insulator, a normal metal or a ferromagnet to yield a phase coherent quantum state. However, in junctions with ferromagnetic spacers, very long-range Josephson effects have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate extremely long-range (micrometric) high-temperature (tens of kelvins) Josephson coupling across the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 combined with the superconducting cuprate YBa2Cu3O7. These planar junctions, in addition to large critical currents, display the hallmarks of Josephson physics, such as critical current oscillations driven by magnetic flux quantization and quantum phase locking effects under microwave excitation (Shapiro steps). The latter display an anomalous doubling of the Josephson frequency predicted by several theories. In addition to its fundamental interest, the marriage between high-temperature, dissipationless quantum coherent transport and full spin polarization brings opportunities for the practical realization of superconducting spintronics, and opens new perspectives for quantum computing.
   Josephson coupling over micrometres and at tens of kelvins is demonstrated across the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 combined with the superconducting cuprate YBa2Cu3O7.

TI Impact of graph structures for QAOA on MaxCut
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising method of solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing. QAOA on the MaxCut problem has been studied extensively on graphs with specific structure; however, little is known about the general performance of the algorithm on arbitrary graphs. In this paper, we investigate how different graph characteristics correlate with QAOA performance at depths at most three on the MaxCut problem for all connected non-isomorphic graphs with at most eight vertices. Some good predictors of QAOA success relate to graph symmetries, odd cycles, and density. For example, on eight vertex graphs, the average probability for selecting an optimal solution for graphs that contain no odd cycles after three iterations of QAOA is 60.6% compared to 48.2% for those that do. The data generated from these studies are shared in a publicly accessible database to serve as a benchmark for QAOA calculations and experiments. Knowing the relationship between structure and performance can be used to identify classes of combinatorial problems that are likely to exhibit a quantum advantage.

TI Low-dimensional solid-state single-photon emitters
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Solid-state single-photon emitters (SPEs) are attracting significant attention as fundamental components in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Low-dimensional materials-based SPEs (LD-SPEs) have drawn particular interest due to their high photon extraction efficiency, ease of integration with photonic circuits, and strong coupling with external fields. The accessible surfaces of LD materials allow for deterministic control over quantum light emission, while enhanced quantum confinement and light-matter interactions improve photon emissive properties. This perspective examines recent progress in LD-SPEs across four key materials: zero-dimensional (0D) semiconductor quantum dots, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes, two-dimensional (2D) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We explore their structural and photophysical properties, along with techniques such as spectral tuning and cavity coupling, which enhance SPE performance. Finally, we address future challenges and suggest strategies for optimizing LD-SPEs for practical quantum applications.

TI Electronic structure simulations in the cloud computing environment
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The transformative impact of modern computational paradigms and technologies, such as high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and cloud computing, has opened up profound new opportunities for scientific simulations. Scalable computational chemistry is one beneficiary of this technological progress. The main focus of this paper is on the performance of various quantum chemical formulations, ranging from low-order methods to high-accuracy approaches, implemented in different computational chemistry packages and libraries, such as NWChem, NWChemEx, Scalable Predictive Methods for Excitations and Correlated Phenomena, ExaChem, and Fermi-L & ouml;wdin orbital self-interaction correction on Azure Quantum Elements, Microsoft's cloud services platform for scientific discovery. We pay particular attention to the intricate workflows for performing complex chemistry simulations, associated data curation, and mechanisms for accuracy assessment, which is demonstrated with the Arrows automated workflow for high throughput simulations. Finally, we provide a perspective on the role of cloud computing in supporting the mission of leadership computational facilities.

TI Improving the convergence of an iterative algorithm for solving
   arbitrary linear equation systems using classical or quantum binary
   optimization
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Recent advancements in quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms have sparked renewed interest in binary optimization. These hardware and software innovations promise to revolutionize solution times for complex problems. In this work, we propose a novel method for solving linear systems. Our approach leverages binary optimization, making it particularly well-suited for problems with large condition numbers. We transform the linear system into a binary optimization problem, drawing inspiration from the geometry of the original problem and resembling the conjugate gradient method. This approach employs conjugate directions that significantly accelerate the algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by leveraging partial knowledge of the problem's intrinsic geometry, we can decompose the original problem into smaller, independent sub-problems. These sub-problems can be efficiently tackled using either quantum or classical solvers. Although determining the problem's geometry introduces some additional computational cost, this investment is outweighed by the substantial performance gains compared to existing methods.

TI Simulation of silicon quantum dots with diamond-channel by simplified ME
   model
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Developing novel silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) on conventional CMOS process is one of the most important technologies in Si quantum computing to realize multi-bit integration with a large scale. In this paper, an analysis model based on master equation and realized by Python code is established to predict and optimize the performance of fabricated diamond channel Si-QDs for potential circuit applications. The model can fast describe the I-V characteristics of devices both in qualitative and semi quantitative method. The inherent tunneling process of Si-QDs can be well simulated by introducing additional parameters and the contribution of neighboring states can be analyzed by setting global parameters. In addition, the calculation speed and accuracy can be readily balanced by modifying the setting parameters. The simulation results of the model are in good agreement with the experimental results at low temperature, which lays a foundation for the performance prediction, structure and process optimization of the Si-QDs for a large scale circuit applications.

TI Advanced SiGe:C HBTs at Cryogenic Temperatures and Their Compact
   Modeling With Temperature Scaling
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EXPLORATORY SOLID-STATE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICES AND
   CIRCUITS
AB The dc and ac performance of advanced SiGe:C heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) featuring transit frequency (f(T)) and maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)) of 300 and 500 GHz was characterized from 298 K down to 4.3 K. At 4.3 K, the transit frequency f(T) increases by 65% from measured 317 GHz (at 298 K) to 525 GHz. The increase of f(T) starts to saturate below 73 K. The physical reasons for the temperature variation of the experimental characteristics and simple model extensions for improving existing compact models (CMs) are discussed so that they can be used for estimating circuit design results at cryogenic temperatures (CTs). The model extensions are verified using experimental data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of modeling advanced SiGe:C HBTs for such a wide temperature range from deep cryogenic to room temperature (RT) (4.3-298 K).

TI Computational synthesis of 2D materials grown by chemical vapor
   deposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The exotic properties of 2D materials made them ideal candidates for applications in quantum computing, flexible electronics, and energy technologies. A major barrier to their adaptation for industrial applications is their controllable and reproducible growth at a large scale. A significant effort has been devoted to the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of wafer-scale highly crystalline monolayer materials through exhaustive trial-and-error experimentations. However, major challenges remain as the final morphology and growth quality of the 2D materials may significantly change upon subtle variation in growth conditions. Here, we introduced a multiscale/multiphysics model based on coupling continuum fluid mechanics and phase-field models for CVD growth of 2D materials. It connects the macroscale experimentally controllable parameters, such as inlet velocity and temperature, and mesoscale growth parameters such as surface diffusion and deposition rates, to morphology of the as-grown 2D materials. We considered WSe2 as our model material and established a relationship between the macroscale growth parameters and the growth coverage. Our model can guide the CVD growth of monolayer materials and paves the way to their synthesis-by-design.

TI Efficient Reconstruction in Key Recovery Attack on the QC-MDPC McEliece
   Cryptosystems
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Realization of large quantum computers is believed to jeopardize the security of cryptosystems relying on computational complexity of some mathematical problems, such as prime factorization and discrete logarithm problem. In this light, post-quantum cryptography, which is secure even after large quantum computers are realized, has been getting a lot of attention. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently started a standardization process for post-quantum cryptosystems. The McEliece public-key cryptosystem based on quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes is a promising candidate in this NIST standardization. Recently, attacks on the QC-MDPC McEliece scheme have extensively been investigated. The one proposed by Guo et al. exploits statistical information of decoding errors to reconstruct the secret key. This attack is twofold: (1) obtaining the distance spectrum of the secret key from statistical information of decoding errors, and (2) reconstructing the secret key from the distance spectrum. The bit-flipping decoding, which is commonly used to decode the QC-MDPC scheme, is considered to be vulnerable to the first part of this attack. Meanwhile the second part of the attack in the original version by Guo et al. requires considerable time because they use recursive search in this part. In this paper, we propose another method to reconstruct the secret key from the obtained distance spectrum on the basis of a method proposed by Fabri & ccaron; et al. They found that the key construction can be mapped to a clique problem in graph theory. Using their observation, we apply a breadth-first search algorithm to the key reconstruction. Numerical experiments show that our method reconstructs the secret key more efficiently than recursive search in the original key reconstruction proposed by Guo et al.

TI Single-shot discrimination of coherent states beyond the standard
   quantum limit
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The discrimination of coherent states is a key task in optical communication and quantum key distribution protocols. In this work, we use a photon-number-resolving detector, the transition-edge sensor, to discriminate binary-phase-shifted coherent states at a telecom wavelength. Owing to its dynamic range and high efficiency, we achieve a bit error probability that unconditionally exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL) by up to 7.7 dB. The improvement to the SQL persists for signals containing up to approximately seven photons on average and is achieved in a single shot (i.e., without measurement feedback), thus making our approach compatible with larger bandwidths.

TI A novel method for developing post-quantum cryptoschemes and a practical
   signature algorithm
SO APPLIED COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
AB PurposeThe practical purpose of this research is to propose a candidate for post-quantum signature standard that is free of significant drawback of the finalists of the NIST world competition, which consists in the large size of the signature and the public key. The practical purpose is to propose a fundamentally new method for development of algebraic digital signature algorithms.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed method is distinguished by the use of two different finite commutative associative algebras as a single algebraic support of the digital signature scheme and setting two different verification equation for a single signature. A single public key is computed as the first and the second public keys, elements of which are computed exponentiating two different generators of cyclic groups in each of the algebras.FindingsAdditionally, a scalar multiplication by a private integer is performed as final step of calculation of every element of the public key. The same powers and the same scalar values are used to compute the first and the second public keys by the same mathematic formulas. Due to such design, the said generators are kept in secret, providing resistance to quantum attacks. Two new finite commutative associative algebras, multiplicative group of which possesses four-dimensional cyclicity, have been proposed as a suitable algebraic support.Originality/valueThe introduced method is novel and includes new techniques for designing algebraic signature schemes that resist quantum attacks. On its base, a new practical post-quantum signature scheme with relatively small size of signature and public key is developed.

AB Data Processing Units (DPUs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially for use in conjunction with WarehouseScale Computers (WSCs) due to their ability to handle networking functions and data-centric workloads. Cost-performance, energy efficiency, network I/O, and batch processing workloads are important design factors for WSCs. Recent developments in AI and the never-ending increase in demand for data processing, cloud computing, and HPC set the optimisation of all those design factors as a high priority. DPUs can be utilised to achieve significant improvements in all those areas. This includes in-line network processing and upcoming enhanced security paradigms such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for quantum resilient communications or software-defined perimeters (SDP) for confidential computing implementations. Being P4-enabled and dRMT-based, DPUs allow for the reconfigurability of the network traffic without the need to change the hardware. However, the network performance on such devices is only sometimes deterministic since the actual traffic and the rules, both of which have to do with packet processing, are not known during compile time. In this paper, we envision how the network performance on DPUs can be accelerated. We describe the challenges that negatively impact the bandwidth and latency: the complex steering pipeline and the massive runtime needed to optimise. These challenges arise from the lack of information during compile time that is only known during runtime. Thus, we envision optimising during runtime by leveraging DPUs' reconfigurability on the network I/O. For this, we discuss the significant factors that must be considered to accelerate the network performance on such devices and we propose a solution for them.

TI AXI Hardware Accelerator for McEliece on FPGA Embedded Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB This article presents a McEliece hardware accelerator designed to be attached to an AXI infrastructure, addressing the efficient implementation of a flexible post-quantum cryptoprocessor on FPGA-based embedded systems. The complexity of the arithmetic circuits, combined with the adaptability to different applications by configurable parameters and run-time reprogramming, presents challenging issues for integrating the accelerator into these systems. The architecture of the accelerator is based on an application-specific instruction processor, which executes a set of constant-time instructions from an internal register file and memories. The role of the embedded processor is reduced to the initial writing of the instruction memory of the accelerator, the launching of the required set of instructions and configuring the Direct Memory Access controller to retrieve and store data from external memory. The run-time programming of the accelerator provides high flexibility in applications that requires post-quantum cryptography. A set of configurable parameters permits to adapt the security level of the McEliece encryption-decryption and the area-performance tradeoff imposed by the target device. Thus, the accelerator can be implemented from low-cost to high-end FPGAs by configuring the data-width of DMA buses or the parallelism level of the Galois-Field adder-multiplier. Experimental results show the accelerator is suited for implementing efficiently the highest security parameters of the Classic McEliece, achieving a McEliece decryption speed-up from x370 to x556 and occupying a small number of resources on a low-cost FPGA. In high-end FPGAs, the accelerator can be configured using higher security parameters not achieved in previous related cryptoprocessors, providing even higher accelerations.

AB Non-Hermitian theory in photonics revolutionized the understanding of optical resonators, thanks to the concept of quasi-normal modes (QNM) and to a deep revision of the Purcell factor expression. Counterintuitive effects followed, such as complex modal volumes and non-Lorentzian local density of states (LDOS) of QNMs. One of the fascinating aspects of non-Hermitian theory is the analogy with quantum mechanics for autoionizing electronic levels where the absorption cross'section is characterized by Fano lineshapes, caused by interference between the probability of absorption in the continuum and in the bound states. In photonics Fano lineshapes can arise from QNM normalization through the complex modal volume. The link between Fano lineshapes in photonic LDOS of QNMs and in the case of autoionizing states needs to be clarified. Here, by developing an analytical model based on the role of losses in the QNM normalization, they clarify the meaning of the phase of QNM normalized fields (qFano parameter),linking QNMs normalization to the concept of interference among the resonant and the leaky modes. This inspired the design of photonic crystal (PhC) cavity that exhibits LDOS with Fano character inside the itself, providing a proof of principle on how to mold the radiative lifetime by Purcell effect.
   Non-Hermitian theories are breaking new ground in quantum photonics applications with their unexpected predictions for the local density of states (LDOS). This paper shows how to mold the Purcell radiative rate by tailoring Fano lineshapes in the LDOS. This approach also highlights the link between the origin of Fano lineshapes in photonics and in quantum mechanics.image

TI Unveiling the Role of Electronic, Vibrational, and Optical Features of
   the 1T′ WSe2 Monolayer
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Understanding the optoelectronic profile and chemical stability of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is crucial for advancing two-dimensional (2D) material applications, particularly in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy devices. Here, we investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and excitonic properties of the 1T ' WSe2 monolayer. Phonon dispersion analysis confirmed the thermodynamic stability of this system. The 1T ' WSe2 monolayer exhibits a small electronic band gap of 0.17 eV, and its linear optical response suggests the potential use as a polarizing filter due to its strong reflectivity at y light polarization. Unlike the 1T ' MoS2 system, 1T ' WSe2 does not show an excitonic insulator phase. Instead, its exciton binding energy of 150 meV is consistent with values expected for 2D materials. This distinction underscores the unique electronic and optical properties of 1T ' WSe2, positioning it as a promising candidate for advanced technological applications such as flexible electronics, photodetectors, and quantum computing. By exploring these properties, we can unlock the full potential of TMDs in creating innovative high-performance devices.

AB Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol is an essential password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). The protocol is specifically designed to obtain a session key and it has been widely used in various scenarios due to its attractive security features. In the SRP protocol, the server is not required to save any data directly associated with passwords. And this makes attackers who manage to corrupt the server fail to impersonate the client unless performing a brute-force search for the password. However, the development of quantum computing has potentially made classic DLP-based public-key cryptography schemes not secure, including the SRP protocol. So it is significant to design a quantum-resistant SRP protocol. In this paper, based on the original scheme, we propose a post-quantum SRP protocol from the learning with errors (LWE) problem. And we give rigorous proof and analyses on the correctness and security of the scheme. Besides being resistant to known quantum attacks, it maintains the various secure qualities of the original protocol.

TI Characterization of antisite defects and in-gap states in
   antiferromagnetic MnSb2Te4
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators have been reported to exhibit novel physical phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator states, demonstrating potential for applications in spintronics and topological quantum computing. Here we perform low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) investigations of the antiferromagnetic ground state of MnSb2Te4, a predicted magnetic topological insulator isostructural with MnBi2Te4. We visualize the hexagonal Te-terminated surface of MnSb2Te4 and identify two distinct defects originating from different antisite substitutions. Notably, we identify an in-gap state above the Fermi energy where the tunneling spectrum exhibits a negative differential conductance behavior. This electronic state can be modulated by external electric and magnetic fields, suggesting effective pathways for electronic state manipulation. Spin-resolved STM measurements further reveal additional magnetic resonance peaks associated with Mn antisite defects. Our results provide novel insights into the investigation of magnetic topological insulators and demonstrate a promising approach to modulate the localized electronic states.

TI Inclusive reactions from finite Minkowski spacetime correlation
   functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within O(10%), the spacetime volumes must satisfy mL O(10-102)) and mT O(102-104).

AB The teaching/learning of quantum mechanics via two-state systems is continuously spreading in secondary schools due to its promising results in physics education research. One possibility is the use of polarisation states of photons. This paper reports on a polarisation-based introduction to quantum mechanics in physics teacher education. A widely used school material prepares teacher trainees for their future work and also improves their conceptual knowledge. This part includes statistical calculations using only secondary school mathematics and a new formulation of the uncertainty relation, using only real numbers. The second step is to prepare the formalism of quantum mechanics using real two-dimensional vectors and matrices. Considering that students may not learn complex linear algebra, we offer a new way to introduce the complete formalism of two-state systems via circular polarisation providing a step-by-step exploration of complex quantum states. This points out the advantage of using complex linear algebra via a physical example, providing the opportunity to reach the elements of advanced quantum physics and quantum computing while deepening the physics background of the secondary school material.

TI Fabrication and characterization of NbTi microwave superconducting
   resonators
SO MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING
AB Superconducting resonators are widely used in fields spanning from quantum computing to electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. With the goal of realizing superconducting resonators, a broad variety and combination of superconducting materials, substrates and fabrication processes have been used and thoroughly reported in the literature. High temperature superconductors such as YBCO and low temperature superconductors such as Nb, NbN, NbTiN and Al are the major actors in the domain. In this work, we investigate the possibility to extend the family of suitable low temperature superconductors for the realization of planar superconducting microwave resonators for future ESR applications. In particular, this study focuses on NbTi, a widely used material to realize superconducting cables but not investigated for planar resonating structures at GHz frequencies. A 150 nm thick film of NbTi is sputtered and patterned on top of an Al2O3 substrate. For devices resonating around 6.8 GHz quality factors greater than 10,000 are observed at 3 K and in magnetic fields up to 250 mT.

TI Universal anomaly of dynamics at phase transition points induced by
   Pancharatnam-Berry phase
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Dynamical anomalies are often observed near both the continuous and first-order phase transition points. We propose that the universal anomalies could originate from the geometric phase effects. A Pancharatnam-Berry phase is accumulated continuously in quantum states with the variation of tuning parameters. Phase transitions are supposed to induce an abrupt shift of the geometric phase. In our multi-level quantum model, the quantum interference induced by the geometric phase could prolong or shorten the relaxation times of excited states at phase transition points, which agrees with the experiments, models under sudden quenches and our semi-classical model. Furthermore, we find that by setting a phase shift of p, the excited state could be decoupled from the ground state by quantum cancellation so that the relaxation time even could diverge to infinity. Our work introduces the geometric phase to the study of conventional phase transitions as well as quantum phase transition, and could substantially extend the dephasing time of qubits for quantum computing.

TI Muons, mutations, and planetary shielding
SO FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
AB Life on earth is protected from astrophysical cosmic rays by the heliospheric magnetic and slowly varying geomagnetic fields, and by collisions with oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. The collisions generate showers of particles of lesser energy; only muons, a charged particle with a mass between that of an electron and a proton, can reach earth's surface in substantial quantities. Muons are easily detected, used to image interior spaces of pyramids, and known to limit the stability of qubits in quantum computing; yet, despite their charge, average energy of 4 GeV and ionizing properties, muons are not considered to affect chemical reactions or biology. In this Perspective the potential damaging effects of muons on DNA, and hence the repercussions for evolution and disease, are examined. It is argued here that the effect of muons on life through DNA mutations should be considered when investigating the protection provided by the magnetic environment and atmosphere from cosmic rays on earth and exoplanets.

TI Direct Observation of the Topological Surface State in the Topological
   Superconductor 2M-WS2
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect has attracted extensive research interest because of the potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing, which is attributable to two conducting edge channels with opposite spin polarization and the quantized electronic conductance of 2e(2)/h. Recently, 2M-WS2, a new stable phase of transition metal dichalcogenides with a 2M structure showing a layer configuration identical to that of the monolayer 1T ' TMDs, was suggested to be a QSH insulator as well as a superconductor with a critical transition temperature of around 8 K. Here, high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES are applied to investigate the electronic and spin structure of the topological surface states (TSS) in the superconducting 2M-WS2. The TSS exhibit characteristic spin-momentum-locking behavior, suggesting the existence of long-sought nontrivial Z(2) topological states therein. We expect that 2M-WS2 with coexisting superconductivity and TSS might host the promising Majorana bound states.

AB The fundamental problem in much of physics and quantum chemistry is to optimize a low-degree polynomial in certain anticommuting variables. Being a quantum mechanical problem, in many cases we do not know an efficient classical witness to the optimum, or even to an approximation of the optimum. One prominent exception is when the optimum is described by a so-called "Gaussian state", also called a free fermion state. In this work we are interested in the complexity of this optimization problem when no good Gaussian state exists. Our primary testbed is the Sachdevs Yes Kitaev (SYK) model of random degree-q polynomials, a model of great current interest in condensed matter physics and string theory, and one which has remarkable properties from a computational complexity standpoint. Among other results, we give an efficient classical certification algorithm for upper-bounding the largest eigenvalue in the q = 4 SYK model, and an efficient quantum certification algorithm for lower-bounding this largest eigenvalue; both algorithms achieve constant-factor approximations with high probability.

TI Analysis of Carleman Linearization of Lattice Boltzmann
SO FLUIDS
AB We explore the Carleman linearization of the collision term of the lattice Boltzmann formulation, as a first step towards formulating a quantum lattice Boltzmann algorithm. Specifically, we deal with the case of a single, incompressible fluid with the Bhatnagar Gross and Krook equilibrium function. Under this assumption, the error in the velocities is proportional to the square of the Mach number. Then, we showcase the Carleman linearization technique for the system under study. We compute an upper bound to the number of variables as a function of the order of the Carleman linearization. We study both collision and streaming steps of the lattice Boltzmann formulation under Carleman linearization. We analytically show why linearizing the collision step sacrifices the exactness of streaming in lattice Boltzmann, while also contributing to the blow up in the number of Carleman variables in the classical algorithm. The error arising from Carleman linearization has been shown analytically and numerically to improve exponentially with the Carleman linearization order. This bodes well for the development of a corresponding quantum computing algorithm based on the lattice Boltzmann equation.

AB In 2016, Galbraith et al. presented an adaptive attack on the SIDH key exchange protocol. In SIKE, one applies a variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform to force Bob to reveal his encryption key to Alice, which Alice then uses to re-encrypt Bob's ciphertext and verify its validity. Therefore, Bob can not reuse his encryption keys. There have been two other proposed countermeasures enabling static-static private keys: k-SIDH and its variant by Jao and Urbanik. These countermeasures are relatively expensive since they consist in running multiple parallel instances of SIDH. In this paper, firstly, we propose a new countermeasure to the GPST adaptive attack on SIDH. Our countermeasure does not require key disclosure as in SIKE, nor multiple parallel instances as in k-SIDH. We translate our countermeasure into a key validation method for SIDH-type schmes. Secondly, we use our key validation to design HealSIDH, an efficient SIDH-type static-static key interactive exchange protocol. Thirdly, we derive a PKE scheme SHealS using HealSIDH. SHealS uses larger primes compared to SIKE, has larger keys and ciphertexts, but only 4 isogenies are computed in a full execution of the scheme, as opposed to 5 isogenies in SIKE. We prove that SHealS is IND-CPA secure relying on a new assumption we introduce and we conjecture its IND-CCA security. We suggest HealS, a variant of SHealS using a smaller prime, providing smaller keys and ciphertexts. As a result, HealSIDH is a practically efficient SIDH based (interactive) key exchange incorporating a "direct" countermeasure to the GPST adaptive attack.

TI HHL Algorithm for Tensor-Decomposable Matrices
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We use the HHL algorithm to retrieve a quantum state holding the algebraic normal form (ANF) of a Boolean function. Unlike the standard HHL applications, we do not describe the cipher as an exponentially big system of equations. Rather, we perform a set of small matrix inversions which correspond to the Boolean M & ouml;bius transform. This creates a superposition holding information about the ANF in the form |A(f)> = 1/C Sigma(2n-1)(I=0)c(I)|I >, where c(I) is the coefficient of the ANF and C is a scaling factor. The procedure has a time complexity of (O) over tilde (n) for a Boolean function with n-bit input. We also propose two approaches by which some information about the ANF can be extracted from such a state. Next, we use a similar approach, the Dual Boolean Mobius transform, to compute the preimage under the algebraic transition matrix. We show that such a matrix is well-suited for the HHL algorithm when the attacker gets oracle access in the Q2 setting to the Boolean function.

In order to realize an efficient spin-photon interface, we couple the emission from a single nanoparticle to a fiber-based microcavity under cryogenic conditions. The spatial and spectral tunability of the cavity permits us to place individual nanoparticles in the cavity, to measure the inhomogeneous linewidth of the ions, and to show a multi-modal Purcell-enhancement of two transition in Eu3+. A halving of the free-space lifetime to 1.0 ms is observed, corresponding to a 140-fold enhancement of the respective transition. Furthermore, we observe a narrow optical linewidth of 3.3 MHz for a few-ion ensemble in the center of the inhomogeneous line. The results represent an important step towards the efficient readout of single Eu3+ ions, a key requirement for the realization of single-ion-level quantum processing nodes in the solid state.

TI Contemporary approaches in matheuristics an updated survey
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Matheuristics are problem independent frameworks that use mathematical programming tools to obtain high quality heuristic solutions. They are structurally general enough to be applied to different problems with little adaptation to their abstract structure, so they can be considered as new or hybrid metaheuristics based on components derived from the mathematical model of the problems of interest. In this survey, we emphasize the mathematical tools and describe how they can be used to design heuristics. We focus on mixed-integer linear programming and report representative examples from the literature of how it has been used for effective heuristic optimization. References to contributions to matheuristics deriving from neighboring research areas such as Artificial Intelligence or Quantum Computing are also included. We conclude with some ideas for possible future developments. This paper extends an original version published in 4OR with new sections on CMSA, Incremental Core, AI hybrids and Quantum Heuristics, and includes references to several recent publications.

TI Disordered optical metasurfaces: from light manipulation to energy
   harvesting
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Metasurfaces, the planar version of artificial structured media at sub-wavelength scale, provide the ability to manipulate light wave in a naturally unavailable way. They offer an unprecedented platform for a plethora of applications ranging from holography, imaging, optical communication to nonlinear light source and quantum computing. Conventionally and straightforwardly, metasurfaces are prepared in ordered configuration, aiming at reducing the geometric fluctuations to guarantee a good performance as designed. On the other hand, the inevitability of fabrication imperfection in nanophotonics and unique properties of disorder have been inspiring the exploration of the metasurfaces with novel design. To supplement the comprehensiveness in review for metasurfaces, here, we overview the mechanisms, characteristics and related applications of disordered metasurfaces, concentrating on recent progresses from light manipulation to energy harvesting and beyond. Besides reviewing the achievements in a wide range of applications with disordered metasurface, we provide an outlook on their future developments. With unique features, disordered metasurface may be a promising alternative for the ordered ones, especially for the practical requirement for large-scale production.

TI Computing the mass shift of Wilson and staggered fermions in the lattice
   Schwinger model with matrix product states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Simulations of lattice gauge theories with tensor networks and quantum computing have so far mainly focused on staggered fermions. In this paper, we use matrix product states to study Wilson fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation and present a novel method to determine the additive mass renormalization. Focusing on the single-flavor Schwinger model as a benchmark model, we investigate the regime of a nonvanishing topological theta-term, which is inaccessible to conventional Monte Carlo methods. We systematically explore the dependence of themass shift on the volume, the lattice spacing, the theta-parameter, and the Wilson parameter. This allows us to follow lines of constant renormalizedmass, and therefore to substantially improve the continuum extrapolation of the mass gap and electric field density. For small values of the mass, our continuum results agree with the theoretical prediction from mass perturbation theory. Going beyond Wilson fermions, our technique can also be applied to staggered fermions, and we demonstrate that the results of our approach agree with a recent theoretical prediction for the mass shift at sufficiently large volumes.

TI Mitigating indistinguishability issues in photon pair sources by
   delayed-pump intermodal four wave mixing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Large arrays of independent, pure and identical heralded single photon sources are an important resource for linear optical quantum computing protocols. In the race towards the development of increasingly ideal sources, delayed-pump intermodal four wave mixing (IFWM) in multimode waveguides has recently emerged as one of the most promising approaches. Despite this, fabrication imperfections still spoil the spectral indistinguishability of photon pairs from independent sources. Here we show that by tapering the width of the waveguide and by controlling the delay between the pump pulses, we add additional spectral tunability to the source while still inheriting all the distinctive metrics of the IFWM scheme. This feature is used to recover spectral indistinuishability in presence of fabrication errors. Under realistic tolerances on the waveguide dimensions, we predict >99.5% indistinguishability between independent sources on the same chip, and a maximum degradation of the heralded Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility <0.35%.

TI Logistics distribution de-carbonization pathways and effect in China: a
   systematic analysis using VRPSDP model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES
AB In order to reduce the carbon emission and improve the de-carbonization in distribution of vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (VRPSDP), a two-stage disruption management method based on the changes of customer demand is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a mathematics model of VRPSDP is established to optimize the parameters and the distribution carbon emission cost and time window deviation. Next, several carbon emission equations in VRPSDP are inducted and designed. Considering the strong global searching ability of quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and combing the advantages of superposition and parallelism of quantum computing, a multi-phase QPSO (MQPSO) is proposed to enhance global searching ability. At last, on the basis of Solomon examples, the validity of the proposed model and MQPSO is tested and compared with the classical algorithms at present. The simulation results show that the proposed method can not only achieve the goal of performance but also meet the practical requirements of reducing carbon emissions in VRPSDP.

TI Ultrahigh supercurrent density in a two-dimensional topological material
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Ongoing advances in superconductors continue to revolutionize technology thanks to the increasingly versatile and robust availability of lossless supercurrents. In particular, high supercurrent density can lead to more efficient and compact power transmission lines, high-field magnets, as well as high-performance nanoscale radiation detectors and superconducting spintronics. Here, we report the discovery of an unprecedentedly high superconducting critical current density (17 MA/cm(2) at 0 T and 7 MA/cm(2) at 8 T) in 1T'-WS2, exceeding those of all reported two-dimensional superconductors to date. 1T'-WS2 features a strongly anisotropic (both in- and out-ofplane) superconducting state that violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit signaling the presence of unconventional superconductivity. Spectroscopic imaging of the vortices further substantiates the anisotropic nature of the superconducting state. More intriguingly, the normal state of 1T'-WS2 carries topological properties. The band structure obtained via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations points to a Z(2) topological invariant. The concomitance of topology and superconductivity in 1T'-WS2 establishes it as a topological superconductor candidate, which is promising for the development of quantum computing technology.

AB The G(m)/I-D approach has proven to be an efficient technique for the design of low-power analog circuits even in advanced technology nodes. It has already been shown that the normalized Gm/ID is actually a universal figure-of-merit (FoM) that is independent of technology and of device geometry. In addition, we will show experimentally in this paper that the normalized Gm/ID is also almost independent of temperature even down to cryogenic temperatures. Analog designers are currently struggling to design circuits that have to operate at cryogenic temperatures for quantum computing application. This is because the compact models available in the physical design kit (PDK) provided by foundries fail at cryogenic temperatures. While the models need to be improved to account for low-temperature physics, the Gm/ID approach can help designing cryo-CMOS analog circuits. In this paper we will show how it can be used for the design of a simple low-noise amplifier in a 16nm FinFET technology taking advantage of the temperature independence of G(m)/I-D.

TI TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model dataset for
   metal-organic frameworks
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF dataset. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. In addition to computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations, the data supports quantum computing tasks that rely on tight-binding Hamiltonian and self-consistent computed Hubbard parameters. For validation and reuse, we have made the data publicly available.

TI Exploring Phonon Interference: Insights From a Nano-Scale Silicon Double
   Slit Atomistic Simulation
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB In this study, the classic double-slit experiment, originally developed for light waves is successfully adapted, to investigate the behavior of phonons in crystalline silicon. Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, how phonons can exhibit wave-like interference patterns when passing through two slits in a silicon block is explored. The results indicate that phonon waves behave similarly to photons, with slit distinct interference patterns. By manipulating geometric parameters such as slit width, distance, and length, in fringe distances that align with Young's double slit formula is observed to change. Key findings include the observation of phonon interference and the sensitivity of fringe distances to geometric configurations. Although some discrepancies with theory arose due to noise in the MD simulations, these results underscore the complexity of simulating phonon behavior in nanostructures. This study demonstrates that phonon behavior at the nanoscale can mirror classical wave interference phenomena, paving the way for future work that includes conducting physical experiments for validation and ultimately aiming to engineer devices that harness phononic interference for innovative applications in thermal management, microelectronics, and quantum computing.

TI Digital Diplomacy and Strategic Conflict: The United States and China in

SO PORTES-REVISTA MEXICANA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE LA CUENCA DEL PACIFICO
AB The digital age has birthed a new kind of superpower rivalry, where technological primacy is the ultimate source of power projection. The United States and China stand at opposite corners of this digital arena, competing across domains such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, data governance, and digital infrastructure. This rivalry is marked by paradox: both sides depend on each other for markets, talent, and innovation, yet each seeks dominance in global digital governance. This article argues that US-China competition over digital infrastructure, technological standards, and data sovereignty is fragmenting the global digital order, undermining cooperative governance, disrupting global value chains, and fueling new dependencies among third countries. Drawing on international relations theory, extensive primary data, and case studies of China's Digital Silk Road and US strategic initiatives, the paper examines the strategic dynamics, the risks of decoupling, and the implications for global governance, technological innovation, economic development, and security.

TI Governing High-Risk Technologies in a Fragmented World: Geopolitical
   Tensions, Regulatory Gaps, and Institutional Barriers to Global
   Cooperation
SO FUDAN JOURNAL OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB The global governance of high-risk technologies-including nuclear technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, biotechnology, and gene editing-faces mounting challenges due to geopolitical tensions, regulatory gaps, and institutional barriers. Drawing on sociopolitical theories such as Beck's Risk Society, Giddens' Runaway World, and Perrow's Normal Accidents, this paper examines the complexities of regulating rapidly advancing technologies within a fragmented global landscape. Unlike previous industrial revolutions, today's technological transformations are unfolding at an unprecedented pace, outstripping existing governance structures and exacerbating regulatory asymmetries and geopolitical rivalries. The national securitization of technology and the absence of binding international frameworks hinder effective cooperation, fueling an unregulated "technological race." Addressing these governance challenges requires multilateral collaboration, legally binding treaties, and independent regulatory bodies with enforcement capabilities. Without coordinated global efforts, unchecked technological proliferation may heighten security risks, deepen global inequalities, and erode trust in regulatory institutions. This paper critically evaluates current governance deficiencies and explores pathways toward more effective and inclusive global cooperation in managing high-risk technologies.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Chronic disease prediction presents ongoing challenges in healthcare, primarily due to the complexity of medical data and the need for models that are both accurate and interpretable. This study introduces a quantum-enhanced machine learning model specifically designed for the prediction of hypertension, combining quantum feature transformation with classical algorithms to deliver precise and reliable results. The model demonstrates high performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.40%, precision of 99.3%, recall of 98.6%, and an F1-score of 98.9%. To ensure transparency and facilitate clinical interpretation, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are employed through SHAP values, highlighting critical factors such as hypertension drug usage, age, ferritin, and cholesterol levels as key contributors to hypertension prediction. This quantum-based approach exemplifies the potential for leveraging cutting-edge technologies in healthcare, offering a robust solution that not only ensures predictive accuracy but also supports interpretability-essential for informed clinical decision-making. The integration of quantum computing and explainable machine learning represents a promising step forward in the development of predictive models tailored to complex medical datasets.

TI Designing a Scalable and Area-Efficient Hardware Accelerator Supporting
   Multiple PQC Schemes
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This study introduces a hardware accelerator to support various Post-Quantum Cryptosystem (PQC) schemes, addressing the quantum computing threat to cryptographic security. PQCs, while more secure, also bring significant computational demands, which are especially problematic for lightweight devices. Previous hardware accelerators are typically scheme-specific, which is inefficient given the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s multiple finalists. Our approach focuses on the shared operations among these schemes, allowing a single design to accelerate multiple candidate PQCs at the same time. This is further enhanced by allocating resources according to performance profiling results. Our compact, scalable hardware accelerator supports four of NIST PQC finalists, achieving an area efficiency of up to 81.85% compared to the current state-of-the-art multi-scheme accelerator while supporting twice as many schemes. The design demonstrates average throughput improvements ranging from 0.97x to 35.97x across the four schemes and their main operations, offering an efficient solution for implementing multiple PQC schemes within constrained hardware environments.

TI Probing Spin-Dependent Ballistic Charge Transport at Single-Nanometer
   Length Scales
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The coherent transport of charge and spin is a key requirement of future devices for quantum computing and communication. Scattering at defects or impurities may significantly reduce the coherence of quantum-mechanical states, thereby affecting the device functionality. While numerous methods exist to experimentally assess charge transport, the real-space detection of a material's ballistic spin transport properties with nanometer resolution remains a challenge. Here we report on a novel approach that utilizes a combination of spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) and the recently introduced molecular nanoprobe (MONA) technique. It relies on the local injection of spin-polarized charge carriers from a magnetic STM tip and their detection by a single surface-deposited phthalocyanine molecule via reversible electron-induced tautomerization events. Based on the particular electronic structure of the Rashba alloy BiAg2, which is governed by a spin-momentum-locked surface state, we prove that the current direction inverses upon tip magnetization reversal.

TI A Cryo-CMOS SAR ADC With FIA Sampling Driver Enabled by Cryogenic-Aware
   Back-Biasing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB This paper presents a floating inverter amplifier (FIA) that performs high-linearity amplification and sampling while driving a 2x time-interleaved (TI) SAR ADC, operating from room temperature (RT) down to 4.2 K. The power-efficient FIA samples the continuous-time input signal by windowed integration, thus avoiding the traditional sample and-hold. Cascode switching, a floating supply and accurate pulse-width timing calibration enable high-speed operation and interleaving. In addition, by exploiting the behavior of CMOS devices at cryogenic temperatures, forward-body-biasing (FBB) is pushed well beyond what is possible at RT to ensure performance down to 4.2 K, and its impact on the performance of cryogenic circuits is analyzed. The resulting ADC, implemented in 40-nm bulk CMOS and including the FIA driver, achieves SNDR=38.7 dB (38.2 dB), SFDR>50 dB (>50 dB), and FOMW=25.4 fJ/conv-step (31.3 fJ/conv-step) with Nyquist-rate input at 1.0 GS/s (0.9 GS/s) at 4.2 K (RT), respectively.

TI Electrical detection and modulation of magnetism in a Dy-based
   ferroelectric single-molecule magnet
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrical control of magnetism in single-molecule magnets with peculiar quantum magnetic behaviours has promise for applications in molecular electronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, such kind of magnetoelectric effects have not been achieved in such materials. Herein, we report the successful realization of significant magnetoelectric effects by introducing ferroelectricity into a dysprosium-based single-molecule magnet through spatial cooperation between flexible organic ligands and halide ions. The stair-shaped magnetization hysteresis loop, alternating current susceptibility, and magnetic relaxation can be directly modulated by applying a moderate electric field. Conversely, the electric polarization can be modulated by applying a small magnetic field. In addition, a resonant magnetodielectric effect is clearly observed, which enables detection of quantum tunnelling of magnetization by a simple electrical measurement. The integration of ferroelectricity into single-molecule magnets not only broadens the family of single-molecule magnets but also makes electrical detection and modulation of the quantum tunnelling of magnetization a reality.
   The significant magnetoelectric effects in a Dy-based ferroelectric single molecule magnet enable electrical manipulation and detection of resonant quantum tunneling of magnetization.

TI Realization of Quantum Secure Direct Communication with Continuous
   Variable
SO RESEARCH
AB With the progress of theoretical and applied technologies, the communication system based on the classical encryption is seriously threatened by quantum computing and distributed computing. A communication method that directly loads confidential information on the quantum state, quantum secure direct communication (QSDC), came into being for resisting security threats. Here, we report the first continuous-variable QSDC (CV-QSDC) experimental demonstration for verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the CV-QSDC protocol based on Gaussian mapping and propose a parameter estimation for signal classification under the actual channels. In our experiment, we provided 4 x 102 blocks, where each block contains 105 data for direct information transmission. For the transmission distance of 5 km in our experiment, the excess noise is 0.0035 SNU, where SNU represents the unit of shot-noise units. The 4.08 x 105 bit per second experimental results firmly demonstrated the feasibility of CV-QSDC under the fiber channel. The proposed grading judgment method based on parameter estimation provides a practical and available message processing scheme for CV-QSDC in a practical fiber channel and lays the groundwork for the grading reconciliation.

TI Development of Evolutionary Systems Based on Quantum Petri Nets
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Evolutionary systems (ES) include software applications that solve problems using heuristic methods instead of the deterministic ones. The classical computing used for ES development involves random methods to improve different kinds of genomes. The mappings of these genomes lead to individuals that correspond to the searched solutions. The individual evaluations by simulations serve for the improvement of their genotypes. Quantum computations, unlike the classical computations, can describe and simulate a large set of individuals simultaneously. This feature is used to diminish the time for finding the solutions. Quantum Petri Nets (QPNs) can model dynamical systems with probabilistic features that make them appropriate for the development of ES. Some examples of ES applications using the QPNs are given to show the benefits of the current approach. The current research solves quantum evolutionary problems using quantum genetic algorithms conceived and improved based on QPN. They were tested on a dynamic system using a Quantum Discrete Controlled Walker (QDCW).

TI Closed-loop optimization of fast trapped-ion shuttling with sub-quanta
   excitation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Shuttling ions at high speed and with low motional excitation is essential for realizing fast and high-fidelity algorithms in many trapped-ion-based quantum computing architectures. Achieving such performance is challenging due to the sensitivity of an ion to electric fields and the unknown and imperfect environmental and control variables that create them. Here we implement a closed-loop optimization of the voltage waveforms that control the trajectory and axial frequency of an ion during transport in order to minimize the final motional excitation. The resulting waveforms realize fast round-trip transport of a trapped ion across multiple electrodes at speeds of 0.5 electrodes per microsecond (35 m center dot s(-1) for a one-way transport of 210 mu m in 6 mu s) with a maximum of 0.36 +/- 0.08 mean quanta gain. This sub-quanta gain is independent of the phase of the secular motion at the distal location, obviating the need for an electric field impulse or time delay to eliminate the coherent motion.

TI Spin-triplet superconductivity from excitonic effect in doped insulators
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Despite being of fundamental importance and potential interest for topological quantum computing, spin-triplet superconductors remain rare in solid state materials after decades of research. In this work, we present a three-particle mechanism for spin-triplet superconductivity in multiband systems, where an effective attraction between doped electrons is produced from the Coulomb repulsion via a virtual interband transition involving a third electron [V. Crepel, L. Fu, Sci. Adv. 7, eabh2233 (2021)]. Our theory is analytically controlled by an interband hybridization parameter and explicitly demonstrated in doped band insulators with the example of an extended Hubbard model. Our theory of exciton-mediated pairing reveals how, as a matter of principle, a two-particle bound state can arise from the strong electron repulsion upon doping, opening a viable path to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) physics in solid state systems. In light of this theory, we propose that recently discovered dilute superconductors such as ZrNCl, WTe2, and moire materials can be spin-triplet and compare the expected consequences of our theory with experimental data.

TI PZT optical memristors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Here, we reveal the first lead zirconate titanate (PZT) optical memristor, working with a paradigm of functional duality: non-volatile setting and ultrafast volatile modulation via the Pockels effect. Fine-tuning and large modulation depth are achieved with an index change of 4.6 x 10(-3) when setting above a threshold voltage V-th and the switching energy is 12.3 pJ only. The non-volatility is highly stable even with >100,000 cycles. Sub-nanosecond volatile modulation (48 Gbps, 432 fJ/bit) is realized with high efficiency (V pi L similar to 0.5 V.cm) via the strong Pockels effect below V-th. Our wafer-scale manufacturing process shows great potential for mass production. The present PZT optical memristors bridge the gap between high-speed photonics and non-volatile memory, offering transformative potential for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing, and brain-like architecture.

TI Neuro-Driven Agent-Based Security for Quantum-Safe 6G Networks
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Around the same time that 6G networks will be launched, advances in quantum computing could challenge existing cryptographic security. This study provides a new approach for designing a quantum-safe 6G security architecture powered by neurons. The framework uses connected cognitive agents that apply neuro-symbolic learning to respond quickly to any quantum-based security threats that may appear in network slices. Experiments carried out using simulations across various network setups with different threats verify that the presented method improves the detection rate of quantum attacks by 37.8%, uses 29.2% less communication capacity than other methods in the field. This network includes features that strengthen it to resist quantum decryption, while at the same time keeping replies fast enough for 6G. When using specific quantum-inspired techniques, accomplishing tasks requires only 42.5% fewer false alarms compared to other intrusion methods. With this research, people are now better prepared for quantum-protected wireless networks and 6G systems that ensure stability in the future.

TI Design principles for >90% efficiency and >99% indistinguishability
   broadband quantum dot cavities
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum dots have the potential to be one of the brightest deterministic single photon sources with high end applications in quantum computing and cluster state generation. In this work, we re-examine the design of plain micropillars by meticulously examining the structural effects of the decay into leaky channels beyond an atom-like cavity estimation. We show that precise control of the side losses with the diameter and avoidance of propagating Bloch modes in the distributed Bragg reflectors can result in easy-to-manufacture broadband ( Q approximate to 750-2500) micropillars, allowing for broad optical coherent control pulses necessary for high single photon purity ( >99.2%-99.99% achievable) while simultaneously demonstrating extremely high efficiency out the top (90.5%-96.4%). We also demonstrate that such cavities naturally decouple from the phonon sideband, with the phonon sideband reducing by a factor of 5-33 allowing us to predict that the photons should show 98.5%-99.8% indistinguishability without the need for filtering.

TI Intrinsic superconducting phase battery
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Leveraging the quantization properties inherent in superconductors, we present the development of an intrinsic superconducting phase battery. This advancement is achieved by integrating a ferromagnetic pi-phase Josephson junction (pi-JJ) within a superconducting ring. The core innovation lies in harnessing the potential energy of the pi-JJ to generate an intrinsic circulating current, thereby inducing a phase difference as the current goes through the geometric inductance. This mechanism allows for tuning the phase bias phi (0 < phi < pi) through an arrangement of the geometric inductance in the battery. We integrate the intrinsic phase batteries into superconducting quantum interference devices, where we verified the effectiveness of the induced phase bias. The polarity of the phase battery is determined by the direction of the intrinsic circulating current, which can be initialized by an external magnetic field. The design methodology for precise intrinsic phase bias has been established. Our findings not only show the feasibility of generating an intrinsic and adjustable phase bias using established fabrication techniques but also open new avenues for enhancing the design, efficiency, and functionality of superconducting electronics, promising to accelerate advancements in digital and quantum computing technologies.

TI Proximity-induced anisotropic magnetoresistance in magnetized
   topological insulators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Topological insulators (TIs) host spin-momentum locked surface states that are inherently susceptible to magnetic proximity modulations, making them promising for nano-electronic, spintronic, and quantum computing applications. While much effort has been devoted to studying (quantum) anomalous Hall effects in magnetic magnetically doped TIs, the inherent magnetoresistance (MR) properties in magnetic proximity-coupled surface states remain largely unexplored. Here, we directly exfoliate Bi2Se3 TI flakes onto a magnetic insulator, yttrium iron garnet, and measure the MR at various temperatures. We experimentally observe an anisotropic magnetoresistance that is consistent with a magnetized surface state. Our results indicate that the TI has magnetic anisotropy out of the sample plane, which opens an energy gap between the surface states. By applying a magnetic field along any in-plane orientation, the magnetization of the TI rotates toward the plane and the gap closes. Consequently, we observe a large (similar to 6.5%) MR signal that is attributed to an interplay between coherent rotation of magnetization within a topological insulator and abrupt switching of magnetization in the underlying magnetic insulator.

TI Revealing the Origin of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in
   Fe-Chalcogenide Superconductor
   FeTe1-xSex
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recently, evidence has emerged in the topological superconductor Fe-chalcogenide FeTe1-xSex for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), the nature of which has strong implications on the Majorana zero modes (MZM) discovered in this system. It remains unclear, however, whether the TRSB resides in the topological surface state (TSS) or in the bulk, and whether it is due to an unconventional TRSB superconducting order parameter or an intertwined order. Here, by performing in superconducting FeTe1-xSex crystals both surface-magneto-optic-Kerr effect measurements using a Sagnac interferometer and bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements, we pinpoint the TRSB to the TSS, where we also detect a Dirac gap. Further, we observe surface TRSB in nonsuperconducting FeTe1-xSex of nominally identical composition, indicating that TRSB arises from an intertwined surface ferromagnetic (FM) order. The observed surface FM bears striking similarities to the two-dimensional (2D) FM found in 2D van der Waals crystals, and is highly sensitive to the exact chemical composition, thereby providing a means for optimizing the conditions for Majorana particles that are useful for robust quantum computing.

TI Hybrid Entanglement Distribution between Remote Microwave Quantum
   Computers Empowered by Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting microwave circuits with Josephson junctions, the major platform for quantum computing, can only reach the full capability when connected. This requires an efficient protocol to distribute microwave entanglement. While quantum computers typically use discrete-variable (DV) methods for information encoding, the entire continuous-variable (CV) degree of freedom in electromagnetic fields must be utilized to achieve the highest entanglement distribution rate. Here, we propose a hybrid protocol to resolve the incompatibility between DV microwave quantum computers and CV quantum communications. CV microwave entanglement is distributed using optical swapping of optical-microwave entanglement pairs. To interface with DV microwave quantum computers, we further design a hybrid circuit to simultaneously convert and distill high-quality DV entanglement from noisy CV entanglement. The hybrid circuit is trained with machine-learning algorithms, ensuring high entanglement fidelity and generation rate. Our work not only provides a practical method to realize efficient quantum links for superconducting microwave quantum computers, but also opens avenues to bridge the gap between DV and CV quantum systems.

TI A Method Inspired by One-Dimensional Discrete-Time Quantum Walks for
   Influential Node Identification
SO ENTROPY
AB Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is essential for a wide range of applications, from social network analysis to enhancing infrastructure resilience. While quantum walk-based methods offer potential advantages, existing approaches face challenges in dimensionality, computational efficiency, and accuracy. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel method inspired by the one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (IOQW). This design enables the development of a simplified shift operator that leverages both self-loops and the network's structural connectivity. Furthermore, degree centrality and path-based features are integrated into the coin operator, enhancing the accuracy and scalability of the IOQW framework. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art quantum and classical methods demonstrate that IOQW excels in capturing both local and global topological properties while maintaining a low computational complexity of O(N < k >), where < k > denotes the average degree. These advancements establish IOQW as a powerful and practical tool for influential node identification in complex networks, bridging quantum-inspired techniques with real-world network science applications.

TI Surface and interface physics driven by quantum materials
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Electronic states at the boundaries of crystals, such as surfaces, interfaces, edges, hinges, corners, and extremities, play crucial roles in emerging quantum materials, such as graphene and similar monatomic-layer materials, van der Waals crystals, and topological insulators. Electronic states at such boundaries are different from those inside the three- or two-dimensional crystals, not only because of the truncation of crystal lattices but also because of space-inversion-symmetry breaking and difference in topology in band structures across the boundaries. Such quantum materials are expected to advance energy-saving/-harvesting technology as well as quantum computing/information technology because of exotic phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking of an electron, pure spin current, dissipation-less charge current, nonreciprocal current, and possible Majorana fermions. In this review, their fundamental concepts are introduced from the viewpoint of surface physics, in which atomic and electronic structures, as well as charge/spin transport properties, are directly probed using state-of-the-art techniques.

TI Programmable integrated photonic coherent matrix: Principle,
   configuring, and applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Every multi-input multi-output linear optical system can be deemed as a matrix multiplier that carries out a desired transformation on the input optical information, such as imaging, modulation, and computing. The strong programmability of the optical matrix has been explored and proved to be able to bring more flexibility and greater possibilities to the applications such as optical signal processing and general optical digital and analog computing. Furthermore, the burgeoning integrated photonics with advanced manufacturing and light manipulating technology pave the way for large-scale reconfigurable photonic coherent matrix. This paper reviews the programmable photonic coherent matrix in the integrated platform. First, the theoretical basis and optimizing methods of three types of integrated photonic coherent matrix (Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh, multi-plane diffraction, and crossbar array) are introduced. Next, we overview the configuring method of this optical matrix. Furthermore, their applications in optical signal processing, optical neural network, optical logic operation, recurrent optical matrix acceleration, and optical quantum computing are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of programmable integrated photonic coherent matrix are discussed.

TI Synthesis and Future Electronic Applications of Topological
   Nanomaterials
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Over the last ten years, the discovery of topological materials has opened up new areas in condensed matter physics. These materials are noted for their distinctive electronic properties, unlike conventional insulators and metals. This discovery has not only spurred new research areas but also offered innovative approaches to electronic device design. A key aspect of these materials is now that transforming them into nanostructures enhances the presence of surface or edge states, which are the key components for their unique electronic properties. In this review, we focus on recent synthesis methods, including vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and chemical conversion techniques. Moreover, the scaling down of topological nanomaterials has revealed new electronic and magnetic properties due to quantum confinement. This review covers their synthesis methods and the outcomes of topological nanomaterials and applications, including quantum computing, spintronics, and interconnects. Finally, we address the materials and synthesis challenges that need to be resolved prior to the practical application of topological nanomaterials in advanced electronic devices.

TI Corrosion protection performance of silicon-based coatings on carbon
   steel in NaCl solution: a theoretical and experimental assessment of the
   effect of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition pretreatment
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Using a plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) process, carbon steel samples were coated with an organosilicon layer less than 2.5 microns thick. Ellipsometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, contact angle, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to analyze the films. Additionally, gravimetric experiments were used to determine the electrochemical properties of the organosilicon coatings. Organosilicon-coated carbon steel specimens demonstrated significantly enhanced resistance to corrosive conditions, such as 3% aqueous sodium chloride solutions. The surface preparation method has a considerable influence on the morphological and electrochemical properties of the steel. Argon pretreatment significantly enhances the corrosion resistance of organosilicon-coated steel. Gravimetric research demonstrated that pretreatment with argon plasma resulted in less weight loss and corrosion than pretreatment with nitrogen plasma. The link between quantum computing and experimental data using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) was used.

TI Physical layer encryption scheme based on biological genetic variation
   mechanisms in CO-OFDM system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB With the rise of quantum computing and sophisticated cyber-attacks, traditional cryptographic methods face challenges in securing optical physical layer data transmission. This study proposes what we believe to be a novel approach by integrating biological genetic variation mechanisms (BGVM) with signal encryption in coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) system. A mapping model between genetic structures and optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals is constructed, and a dual encryption mechanism including mutation-guiding encryption mechanism (MGEN) and reorganization-guiding encryption mechanism (RGEN) is established to disrupt the data positions on subcarriers. In the system, the key sequences are generated by a four-dimensional hyperchaotic system, which exhibits good randomness and unpredictability. Experiment is successfully conducted to realize physical layer secure transmission of the CO-OFDM signal over 80 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF). The proposed scheme has low time complexity and the key space is extended to 101194 approximately, when the number of subcarriers N = 256.

TI Realization of a one-dimensional topological insulator in ultrathin
   germanene nanoribbons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing a one-dimensional (1D) topological insulator and identifying the lower-dimensional limit of two-dimensional (2D) behavior are crucial steps toward developing high-density quantum state networks, advancing topological quantum computing, and exploring dimensionality effects in topological materials. Although 2D topological insulators have been experimentally realized, their lower dimensional limit and 1D counterparts remain elusive. Here, we fabricated and characterized arrays of zigzag-terminated germanene nanoribbons, a 2D topological insulator with a large topological bulk gap. The electronic properties of these nanoribbons strongly depend on their width, with topological edge states persisting down to a critical width (similar to 2 nm), defining the limit of 2D topology. Below this threshold, contrary to the tenfold way classification, we observe zero-dimensional (0D) states localized at the ends of the ultrathin nanoribbons. These end states, topologically protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries, indicate the realization of a 1D topological insulator with strong spin-orbit coupling. Our findings establish germanene nanoribbons as a platform for investigating 1D topology and dimensionality effects in topological materials.

TI Enhancing Software Requirements Verification and Validation Techniques
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In this study, we examine the diverse methodologies used for software verification and validation (V and V) across various industries, leveraging secondary data to synthesize insights from key guidelines, standards, and frameworks. The findings indicate a preference for advanced V and V techniques such as risk-based testing, simulation, and formal methods, particularly in industries with high operational demands including IT, health care, and quantum computing. In the analysis, we highlight sector-specific adaptations of V and V practices, indicating the need for tailoring methodologies to align with unique industry challenges and requirements. We underscore the critical role of contextual relevance in the successful implementation of V and V techniques. Future research should incorporate primary data collection and explore underrepresented sectors to provide a comprehensive view of V and V practices. In addition, it should include additional variables such as organizational culture, project characteristics, and stakeholder involvement to contextualize V and V practices. Such efforts will enhance the applicability of V and V methodologies, ensuring their effectiveness across a broader spectrum of industries and operational contexts.

TI Experimental Study of a Helium Sorption Cooler with Low Temperature
   Fluctuation and Long Hold Time below 1 K
SO FRONTIERS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER
AB Helium sorption cooler technology is a key means to realize highly reliable low-vibration very lowtemperature environments, which have important applications in fields such as quantum computing and space exploration. The laboratory designed a superfluid suppression small hole and a multi-ribbed condenser, developed a reliable-performance helium sorption cooler (HSC), and conducted experimental studies. Experimental results show that the prototype can achieve the lowest cooling temperature of 873 mK without load by filling 6 MPa helium at room temperature. The low-temperature hold time is 26 h, and the temperature fluctuation is within 0.8 mK. The cooling power of the helium sorption cooler is 1 mW @ 0.98 K @ 3.5 h. Experimental results indicate that when the charging pressure is reduced to 4 MPa, the minimum temperature decreases to 836 mK, and the hold time shortens to 16 h. When the pre-cooling temperature increases from 3.9 to 4.9 K, the hold time is reduced to 3 h.

TI What ChatGPT Has to Say About Its Topological Structure: The Anyon
   Hypothesis
SO MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
AB Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable predictive capabilities but remain opaque in their internal reasoning, creating a pressing need for more interpretable artificial intelligence. Here, we propose bridging this explanatory gap by drawing on concepts from topological quantum computing (TQC), specifically the anyonic frameworks arising from SU(2)k theories. Anyons interpolate between fermions and bosons, offering a mathematical language that may illuminate the latent structure and decision-making processes within LLMs. By examining how these topological constructs relate to token interactions and contextual dependencies in neural architectures, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on how meaning and coherence emerge. After eliciting insights from ChatGPT and exploring low-level cases of SU(2)k models, we argue that the machinery of modular tensor categories and topological phases could inform more transparent, stable, and robust AI systems. This interdisciplinary approach suggests that quantum-theoretic principles may underpin a novel understanding of explainable AI.

TI Third- and fifth-order nonlinearities in quantum dot hybrid systems:
   Influence of graphene and metal nanoparticles
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This work examines the third-order and fifth-order nonlinear susceptibilities in a hybrid system including a semiconductor quantum dot, metallic nanoshell, and graphene nanodisk. The research uses the density matrix method to examine the dipole-dipole interaction that occurs due to the applied field. It assumes that there is an increase in the strength of a continuous-wave electromagnetic field inside the quantum dot. The inclusion of the graphene nanodisk greatly amplifies the nonlinear optical reaction of the quantum dot in this combined system, which is governed by the dipole-dipole interaction. The findings indicate a notable disparity in the nonlinear optical reaction of the semiconductor quantum dot when the parameters are modified. The possible applications of this concept include optical sensors, photonic devices, quantum computing, medical imaging, energy harvesting, and high-density data storage. Additionally, it has the potential to progress terahertz technology and simplify the development of new materials with customized optical properties. The substantial rise in nonlinearities inside the hybrid system presents prospects for advancements in diverse technological and scientific domains.

TI New basis for Hamiltonian SU(2) simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Due to rapidly improving quantum computing hardware, Hamiltonian simulations of relativistic lattice field theories have seen a resurgence of attention. This computational tool requires turning the formally infinite -dimensional Hilbert space of the full theory into a finite -dimensional one. For gauge theories, a widely used basis for the Hilbert space relies on the representations induced by the underlying gauge group, with a truncation that keeps only a set of the lowest dimensional representations. This works well at large bare gauge coupling, but becomes less efficient at small coupling, which is required for the continuum limit of the lattice theory. In this work, we develop a new basis suitable for the simulation of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the maximal tree gauge. In particular, we show how to perform a Hamiltonian truncation so that the eigenvalues of both the magnetic and electric gauge -fixed Hamiltonian are mostly preserved, which allows for this basis to be used at all values of the coupling. Little prior knowledge is assumed, so this may also be used as an introduction to the subject of Hamiltonian formulations of lattice gauge theories.

TI Stone-Wales Defect in Graphene
SO SMALL
AB 2D graphene the most investigated structures from nanocarbon family studied in the last three decades. It is projected as an excellent material useful for quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and next generation advanced technologies. Graphene exists in several forms and its extraordinary thermal, mechanical, and electronic properties, principally depend on the kind of perfection of the hexagonal atomic lattice. Defects are always considered as undesired components but certain defects in graphene could be an asset for electrochemistry and quantum electronics due to the engineered electronclouds and quantum tunnelling. The authors carefully discuss the Stone-Wales imperfections in graphene and its derivatives comprehensively. A specific emphasis is focused on the experimental and theoretical aspects of the Stone-Wales defects in graphene with respect to structure-property relationships. The corroboration of extrinsic defects like external atomic doping, functionalization, edge distortion in the graphene consisting of Stone-Wales imperfections, which are very significant in designing graphene-based electronic devices, are summarized.

TI Random walk and non-Gaussianity of the 3D second-quantized
   Schrodinger-Newton nonlocal soliton
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Nonlocal quantum fluids emerge as dark-matter models and tools for quantum simulations and technologies. However, strongly nonlinear regimes, like those involving multi-dimensional self-localized solitary waves, are marginally explored for what concerns quantum features. We study the dynamics of 3D+1 solitons in the second-quantized nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton equation. We theoretically investigate the quantum diffusion of the soliton center of mass and other parameters, varying the interaction length. 3D+1 simulations of the Ito partial differential equations arising from the positive P-representation of the density matrix validate the theoretical analysis. The numerical results unveil the onset of non-Gaussian statistics of the soliton, which may signal quantum-gravitational effects and be a resource for quantum computing. The non-Gaussianity arises from the interplay between the soliton parameter quantum diffusion and the stable invariant propagation. The fluctuations and the non-Gaussianity are universal effects expected for any nonlocality and dimensionality.

AB Quantum theory is often regarded as challenging to learn and teach, with advanced mathematical prerequisites ranging from complex numbers and probability theory to matrix multiplication, vector space algebra and symbolic manipulation within the Hilbert space formalism. It is traditionally considered an advanced undergraduate or graduate-level subject.
   In this work, we challenge the conventional view by proposing "Quantum Picturalism" as a new approach to teaching the fundamental concepts of quantum theory and computation. We establish the foundations and methodology for an ongoing educational experiment to investigate the question "From what age can students learn quantum theory if taught using a diagrammatic approach?". We anticipate that the primary benefit of leveraging such a diagrammatic approach, which is conceptually intuitive yet mathematically rigorous, will be eliminating some of the most daunting barriers to teaching and learning this subject while enabling young learners to reason proficiently about high-level problems. We posit that transitioning from symbolic presentations to pictorial ones will increase the appeal of STEM education, attracting more diverse audience.

AB We present ExaTN (Exascale Tensor Networks), a scalable GPU-accelerated C++ library which can express and process tensor networks on shared- as well as distributed-memory high-performance computing platforms, including those equipped with GPU accelerators. Specifically, ExaTN provides the ability to build, transform, and numerically evaluate tensor networks with arbitrary graph structures and complexity. It also provides algorithmic primitives for the optimization of tensor factors inside a given tensor network in order to find an extremum of a chosen tensor network functional, which is one of the key numerical procedures in quantum many-body theory and quantum-inspired machine learning. Numerical primitives exposed by ExaTN provide the foundation for composing rather complex tensor network algorithms. We enumerate multiple application domains which can benefit from the capabilities of our library, including condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, quantum circuit simulations, as well as quantum and classical machine learning, for some of which we provide preliminary demonstrations and performance benchmarks just to emphasize a broad utility of our library.

TI Multifunctional Prussian blue analogue magnets: Emerging opportunities
SO APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB There is a surge of interest to expand the search for entirely new classes of molecular magnets as the emergence of information storage and quantum computing devices. Prussian blue analogues as a family of molecular magnets are especially attracting wide attention due to their large number of derivatives with a range of magnetic ordering temperature from cryogenic to room temperature. This review presents Prussian blue analogues as multifunctional molecular magnets, which involves the development of molecular magnet syntheses and crystal structures, and magnetic properties under external stimuli. In addition, the porous network structures and vacancy order of Prussian blue analogues present a wide capability to interact with water molecules and gas adsorption. External stimuli, such as thermal, pressure, electric and magnetic field and photoexcitation, play an important role in controlling the hidden states and cooperative phenomena of high temperature molecular magnets based on Prussian blue analogues.

AB Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) on LaFePO in 2006, many types of IBSs have been fabricated. IBSs have usually been compared to cuprates and MgB2, and the methodology of research developed by them have been implemented to IBSs. As a result, many similarities between IBSs and cuprates have been revealed, e.g., the parent compounds being antiferromagnets and grain boundaries being weak-links to some extent. On the other hands, the distinct features of IBSs are highlighted as multiband superconductors (i.e., the 5 bands of Fe 3d orbital crossing Fermi level) and extended s-wave symmetry. Additionally, some of the IBSs are topological superconductors that can be possible platforms for quantum computing. In this paper, an overview of IBS research and development in the last 18 years will be reported, involving characteristics of IBSs as well as strategies of increasing the superconducting transition temperature and critical current density.

TI On-chip deterministic arbitrary-phase-controlling
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The stable on-chip deterministic arbitrary-phase-controlling of signal light in micro/nanometer spatial scale is an extremely important basis for large-scale and high-density integrated photonic information processing chips. Conventional phase-controlling methods face with serious limitation of unavoidable crosstalk, length distortion, and fabrication error. To date, it is still a great challenge to achieve deterministic and wide-range on-chip arbitrary-phase-controlling. Here, we report an effective strategy of three-waveguide coupled configuration to realize on-chip deterministic arbitrary-phase-controlling (ranging from 0 to 2 pi) by combing the dynamic phase and the geometric phase. Based on this strategy, quantum gate operations in an optical permutation-group circuit are successfully realized in femtosecond-laser direct writing sample. To extend the feasibility of this method, on-chip silicon-based deterministic arbitrary-phase-controlling in the optical communication range is also experimentally verified. Our work not only paves the way for fundamental research in chip-scale novel optical devices but also promotes the study of topological quantum computing.

TI Enhancing thermoelectric output in a molecular heat engine utilizing
   Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Particle exchange heat engines are a novel class of cyclic heat engines that are all-electrical, contain no moving parts and can therefore be scaled down to nanometer size. At the center of their operation is the manipulation of a particle flow between a hot and a cold reservoir through energy filtering mechanisms, where their efficiency depends primarily on the sharpness of the energy filter. In this study, we investigate the efficiency enhancement of such engines by utilizing ultra-sharp transmission resonances formed by magnetic impurities interacting with superconductors, known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states. To this end, we couple a neutral and stable diradical molecule to superconducting break-junction electrodes, and study its thermoelectric properties at ultra-low temperatures. By driving the molecular heat engine through a phase transition from a Kondo state into the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime, we observe a five fold increase in the thermoelectric power factor. This observation could pave the way for practical applications such as cryogenic waste heat recovery and efficient spot-cooling for future quantum computing architectures.

TI Enhanced cryogenic magnetocaloric performance and the existence of
   short-range magnetic correlations in frustrated diamond geometries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The magnetocaloric effect in the cryogenic temperature regime has gained enormous attention due to its application in the field of cryogenic refrigeration technology, which is required for quantum computing, space sciences and basic research activities. In this context, Gd- and Dy-based frustrated systems are considered as promising cryogenic magnetocaloric materials. Hence, in this paper the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of GdTaO4, GdNbO4 and DyNbO4 are comprehensively investigated. Structural analysis suggests that these compounds crystallize in a monoclinic structure, wherein magnetic ions form an elongated diamond geometry. Analysis of magnetization, heat capacity and field-dependent magnetic entropy changes confirms the presence of short-range magnetic correlations in these compounds. Additionally, a remarkably large magnetic entropy change and relative cooling power are noted. The mechanical efficiency is found to be comparable to (or even better than) those reported for good magnetic refrigerants. Our study suggests that GdTaO4, GdNbO4 and DyNbO4 can be regarded as promising cryogenic magnetic refrigerant materials.

TI Observation of In-Gap States in a Two-Dimensional
   CrI2/NbSe2 Heterostructure
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Low-dimensional magnetic structures coupled with superconductors are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes, which have potential applications in topological quantum computing. Here, we report a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic-superconducting heterostructure consisting of single-layer chromium diiodide (CrI2) on a niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Single-layer CrI2 nanosheets, which hold antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states by our first-principles calculations, were epitaxially grown on the layered NbSe2 substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observed robust in-gap states spatially located at the edge of the nanosheets and defect-induced zero-energy peaks inside the CrI2 nanosheets. Magnetic-flux vortices induced by an external field exhibit broken 3-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine NbSe2 superconductor, implying the efficient modulation of the interfacial superconducting states by the epitaxial CrI2 layer. A phenomenological model suggests the existence of chiral edge states in a 2D AFM-superconducting hybrid system with an even Chern number, providing a qualitatively plausible understanding for our experimental observation.

TI Unveiling the evolution of light within photonic integrated circuits
SO OPTICA
AB Silicon photonics leverages mature semiconductor technology to produce cost-effective and high-performance components for various applications in data centers, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. While the geometry of photonic integrated circuits can be characterized by existing means, their optimal and accurate performance requires detailed characterization of the light propagating within them. Here we demonstrate the first, to our knowledge, direct visualization of the light as it travels inside photonic integrated circuits. We employ the natural nonlinear optical properties of silicon to directly map the electric field of the waves guided inside the integrated circuits, characterizing waveguides and multimode splitters while extracting various parameters of the device-all in real-time and in a noninvasive manner. Our approach for visualizing light inside photonic circuits is the only solution directly providing such information without any overhead or penalty, potentially making it a crucial component for the characterization of photonic circuitry, toward their improved design, fabrication, and optimization.

TI A hybrid quantum image edge detector for the NISQ era
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Edges are image locations where the gray value intensity changes suddenly. They are among the most important features to understand and segment an image. Edge detection is a standard task in digital image processing, solved, for example, using filtering techniques. However, the amount of data to be processed grows rapidly and pushes even supercomputers to their limits. Quantum computing promises exponentially lower memory usage in terms of the number of qubits compared to the number of classical bits. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for quantum edge detection based on the idea of a quantum artificial neuron. Our method can be practically implemented on quantum computers, especially on those of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We compare six variants of the method to reduce the number of circuits and thus the time required for the quantum edge detection. Taking advantage of the scalability of our method, we can practically detect edges in images considerably larger than reached before.

TI Countermeasure Against Quantum Hacking Using Detection Statistics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Detector blinding attacks have been proposed in the last few years, and they could potentially threaten the security of quantum key distribution systems. Even though such attacks are technically challenging to implement, it is important to consider countermeasures to avoid information leakage. In this paper, we present a countermeasure against these kinds of attacks based on the use of multipixel detectors. We show that with this method, we are able to estimate an upper bound on the information an eavesdropper could have on the key exchanged. Finally, we test a multipixel detector based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to show it can fulfill all the requirements for our countermeasure to be effective.

TI Experimental Investigation of Uncertainty Relations for Non-Hermitian
   Operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Uncertainty relations for Hermitian operators have been confirmed through many experiments. However, previous experiments have only tested the special case of non-Hermitian operators, i.e., uncertainty relations for unitary operators. In this study, we explore uncertainty relations for general non-Hermitian operators, which include Hermitian and unitary operators as special cases. We perform experiments with both real and complex non-Hermitian operators for qubit states, and confirm the validity of the uncertainty relations within the experimental error. Our results provide experimental evidence of uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators. Furthermore, our methods for realizing and measuring non-Hermitian operators are valuable in characterizing open-system dynamics and enhancing parameter estimation.

TI Non-Contact Characterization of Two-Dimensional Electron Gas by Using
   Circularly Polarized TE11n Modes
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS
AB Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are essential not only for modern electronics but also for the advancement of next-generation communication technologies and quantum computing. Here, we report a non-contact method for characterizing material parameters of 2DEGs using circularly polarized TE11n modes. By developing an excitation method utilizing a circular patch antenna with an adjustable coupling hole, we enable the use of higher-order modes up to TE117, while minimizing the effects of cylindrical symmetry breaking. This method is demonstrated by measuring the magnetic field dependence of microwave conductivities in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction at 300 K and 77 K. The electron mobility obtained by fitting to the Drude model is in good agreement with the results from standard Hall measurements. Additionally, the signature of cyclotron resonance is clearly observed at 77 K, and the effective electron mass is successfully estimated. The present method could accelerate fundamental research and device development using various 2DEGs.

TI Estimating Eigenenergies from Quantum Dynamics: A Unified
   Noise-Resilient Measurement-Driven Approach
SO QUANTUM
AB Ground state energy estimation in physical, chemical, and materials sciences is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid approach that finds the eigenenergies by collecting real-time measurements and post-processing them using the machinery of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). From the perspective of quantum dynamics, we establish that our approach can be formally understood as a stable variational method on the function space of observables available from a quantum many-body system. We also provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that our method converges rapidly even in the presence of a large degree of perturbative noise, and show that the method bears an isomorphism to robust matrix factorization methods developed independently across various scientific communities. Our numerical benchmarks on spin and molecular systems demonstrate an accelerated convergence and a favorable resource reduction over state-of-the-art algorithms. The DMD-centric strategy can systematically mitigate noise and stands out as a leading hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver.

TI Cryogenic temperature 3D mapping via a distributed temperature sensor
   with centimeter resolution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We conduct 3D mapping of cryogenic temperatures via a Raman-based distributed temperature sensor, employing standard telecom single-mode fibers and polarization-independent superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). By coiling a test fiber around various stages of a liquid helium cooled cryostat, our device demonstrates a lower temperature sensing limit of (48 +/- 2) K, below the nitrogen boiling point. This achievement is made possible by the low dark count rates of SNSPDs, as validated by theoretical simulations. Furthermore, we utilize our device to map cryogenic temperatures on the 350 cm2 2 surface of a specially designed hollow cylindrical aluminum sample, accommodating approximately 2 m of standard single-mode optical fiber. During nitrogen cooling, we monitor the temporal evolution of the spatially dependent temperature gradient on the metallic sample with a temporal sampling down to one minute. Fiber-based distributed temperature sensing with centimetric spatial resolution can be effectively applied for 3D mapping at cryogenic temperatures of superconducting, quantum computing and aerospace instrumentation.

TI Floating Block Method for Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are powerful and versatile tools for the quantum many-body problem. In addition to the usual calculations of energies and eigenstate observables, quantum Monte Carlo simulations can in principle be used to build fast and accurate many-body emulators using eigenvector continuation or design time-dependent Hamiltonians for adiabatic quantum computing. These new applications require something that is missing from the published literature, an efficient quantum Monte Carlo scheme for computing the inner product of ground state eigenvectors corresponding to different Hamiltonians. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called the floating block method, which solves the problem by performing Euclidean time evolution with two different Hamiltonians and interleaving the corresponding time blocks. We use the floating block method and nuclear lattice simulations to build eigenvector continuation emulators for energies of He-4, Be-8, C-12, and O-16 nuclei over a range of local and nonlocal interaction couplings. From the emulator data, we identify the quantum phase transition line from a Bose gas of alpha particles to a nuclear liquid.

TI Topographic signatures and manipulations of Fe atoms, CO molecules and

SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Topological superconductivity emerging in one-or two-dimensional hybrid materials is predicted as a key ingredient for quantum computing. However, not only the design of complex heterostructures is primordial for future applications but also the characteriza-tion of their electronic and structural properties at the atomic scale using the most advanced scanning probe microscopy techniques with functionalized tips. We report on the topographic signatures observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of carbon monoxide (CO) molecules, iron (Fe) atoms and sodium chloride (NaCl) islands deposited on superconducting Pb(111). For the CO adsorption a comparison with the Pb(110) substrate is demonstrated. We show a general propensity of these adsorbates to diffuse at low temperature under gentle scanning conditions. Our findings provide new insights into high-resolution probe microscopy imaging with terminated tips, decoupling atoms and molecules by NaCl islands or tip-induced lateral manipulation of iron atoms on top of the prototypical Pb(111) superconducting surface.

TI Fledgling Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Pseudo Gap Phase of Bi2212
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We studied the emergence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states for the pseudo-gap (PG) phase of Bi2212 bilayer system, assumed to be D-density wave (DDW) ordered, starting with a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) armed, and the time reversal symmetry (TRS) complaint Bloch Hamiltonian. The presence of strong SOC gives rise to non-trivial, spin-momentum locked spin texture tunable by electric field. The emergence of quantum anomalous Hall effect with TRS broken Chiral DDW Hamiltonian of Das Sarma et al. is found to be possible.

TI Coherent Gate Operations in Hybrid Magnonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electromagnonics-the hybridization of spin excitations and electromagnetic waves-has been recognized as a promising candidate for coherent information processing in recent years. Among its various implementations, the lack of available approaches for real-time manipulation on the system dynamics has become a common and urgent limitation. In this work, by introducing a fast and uniform modulation technique, we successfully demonstrate a series of benchmark coherent gate operations in hybrid magnonics, including semiclassical analogies of Landau-Zener transitions, Rabi oscillations, Ramsey interference, and controlled mode swap operations. Our approach lays the groundwork for dynamical manipulation of coherent signals in hybrid magnonics and can be generalized to a broad range of applications.

TI Maximum-power heat engines and refrigerators in the fast-driving regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the optimization of the performance of arbitrary periodically driven thermal machines. Within the assumption of fast modulation of the driving parameters, we derive the optimal cycle that universally maximizes the extracted power of heat engines, the cooling power of refrigerators, and in general any linear combination of the heat currents. We denote this optimal solution as "generalized Otto cycle" since it shares the basic structure with the standard Otto cycle, but it is characterized by a greater number of fast strokes. We bound this number in terms of the dimension of the Hilbert space of the system used as working fluid. The generality of these results allows for a widespread range of applications, such as reducing the computational complexity for numerical approaches, or obtaining the explicit form of the optimal protocols when the system-baths interactions are characterized by a single thermalization scale. In this case, we compare the thermodynamic performance of a collection of optimally driven noninteracting and interacting qubits. Remarkably, for refrigerators the noninteracting qubits perform almost as well as the interacting ones, while in the heat engine case there is a many-body advantage both in the maximum power, and in the efficiency at maximum power. Additionally, we illustrate our general results studying the paradigmatic model of a qutrit-based heat engine. Our results strictly hold in the semiclassical case in which no coherence is generated by the driving, and finally we discuss the noncommuting case.

TI Quantum-inspired grey wolf optimizer for rapid lithium-ion battery
   parameter identification in electric vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB An accurate battery model is crucial for achieving efficient battery management. However, traditional parameter identification methods have limitations on dealing with the nonlinear characteristics of batteries, resulting in low identification accuracy and long identification cycles. To address this problem, this paper proposes a battery equivalent circuit model parameter identification method based on an improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (Q-DO-GWO). This method through incorporating the local development strategy from the ascending phase of the dandelion optimization (DO) into the convergence factor, and Brownian motion from the descending phase of DO into the individual movement trajectory of the GWO, enhances the exploration capability in global search. The Q-DO-GWO algorithm, through quantum encoding of the initial population and quantum rotation gate updates of population position, enables this method rapid convergence to the global optimal solution. Simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method on the accuracy and speed of battery parameter identification over other three state-of-the-art intelligent optimization algorithms.

TI Quantum-safe mutual authentication scheme for IoHT using blockchain
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) has revolutionized healthcare by enabling seamless communication and interaction among medical devices. However, it faces critical security challenges, including threats to sensitive medical data and the vulnerability of traditional cryptographic methods to quantum computing. To address these issues, we propose a novel quantum-safe mutual authentication scheme utilizing a module lattice-based blockchain architecture. The proposed method ensures secure and decentralized interactions among healthcare participants, including doctors, patients, and cloud servers, while safeguarding data integrity and privacy against quantum threats. Formal security analysis using the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, ProVerif tool and informal assessments confirm its resistance to diverse attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, replay, and stolen device attacks. Performance evaluations reveal significant reductions in average latency, with a decrease from 31.7 seconds to 9.1 seconds across iterations, a 62% increase in computation throughput, and an improvement in transaction processing efficiency by 36%. Additionally, the framework enhances data throughput by 40%, demonstrating its effectiveness for secure, efficient, and quantum-safe IoHT systems.

TI Tunable hexagonal boron nitride topological optical delay line in the
   visible region
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Tunability, ultracompact design, high group index, low loss, and broad bandwidth are desired properties for integrated optical delay lines (ODLs). However, those properties are challenging to achieve simultaneously in the visible region. This paper proposes a tunable hexagonal boron nitride topological optical delay line (ODL) in the visible region based on valley photonic crystals. The topological edge state from the beard-type boundary allows the achievement of an ultralow group velocity close to zero, which results in a large group index of 629 at 645 nm. Moreover, we demonstrate tuning of the slow-light wavelength and optical delay times with electrically tunable liquid crystals by applying external voltage. The device has an ultracompact size of 5 mu m x 2.7 mu m with an optical delay distance of 25a (a is the lattice constant) and a delay time of 12 ps. Our design can provide a new possibility for designing ODLs working in the visible region for optical communication and quantum computing systems.

TI Surface Topological Plexcitons: Strong Coupling in a
   Bi2Se3 Topological Insulator Nanoparticle-Quantum
   Dot Molecule
SO OPTICS
AB Strong coupling of quantum states with electromagnetic modes of topological matter offer an interesting platform for the exploration of new physics and applications. In this work, we report a novel hybrid mode, a surface topological plexciton, arising from strong coupling between the surface topological plasmon mode of a Bi2Se3 topological insulator nanoparticle and the exciton of a two-level quantum emitter. We study the power absorption spectrum of the system by working within the dipole and rotating-wave approximations, using a density matrix approach for the emitter, and a classical dielectric-function approach for the topological-insulator nanoparticle. We show that a Rabi-type splitting can appear in the spectrum suggesting the presence of strong coupling. Furthermore, we study the dependence of the splitting on the separation of the two nanoparticles as well as the dipole moment of the quantum emitter. These results can be useful for exploring exotic phases of matter, furthering research in topological insulator plasmonics, as well as for applications in the far-infrared and quantum computing.

TI Quantum optics with Rydberg superatoms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum optics based on highly excited atoms, also known as Rydberg atoms, has cemented itself as a powerful platform for the manipulation of light at the few-photon level. The Rydberg blockade, resulting from the strong interaction between individual Rydberg atoms, can turn a large ensemble of atoms into a system which collectively resembles a single two-level emitter, a so-called Rydberg superatom. The coupling of this artificial emitter to a driving photonic mode is collectively enhanced by Rydberg interactions, enabling strong coherent coupling at the few-photon level in free-space. The exquisite level of control achievable through this has already demonstrated its utility in applications of quantum computing and information processing. Here, we review the derivation of the collective coupling between a Rydberg superatom and a single light mode and discuss the similarity of this free-space setup to waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems of quantum emitters coupled to photonic waveguides. We also briefly review applications of Rydberg superatoms to quantum optics such as single-photon generation and single-photon subtraction.

TI Magnetic molecules as local sensors of topological hysteresis of
   superconductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconductors and magnetic materials, including molecules, are key ingredients for quantum computing and spintronics. However, only a little is known about how these materials interact in multilayer nanostructures like the hybrid architectures nowadays under development for such advanced applications. Here, we show that a single layer of magnetic molecules, Terbium(III) bis-phthalocyaninato (TbPc2) complexes, deposited under controlled UHV conditions on a superconducting Pb(111) surface is sensitive to the topology of the intermediate state of the superconductor, namely to the presence and evolution of superconducting and normal domains due to screening and penetration of an external magnetic field. The topological hysteresis of the superconducting substrate imprints a local evolution of the magnetisation of the TbPc2 molecules in the monolayer. Element and surface selective detection is achieved by recording the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism of the Tb atoms. This study reveals the impressive potential of magnetic molecules for sensing local magnetic field variations in molecular/superconductor hybrid devices, including spin resonators or spin injecting and spin filtering components for spintronics applications.

TI Efficient Coalition Structure Generation via Approximately Equivalent
   Induced Subgraph Games
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB We show that any characteristic function game (CFG) G can be always turned into an approximately equivalent game represented using the induced subgraph game (ISG) representation. Such a transformation incurs obvious benefits in terms of tractability of computing solution concepts for G. Our transformation approach, namely, AE-ISG, is based on the solution of a norm approximation problem. We then propose a novel coalition structure generation (CSG) approach for ISGs that is based on graph clustering, which outperforms existing CSG approaches for ISGs by using off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the value of the optimal CSG solution of G with respect to the optimal CSG solution of the approximately equivalent ISG. As a consequence, our approach allows one to compute approximate CSG solutions with quality guarantees for any CFG. Results on a real-world application domain show that our approach outperforms a domain-specific CSG algorithm, both in terms of quality of the solutions and theoretical quality guarantees.

TI Security Requirements and Challenges of 6G Technologies and Applications
SO SENSORS
AB After implementing 5G technology, academia and industry started researching 6th generation wireless network technology (6G). 6G is expected to be implemented around the year 2030. It will offer a significant experience for everyone by enabling hyper-connectivity between people and everything. In addition, it is expected to extend mobile communication possibilities where earlier generations could not have developed. Several potential technologies are predicted to serve as the foundation of 6G networks. These include upcoming and current technologies such as post-quantum cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), enhanced edge computing, molecular communication, THz, visible light communication (VLC), and distributed ledger (DL) technologies such as blockchain. From a security and privacy perspective, these developments need a reconsideration of prior security traditional methods. New novel authentication, encryption, access control, communication, and malicious activity detection must satisfy the higher significant requirements of future networks. In addition, new security approaches are necessary to ensure trustworthiness and privacy. This paper provides insights into the critical problems and difficulties related to the security, privacy, and trust issues of 6G networks. Moreover, the standard technologies and security challenges per each technology are clarified. This paper introduces the 6G security architecture and improvements over the 5G architecture. We also introduce the security issues and challenges of the 6G physical layer. In addition, the AI/ML layers and the proposed security solution in each layer are studied. The paper summarizes the security evolution in legacy mobile networks and concludes with their security problems and the most essential 6G application services and their security requirements. Finally, this paper provides a complete discussion of 6G networks' trustworthiness and solutions.

TI Widely tunable and narrow-linewidth violet lasers enabled by
   UV-transparent materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Embedding multi-wavelength lasers in photonic waveguide circuits is of interest for next-generation ion traps, such as for miniaturizing optical clocks or upscaling ion-based quantum computing. Critically, this path involves photonic integration of highly coherent lasers in the ultraviolet (UV) range, which is presently obstructed by the transparency limit of materials used in established integrated waveguides. Here, we demonstrate the first integrated, extended cavity diode laser based solely on UV-transparent materials. We integrate aluminum oxide waveguide circuits with gallium nitride amplifiers to generate milliwatt-level on-chip output power near the ultraviolet range. The extended cavity approach allows for wide wavelength coverage and precise frequency control, which is demonstrated by tuning mode-hop-free to a Sr-transition frequency. Due to the inherent stability of photonic circuits and UV-compatible integration, the intrinsic laser linewidth reaches a record-low value around 300 kHz with better than 43-dB side-mode suppression. These results announce the viability of a novel class of integrated lasers that opens access to the UV.

TI PSR: An Improvement of Lightweight Cryptography Algorithm for Data
   Security in Cloud Computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Data security in cloud storage is a pressing concern as organizations increasingly rely on cloud computing services. Transitioning to cloud-based solutions underscores the need to safeguard sensitive information against data breaches and unauthorized access. Traditional cryptography algorithms are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and mathematical breakthroughs, necessitating large key sizes for security. Moreover, they lack resilience against emerging quantum computing threats, posing a significant risk to encryption. To tackle these issues, this study presents a novel lightweight cryptography algorithm named as PSR which is aimed at encryption so as to improve data security before storage in cloud systems. The proposed system converts 128 bit plaintext to cipher by employing techniques such as substitution, ASCII and hexadecimal conversions, block-wise transformations including Rail Fence, Grey Code, and XOR operations with random prime numbers. Notably, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance with minimal runtime and memory usage, satisfying the avalanche effect criterion with anoteworthy efficacy in all executions and resistant to brute force attack

AB As network service requirements and computational complexity continue to increase, efficient resource management and optimization techniques are essential to ensure performance and scalability. In the context of edge cloud networks, there are computational challenges associated with optimal path selection and resource allocation. This paper explores the integration of quantum computing with dynamic programming (DP) to solve path optimization problems in network service orchestration. More specifically, we investigate two approaches to DP: the classical DP method, which provides exact solutions by systematically evaluating all possible states, and a quantum-enhanced version, which uses the Grover search algorithm to accelerate for performance comparisons in terms of accuracy and execution times. Simulation results provide insights into the comparative performance of classical and quantum DP approaches, with an emphasis on search time improvements. Beyond computational performance, we discuss practical considerations including the constraints of current quantum hardware, algorithmic efficiency improvements, scalability challenges, and integration with classical systems. Additionally, we evaluate energy efficiency, cost-benefit trade-offs, resilience, and regulatory concerns associated with quantum-enabled service orchestration.

TI Plasmonic Modulators in Cryogenic Environment Featuring Bandwidths in
   Excess of 100 GHz and Reduced Plasmonic Losses
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Cryogenic quantum applications have a demand for an ever-higher number of interconnects and bandwidth. Photonic links are foreseen to offer data transfer with high bandwidth, low heat load, and low noise to enable the next-generation scalable quantum computing systems. However, they require high-speed and energy-efficient modulators operating at cryogenic temperatures for electro-optic signal conversion. Here, plasmonic organic electro-optic modulators operating at 4 K are demonstrated with a >100 GHz bandwidth, drive voltages as low as 96 mV, and a significant reduction in plasmonic propagation losses by over 40% compared to room temperature. Up to 160 Gbit/s and 256 Gbit/s cryogenic electro-optic signal conversion are demonstrated by performing data experiments using a plasmonic Mach-Zehnder modulator at around 1528 nm and a plasmonic ring-resonator modulator at around 1285 nm, respectively. This work shows that plasmonic modulators are ideally suited for future high-speed, scalable, and energy-efficient photonic interconnects in cryogenic environments.

TI Metasurface optical trap array for single atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Metasurfaces made of subwavelength silicon nanopillars provide unparalleled capacity to manipulate light, and have emerged as one of the leading platforms for developing integrated photonic devices. In this study, we report on a compact, passive approach based on planar metasurface optics to generate large optical trap arrays. The unique configuration is achieved with a meta -hologram to convert a single incident laser beam into an array of individual beams, followed up with a metalens to form multiple laser foci for single rubidium atom trapping. We experimentally demonstrate two-dimensional arrays of 5 x 5 and 25 x 25 at the wavelength of 830 nm, validating the capability and scalability of our metasurface design. Beam waists similar to 1.5 mu m, spacings (about 15 mu m), and low trap depth variations (8%) of relevance to quantum control for an atomic array are achieved in a robust and efficient fashion. The presented work highlights a compact, stable, and scalable trap array platform well -suitable for Rydberg-state mediated quantum gate operations, which will further facilitate advances in neutral atom quantum computing.

TI A Benchmark of Cryo-CMOS Embedded SRAM/DRAMs in 40-nm CMOS
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB The interface electronics needed for quantum processors require cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) embedded digital memories covering a wide range of specifications. To identify the optimum architecture for each specific application, this article presents a benchmark from room temperature (RT) down to 4.2 K of custom SRAMs/DRAMs in the same 40-nm CMOS process. To deal with the significant variations in device parameters at cryogenic temperatures, such as the increased threshold voltage, lower subthreshold leakage, and increased variability, the feasibility of different memories at cryogenic temperature is assessed and specific guidelines for cryogenic memory design are drafted. Unlike at RT, the 2T low-threshold-voltage (LVT) DRAM at 4.2 K is up to 2x more power efficient than both SRAMs for any access rate above 75 kHz since the lower leakage increases the retention time by 40,000 x , thus sharply cutting on the refresh power and showing the potential of cryo-CMOS DRAMs in cryogenic applications.

TI High-Efficiency Multilevel Volume Diffraction Gratings inside Silicon
SO ACS MATERIALS AU
AB Silicon (Si)-based integrated photonics is considered to play a pivotal role in multiple emerging technologies, including telecommunications, quantum computing, and lab-chip systems. Diverse functionalities are either implemented on the wafer surface ("on-chip") or recently within the wafer ("in-chip") using laser lithography. However, the emerging depth degree of freedom has been exploited only for single-level devices in Si. Thus, monolithic and multilevel discrete functionality is missing within the bulk. Here, we report the creation of multilevel, high-efficiency diffraction gratings in Si using three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear laser lithography. To boost device performance within a given volume, we introduce the concept of effective field enhancement at half the Talbot distance, which exploits self-imaging onto discrete levels over an optical lattice. The novel approach enables multilevel gratings in Si with a record efficiency of 53%, measured at 1550 nm. Furthermore, we predict a diffraction efficiency approaching 100%, simply by increasing the number of levels. Such volumetric Si-photonic devices represent a significant advance toward 3D-integrated monolithic photonic chips.

TI Silicene: Genesis, remarkable discoveries, and legacy
SO MATERIALS TODAY ADVANCES
AB In the realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials, besides the ones initially peeled from lamellar crystals, the artificial emerging elemental ones, called Xenes, appear as strong contenders to graphene in a booming new field. The very first synthetic Xene was silicene, created in 2012. On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, this concise review, describes the birth of silicene, in situ, under ultra-high vacuum, and surveys its most tantalizing properties: its Dirac features, its 2D topological insulator character, its easy functionalization, its insertion as atom-thin channel in Field Effect Transistors operating at room temperature. Silicene has striking variants and amazing doubles in the quantum world; these lookalikes are briefly described and their origins discussed. We owe to silicene the legacy of all its descendants from borophene to tellurene, and fascinating prospects for spintronics, the emergence and control of Majorana fermions, possibly for quantum computing.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

   Polarization at Room Temperature
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Characterizing and manipulating the circular polarization of light is central to numerous emerging technologies, including spintronics and quantum computing. Separately, monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a versatile material that has demonstrated promise in a variety of applications, including single photon emitters and valleytronics. Here, we demonstrate a method to tune the photoluminescence (PL) intensity (factor of x161), peak position (38.4 meV range), circular polarization (39.4% range), and valley polarization of a Bi2Se3-WS2 2D heterostructure using a low-power laser (0.762 mu W) in ambient conditions. Changes are spatially confined to the laser spot, enabling submicrometer (814 nm) features, and are long-term stable (>334 days). PL and valley polarization changes can be controllably reversed through laser exposure in a vacuum, allowing the material to be erased and reused. Atmospheric experiments and first-principles calculations indicate oxygen diffusion modulates the exciton radiative vs nonradiative recombination pathways, where oxygen absorption leads to brightening and desorption to darkening.

AB The secure command & control (C&C) of mobile agents arises in various settings including unmanned aerial vehicles, single pilot operations in commercial settings, and mobile robots to name a few. As more and more of these applications get integrated into aerospace and defense use cases, the security of the communication channel between the ground station and the mobile agent is of increasing importance. The development of quantum computing devices poses a unique threat to secure communications due to the vulnerability of asymmetric ciphers to Shor's algorithm. Given the active development of new quantum resistant encryption techniques, we report the first integration of post-quantum secure encryption schemes with robotic operating system (ROS) and C&C of mobile agents, in general. We integrate these schemes in the application and network layers and study the performance of these methods by comparing them to present-day security schemes such as the widely used RSA algorithm.

TI Electronic properties of the bulk and surface states of
   Fe1+yTe1-xSex
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB The idea of employing non-Abelian statistics for error-free quantum computing ignited interest in reports of topological surface superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in FeTe0.55Se0.45. However, the topological features and superconducting properties are not observed uniformly across the sample surface. The understanding and practical control of these electronic inhomogeneities present a prominent challenge for potential applications. Here, we combine neutron scattering, scanning angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and microprobe composition and resistivity measurements to characterize the electronic state of Fe1+yTe1-xSex. We establish a phase diagram in which the superconductivity is observed only at sufficiently low Fe concentration, in association with distinct antiferromagnetic correlations, whereas the coexisting topological surface state occurs only at sufficiently high Te concentration. We find that FeTe0.55Se0.45 is located very close to both phase boundaries, which explains the inhomogeneity of superconducting and topological states. Our results demonstrate the compositional control required for use of topological MZMs in practical applications.
   The compositional dependence of magnetic, superconducting and topological surface states on an iron-based superconductor is reported.

TI Mutual information maximizing quantum generative adversarial networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the most promising applications in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which offer significant quantum advantages over classical machine learning in various domains. However, QGANs suffer from mode collapse and lack explicit control over the features of generated outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfoQGAN, a novel quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial network that integrates the principles of InfoGAN with a QGAN architecture. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit for data generation, a classical discriminator, and a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to explicitly optimize the mutual information between latent codes and generated samples. Numerical simulations on synthetic 2D distributions and Iris dataset augmentation demonstrate that InfoQGAN effectively mitigates mode collapse while achieving robust feature disentanglement in the quantum generator. By leveraging these advantages, InfoQGAN not only enhances training stability but also improves data augmentation performance through controlled feature generation. These results highlight the potential of InfoQGAN as a foundational approach for advancing quantum generative modeling in the NISQ era.

TI Transformation-Free Generation of a Quasi-Diabatic Representation from

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB In the present work, we examine how the recent quantum-computing algorithm known as the state-average orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE), viewed within the context of quantum chemistry as a type of multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) electronic-structure approach, exhibits a propensity to produce an ab initio quasi-diabatic representation "for free" if considered as a least-transformed block-diagonalization procedure, as alluded to in our previous work (Yalouz, S. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 776-794) and thoroughly assessed herein. To this end, we introduce intrinsic and residual descriptors of diabaticity and re-explore the definition and linear-algebra properties, as well as their consequences on the vibronic nonadiabatic couplings, of an optimal diabatic representation within this context and how much one may deviate from it. Such considerations are illustrated numerically in the prototypical case of formaldimine, which presents a well-known conical intersection between its ground and first-excited singlet electronic states.

TI Relation between 4f-magnetism and the low-temperature magnetocaloric
   effect in multiferroic hexagonal manganites
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The magnetocaloric effect enables magnetic refrigeration and plays an important role for cooling at cryogenic temperatures, which is essential for emergent technologies such as hydrogen liquefaction and quantum computing. Here, we study the origin of the low-temperature magnetocaloric effect in multiferroic hexagonal manganites. By conducting direct adiabatic temperature measurements in pulsed magnetic fields exceeding 20 T on different RMnO3 systems with varying magnetic 4f-moments (i.e., R = Y, Ho, Er, and Tm), we demonstrate significant magnetic-field-driven reversible temperature changes, Delta Tad. Our data show that the effect is predominantly driven by the rare-earth magnetism, scaling with the effective magnetic moment of the R atom. The largest reversible temperature change is observed in HoMnO3 with Delta Tad of up to 20.1 K, whereas the effect is largely suppressed in YMnO3. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the 4f-magnetism for the magnetocaloric effect in hexagonal manganites, which is expected to be relevant for other magnetic oxide systems and their optimization for refrigeration applications at cryogenic temperature.

AB The recent decade has witnessed the rapid development of superconducting quantum computing in which its chips require to operate below 100 mK. The dilution refrigerator, which can operate continuously and stably and features the merits of low vibration and electromagnetic Interference, has become the enabling cooling technology for this purpose. There are two types of heat exchangers in the dilution refrigerator based on the effect of Kapitza resistance, namely the continuous and discrete heat exchangers. Their flow and heat transfer characteristics are crucial to the refrigerator's performance. In this paper, a numerical model of the heat exchangers in the dilution refrigerator is established, based on which the effects of dimensions, the Kapitza thermal resistance, and viscous heating on the cooling performance are investigated. The optimal parameters are given, and the cooling capacity of the dilution unit can be improved from 19 mu W to 25.2 mu W at 20 mK theoretically, which would provide a better temperature environment for quantum computers requiring more qubits.

SO JORDAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum dots are considered the cornerstone for the future of quantum computing, and understanding their properties and theories is essential for advancements in this vast field. The physical model is introduced for studying the spin-polarized electron currents through a quantum dot connected to a fixed spin impurity. This quantum dot is made of semiconductor material. The quantum dot features three energy levels, the fixed impurity has one energy level that exhibits different Zeeman splittings under an external magnetic field. A specific MATLAB program is used to solve the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and calculate the energy levels of the quantum dot and the fixed spin impurity. The values of energy levels are used to calculate the spin-polarized current and polarization. Furthermore, the MATLAB program is utilized to plot the relationship between energy levels and magnetic field strength to explain the effect of the magnetic field produced by the connection between the single quantum dot and the fixed spin.

TI A First Approach to Quantum Logical Shape Classification Framework
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum logic is a well-structured theory, which has recently received some attention because of its fundamental relation to quantum computing. However, the complex foundation of quantum logic borrowing concepts from different branches of mathematics as well as its peculiar settings have made it a non-trivial task to devise suitable applications. This article aims to propose for the first time an approach using quantum logic in image processing for shape classification. We show how to make use of the principal component analysis to realize quantum logical propositions. In this way, we are able to assign a concrete meaning to the rather abstract quantum logical concepts, and we are able to compute a probability measure from the principal components. For shape classification, we consider encrypting given point clouds of different objects by making use of specific distance histograms. This enables us to initiate the principal component analysis. Through experiments, we explore the possibility of distinguishing between different geometrical objects and discuss the results in terms of quantum logical interpretation.

TI Multiclass seismic damage detection of buildings using quantum
   convolutional neural network
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
AB The traditional visual inspection technique for damage assessment of buildings immediately after an earthquake can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and risky. Numerous studies have been carried out using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN), to evaluate the damage to building structures after an earthquake using buildings' damage images. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is a computing environment that can exploit superposition and entanglement, which are not available in classical computing environments, to achieve higher performance using parallelism between qubits. This paper presents a novel quantum CNN (QCNN) approach to detect damage to reinforced concrete (RC) buildings from images after the earthquake. The QCNN model is developed and trained using the RC building damaged images collected from past earthquakes. The performance of this model is evaluated based on the multiclass damage detection ability of the real-world RC building damaged images collected from the recent earthquake in Turkey in February 2023. Furthermore, the seismic damage detection accuracy obtained from the QCNN model is compared with various CNN architecture results.

AB As the AES is the standard symmetric cipher selected by NIST, is the best-known and the most widely used block cipher. Consequently, security threats are constantly rising and increasingly powerful. With the addition of the upcoming scenario of quantum computing, these threats have become a front-line concern in the crypto-community. Although is claimed that using larger key sizes in symmetric key algorithms for implementing quantum-resistant implementations is enough to counteract brute force attacks, this paper shows that both AES128 and AES-256 are vulnerable to Power Analysis attacks. This paper presents a security comparison against Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks over both AES 128-256. Through experimental attacks in FPGA AES implementations, results show that although AES-256 reaches a greater level of security than AES128, is still vulnerable to this kind of attack. Specifically, we have obtained 75% of the bytes needed to find the original key for AES-128 while only 28.125% for AES-256 by performing the same attack.

TI Manipulating Transverse Spin Angular Momentum with Symmetrically
   Modulated Hybridly Polarized Vector Optical Field
SO PHOTONICS
AB Transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) of photon, also known as 'photonic wheel', has attracted much attention, owing to its extraordinary properties and broad application prospect. Thus, it is essential to flexibly manipulate the transverse SAM in order to satisfy different needs. In this article, we design and generate a new kind of symmetrically modulated hybridly polarized vector optical field (SM-HP-VOF), and pure transverse SAM can be achieved based on the tightly focused SM-HP-VOF. Through adjusting the parameters of the SM-HP-VOF, the shape, intensity, and symmetry of the transverse SAM can be modulated. Moreover, by adding a segmented vortex phase distribution to the SM-HP-VOF, the transverse SAM becomes more concentrated and stronger, indicating that the orbital angular momentum can be a catalyst in modulating transverse SAM. Such results can provide a new avenue in studying and modulating transverse SAM, which would have potential applications in various areas including chip optical circuitry, optical quantum computing, and optical trapping and manipulation.

TI Exact bounds on the energy gap of transverse-field Ising chains by
   mapping to random walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Based on a relationship with continuous-time random walks discovered by Igloi, Turban, and Rieger [Phys. Rev. E 59, 1465 (1999)], we derive exact lower and upper bounds on the lowest energy gap of open transverse-field Ising chains, which are explicit in the parameters and are generally valid for arbitrary sets of possibly random couplings and fields. In the homogeneous chain and in the random chain with uncorrelated parameters, both the lower and upper bounds are found to show the same finite-size scaling in the ferromagnetic phase and at the critical point, demonstrating the ability of these bounds to infer the correct finite-size scaling of the critical gap. Applying the bounds to random transverse-field Ising chains with coupling-field correlations, a model which is relevant for adiabatic quantum computing, the finite-size scaling of the gap is shown to be related to that of sums of independent random variables. We determine the critical dynamical exponent of the model and reveal the existence of logarithmic corrections at special points.

AB Advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm have greatly improved the quality of services in the electricity industry through the integration of smart energy distribution and dependable electric devices. Conspicuously, the current research introduces a method for managing electricity consumption in smart residences using IoT-Fog technology, focusing on efficient energy allocation and real-time energy needs. The study specifically examines the effectiveness of electricity grid sub-stations in distributing energy using fog computing technology. By utilizing a quantum computing-assisted approach, optimal energy distribution is achieved by calculating a novel Electricity Usage Measure (EUM) based on actual energy usage patterns of smart homes. Furthermore, the Quantumized Neural Network (QiM-NN) technique is developed to forecast the electricity distribution over grid substations. For performance assessment, 4-month data are collected using four smart houses. Comparative analysis with existing data assessment techniques illustrates the effectiveness in terms of Temporal Delay (6.33 ms), Optimization Performance (Specificity (93.00%), Sensitivity (90.86%), Precision (96.66%), Coverage (96.66 %), Reliability (93.76%), and Stability (71%).

TI Brillouin zone folding driven bound states in the continuum
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-radiative bound states in the continuum (BICs) allow construction of resonant cavities with confined electromagnetic energy and high-quality (Q) factors. However, the sharp decay of the Q factor in the momentum space limits their usefulness for device applications. Here we demonstrate an approach to achieve sustainable ultrahigh Q factors by engineering Brillouin zone folding-induced BICs (BZF-BICs). All the guided modes are folded into the light cone through periodic perturbation that leads to the emergence of BZF-BICs possessing ultrahigh Q factors throughout the large, tunable momentum space. Unlike conventional BICs, BZF-BICs show perturbation-dependent dramatic enhancement of the Q factor in the entire momentum space and are robust against structural disorders. Our work provides a unique design path for BZF-BIC-based silicon metasurface cavities with extreme robustness against disorder while sustaining ultrahigh Q factors, offering potential applications in terahertz devices, nonlinear optics, quantum computing, and photonic integrated circuits.
   Periodic perturbations and guided mode engineering into Brillouin zone folding-induced bound states in the continuum resulted in ultrahigh Q factors that are both robust and sustainable across a broad range of tunable momentum space.

TI Discretized hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters and their chemical
   interconversion
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are of significant interest because of their unique photophysical properties, such as single-photon emission at room temperature, and promising applications in quantum computing and communications. The photoemission from hBN defects covers a wide range of emission energies but identifying and modulating the properties of specific emitters remain challenging due to uncontrolled formation of hBN defects. In this study, more than 2000 spectra are collected consisting of single, isolated zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) between 1.59 and 2.25 eV from diverse sample types. Most of ZPLs are organized into seven discretized emission energies. All emitters exhibit a range of lifetimes from 1 to 6 ns, and phonon sidebands offset by the dominant lattice phonon in hBN near 1370 cm(-1). Two chemical processing schemes are developed based on water and boric acid etching that generate or preferentially interconvert specific emitters, respectively. The identification and chemical interconversion of these discretized emitters should significantly advance the understanding of solid-state chemistry and photophysics of hBN quantum emission.

TI Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum <monospace>NAND</monospace>
   Tree
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.

TI Cryogenic photonic link using an extended-InGaAs photodiode and short
   pulse illumination toward high-fidelity drive of superconducting qubits
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We investigate short pulse illumination of a high-speed extended-InGaAs photodiode at cryogenic temperatures toward its use in control and readout of superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate high detector responsivity at 1550 nm illumination at 20 mK, a wavelength band unavailable to cryogenic standard InGaAs detectors due to the temperature-dependent bandgap shift. Second, we demonstrate an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the shot noise limit for cryogenic short optical pulse detection when compared with conventional modulated continuouswave laser detection. At 40 mu A of photocurrent and a detector temperature of 4 K, short pulse detection yields an SNR improvement of 20 dB and 3 dB for phase and amplitude quadratures, respectively. Last, we discuss how short pulse detection offers a path for signal multiplexing, with a demonstration of simultaneous production of microwave pulses at two different carrier frequencies. Together, these advancements establish a path toward low noise and power efficient multiplexed photonic links for quantum computing with a large number of superconducting qubits.

TI Optimizing the rodeo projection algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The rodeo algorithm has been proposed recently as an efficient method in quantum computing for projection of a given initial state onto a state of fixed energy for systems with discrete spectra. In the initial formulation of the rodeo algorithm, evolution times were chosen randomly via a Gaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation. In this paper, it is shown that such a random approach for choosing times suffers from exponentially large fluctuations in the suppression of unwanted components: as the number of iterations gets large, the distribution of suppression factors obtained from random selection approaches a log-normal distribution, leading to remarkably large fluctuations. We note that by choosing times intentionally rather than randomly, such fluctuations can be avoided and strict upper bounds on the suppression can be obtained. Moreover, the average suppression using fixed computational cost can be reduced by many orders of magnitude relative to the random algorithm. A key to doing this is to choose times that vary over exponentially many timescales, starting from a modest maximum scale and going down to timescales exponentially smaller.

Since the focus is on the readout via a single electron transistor (SET), the SET behavior and performance are first described and modeled, showing that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) theoretically achievable by a SET-based DC-readout is significantly beyond the state-of-the-art. Practical circuit architectures for implementing a DC-readout, such as the voltage amplifier, the transimpedance amplifier, the charge sampling, and the current pre-amplifier, are then analyzed by deriving their design equations and trade-offs. As a result, the practical performances of those different solutions are evaluated and compared, thus presenting clear selection criteria for the readout architecture and its design equations given the specific parameters of the SET sensor.

TI Quantum Inspired Adaptive Resource Management Algorithm for Scalable and
   Energy Efficient Fog Computing in Internet of Things (IoT)
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Effective resource management in the Internet of Things and fog computing is essential for efficient and scalable networks. However, existing methods often fail in dynamic and high-demand environments, leading to resource bottlenecks and increased energy consumption. This study aims to address these limitations by proposing the Quantum Inspired Adaptive Resource Management (QIARM) model, which introduces novel algorithms inspired by quantum principles for enhanced resource allocation. QIARM employs a quantum superposition-inspired technique for multi-state resource representation and an adaptive learning component to adjust resources in real time dynamically. In addition, an energy-aware scheduling module minimizes power consumption by selecting optimal configurations based on energy metrics. The simulation was carried out in a 360-minute environment with eight distinct scenarios. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired resource management framework that achieves up to 98% task offload success and reduces energy consumption by 20%, addressing critical challenges of scalability and efficiency in dynamic fog computing environments.

TI Synergic Effect of N and Se Facilitates Photoelectric Performance in
   Co-Hyperdoped Silicon
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Femtosecond-laser-fabricated black silicon has been widely used in the fields of solar cells, photodetectors, semiconductor devices, optical coatings, and quantum computing. However, the responsive spectral range limits its application in the near- to mid-infrared wavelengths. To further increase the optical responsivity in longer wavelengths, in this work, silicon (Si) was co-hyperdoped with nitrogen (N) and selenium (Se) through the deposition of Se films on Si followed by femtosecond (fs)-laser irradiation in an atmosphere of NF3. The optical and crystalline properties of the Si:N/Se were found to be influenced by the precursor Se film and laser fluence. The resulting photodetector, a product of this innovative approach, exhibited an impressive responsivity of 24.8 A/W at 840 nm and 19.8 A/W at 1060 nm, surpassing photodetectors made from Si:N, Si:S, and Si:S/Se (the latter two fabricated in SF6). These findings underscore the co-hyperdoping method's potential in significantly improving optoelectronic device performance.

TI Preserving Privacy of Internet of Things Network with Certificateless

AB With the rapid development of quantum computers and quantum computing, Internet of Things (IoT) networks equipped with traditional cryptographic algorithms have become very weak against quantum attacks. This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving problem in IoT networks and proposes a certificateless ring signature (CLRS) scheme. This CLRS is constructed with lattice theories, which show promising advantages in resisting quantum attacks. Meanwhile, the certificateless mechanism reduces the key control ability of the key generation center (KGC) by adding personal secret keys to the private key generated by the system. Meanwhile, the ring signature mechanism protects users' privacy information through a non-central control mechanism. Next, the security proof in a random oracle model is given, which shows that this CLRS scheme can obtain unforgeability and ensure the signer's anonymity. Its security properties include non-repudiation, traceability, and post-quantum security. Then, the efficiency comparison and performance results show that this CLRS scheme is more efficient and practical than similar schemes. Moreover, this work presents an exploration of the post-quantum cryptographic algorithm and its application in IoT networks.

AB The term crypto-agility means the ability to quickly and securely change cryptographic algorithms and related data, in the case of their compromise. In this context, the advent of quantum computing constitutes a new paradigm, which poses existential threats to current cryptographic algorithms. Even if these attacks are not an imminent danger, we must be prepared to change the cryptographic algorithms at risk with new, quantum resistant ones. This is by no means an easy task, because cryptographic algorithms are used everywhere and are often also implemented on the hardware. In this paper, we analyze the similarities and the differences between traditional agility and crypto-agility, and investigate the prospects of using agile and lean practices in the context of crypto-agility to introduce quantum resistant algorithms. In particular, for the main agile and lean practices we discuss if and how they can be useful for obtaining crypto-agility. We also investigate how the features key to crypto-agility can be helped by the agile and lean approach.

TI High-harmonic spectroscopy of quantum phase transitions in a high-Tc
   superconductor
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We report on the nonlinear optical signatures of quantum phase transitions in the high-temperature superconductor YBCO, observed through high harmonic generation. While the linear optical response of the material is largely unchanged when cooling across the phase transitions, the nonlinear optical response sensitively imprints two critical points, one at the critical temperature of the cuprate with the exponential growth of the surface harmonic yield in the superconducting phase and another critical point, which marks the transition from strange metal to pseudogap phase. To reveal the underlying microscopic quantum dynamics, a strong-field quasi-Hubbard model was developed, which describes the measured optical response dependent on the formation of Cooper pairs. Further, the theory provides insight into the carrier scattering dynamics and allows us to differentiate between the superconducting, pseudogap, and strange metal phases. The direct connection between nonlinear optical response and microscopic dynamics provides a powerful methodology to study quantum phase transitions in correlated materials. Further implications are light wave control over intricate quantum phases, light-matter hybrids, and application for optical quantum computing.

TI Cooling of an integrated Brillouin laser below the thermal limit
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonically integrated resonators are promising as a platform for enabling ultranarrow linewidth lasers in a compact form factor. Owing to their small size, these integrated resonators suffer from thermal noise that limits the frequency stability of the optical mode to similar to 100 kHz. Here, we demonstrate an integrated stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) laser based on a large mode-volume annulus resonator that realizes an ultranarrow thermal-noise-limited linewidth of 270 Hz. In practice, yet narrower linewidths are required before integrated lasers can be truly useful for applications such as optical atomic clocks, quantum computing, gravitational wave detection, and precision spectroscopy. To this end, we employ a thermorefractive noise suppression technique utilizing an auxiliary laser to reduce our SBS laser linewidth to 70 Hz. This demonstration showcases the possibility of stabilizing the thermal motion of even the narrowest linewidth chip lasers to below 100 Hz, thereby opening the door to making integrated microresonators practical for the most demanding future scientific endeavors.

TI Asymmetric Fraunhofer spectra in a topological insulator-based Josephson
   junction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Josephson junctions with topological insulators as their weak link (S-TI-S junctions) are predicted to host Majorana fermions, which are key to creating qubits for topologically protected quantum computing. But the details of the S-TI-S current-phase relation and its interplay with magnetic fields are not well understood. We fabricate a Bi2Se3 junction with NbTi leads and measure the Fraunhofer patterns of the junction with applied in-plane fields. We observe that asymmetric Fraunhofer patterns appear in the resistance maps of B (z) vs B (x,y) , with aperiodic node spacings. These asymmetric patterns appear even at zero parallel field and for temperatures up to 1 K. The anomalous features are compared to asymmetric Fraunhofer patterns expected for finite Cooper pair momentum shifts as well as geometric effects. We show that the geometric effects can dominate, independent of in-plane field magnitude. These results are important for differentiating geometrical phase shifts from those caused by Cooper pair momentum shifting, Majorana mode signatures, or other unconventional superconducting behavior.

TI Probing nonclassical light fields with energetic witnesses in waveguide
   quantum electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an operational scenario to characterize the nature of energy exchanges between two coupled but otherwise isolated quantum systems. Defining work as the component stemming from effective unitary interactions performed by each system on one another, the remnant is stored in the correlations and generally prevents full energy extraction by local operations. Focusing on the case of a qubit coupled to the light field of a waveguide, we establish a bound relating work exchange and local energy extraction when the light statistics is coherent, and that gets violated in the presence of a quantum light pulse. Our results provide operational, energy-based witnesses to probe nonclassical resources.

TI Coherent Control and Spectroscopy of a Semiconductor Quantum Dot Wigner
   Molecule
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots containing more than one electron have found wide application in qubits, where they enable readout and enhance polarizability. However, coherent control in such dots has typically been restricted to only the lowest two levels, and such control in the strongly interacting regime has not been realized. Here we report quantum control of eight different transitions in a silicon-based quantum dot. We use qubit readout to perform spectroscopy, revealing a dense set of energy levels with characteristic spacing far smaller than the single-particle energy. By comparing with full configuration interaction calculations, we argue that the dense set of levels arises from Wigner-molecule physics.

TI GeSn quantum wells as a platform for spin-resolved hole transport
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The nascent group IV GeSn alloys are highly attractive for spintronics applications, including quantum computing, due to their ability to enable highly scalable fabrication and all-electrical spin manipulation. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study of a two-dimensional hole gas in a Ge/GeSn quantum well, exhibiting the integer quantum Hall effect and distinct Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Emphasis is given to the determination of the Land & eacute; g-factor and its pronounced anisotropy in this two-dimensional system, revealing values significantly higher than those in conventional Ge or SiGe/Ge systems. Moreover, by modeling the spin-orbit interaction using the Iordanskii-Lyanda-Geller-Pikus theory, crucial cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction coefficients, are extracted and their significance is highlighted. This work provides the experimental validation of the theoretically predicted enhancements in spin-orbit interaction and g-factors in GeSn alloys compared to Ge. Additionally, it delivers essential parameters for the design of hole spin devices, such as hole qubits, utilizing GeSn-based structures on the Si platform.

TI Ellipticity-Controlled Exceptional Points and Cross-Polarized Phase
   Singularities in Multi-Layer Silicon Guided Mode Resonant Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Precise control over light polarization is critical for advancing technologies in telecommunications, quantum computing, and image sensing. However, existing methods for manipulating polarization around exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems have exclusively focused on circular polarization and work with reflected light. To address this limitation, a novel metasurface platform with high-Q resonators is developed that enables tunable control of polarization exceptional points across arbitrary ellipticity for transmitted light. This design employs orthogonally polarized guided mode resonators in a two-layer silicon metasurface, where careful tuning of the dipolar guided mode resonances (DGMRs) and layer spacing allows us to control the ellipticity of EPs. By leveraging high-quality factor resonances, strong orthogonal mode coupling over distances up to a quarter wavelength is achieved. This platform exhibits omnipolarizer behavior and the corresponding phase singularity can imprint phase shifts from 0 to 2 pi with small perturbations in the geometry. This approach opens new possibilities for polarization control and programmable wavefront shaping, offering significant potential for next-generation optical devices.

TI Optimizing ZX-diagrams with deep reinforcement learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB ZX-diagrams are a powerful graphical language for the description of quantum processes with applications in fundamental quantum mechanics, quantum circuit optimization, tensor network simulation, and many more. The utility of ZX-diagrams relies on a set of local transformation rules that can be applied to them without changing the underlying quantum process they describe. These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy, simulated annealing, and state-of-the-art hand-crafted algorithms. The use of graph neural networks to encode the policy of the agent enables generalization to diagrams much bigger than seen during the training phase.

TI Site-Dependent Properties of Quantum Emitters in Nanostructured Silicon
   Carbide
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Deep defects in silicon carbide (SiC) possess atomlike electronic, spin, and optical properties, making them ideal for quantum computing and sensing applications. In these applications, deep defects are often placed within fabricated nanostructures that modify defect properties due to surface and quantum confinement effects. Thus far, theoretical studies exploring deep defects in SiC have ignored these effects. Using density-functional theory, this work demonstrates site dependence of properties of bright negatively charged silicon monovacancies within a SiC nanowire. It is shown that the optical properties of defects depend strongly on the hybridization of the defect states with the surface states and on the structural changes allowed by proximity to the surfaces. Additionally, analysis of the first-principles results indicates that the charge-state conversion and/or migration to thermodynamically favorable undercoordinated surface sites can deteriorate deep-defect properties. These results illustrate the importance of considering how finite-size effects tune defect properties and of creating mitigating protocols to ensure the charge-state stability of a defect within nanostructured hosts.

TI Benzo-Extended Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Derivatives with Very

SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Open-shell non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are attracting increasing attention due to their promising applications in organic spintronics and quantum computing. Herein we report the synthesis of three cyclohepta[def]fluorene-based diradicaloids (1-3), by fusion of benzo rings on its periphery for the thermodynamic stabilization, as evidenced by multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, all of them display a very narrow optical energy gap (E-g(opt)=0.52-0.69 eV) and persistent stability under ambient conditions (t(1/2)=11.7-33.3 h). More importantly, this new type of diradicaloids possess a low-lying triplet state with an extremely small singlet-triplet energy gap, as low as 0.002 kcal mol(-1), with a clear dependence on the molecular size. This family of compounds thus offers a new route to create non-alternant open-shell PHs with high-spin ground states, and opens up novel possibilities and insights into understanding the structure-property relationships.

TI Variational Adiabatic Gauge Transformation on Real Quantum Hardware for
   Effective Low-Energy Hamiltonians and Accurate Diagonalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Effective low-energy theories represent powerful theoretical tools to reduce the complexity in modeling interacting quantum many-particle systems. However, common theoretical methods rely on perturbation theory, which limits their applicability to weak interactions. Here we introduce the Variational Adiabatic Gauge Transformation (VAGT), a nonperturbative hybrid quantum algorithm that can use nowadays quantum computers to learn the variational parameters of the unitary circuit that brings the Hamiltonian to either its block-diagonal or full-diagonal form. If a Hamiltonian can be diagonalized via a shallow quantum circuit, then VAGT can learn the optimal parameters using a polynomial number of runs. The accuracy of VAGT is tested through numerical simulations, as well as simulations on Rigetti and IonQ quantum computers.

TI Parafermions in moiré minibands
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Moir & eacute; materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at zero magnetic field have been experimentally demonstrated, and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here, we provide telltale evidence based on many-body exact diagonalization for the even more exotic possibility of moir & eacute;-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations. In particular, we obtain low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow, many-body Chern numbers, and entanglement spectra consistent with the Z3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{3}$$\end{document} Read-Rezayi parafermion phase in an exemplary moir & eacute; system with tunable quantum geometry.

TI Superconductivity at Interfaces in Cuprate-Manganite Superlattices
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB One of the unsolved problems for using high-T-c superconducting cuprates for spintronic applications are the short coherence lengths of Cooper pairs in oxides (a few angstrom), which requires atomically sharp and defect-free interfaces. This research demonstrates the presence of high-T-c superconducting La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 in direct proximity to SrLaMnO4 and provides evidence for the sharpness of interfaces between the cuprate and the manganite layers at the atomic scale. These findings shed light on the impact of the chemical potential at the interface of distinct materials on highly sensitive physical properties, such as superconductivity. Additionally, this results show the high stability of ultrathin layers from the same K2NiF4-type family, specifically one unit cell of Sr2-xLaxMnO4 and three unit cells of La1.84Sr0.16CuO4. This work advances both the fundamental understanding of the proximity region between superconducting cuprates and manganite phases and the potential use of oxide-based materials in quantum computing.

TI Network search algorithms and scoring functions for advanced-level
   computerized synthesis planning
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE
AB In 2020, a "hybrid" expert-AI computer program called Chematica (a.k.a. Synthia) was shown to autonomously plan multistep syntheses of complex natural products, which remain outside the reach of purely data-driven AI programs. The ability to plan at this level of chemical sophistication has been attributed mainly to the superior quality of Chematica's reactions rules. However, rules alone are not sufficient for advanced synthetic planning which also requires appropriately crafted algorithms with which to intelligently navigate the enormous networks of synthetic possibilities, score the synthetic positions encountered, and rank the pathways identified. Chematica's algorithms are distinct from pret-a-porter algorithmic solutions and are product of multiple rounds of improvements, against target structures of increasing complexity. Since descriptions of these improvements have been scattered among several of our prior publications, the aim of the current Review is to narrate the development process in a more comprehensive manner.

TI Integrated InP optical unitary converter with compact half-integer
   multimode interferometers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated optical unitary converters (OUCs) are vital devices for various emerging applications such as mode-multiplexed optical communication, optical neural networks, and quantum computing. In order to realize large-scale OUCs in a limited footprint, the number of elements, as well as the size of each element, is important. In this work, we present a novel type of OUC using half-integer multimode interferometers (MMIs) based on the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) concept. A half-integer MMI enables unitary coupling among the multiple input and output ports, while requiring only half the length of a conventional uniform MMI. Although the splitting ratio is not uniform across the ports, we show both numerically and experimentally that arbitrary unitary operation can still be achieved with comparable performance. We fabricate 4x4 OUC with half-integer MMIs on the monolithic InP platform and experimentally demonstrate reconfigurable 4-mode sorting and switching with a significantly reduced footprint compared with the conventional OUCs using uniform MMIs.

TI Digitized-counterdiabatic quantum approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has proved to be an effective classical-quantum algorithm serving multiple purposes, from solving combinatorial optimization problems to finding the ground state of many-body quantum systems. Since the QAOA is an Ansatz-dependent algorithm, there is always a need to design Ansatze for better optimization. To this end, we propose a digitized version of the QAOA enhanced via the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity. Specifically, we use a counterdiabatic (CD) driving term to design a better Ansatz, along with the Hamiltonian and mixing terms, enhancing the global performance. We apply our digitized-CD QAOA to Ising models, classical optimization problems, and the P-spin model, demonstrating that it outperforms the standard QAOA in all cases we study.

AB The dual attacks on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem are currently a subject of controversy. In particular, the results of [27], which claim to significantly lower the security level of Kyber [34], a lattice-based cryptosystem currently being standardized by NIST, are not widely accepted. The analysis behind their attack depends on a series of assumptions that, in certain scenarios, have been shown to contradict established theorems or well-tested heuristics [18].
   In this paper, we introduce a new dual lattice attack on LWE, drawing from ideas in coding theory. Our approach revisits the dual attack proposed by [27], replacing modulus switching with an efficient decoding algorithm. This decoding is achieved by generalizing polar codes over Z(q), and we confirm their strong distortion properties through benchmarks. This modification enables a reduction from small-LWE to plain-LWE, with a notable decrease in the secret dimension. Additionally, we replace the enumeration step in the attack by assuming the secret is zero for the portion being enumerated, iterating this assumption over various choices for the enumeration part.
   We make an analysis of our attack without using the flawed independence assumptions used in [27] and we fully back up our analysis with experimental evidences.
   Lastly, we assess the complexity of our attack on Kyber; showing that the security levels for Kyber-512/768/1024 are 3.5/11.9/12.3 bits below the NIST requirements (143/207/272 bits) in the same nearest-neighbor cost model as in [27, 34]. All in all the cost of our attack matches and even slightly beat in some cases the complexities originally claimed by the attack of [27].

TI Quantum Permutation Matrices
SO COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY
AB Quantum permutations arise in many aspects of modern "quantum mathematics". However, the aim of this article is to detach these objects from their context and to give a friendly introduction purely within operator theory. We define quantum permutation matrices as matrices whose entries are operators on Hilbert spaces; they obey certain assumptions generalizing classical permutation matrices. We give a number of examples and we list many open problems. We then put them back in their original context and give an overview of their use in several branches of mathematics, such as quantum groups, quantum information theory, graph theory and free probability theory.

TI Side-channel and Fault-injection attacks over Lattice-based Post-quantum
   Schemes (Kyber, Dilithium): Survey and New Results
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB In this work, we present a systematic study of Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) and Fault Injection Attacks (FIA) on structured lattice-based schemes, with main focus on Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Dilithium signature scheme, which are leading candidates in the NIST standardization process for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Through our study, we attempt to understand the underlying similarities and differences between the existing attacks while classifying them into different categories. Given the wide variety of reported attacks, simultaneous protection against all the attacks requires to implement customized protections/countermeasures for both Kyber and Dilithium. We therefore present a range of customized countermeasures, capable of providing defenses/mitigations against existing SCA/FIA, and incorporate several SCA and FIA countermeasures within a single design of Kyber and Dilithium. Among the several countermeasures discussed in this work, we present novel countermeasures that offer simultaneous protection against several SCA- and FIA-based chosen-ciphertext attacks for Kyber KEM. We implement the presented countermeasures within two well-known public software libraries for PQC: (1) pqm4 library for the ARM Cortex-M4-based microcontroller and (2) liboqs library for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plus based on the ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Our performance evaluation reveals that the presented custom countermeasures incur reasonable performance overheads on both the evaluated embedded platforms. We therefore believe our work argues for usage of custom countermeasures within real-world implementations of lattice-based schemes, either in a standalone manner or as reinforcements to generic countermeasures such as masking.

TI The Future of Cybersecurity in the Age of Quantum Computers
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The first week of August 2022 saw the world's cryptographers grapple with the second shocker of the year. Another one of the four post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms selected by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in a rigorous 5-year process was cracked by a team from Belgium. They took just 62 min and a standard laptop to break the PQC algorithm to win a USD 50,000 bounty from Microsoft. The first shocker came 6 months earlier, when another of the NIST finalists (Rainbow) was taken down. Unfortunately, both failed PQC algorithms are commercially available to consumers. With 80 of the 82 PQC candidates failing the NIST standardization process, the future of the remaining two PQC algorithms is, at best, questionable, placing the rigorous 5-year NIST exercise to build a quantum-safe encryption standard in jeopardy. Meanwhile, there is no respite from the quantum threat that looms large. It is time we take a step back and review the etiology of the problem de novo. Although state-of-the-art computer security heavily relies on cryptography, it can indeed transcend beyond encryption. This paper analyzes an encryption-agnostic approach that can potentially render computers quantum-resistant. Zero-vulnerability computing (ZVC) secures computers by banning all third-party permissions, a root cause of most vulnerabilities. ZVC eliminates the complexities of the multi-layered architecture of legacy computers and builds a minimalist, compact solid-state software on a chip (3SoC) that is robust, energy-efficient, and potentially resistant to malware as well as quantum threats.

AB Kyber is a key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that was recently selected by NIST in its PQC standardization process; it is also the only scheme to be selected in the context of public-key encryption (PKE) and key establishment. The main security target for KEMs, and their associated PKE schemes, in the NIST PQC context has been IND-CCA security. However, some important modern applications also require their underlying KEMs/PKE schemes to provide anonymity (Bellare et al., ASIACRYPT 2001). Examples of such applications include anonymous credential systems, cryptocurrencies, broadcast encryption schemes, authenticated key exchange, and auction protocols. It is hence important to analyze the compatibility of NIST's new PQC standard in such "beyond IND-CCA" applications.
   Some starting steps were taken by Grubbs et al. (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Xagawa (EUROCRYPT 2022) wherein they studied the anonymity properties of most NIST PQC third round candidate KEMs. Unfortunately, they were unable to show the anonymity of Kyber because of certain technical barriers.
   In this paper, we overcome said barriers and resolve the open problems posed by Grubbs et al. (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Xagawa (EUROCRYPT 2022) by establishing the anonymity of Kyber, and the (hybrid) PKE schemes derived from it, in a post-quantum setting. Along the way, we also provide an approach to obtain tight IND-CCA security proofs for Kyber with concrete bounds; this resolves another issue identified by the aforementioned works related to the post-quantum IND-CCA security claims of Kyber from a provable security point-of-view. Our results also extend to Saber, a NIST PQC third round finalist, in a similar fashion.

We show that this scenario can be analysed using the relation between three different measurements, which seem to result in a logical contradiction. We discuss how this contextual behaviour links to weak values, and coherences between prohibited states. Rather than showing a property of the particle is disembodied, the quantum Cheshire cat instead demonstrates the effects of these coherences, which are typically found in pre- and post-selected systems.

TI Improved Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Based on Conditional
   Value-at-Risk for Portfolio Optimization
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an improved Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm variant based on Conditional Value-at-Risk for addressing portfolio optimization problems. Portfolio optimization is a NP-hard combinatorial problem that aims to select an optimal set of assets and their quantities to balance risk against expected return. The proposed approach uses the QAOA to find the optimal asset combination that maximizes returns while minimizing risk, with a focus on the tail end of the loss distribution. An enhanced QAOA ansatz introduced that offers a balance between optimization quality and circuit depth, leading to faster convergence and higher probabilities of obtaining optimal solutions. Experiments are conducted using historical stock data from Nasdaq, optimizing portfolios with varying numbers of stocks. Our method outperforms original QAOA and CVaR-QAOA, particularly as the size of the problem increases. Regardless of the scenario, whether it involves 10, 12, 14, or 16 stocks, the improved CVaR-QAOA consistently converges within 100 iterations or less, whereas the standard QAOA consistently requires 450 iterations or more.

TI Observation of Topological Armchair Edge States in Photonic Biphenylene
   Network
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Edge states in 2D materials are vital for advancements in spintronics, quantum computing, and logic transistors. For uniform graphene, it is well known that the zigzag edges can host edge states, but the realization of armchair edge states has been challenging without engineered strain or breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Here, by using a photonic analog of a recently synthesized graphene-like biphenylene network (BPN), topological in-gap edge states are demonstrated, particularly at the armchair edges. Interestingly, several bulk states preserve the characteristics of edge states along the armchair boundaries, manifesting an unusual hybridization between the edge and bulk states. Experimentally, both zigzag and armchair edge states are observed in photonic BPN lattices written in a nonlinear crystal. Furthermore, the different features of the armchair boundary are clarified between the uniform BPN and graphene lattices. These results demonstrated here may be applicable to carbon-based BPNs and other artificial platforms beyond photonics, holding promise for expanding the application scope of 2D materials.

TI Catalyst-free MBE growth of PbSnTe nanowires with tunable aspect ratio
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are interesting for their topological surface states, which hold great promise for scattering-free transport channels and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A promising TCI is SnTe. However, Sn-vacancies form in SnTe, causing a high hole density, hindering topological transport from the surface being measured. This issue could be relieved by using nanowires with a high surface-to-volume ratio. Furthermore, SnTe can be alloyed with Pb reducing the Sn-vacancies while maintaining its topological phase. Here we present the catalyst-free growth of monocrystalline PbSnTe in molecular beam epitaxy. By the addition of a pre-deposition stage before the growth, we have control over the nucleation phase and thereby increase the nanowire yield. This facilitates tuning the nanowire aspect ratio by a factor of four by varying the growth parameters. These results allow us to grow specific morphologies for future transport experiments to probe the topological surface states in a Pb1-x Sn x Te-based platform.

TI High performance Boson sampling simulation via data-flow engines
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Boson sampling (BS) is viewed to be an accessible quantum computing paradigm to demonstrate computational advantage compared to classical computers. In this context, the evolution of permanent calculation algorithms attracts a significant attention as the simulation of BS experiments involves the evaluation of vast number of permanents. For this reason, we generalize the Balasubramanian-Bax-Franklin-Glynn permanent formula, aiming to efficiently integrate it into the BS strategy of Clifford and Clifford (2020 Faster classical boson sampling). A reduction in simulation complexity originating from multiplicities in photon occupation was achieved through the incorporation of a n-ary Gray code ordering of the addends during the permanent evaluation. Implementing the devised algorithm on FPGA-based data-flow engines, we leverage the resulting tool to accelerate boson sampling simulations for up to 40 photons. Drawing samples from a 60-mode interferometer, the achieved rate averages around 80 s per sample, employing 4 FPGA chips. The developed design facilitates the simulation of both ideal and lossy boson sampling experiments.

TI New Quantum Strategy for MIMO System Optimization
SO WINSYS : PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS
   NETWORKS AND MOBILE SYSTEMS

AB Co-channel interference and noise power could affect the performance of the MIMO system and can be evaluated with respect to the user's signal to noise and interference ratio. As a result, the desired transmission rate of the users could be satisfied by consuming more transmit power. Owing to this, a quantum optimization strategy can be utilized in order to minimize the transmit power, as well as to achieve an optimum trade-off within the throughput and the resulting interference and noise. In this study, a constrained quantum optimization algorithm (CQOA) has been implemented in the MIMO-downlink system to reduce the transmit power and computational complexity. An analytical study is conducted along with a comparison between the water filling algorithm-based binary searching algorithm (WFA-BSA), exhaustive algorithm-based water filling algorithm (EWFA), and the CQOA. Finally, simulation results show that the aforementioned methods consume similar total transmit power, however, the computational complexity of the quantum strategy is dramatically low compared to the other methods.

TI Nonlinear-Optical Processing of OAM Light States in a Few-Mode Fiber
SO PHOTONICS
AB Utilizing the phase-matching conditions of inter-modal four-wave mixing in an elliptical-core few-mode fiber supporting three non-degenerate modes, we experimentally demonstrate schemes for generating orbital-angular-momentum (OAM)-entangled photon pairs with high mode purity and for achieving highly mode-selective frequency conversion of beams in OAM-compatible (LP11a, LP11b) mode basis. These techniques expand the toolbox for using OAM modes in both classical and quantum communications and information processing.

TI Noninvertible Symmetries Act Locally by Quantum Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Noninvertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing noninvertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this Letter is to point out that these noninvertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e., completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers-Wannier duality of the onedimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of noninvertible symmetry operations.

TI Broadband detection of 18 teeth in an 11-dB squeezing comb
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Squeezed vacuum is a versatile resource of bipartite entanglement for quantum metrology and information. Optical parametric oscillators generate these states in a frequency comb structure. We show the simultaneous detection of 18 teeth with 11 dB of squeezing each. We built a 1.5-m-long optical resonator to increase the spectral teeth density and significantly increase the detection bandwidth by employing unbalanced homodyne detection instead of balanced. Our approach can be a crucial step in using the scaling potential of high-frequency squeezed states in quantum information.

TI Mobius mirrors
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB An accelerating boundary (mirror) acts as a horizon and black hole analog, radiating energy with some particle spectrum. We demonstrate that a Mobius transformation on the null coordinate advanced time mirror trajectory uniquely keeps invariant not only the energy flux but the particle spectrum. We clarify how the geometric entanglement entropy is also invariant. The transform allows generation of families of dynamically distinct trajectories, including PT-symmetric ones, mapping from the eternally thermal mirror to the de Sitter horizon, and different boundary motions corresponding to Kerr or Schwarzschild black holes.

TI Roadmap for Photonics with 2D Materials
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Triggered by advances in atomic-layer exfoliation and growth techniques, along with the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or a few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals now constitute a broad research field expanding in multiple directions through the combination of layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary subset of those directions, where 2D materials contribute remarkable nonlinearities, long-lived and ultraconfined polaritons, strong excitons, topological and chiral effects, susceptibility to external stimuli, accessibility, robustness, and a completely new range of photonic materials based on layer stacking, gating, and the formation of moire patterns. These properties are being leveraged to develop applications in electro-optical modulation, light emission and detection, imaging and metasurfaces, integrated optics, sensing, and quantum physics across a broad spectral range extending from the far-infrared to the ultraviolet, as well as enabling hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures and magnetic degrees of freedom. The rapid expansion of photonics with 2D materials as a dynamic research arena is yielding breakthroughs, which this Roadmap summarizes while identifying challenges and opportunities for future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.

TI Multiplexed Near-IR Detection of Single-Molecule Fluorescence
   Fluctuations Using a Single Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon
   Detector
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Fluorescence-based single-molecule and fluctuation spectroscopy in the near-IR can open avenues for biomolecular dynamic studies in biological media with suppressed autofluorescence and scattering background. However, further implementation is limited by the lower brightness of NIR fluorophores and available single-photon detector technologies that are still to be explored and adapted. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (snSPDs) have found increasing use in quantum optics and optical communication applications thanks to high sensitivity in the near-infraed (NIR), low dark-counts, no after-pulsing, and high time resolution. Here, we present characterization of fluorescence intensity fluctuations from single vesicles and NIR fluorophores based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), specifically taking advantage of these snSPD properties. We present a concept allowing multiplexed readouts based on only one snSPD, in which the emitted photons are separated by their emission wavelength into different optical paths, thereby translating the emission wavelengths into different arrival times onto the snSPD. This concept allows one-laser-one-detector, dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) measurements, with fluorescence intensity fluctuations of two fluorophore species separately analyzed and cross-correlated. It is shown how two fluorophore species in a sample can be distinguished by their different blinking kinetics, fluorescence lifetimes, and/or diffusion properties. Apart from differences in emission spectra, the presented concept for multiplexing using a single detector can also be applied to distinguish emitters by properties such as polarization, coherence lengths, and fluorescence bunching and antibunching signatures. It can also be generalized to other modalities than FCS, including single-molecule detection, confocal microscopy, and imaging.

TI Metal, dielectric and hybrid nanoantennas for enhancing the emission of
   single quantum dots: A comparative study
SO JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
AB The confinement of electromagnetic energy to subwavelength volumes through nanoscale antennas can be used to enhance the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters. With this aim, different configurations of metallic and high refractive index dielectric nanoparticles have been explored. Here, we carry out a comparative analysis of planar metallic, high refractive index dielectric, and hybrid nanoantennas considering three different parameters: the Purcell factor enhancement, radiation efficiency, and directionality properties. We focus our study on different geometries and material combinations of a dimer of cylinders. A dimer made of two gold nanocylinders is the most promising candidate for improving the spontaneous emission. While most previous works have paid attention to the redirection of the scattered emission in the nanoparticle plane, our proposed nanostructure of two large gold cylinders (R = lambda/4) emits most of the radiation upwards. This effect is due to the strong quadrupolar electric contribution to the resonant mode. With the aim to further improve the directionality properties, additional silicon nanocylinders are used as directors of the scattered radiation, increasing the directivity by a factor of 2.4 with respect to the gold dimer without directors. All in all, a hybrid structure composed of a gold dimer and silicon nanoparticles is proposed to enhance the spontaneous emission of a single quantum dot and to govern its emission pattern. The results shown in this work could be useful in fluorescence enhancement or in quantum photonics. They are particularly interesting for the development of single-photon sources based on quantum dots and other nanoscale emitters. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Optical encryption scheme based on spread spectrum ghost imaging
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB An optical encryption (OE) scheme based on the spread spectrum ghost imaging (SSGI), named as SSGI-OE, is proposed to obtain a high security with a smaller key. In the scheme, the randomly selected row number of a Hadamard matrix of order N is used as the secure key, and shared with the authorized user, Bob, through a private channel. Each corresponding row vector of the order-N Hadamard matrix is then used as the direct sequence code to modulate a speckle pattern for the ghost imaging system, and an image is encrypted with the help of the SSGI. The measurement results from the bucket detector, named as ciphertext, are then transmitted to Bob through a public channel. The illuminating speckle patterns are also shared with Bob by the public channel. With the correct secure key, Bob could reconstruct the image with the aid of the SSGI system, whereas the unauthorized user, Eve, could not obtain any useful information of the encrypted image. The numerical simulations and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is feasible with a higher security and a smaller key. For the 32 x 32 pixels image, the number of bits sent from Alice to Bob by using SSGI-OE (M = 1024, N = 2048) scheme is only 0.0107 times over a computational ghost imaging optical encryption scheme. When the eavesdropping ratio (ER) is less than 40%, the eavesdropper cannot acquire any information of the encrypted image. The extreme circumstance for the proposed SSGI-OE scheme is also discussed, where the eavesdropper begins to extract the information when ER is up to 15%.

TI Entanglement structure of quantum fields through local probes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present a framework to study the entanglement structure of a quantum field theory inspired by the formalism of particle detectors in relativistic quantum information. This framework can in principle be used to faithfully capture entanglement in a QFT between arbitrary-shaped regions of spacetime without encountering UV divergences, bypassing many of the issues typically present in other approaches. Our results also establish the limits of the efficiency of entanglement harvesting, and may also be used to motivate an operational definition of entanglement between spacetime subregions in field theory.

TI Revisited aspects of the local set in CHSH Bell scenario
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Bell inequalities stand at the cornerstone of the developments of quantum theory on both the foundational and applied side. The discussion started as a way to test whether the quantum description of reality is complete or not, but it developed in such a way that a new research area stemmed from it, namely quantum information. Far from being and exhausted topic, in this paper, we present a constructive and geometrically intuitive description of the local polytope and its facets in a bipartite Bell scenario with two dichotomic measurements per party.

TI Clustering property for quantum Markov chains on the comb graph
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum Markov chains (QMCs) on graphs and trees were investigated in connection with many important models arising from quantum statistical mechanics and quantum information. These quantum states generate many important properties such as quantum phase transition and clustering properties. In the present paper, we propose a construction of QMCs associated with an XX-Ising model over the comb graph N >0 Z. Mainly, we prove that the QMC associated with the disordered phase, enjoys a clustering property.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Coherent coupling between excitons is at the heart of many-body interactions and quantum information with transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures as an emergent platform for the investigation of these interactions. We employ multidimensional coherent spectroscopy on monolayer MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures and observe coherent coupling between excitons spatially localized in monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2. Through many-body spectroscopy, we further observe the absorption state arising from free interlayer electron-hole pairs. This observation yields a spectroscopic measurement of the interlayer exciton binding energy of about 250 meV.

TI Mesoscopic ultrafast nonlinear optics-the emergence of multimode quantum
   non-Gaussian physics
SO OPTICA
AB Over the last few decades, nonlinear optics has become significantly more nonlinear, traversing nearly a billionfold improvement in energy efficiency, with ultrafast nonlinear nanophotonics in particular emerging as a frontier for combining both spatial and temporal engineering. At present, cutting-edge experiments in nonlinear nanophotonics place us just above the mesoscopic regime, where a few hundred photons suffice to trigger highly nonlinear dynamics. In contrast to classical or deep-quantum optics, the mesoscale is characterized by dynamical interactions between mean-field, Gaussian, and non-Gaussian quantum features, all within a close hierarchy of scales. When combined with the inherent multimode complexity of optical fields, such hybrid quantum-classical dynamics present theoretical, experimental, and engineering challenges to the contemporary framework of quantum optics. In this review, we highlight the unique physics that emerges in multimode nonlinear optics at the mesoscale and outline key principles for exploiting both classical and quantum features to engineer novel functionalities. We briefly survey the experimental landscape and draw attention to outstanding technical challenges in materials, dispersion engineering, and device design for accessing mesoscopic operation. Finally, we speculate on how these capabilities might usher in some new paradigms in quantum photonics, from quantum-augmented information processing to nonclassical-light-driven dynamics and phenomena to all-optical non-Gaussian measurement and sensing. The physics unlocked at the mesoscale present significant challenges and opportunities in theory and experiment alike, and this review is intended to serve as a guide to navigating this new frontier in ultrafast quantum nonlinear optics.

TI Review of Recent Advancement on Nature/Bio-Inspired Antenna Designs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This article presents an extensive examination of antennas rooted in nature and biology, showcasing their remarkable performance across a wide spectrum of frequencies-from microwave to terahertz. The limitations of traditional antenna design have become increasingly evident in the face of burgeoning demands for novel communication technologies. Conventional analytical-equation-based approaches struggle to deliver the combined performance characteristics- encompassing bandwidth, gain, radiation pattern, and miniaturization- that emerging technologies necessitate. This has fueled an interest in bio-inspired antenna designs, a paradigm shift drawing inspiration from the ingenious structural solutions found in the living and non-living world, from plant leaves to bird feathers. These bio-inspired designs offer distinct advantages such as broader bandwidth and reduced sizes, making them highly appealing alternatives to the limitations of conventional antenna designs. This review explores a diverse range of bio-inspired designs. Among them are fractal geometries, inspired by self-repeating patterns in nature, which achieve optimal performance. Numerous designs in this category draw inspiration from nature, incorporating patterns observed in snowflakes, tree branches, clouds, and butterflies. Furthermore, nano-antennas have attracted significant attention for their vast potential applications in microwave and optical frequencies, playing a pivotal role in high-resolution spectroscopy, biomedical diagnosis and sensing, quantum photonics, and solar cell applications. By examining design methodologies and potential benefits, this article highlights the transformative potential of nature-inspired antennas. The compelling advantages of bio-inspired approaches necessitate a thorough exploration of their potential, paving the way for the development of next-generation communication systems with unprecedented capabilities.

TI Quantum regression in dephasing phenomena
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We investigate the validity of quantum regression for a family of quantum Hamiltonians on a multipartite system leading to phase-damping reduced dynamics. After finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the CP-divisibility of the corresponding channel, we evaluate a hierarchy of equations equivalent to the validity of quantum regression under arbitrary interventions; in particular, we find necessary conditions for a nontrivial dephasing to be compatible with quantum regression. In this framework, we study a class of dephasing-type generalized spin-boson models, investigating the existence of qubit-environment coupling functions that ensure the exact validity of quantum regression.

TI Phase Space Spin-Entropy
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum physics is intrinsically probabilistic, where the Born rule yields the probabilities associated with a state that deterministically evolves. The entropy of a quantum state quantifies the amount of randomness (or information loss) of such a state. The degrees of freedom of a quantum state are position and spin. We focus on the spin degree of freedom and elucidate the spin-entropy. Then, we present some of its properties and show how entanglement increases spin-entropy. A dynamic model for the time evolution of spin-entropy concludes the paper.

TI Experimental Reconstruction of the Few-Photon Nonlinear Scattering

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent photon-emitter interfaces offer a way to mediate efficient nonlinear photon-photon interactions, much needed for quantum information processing. Here we experimentally study the case of a two-level emitter, a quantum dot, coupled to a single optical mode in a nanophotonic waveguide. We carry out few-photon transport experiments and record the statistics of the light to reconstruct the scattering matrix elements of one- and two-photon components. This provides direct insight to the complex nonlinear photon interaction that contains rich many-body physics.

Through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, we identify pivotal research trends and advancements in IoT-based sensors, devices, and network architectures that facilitate real-time fire management. In addition, we examine the integration of emerging technologies-such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing-that enhance system performance and operational efficiency. Our study further highlights critical challenges and research gaps, including issues related to dynamic system adaptability, cross-domain synergies, bio-inspired fire safety mechanisms, post-fire analysis capabilities, linguistic and cultural barriers in research, and data security and privacy concerns. Finally, we outline prospective directions for future inquiry, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and robust cybersecurity strategies to fully harness the potential of IoT in transforming fire safety.

   network AI model
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Superconducting critical temperature is the most attractive material property due to its impact on the applications of electricity transmission, railway transportation, strong magnetic fields for nuclear fusion and medical imaging, quantum computing, etc. The ability to predict its value is a constant pursuit for condensed matter physicists. We developed a new hierarchical neural network (HNN) AI algorithm to resolve the contradiction between the large number of descriptors and the small number of datasets always faced by neural network AI approaches to materials science. With this new HNN-based AI model, a much-increased number of 909 universal descriptors for inorganic compounds, and a dramatically cleaned database for conventional superconductors, we achieved high prediction accuracy with a test R-2 score of 95.6%. The newly developed HNN model accurately predicted T-c of 45 new high-entropy alloy super-conductors with a mean absolute percent error below 6% compared to the experimental data. This demonstrated a significant potential for predicting other properties of inorganic materials.

TI Optimization of a plasmonic lens structure for maximum optical vortices
   induced on Weyl semimetal surface states
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Optical vortices have a topologically charged phase singularity and zero intensity distribution in the centre. Optical vortex creation is regarded as a significant means for information transmission for applications in quantum computing, encryption, optical communication, etc. In this study, using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, we calculated the electric field intensity and phase distribution of 2D lattices of optical vortices generated from various polygonal plasmonic lens structures using surface states of a Weyl semimetal (MoTe2). It was shown that a hexagonal lens is the best performing plasmonic lens. Further, we posited here a unified mathematical formulation for optical electrical field and phase distribution in the near field for any polygonal plasmonic lens. Our theoretical calculation corroborated well with FDTD results, validating the proposed generalized formula. Such plasmonic lens structures demonstrating scaling behavior offer great potential for designing next-generation optical memories.
   A unified mathematical equation of a polygonal plasmonic lens is proposed, which can calculate the electric field intensity and phase-distribution maps of any polygonal lens.

TI Low-loss α-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon
   wafers: fabrication, characterization and surface modification
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of state-of-the-art superconducting quantum devices is currently limited by microwave dielectric loss at different interfaces. alpha-tantalum is a superconductor that has proven effective in reducing dielectric loss and improving device performance due to its thin low-loss oxide. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality factor alpha-tantalum coplanar-waveguide resonators directly on pristine 300 mm silicon wafers over a variety of metal deposition conditions and perform a comprehensive material and electrical characterization study. Additionally, we apply a surface treatment based on hydrofluoric acid that allows us to modify different resonators surfaces, leading to a reduction in two-level system loss in the devices by a factor of three. This loss reduction can be entirely attributed to the removal of surface oxides. Our study indicates that large scale manufacturing of low-loss superconducting circuits should indeed be feasible and suggests a viable avenue to materials-driven advancements in superconducting circuit performance.

AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) rolls out today to devices whose lifetime may well exceed a decade, conservative threat models should consider adversaries with access to quantum computing power. The IETF-specified SUIT standard defines a security architecture for IoT software updates, standardizing metadata and cryptographic tools-digital signatures and hash functions-to guarantee the update legitimacy. SUIT performance has been evaluated in the pre-quantum context, but not yet in a post-quantum context. Taking the open-source implementation of SUIT available in RIOT as a case study, we survey post-quantum considerations, and quantum-resistant digital signatures in particular, focusing on low-power, microcontroller-based IoT devices with stringent memory, CPU, and energy consumption constraints. We benchmark a range of pre- and post-quantum signature schemes on a range of IoT hardware including ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, and Espressif (ESP32), which form the bulk of modern 32-bit microcontroller architectures. Interpreting our benchmarks in the context of SUIT, we estimate the real-world impact of transition from pre- to post-quantum signatures.

AB Noise is a framework for the design and security assessment of Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols between two parties using Diffie-Hellman (DH) as the only public-key cryptosystem. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the computation and communication cost of Noise and PQNoise, a recently introduced post-quantum version of the Noise protocol framework. Furthermore, we present combinations of the 12 fundamental (interactive) Noise patterns and their PQNoise counterparts, thereby obtaining hybrid handshake patterns, and include them in our evaluation. We integrated PQNoise and the novel hybrid patterns into Noise-C, a reference implementation of the Noise protocol framework written in C. In order to evaluate Noise and its variants, we emulated networks with different latency, throughput, and packet-loss settings using Linux network emulation tools. For all Noise handshakes we chose cryptosystems that provide a comparable (pre-quantum) level of security, namely X25519 and Kyber512. We ran our experiments on two different devices, one is a laptop with an Intel Core i5-10210U CPU and the other an Orange Pi One development board with a 32-bit ARM Cortex-A7 processor. The results we collected show that, under normal network conditions, the Noise patterns and their PQNoise counterparts have nearly identical execution times, except when the latter require an additional handshake message. However, under bad network conditions with high packet-loss rates, PQNoise falls behind Noise, mainly because of the relatively large public-key and ciphertext sizes of Kyber512. The execution times of our hybrid handshakes are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding PQNoise handshakes when the packet-loss rates are low, and at higher loss rates the differences are small.

TI Towards Post-quantum Secure PAKE - A Tight Security Proof for OCAKE in

AB We revisit OCAKE (ACNS 23), a generic recipe that constructs password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) from key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), to allow instantiations with post-quantums KEM like KYBER.
   The ACNS23 paper left as an open problem to argue security against quantum attackers, with its security proof being in the universal composability (UC) framework. This is common for PAKE, however, at the time of this submission's writing, it was not known how to prove (computational) UC security against quantum adversaries. Doing this becomes even more involved if the proof uses idealizations like random oracles or ideal ciphers.
   To pave the way towards post-quantum security proofs, we therefore resort to a (still classical) game-based security proof in the BPR model (EUROCRYPT 2000). We consider this a crucial stepping stone towards a fully satisfying post-quantum security proof. We also hope that a game-based proof is easier to (potentially formally) verify.
   We prove security of (a minor variation of) OCAKE, assuming the underlying KEM satisfies notions of ciphertext indistinguishability, anonymity, and (computational) public-key uniformity. Using multi-user variants of these properties, we achieve tight security bounds.
   We provide a full detailed proof - something often omitted in publications on game-based security of PAKE. As a side-contribution, we demonstrate in detail how to handle password guesses, which is something we were unable to find in the existing literature at the time of writing.
   Finally, we discuss which current PQC KEMs can be plugged into the proposed protocol and provide a concrete instantiation, accompanied by a proof-of-concept implementation and respective run-time benchmarks.

TI Accelerating Falcon Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithm on Graphic
   Processing Units
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Since 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been performing a competition to standardize post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Although Falcon has been selected in the competition as one of the standard PQC algorithms because of its advantages in short key and signature sizes, its performance overhead is larger than that of other lattice-based cryptosystems. This study presents multiple methodologies to accelerate the performance of Falcon using graphics processing units (GPUs) for server-side use. Direct GPU porting significantly degrades performance because the Falcon reference codes require recursive functions in its sampling process. Thus, an iterative sampling approach for efficient parallel process-ing is presented. In this study, the Falcon software applied a fine-grained execution model and reported the optimal number of threads in a thread block. Moreover, the polynomial multiplication performance was optimized by parallelizing the number-theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplication and the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based multiplication. Furthermore, dummy-based parallel execution methods have been introduced to handle the thread divergence effects. The presented Falcon software on RTX 3090 NVIDA GPU based on the proposed methods with Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024 parameters outperform at 35.14, 28.84, and 34.64 times and 33.31, 27.45, and 34.40 times, respectively, better than the central processing unit (CPU) reference implementation using Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) instructions on a Ryzen 9 5900X running at 3.7 GHz in key genera-tion, signing, and verification, respectively. Therefore, the proposed Falcon software can be used in servers managing multiple concurrent clients for efficient certificate verification and be used as an outsourced key generation and signature generation server for Signature as a Service (SaS).

TI Adaptive lattice-gas algorithm: Classical and quantum implementations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Lattice-gas algorithms (LGA) are a class of algorithms including, in chronological order, binary lattice-gas cellular automata, integer lattice-gas algorithms (ILGA), and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). They are largely used for simulating nonlinear systems. Starting from one-dimensional ILGA, we design an algorithm where we carry out a fraction of the possible collisions. These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice-gas algorithm that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure. Multi-time-step implementation is possible in some specific cases, briefly discussed.

TI Quantum Brascamp-Lieb Dualities
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Brascamp-Lieb inequalities are entropy inequalities which have a dual formulation as generalized Young inequalities. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of this duality, relating quantum relative entropy inequalities to matrix exponential inequalities of Young type. We demonstrate this novel duality by means of examples from quantum information theory-including entropic uncertainty relations, strong data-processing inequalities, super-additivity inequalities, and many more. As an application we find novel uncertainty relations for Gaussian quantum operations that can be interpreted as quantum duals of the well-known family of 'geometric' Brascamp-Lieb inequalities.

TI Broadband Continuous-Variable Entanglement Generation Using a Kerr-Free

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Entangled microwave photons form a fundamental resource for quantum information processing and sensing with continuous variables. We use a low-loss Josephson metamaterial comprising superconduct-ing, nonlinear, asymmetric inductive elements to generate frequency-entangled photons from vacuum fluctuations at a rate of 2 giga entangled bits per second spanning over the 4-GHz bandwidth. The device is operated as a traveling-wave parametric amplifier under Kerr-relieving biasing conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate single-mode squeezing in such devices-3.1 +/- 0.7 dB below the zero-point level at half of modulation frequency.

The loop itself is of high quality, allowing for storage of a non-Gaussian state for up to seven round trips while preserving its Wigner negativity and phase coherence. We perform various BS operations on a non-Gaussian state and evaluate them as transformations of the state's waveforms. Our work integrates non-Gaussian states with time multiplexing, laying the foundation for large-scale universal quantum information processing.

TI Laser Cooling of Nuclear Magnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The initialization of nuclear spin to its ground state is challenging due to its small energy scale compared with thermal energy, even at cryogenic temperature. In this Letter, we propose an optonuclear quadrupolar effect, whereby two-color optical photons can efficiently interact with nuclear spins. Leveraging such an optical interface, we demonstrate that nuclear magnons, the collective excitations of nuclear spin ensemble, can be cooled down optically. Under feasible experimental conditions, laser cooling can suppress the population and entropy of nuclear magnons by more than 2 orders of magnitude, which could facilitate the application of nuclear spins in quantum information science.

The photon statistics, photon number correlation, and entanglement properties of the system have been calculated employing the dynamical equation of the system. It is shown that, for the sub-Poissonian photon statistics, the degree of correlation increases with the atomic pumping rate, and the entanglement varies with phase fluctuations, rather than with the atomic pumping rate. The proposed system is well suitable for the quantum information processing.

It is an approximate method based on a Markov assumption for environmental coupling. In this Letter we quantify properties of photons emitted from a single quantum dot coupled to phonons. For the single-photon purity and the indistinguishability, we compare numerically exact path-integral results with those obtained from the QRT. It is demonstrated that the QRT systematically overestimates the influence of the environment for typical quantum dots used in quantum information technology.

TI Entangled cognition in immersive learning experience
SO ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR
AB Immersive learning environments in education provide a set of rich and diverse learning affordances (possibilities). Cognition in such environments can be considered as embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended (the 4Es of cognition). During such cognitive happenings, we assume and live as valid everything we experience. Yet in this enactive structural coupling between individuals and their experiential world, another phenomenon occurs. We become a behaviorally inseparable entity with the virtual/immersive world. We become entangled with that virtual/immersive world. Here we propose that, within the framework of the 4Es of cognition, a recognizable lived experience phenomena occurs when learners engage with virtual or immersive learning environments. That is, cognition becomes entangled in immersive environments with alternative realities. Coming from the Santiago school of cognition, and building from ideas from immersive learning, 4E cognition, and quantum entanglement inspired in quantum cognition, we attempt to describe the process of entangled cognition happening in immersive learning environments. We recognize at least two levels of entanglement from the same recursive phenomenology: one we call a local entanglement, related to perception and sense-making; and a second we call a global entanglement, connected to the process and phenomena of human consciousness and meaning-making, accessible when conceived as a whole. We see the benefits for such a theoretical framework to ultimately guide, justify, and encourage the emergence of an epistemology shift in educational technology towards design principles that account for entangled cognition in immersive learning (and beyond), and the associated possibilities offered by new immersive technologies in education.

TI Polynomial Time Key-Recovery Attack on High Rate Random Alternant Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB A long standing open question is whether the distinguisher of high rate alternant codes or Goppa codes from Faug & egrave;re, Gauthier-Uma na, Otmani, Perret, and Tillich in 2011 can be turned into an algorithm recovering the algebraic structure of such codes from the mere knowledge of an arbitrary generator matrix of it. This would allow to break the McEliece scheme as soon as the code rate is large enough and would break all instances of the CFS signature scheme. We give for the first time a positive answer for this problem when the code is a generic alternant code and when the code field size q is small: q is an element of {2,3} and for all regimes of other parameters for which the aforementioned distinguisher works. This breakthrough has been obtained by two different ingredients: (i) a way of using code shortening and the component-wise product of codes to derive from the original alternant code a sequence of alternant codes of decreasing degree up to getting an alternant code of degree 3 (with a multiplier and support related to those of the original alternant code); (ii) an original Gr & ouml;bner basis approach which takes into account the non standard constraints on the multiplier and support of an alternant code which recovers in polynomial time the relevant algebraic structure of an alternant code of degree 3 from the mere knowledge of a basis for it.

AB Whereas theoretical attacks on standardized cryptographic primitives rarely lead to actual practical attacks, the situation is different for side-channel attacks. Improvements in the performance of side-channel attacks are of utmost importance.
   In this paper, we propose a framework to be used in key-recovery side-channel attacks on CCA-secure post-quantum encryption schemes. The basic idea is to construct chosen ciphertext queries to a plaintext checking oracle that collects information on a set of secret variables in a single query. Then a large number of such queries is considered, each related to a different set of secret variables, and they are modeled as a low-density parity-check code (LDPC code). Secret variables are finally determined through efficient iterative decoding methods, such as belief propagation, using soft information. The utilization of LDPC codes offers efficient decoding, source coding, and error correction benefits. It has been demonstrated that this approach provides significant improvements compared to previous work by reducing the required number of queries, such as the number of traces in a power attack.
   The framework is demonstrated and implemented in two different cases. On one hand, we attack implementations of HQC in a timing attack, lowering the number of required traces considerably compared to attacks in previous work. On the other hand, we describe and implement a full attack on a masked implementation of Kyber using power analysis. Using the ChipWhisperer evaluation platform, our real-world attacks recover the long-term secret key of a first-order masked implementation of Kyber-768 with an average of only 12 power traces.

TI Bayesian interpretation of Husimi function and Wehrl entropy
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The Husimi function (Q-function) of a quantum state is the distribution function of the density operator in the coherent state representation. It is widely used in theoretical research, such as in quantum optics. The Wehrl entropy is the Shannon entropy of the Husimi function, and is non-zero even for pure states. This entropy has been extensively studied in mathematical physics. Recent research also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and many-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system of N spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent states, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive operator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not a set of orthonormal basis. Here, with the help of the Bayes' theorem, we provide an alternative probabilistic interpretation for the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy. This interpretation is based on direct measurements of the system, and thus does not require the introduction of an ancillary system as in the POVM theory. Moreover, under this interpretation the classical correspondences of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy are just phase-space probability distribution function of N classical tops, and its associated entropy, respectively. Therefore, this explanation contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between the Husimi function, Wehrl entropy, and classical-quantum correspondence. The generalization of this statistical interpretation to continuous-variable systems is also discussed.

TI Entanglement entropy at critical points of classical evolution in
   oscillatory and exotic singularity multiverse models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Using the third quantization formalism we study the quantum entanglement of universes created in pairs within the framework of standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. In particular, we investigate entanglement quantities (entropy, temperature) around the maxima, minima and inflection points of the classical evolution. The novelty from previous works is that we show how the entanglement changes in an extended minisuperspace parametrized by the scale factor and additionally, by the massless scalar field. We study the entanglement quantities for the universes which classically exhibit big bang and other than big bang (exotic) singularities such as big brake, big freeze, big separation, and little rip. While taking into account the scalar field, we find that the entanglement entropy is finite at the big bang singularity and diverges at the maxima or minima of expansion. As for the exotic singularity models we find that the entanglement entropy or the temperature in all the critical points and singularities is either finite or infinite, but it never vanishes. This shows that each of the universes of a pair is entangled to a degree parametrized by the entanglement quantities which measure the quantumness of the system. Apart from the von Neumann entanglement entropy, we also check the behavior of the Tsallis and the Renyi entanglement entropies, and find that they behave similarly to the meters of the quantumness. Finally, we find that the best-fit relation between the entanglement entropy and the Hubble parameter (which classically marks special points of universe evolution) is of the logarithmic shape, and not polynomial, as one could initially expect.

TI Cooperative Control Strategy of Vehicle Motors Using Modified Quantum 3D
   Technology
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB We propose a novel approach for constructing a Power Internet of Things (PIOT) collaborative network architecture using intelligent motors in this paper, eliminating the need for a traditional controller area network interface. The proposed system transforms the conventional centralized vehicle motor, call motor, control model-where a single control unit governs all motors-into a decentralized control framework. More importantly, it integrates modified quantum three-dimension (3D) communication (MQ3D), enabling coordination among different types (AC, DC) and quantities of motors through a smart DC bus architecture built with only two power lines. This configuration supports synchronized motor driving and improves system scalability. In conventional systems, motor operation can induce harmonic interference in control circuits due to fluctuating drive currents, potentially leading to malfunctions-especially when multiple heterogeneous motors operate simultaneously in complex harmonic environments. In contrast, the proposed system uses power waveforms as communication signals, avoiding the need for additional communication infrastructure, thereby reducing hardware costs. Moreover, unlike traditional communication platforms such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth that rely on low-power signals susceptible to interference, power-based communication inherently offers greater noise immunity owing to its higher energy signals. The MQ3D technology applied in this study is a novel quantum communication method that does not require sidebands between communication channels and can operate at ultralow frequencies (below 1 Hz). The proposed method also addresses limitations in MQ3D's original amplitude-restricted design, which constrained data space and reduced communication speed. Effective motor collaboration requires not only responsive control units but also high-speed and reliable communication. To address the aforementioned issues, we also propose a PIOT system, implemented on an automotive platform using a smart motor architecture. Leveraging advances in quantum communication, we enhanced data throughput and the responsiveness of the motor collaboration system. To validate the proposed methodology, a test platform was developed using a personal computer, a custom smart DC bus controller, Arduino Mega2560, and various motors. MATLAB (R), a packet software program, was employed for experimental verification, and the feasibility and correctness of the theoretical concepts proposed in this research were demonstrated.

TI The Brukner-Zeilinger invariants in terms of (N, M) - POVMs

AB Brukner-Zeilinger invariants, including invariant information and invariant uncertainty, play a remarkable role in quantum information theory. Recently, a broad class of symmetric informationally complete measurements is presented, which contains a general symmetrical information complete POVMs and mutually unbiased measurements (2022, Phys. Rev. A<bold>105</bold>, 042 209). Based on this important measurement and variance, we further analyze the internal relationship between Brukner-Zeilinger invariants in detail. The results maybe provide a method to explain the importance of Brukner-Zeilinger invariants.

TI Optomagnonically induced RoF chaotic synchronization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optomagnonics is a good platform for the interplay of radio frequency and optical signals, which are the primary communication carriers in the present day. On the basis of optomagnonics, we provide a multi-scale method for analyzing its behavior, including frequency comb and RoF chaotic synchronization at the microwave scale. Adjusting the pump light intensity permits the transition of RoF signals between harmonics, frequency combs, and chaotic movements. The dual optomagnonical device enables the synchronization of RoF signals between different cavities. Our study will contribute to the use of multiscale electromagnetic wave coupling in both conventional and quantum information applications.

TI Versatile Atomic Magnetometry Assisted by Bayesian Inference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum sensors typically translate external fields into a periodic response whose frequency is then determined by analyses performed in Fourier space. This allows for a linear inference of the parameters that characterize external signals. In practice, however, quantum sensors are able to detect fields only in a narrow range of amplitudes and frequencies. A departure from this range, as well as the presence of significant noise sources and short detection times, lead to a loss of the linear relationship between the response of the sensor and the target field, thus limiting the working regime of the sensor. Here we address these challenges by means of a Bayesian inference approach that is tolerant to strong deviations from desired periodic responses of the sensor and is able to provide reliable estimates even with a very limited number of measurements. We demonstrate our method for an Yb-171(+) trapped-ion quantum sensor but stress the general applicability of this approach to different systems.

TI Multimode-enabled silicon photonic delay lines: break the delay-density
   limit
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Integrated optical delay lines have become imperative to meet the growing demand as large aperture antennas and high number of subarrays required for microwave beamforming, high-speed optical communication, and integrated quantum photonics. It is very challenging to achieve large delay ranges, small footprints, and broad bandwidths simultaneously due to the strong trade-off between the propagation loss and the group refractive index of optical waveguides. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate multimode-enabled silicon photonic delay line for the first time, which breaks the delay-density limit of singlemode waveguide spirals, towards a broadband, mm2-scale, and ultra-large time delay. By demonstrating low-loss-propagation possibilities for different polarizations and modes, we introduce a novel multimode delay unit by integrating the mode (de)multiplexers and the ultralow-loss multimode waveguide spiral supporting the TE0, TE1, and TE2 modes propagating in parallel. The measured propagation losses for the TE0, TE1, and TE2 modes are 0.2 dB/cm, 0.31 dB/cm, and 0.49 dB/cm, respectively. In this way, the highest line delay-density of 376.9 ps/cm and low delay loss of 0.004 dB/ps are achieved. Furthermore, we implement a 7-bit tunable multimode photonic delay line and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-large delay range of 12.7 ns with a delay resolution of 100 ps and within an ultra-compact footprint of 3.85 mm2, enabling a delay density over 3299 ps/mm2, showing the largest delay range and the highest delay density among on-chip delay lines reported to date, to the best of our knowledge.

TI Quantum game theory and the complexity of approximating quantum Nash

SO QUANTUM
AB This paper is concerned with complexity theoretic aspects of a general for-mulation of quantum game theory that models strategic interactions among rational agents that process and exchange quantum information. In particular, we prove that the computational problem of finding an approximate Nash equi-librium in a broad class of quantum games is, like the analogous problem for classical games, included in (and therefore complete for) the complexity class PPAD. Our main technical contribution, which facilitates this inclusion, is an extension of prior methods in computational game theory to strategy spaces that are characterized by semidefinite programs.

TI Bulk-boundary entanglement correspondence and the Ryu-Takayanagi
   conjecture in an AdS2/CFT1 setup
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Using recent developments in expressing one-loop partition functions in Euclidean AdS2 space-times in terms of character integrals, we relate the one-loop effective action for a free field theory in AdS2 (comprised of a massless scalar field and a massless Majorana fermion field) to the partition function of the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan (DFF) conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) models on the two global AdS2 boundaries. The equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees in the field theory guarantee that the one-loop calculation is free of all UV divergences except a logarithmic one consistent with the expected entanglement entropy behaviour in a CQM. Via a thermofield double representation, we compute the entanglement entropy between two copies of the CFT1 (CQM), each living near one of the two boundaries of global AdS2, in a state at global time tau -> - infinity. This entanglement entropy is expressed in terms of the logarithm of the regularised length of a closed particle trajectory infinitesimally near the rim of the Euclidean AdS2 disc. We view this relation between boundary quantum entanglement and a bulk geometrical quantity as the AdS2/CFT1 version of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in our setup. The boundary entanglement entropy is equal to 4 times the thermodynamic entropy read off from the regularised one-loop effective action in AdS2. Further, we compute the bulk entanglement entropy associated with black hole horizons in Lorentzian AdS2 and show that it precisely matches the boundary entanglement entropy.

TI Comparing Quantum Gravity Models: String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity,
   and Entanglement Gravity versus SU(∞)-QGR
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In a previous article we proposed a new model for quantum gravity (QGR) and cosmology, dubbed SU(& INFIN;)-QGR. One of the axioms of this model is that Hilbert spaces of the Universe and its subsystems represent the SU(& INFIN;) symmetry group. In this framework, the classical spacetime is interpreted as being the parameter space characterizing states of the SU(& INFIN;) representing Hilbert spaces. Using quantum uncertainty relations, it is shown that the parameter space-the spacetime-has a 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian geometry. Here, after a review of SU(& INFIN;)-QGR, including a demonstration that its classical limit is Einstein gravity, we compare it with several QGR proposals, including: string and M-theories, loop quantum gravity and related models, and QGR proposals inspired by the holographic principle and quantum entanglement. The purpose is to find their common and analogous features, even if they apparently seem to have different roles and interpretations. The hope is that this exercise provides a better understanding of gravity as a universal quantum force and clarifies the physical nature of the spacetime. We identify several common features among the studied models: the importance of 2D structures; the algebraic decomposition to tensor products; the special role of the SU(2) group in their formulation; the necessity of a quantum time as a relational observable. We discuss how these features can be considered as analogous in different models. We also show that they arise in SU(& INFIN;)-QGR without fine-tuning, additional assumptions, or restrictions.

TI Entanglement Phase Transition Induced by the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Recent years have seen remarkable development in open quantum systems effectively described by nonHermitian Hamiltonians. A unique feature of non-Hermitian topological systems is the skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Despite its significance for non-Hermitian topological phases, the relevance of the skin effect to quantum entanglement and critical phenomena has remained unclear. Here, we find that the skin effect induces a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition in the entanglement dynamics. We show that the skin effect gives rise to a macroscopic flow of particles and suppresses the entanglement propagation and thermalization, leading to the area law of the entanglement entropy in the nonequilibrium steady state. Moreover, we reveal an entanglement phase transition induced by the competition between the unitary dynamics and the skin effect even without disorder or interactions. This entanglement phase transition accompanies nonequilibrium quantum criticality characterized by a nonunitary conformal field theory whose effective central charge is extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that it originates from an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the concomitant scale invariance of the skin modes localized according to the power law. Furthermore, we show that the skin effect leads to the purification and the reduction of von Neumann entropy even in Markovian open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation. Our work opens a way to control the entanglement growth and establishes a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena in open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium.

TI Contextuality witness inspired by optimal state discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many protocols and tasks in quantum information science rely inherently on the fundamental notion of contextuality to provide advantages over their classical counterparts, and contextuality represents one of the main differences between quantum and classical physics. In this work we present a witness for preparation contextuality inspired by optimal two-state discrimination. The main idea is based on finding the accessible averaged success and error probabilities in both classical and quantum models. We can then construct a noncontextuality inequality and associated witness which we find to be robust against depolarising noise and loss in the form of inconclusive events.

TI Ultra-broad Schmidt modes for biphoton states generated by SPDC in the
   chirped QPM crystals
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS
AB In the realm of quantum optics, the manipulation and characterization of biphoton states hold significant importance for advancing quantum information processing and communication technologies. This study explores the Schmidt decomposition of ultra-broad biphoton states, revealing that most modes are fulfilled with the frequency response points, and certain modes exhibit exceptionally broad Schmidt spectra. These Schmidt modes in frequency domain are significantly reshaped and widened by a crystal at a moderate chirp-rate when pump bandwidth is about several Giga-Hertz.

TI Optical phase encoding in a pulsed approach to reservoir computing
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The exploitation of the full structure of multimode light fields enables compelling capabilities in many fields including classical and quantum information science. We exploit dataencoding on the optical phase of the pulses of a femtosecond laser source for a photonic implementation of a reservoir computing protocol. Rather than intensity detection, data-reading is done via homodyne detection that accesses combinations of an amplitude and a phase of the field. Numerical and experimental results on nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) tasks and laser dynamic predictions are shown. We discuss perspectives for quantumenhanced protocols.

TI Light quantum control of persisting Higgs modes in iron-based
   superconductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Higgs mechanism, i.e., spontaneous symmetry breaking of the quantum vacuum, is a cross-disciplinary principle, universal for understanding dark energy, antimatter and quantum materials, from superconductivity to magnetism. Unlike one-band superconductors (SCs), a conceptually distinct Higgs amplitude mode can arise in multi-band, unconventional superconductors via strong interband Coulomb interaction, but is yet to be accessed. Here we discover such hybrid Higgs mode and demonstrate its quantum control by light in iron-based high-temperature SCs. Using terahertz (THz) two-pulse coherent spectroscopy, we observe a tunable amplitude mode coherent oscillation of the complex order parameter from coupled lower and upper bands. The nonlinear dependence of the hybrid Higgs mode on the THz driving fields is distinct from any known SC results: we observe a large reversible modulation of resonance strength, yet with a persisting mode frequency. Together with quantum kinetic modeling of a hybrid Higgs mechanism, distinct from charge-density fluctuations and without invoking phonons or disorder, our result provides compelling evidence for a light-controlled coupling between the electron and hole amplitude modes assisted by strong interband quantum entanglement. Such light-control of Higgs hybridization can be extended to probe many-body entanglement and hidden symmetries in other complex systems. A collective excitation called Higgs mode may arise in multi-band superconductors via strong interband interaction, but it is yet to be accessed. Here, the authors observe a tunable coherent amplitude oscillation of the order parameter in Ba(Fe1-xCox)(2)As-2, suggesting appearance and control of the Higgs mode by light tuning interband interaction.

TI Maximal speed of quantum propagation
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB For Schrodinger equations with both time-independent and time-dependent Kato potentials, we give a simple proof of the maximal speed bound. The latter states that the probability to find the quantum system outside a ball of radius proportional to the time lapsed decays as an inverse power of time. We give an explicit expression for the constant of proportionality in terms of the maximal energy available to the initial condition. For the time-independent part of the interaction, we require neither decay at infinity nor smoothness.

TI Fractalizing quantum codes
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce "fractalization", a procedure by which spin models are extended to higher-dimensional "fractal" spin models. This allows us to interpret type-II fracton phases, fractal symmetry-protected topological phases, and more, in terms of well understood lower-dimensional spin models. Fractalization is also useful for deriving new spin models and quantum codes from known ones. We construct higher dimensional generalizations of fracton models that host extended fractal excitations. Finally, by applying fractalization to a 2D subsystem code, we produce a family of locally generated 3D subsystem codes that are conjectured to saturate a quantum information storage tradeoff bound.

TI Study of Multi-Pixel Scintillator Detector Configurations for Measuring
   Polarized Gamma Radiation
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB When a positron annihilates, two gamma photons are created with orthogonal polarizations. It is possible to use coincidence measurements where both photons undergo Compton scattering to estimate their initial relative polarization orientation. This information is of great interest in gamma imaging systems, such as Positron Emission Tomography, where it may be used as an additional tool to distinguish true coincidence events from scatter and random background. The successful utilization of this principle critically depends on the detector's angular and energy resolution, which determine its polarimetric performance. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the Geant4 toolkit to model two multi-pixel detector configurations identified as prospective for the measurement of gamma-ray polarization in PET. One is based on 2 mm x 2 mm x 20 mm LYSO scintillators and the other is based on 3 mm x 3 mm x 20 mm GAGG scintillators. Each configuration has a pair of modules, each consisting of 64 crystals set up in a single 8 x 8 matrix, where both the recoil electron and the Compton-scattered photon are absorbed. We simulate positron annihilation by generating two back-to-back gamma photons of 511 keV with orthogonal polarizations. The Compton scattering is successfully identified and the modulation of the azimuthal angle difference is clearly observed. The configuration based on GAGG crystals demonstrates slightly better polarimetric performance than the one based on LYSO crystals, reflected in the more pronounced azimuthal modulation.

TI Exploring the Relationship Between Surface Features and Explaining
   Quality of YouTube Explanatory Videos
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
AB Physics education research on explanatory videos has experienced a boost in recent years. Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online, e.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging task for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the explaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has uncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views or likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos' explaining quality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be statistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality. To date, these findings have only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations between the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for videos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for example from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study analyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on quantum entanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a category-based measure of explanatory videos' explaining quality from the literature. We report correlations between the videos' explaining quality and the surface features provided by YouTube. On the one hand, our results substantiate earlier findings for mechanics topics. On other hand, partial correlations shed new light on the relationship between YouTube's surface features and explaining quality of explanatory videos.

AB In this paper, we present the first single trace side-channel attack that targets the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) framework based on threshold secret sharing, also known as Threshold Computation in the Head (TCitH) in its original version. This MPCitH framework can be found in 5 of the 14 digital signatures schemes in the recent second round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) call for digital signatures. In this work, we start by highlighting a side-channel leak in the Syndrome-Decoding-in-the-Head (SDitH) algorithm and use the TCitH framework to build our attack. Specifically, we exploit the leakage of a multiplication function in the Galois field to make predictions about intermediate values, and we use the structure of the algorithm to combine information efficiently. This allows us to build an attack that is both the first Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attack (SASCA) targeting the MPCitH framework, as well as the first attack on the SDitH algorithm. More specifically, we build a SASCA based on Belief Propagation (BP) on the evaluation of polynomials in the signature using the threshold variant structure to reconstruct the secret key. We perform simulated attacks under the Hamming Weight (HW) leakage model, enabling us to evaluate the resistance of the scheme against SASCA. We then perform our attacks in a real case scenario, more specifically on the STM32F407, and recover the secret key for all the security levels. We end this paper by discussing the various shuffling countermeasures we could use to mitigate our attacks.

TI Cupolets: History, Theory, and Applications
SO DYNAMICS
AB In chaos control, one usually seeks to stabilize the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that densely inhabit the attractors of many chaotic dynamical systems. These orbits collectively play a significant role in determining the dynamics and properties of chaotic systems and are said to form the skeleton of the associated attractors. While UPOs are insightful tools for analysis, they are naturally unstable and, as such, are difficult to find and computationally expensive to stabilize. An alternative to using UPOs is to approximate them using cupolets. Cupolets, a name derived from chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets, are a relatively new class of waveforms that represent highly accurate approximations to the UPOs of chaotic systems, but which are generated via a particular control scheme that applies tiny perturbations along Poincar & eacute; sections. Originally discovered in an application of secure chaotic communications, cupolets have since gone on to play pivotal roles in a number of theoretical and practical applications. These developments include using cupolets as wavelets for image compression, targeting in dynamical systems, a chaotic analog to quantum entanglement, an abstract reducibility classification, a basis for audio and video compression, and, most recently, their detection in a chaotic neuron model. This review will detail the historical development of cupolets, how they are generated, and their successful integration into theoretical and computational science and will also identify some unanswered questions and future directions for this work.

TI AEKA: FPGA Implementation of Area-Efficient Karatsuba Accelerator for
   Ring-Binary-LWE-Based Lightweight PQC
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Lightweight PQC-related research and development have gradually gained attention from the research community recently. Ring-Binary-Learning-with-Errors (RBLWE)-based encryption scheme (RBLWE-ENC), a promising lightweight PQC based on small parameter sets to fit related applications ( but not in favor of deploying popular fast algorithms like number theoretic transform). To solve this problem, in this article, we present a novel implementation of hardware acceleration for RBLWE-ENC based on Karatsuba algorithm, particularly on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. In detail, we have proposed an areaefficient Karatsuba Accelerator (AEKA) for RBLWE-ENC, based on three layers of innovative efforts. First of all, we reformulate the signal processing sequence within the major arithmetic component of the KA-based polynomial multiplication for RBLWE-ENC to obtain a new algorithm. Then, we have designed the proposed algorithm into a new hardware accelerator with several novel algorithm-to-architecture mapping techniques. Finally, we have conducted thorough complexity analysis and comparison to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed accelerator, e.g., it involves 62.5% higher throughput and 60.2% less area-delay product (ADP) than the state-of-the-art design for n = 512 (Virtex-7 device, similar setup). The proposed AEKA design strategy is highly efficient on the FPGA devices, i.e., small resource usage with superior timing, which can be integrated with other necessary systems for lightweight-oriented high-performance applications (e.g., servers). The outcome of this work is also expected to generate impacts for lightweight PQC advancement.

TI Transfer Bandwidth Optimization for Multichannel Time-Correlated
   Single-Photon-Counting Systems Using a Router-Based Architecture: New
   Advancements and Results
SO PHOTONICS
AB Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) is a powerful technique for time-resolved measurement of fast and weak light signals used in a variety of scientific fields, including biology, medicine, and quantum cryptography. Unfortunately, given its repetitive nature, TCSPC is recognized as a relatively slow technique. In the last ten years, attempts have been made to speed it up by developing multichannel integrated architectures. Yet, for the solutions proposed thus far, the measurement speed has not increased proportionally to the number of channels, reducing the benefits of a multichannel approach. Recent theoretical studies and prototypes have shown that it is possible to implement a new multichannel architecture, so-called router-based architecture, capable of optimizing the efficiency of data transfer from the integrated chip to the data processor, increasing the overall measurement speed. However, the first implementations failed to achieve the theoretical results due to implementation flaws. In this paper, we present a new logic for the router-based architecture that can operate at the same laser frequency and solve the issues of the previous implementation. Alongside the new logic, we present a new integrated low-jitter delay line combined with a new method for timing-signal distribution that allows the proper management of the pixel timing information. The new implementation is a step closer to realizing a router-based architecture that achieves the expected theoretical results. Simulations and bench tests support the results here reported.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel trapdoor generation technique for Prest's hybrid sampler over NTRU lattices. Prest's sampler is used in particular in the recently proposed MITAKA signature scheme (Eurocrypt 2022), a variant of the FALCON signature scheme, one of the candidates selected by NIST for standardization. MITAKA was introduced to address FALCON's main drawback, namely the fact that the lattice Gaussian sampler used in its signature generation is highly complex, difficult to implement correctly, to parallelize or protect against side-channels, and to instantiate over rings of dimension not a power of two to reach intermediate security levels. Prest's sampler is considerably simpler and solves these various issues, but when applying the same trapdoor generation approach as FALCON, the resulting signatures have far lower security in equal dimension. The MITAKA paper showed how certain randomness-recycling techniques could be used to mitigate this security loss, but the resulting scheme is still substantially less secure than FALCON (by around 20 to 50 bits of CoreSVP security depending on the parameters), and has much slower key generation.
   Our new trapdoor generation techniques solves all of those issues satisfactorily: it gives rise to a much simpler and faster key generation algorithm than MITAKA's (achieving similar speeds to FALCON), and is able to comfortably generate trapdoors reaching the same NIST security levels as FALCON as well. It can also be easily adapted to rings of intermediate dimensions, in order to support the same versatility as MITAKA in terms of parameter selection. All in all, this new technique combines all the advantages of both FALCON and MITAKA (and more) with none of the drawbacks.

AB Signature schemes based on the MPC-in-the-head approach (MPCitH) have either been designed by taking a proof system and selecting a suitable symmetric-key primitive (Picnic, CCS16), or starting with an existing primitive such as AES and trying to find the most suitable proof system (BBQ, SAC19 or Banquet, PKC21). In this work we do both: we improve certain symmetric-key primitives to better fit existing signature schemes, and we also propose a new signature scheme that combines a new, minimalist one-way function with changes to a proof system to make their combination even more efficient. Our concrete results are as follows.
   First, we show how to provably remove the need to include the key schedule of block ciphers. This simplifies schemes like Picnic and it also leads to the fastest and smallest AES-based signatures, where we achieve signature sizes of around 10.8 to 14.2 KB using AES-128, on average 10% shorter than Banquet and 15% faster.
   Second, we investigate a variant of AES with larger S-boxes we call LSAES, for which we argue that it is likely to be at least as strong as AES, further reducing the size of AES-based signatures to 9.9 KB.
   Finally, we present a new signature scheme, Rainier, combining a new one-way function called Rain with a Banquet-like proof system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first MPCitH-based signature scheme which can produce signatures that are less than 5 KB in size; it also outperforms previous Picnic and Banquet instances in all performance metrics.<bold> </bold>

TI Efficient Algorithm-Level Error Detection for Number-Theoretic Transform
   Used for Kyber Assessed on FPGAs and ARM
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Polynomial multiplication stands out as a highly demanding arithmetic process in the development of post-quantum cryptosystems. The importance of the number-theoretic transform (NTT) extends beyond post-quantum cryptosystems, proving valuable in enhancing existing security protocols such as digital signature schemes and hash functions. CRYSTALS-KYBER stands out as the sole public key encryption (PKE) algorithm chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its third round selection, making it highly regarded as a leading post-quantum cryptography (PQC) solution. Faults have the potential to disrupt cryptographic systems, compromise data integrity, and enable side-channel attacks, making the incorporation of robust error detection mechanisms essential. This article introduces algorithm-level fault detection schemes in the NTT multiplication using Negative Wrapped Convolution (NWC) and the NTT tailored for Kyber Round 3, representing a significant enhancement compared with previous research. We evaluate this through the simulation of a fault model, ensuring that the conducted assessments accurately mirror the obtained results. Our fault detection scheme is designed to address both malicious fault injection attacks on Kyber and naturally occurring faults. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of the proposed error detection scheme for the NTT implemented in both NWC and Kyber, using AMD/Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, HLS and processor-based approaches. In our FPGA implementation of NWC, the integration of our error detection approach achieves near-100% fault coverage with minimal area overhead and results in only a 12% increase in latency compared with the original hardware design. Finally, we attained an error detection ratio of nearly 100% for the NTT operation in Kyber, with a clock cycle overhead of 16% on the Cortex-A72 processor.

TI Control Layer Security: Exploiting Unobservable Cooperative States of
   Autonomous Systems for Secret Key Generation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The rapid growth of autonomous systems (ASs) with data sharing means new cybersecurity methods have to be developed for them. Existing computational complexity-based cryptography does not have information-theoretical bounds and poses threats to superior computational attackers. This post-quantum cryptography issue indeed motivated the rapid advances in using common physical layer properties to generate symmetrical cipher keys (known as PLS). However, PLS remains sensitive to attackers (e.g., jamming) that destroy its prerequisite wireless channel reciprocity. When ASs are in cooperative tasks (e.g., rescuing searching, and formation flight), they will behave cooperatively in the control layer. Inspired by this, we propose a new security mechanism called control layer security (CLS), which exploits the correlated but unobservable states of cooperative ASs to generate symmetrical cipher keys. This idea is then realized in the linearized UAV cooperative control scenario. The theoretical correlation coefficients between Alice's and Bob's states are computed, based on which common feature selection and key quantization steps are designed. The results from simulation and real UAV experiments show i) an approximately 90% key agreement rate is achieved, and ii) even an Eve with the known observable states and systems fails to estimate the unobservable states and the secret keys relied upon, due to the multiple-to-one mapping from unobservable states (pitch, roll and yaw angles) to the observable states (3D trajectory). This demonstrates CLS as a promising candidate to secure the communications of ASs, especially in the adversarial radio environment with attackers that destroys the prerequisite for current PLS.

TI Geometry of Banach Spaces: A New Route Towards Position Based
   Cryptography
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work we initiate the study of position based quantum cryptography (PBQC) from the perspective of geometric functional analysis and its connections with quantum games. The main question we are interested in asks for the optimal amount of entanglement that a coalition of attackers have to share in order to compromise the security of any PBQC protocol. Known upper bounds for that quantity are exponential in the size of the quantum systems manipulated in the honest implementation of the protocol. However, known lower bounds are only linear. In order to deepen the understanding of this question, here we propose a position verification (PV) protocol and find lower bounds on the resources needed to break it. The main idea behind the proof of these bounds is the understanding of cheating strategies as vector valued assignments on the Boolean hypercube. Then, the bounds follow from the understanding of some geometric properties of particular Banach spaces, their type constants. Under some regularity assumptions on the former assignment, these bounds lead to exponential lower bounds on the quantum resources employed, clarifying the question in this restricted case. Known attacks indeed satisfy the assumption we make, although we do not know how universal this feature is. Furthermore, we show that the understanding of the type properties of some more involved Banach spaces would allow to drop out the assumptions and lead to unconditional lower bounds on the resources used to attack our protocol. Unfortunately, we were not able to estimate the relevant type constant. Despite that, we conjecture an upper bound for this quantity and show some evidence supporting it. A positive solution of the conjecture would lead to stronger security guarantees for the proposed PV protocol providing a better understanding of the question asked above.

TI TensorCrypto: High Throughput Acceleration of Lattice-Based Cryptography
   Using Tensor Core on GPU
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Tensor core is a newly introduced hardware unit in NVIDIA GPU chips that allows matrix multiplication to be computed much faster than in the integer and floating-point units. In this paper, we show that for the first time, tensor core can be used to accelerate state-of-the-art lattice-based cryptosystems. We employed tensor core to speed up polynomial convolution, which is the most time consuming operation in lattice-based cryptosystems. Towards that aim, several parallel algorithms are proposed to allow the tensor core to handle flexible matrix sizes and ephemeral key pairs. Experimental results show that the polynomial convolution computed using the tensor core is at least 2x faster than the version implemented with conventional integer units of the NVIDIA GPU. The proposed tensor-core-based polynomial convolution technique was applied to NTRU, one of the finalists in NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization. It achieved 2.02 x/1.98 x (encapsulation) and 1.56x/1.90 x (decapsulation) higher throughput on two parameter sets (ntruhps2048509 and ntruhps2048677), compared to the conventional integer-based implementations on a GPU. In particular, the proposed implementation techniques achieved throughput up to 793651 key encapsulations per second and 505051 decapsulations per second on a RTX2060 GPU. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed technique, we extend the implementation to other lattice-based cryptosystems that have a small modulus: LAC and two variant parameter sets in FrodoKEM. Considering that the IoT gateway devices and cloud servers need to handle massive connections from the sensor nodes, the proposed high throughput implementation on GPU is very useful in securing the IoT communication.

TI Hunting Quantum Gravity with Analogs: The Case of High-Energy Particle
   Physics
SO UNIVERSE
AB In this review, we collect, for the first time, old and new research results, and present future perspectives on how hadron production, in high-energy scattering processes, can experimentally probe fundamental questions of quantum gravity. The key observations that ignited the link between the two arenas are the so-called "color-event horizon" of quantum chromodynamics, and the (de)accelerations involved in such scattering processes. Both phenomena point to the Unruh (and related Hawking)-type effects. After the first pioneering investigations, such research studies continued, including studies of the horizon entropy and other "black-hole thermodynamical" behaviors, which incidentally are also part of the frontier of the analog gravity research itself. It has been stressed that the trait d'union between the two phenomenologies is that in both hadron physics and black hole physics, "thermal" behaviors are more easily understood, not as due to real thermalization processes (sometimes just impossible, given the small number of particles involved), but rather to a stochastic/quantum entanglement nature of such temperatures. Finally, other aspects, such as the self-critical organizations of hadronic matter and of black holes, have been recently investigated. The results of those investigations are also summarized and commented upon here. As a general remark, this research line shows that we can probe quantum gravity theoretical constructions with analog systems that are not confined to only the condensed matter arena.

TI Optimization of detector modules for measuring gamma-ray polarization in
   Positron Emission Tomography
SO NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS
   SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
AB Detection of gamma-ray polarization in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is as yet an unexploited feature that could be used as an additional handle to improve signal-to-background ratio in this imaging modality. The gamma polarization is related to the azimuthal angle in the Compton scattering process, so the initial correlation of polarizations of the annihilation quanta translates to the correlation of the azimuthal angles in events where both annihilation photons undergo Compton scattering in respective detectors. This results in a modulated distribution of the azimuthal angle difference for true events, while this modulation is lacking for the background events. We present a comprehensive experimental study of five detector configurations based on scintillator matrices and silicon photomultipliers, suitable for measuring the azimuthal modulation. The modules consist of either GaGG:Ce or LYSO:Ce pixels with sizes varying from 1.9 x 1.9 x 20 mm(3) to 3 x 3 x 20 mm(3). The distinctive feature of the modules is that they can reconstruct the Compton scattering by detecting the recoil electron and the scattered gamma in a single detector layer, which simplifies extension to larger systems. The amplitude modulation of the azimuthal angles' difference is clearly observable in all configurations ranging from 0.26 +/- 0.01 to 0.34 +/- 0.02 depending on the event selection criteria. The results suggest that finer detector segmentation plays a leading role in achieving higher modulation factors.

TI Squeezing and evolution of single particle by frequency jumping in
   two-dimensional rotating harmonic
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The control of microscopic particle behavior based on a specific external field has always been a research hotspot in the field of physics. Many studies have been exploring various methods to manipulate and control the behavior of particles at a microscopic level. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of single-particle squeezing induced by frequency jumping in a two-dimensional rotating harmonic oscillator potential. Squeezing, as a quantum mechanical phenomenon, has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in various fields. It refers to the reduction of fluctuations in certain physical quantities, allowing for more precise measurement results. Squeezing phenomena have been extensively studied in different physical systems, including optics, atomic physics, and solid-state physics. However, there have been few reports on the quantum state squeezing phenomenon induced by frequency jumping in a rotating harmonic oscillator potential. Therefore, our study aims to fill this gap and shed light on this intriguing phenomenon. To explore the squeezing phenomenon induced by frequency jumping, we focus on the fluctuations and squeezing of the single particle's cyclotron radius coordinate and center-guided coordinate in the two-dimensional rotating harmonic oscillator potential. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we can understand the influence of frequency jumping on the degree of squeezing and reveal the underlying physical mechanism of squeezing evolution. In this work, we first investigate the influence of frequency jumping on the squeezing evolution of the cyclotron radius mode. By carefully selecting appropriate jumping moments, we analyze the influence of frequency jumping on the degree of squeezing. Our research results show that the degree of squeezing in the cyclotron radius coordinate remains unchanged at the jumping moment. However, we observe a stronger squeezing phenomenon in the subsequent evolution process. This indicates that frequency jumping plays a crucial role in squeezing evolution of the cyclotron radius mode. Furthermore, we focus on the squeezing evolution of the center-guided mode during frequency jumping. By selecting suitable parameters, we analyze the squeezing and evolution of two squeezing modes: the divergent mode and the oscillatory mode. Interestingly, we discover the existence of a critical potential trap aspect ratio, which is determined by the rotation angular velocity of the external potential. When the aspect ratio approaches this critical value, the squeezing mode undergoes a transition, and a significant squeezing phenomenon appears in the oscillatory mode. This finding provides valuable insights into the origin and control of squeezing phenomena. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of these squeezing phenomena. Squeezing has significant implications in the fields of quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Through a deeper understanding of the squeezing evolution process caused by frequency jump, we can better control the microscopic particle behavior through external field. This knowledge opens up new possibilities for future physical research and technical applications.

TI Improved device-independent randomness expansion rates using two sided
   randomness
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A device-independent randomness expansion (DIRE) protocol aims to take an initial random string and generate a longer one, where the security of the protocol does not rely on knowing the inner workings of the devices used to run it. In order to do so, the protocol tests that the devices violate a Bell inequality and one then needs to bound the amount of extractable randomness in terms of the observed violation. The entropy accumulation theorem lower bounds the extractable randomness of a protocol with many rounds in terms of the single-round von Neumann entropy of any strategy achieving the observed score. Tight bounds on the von Neumann entropy are known for the one-sided randomness (i.e. where the randomness from only one party is used) when using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt game. Here we investigate the possible improvement that could be gained using the two-sided randomness. We generate upper bounds on this randomness by attempting to find the optimal eavesdropping strategy, providing analytic formulae in two cases. We additionally compute lower bounds that outperform previous ones and can be made arbitrarily tight (at the expense of more computation time). These bounds get close to our upper bounds, and hence we conjecture that our upper bounds are tight. We also consider a modified protocol in which the input randomness is recycled. This modified protocol shows the possibility of rate gains of several orders of magnitude based on recent experimental parameters, making DIRE significantly more practical. It also enables the locality loophole to be closed while expanding randomness in a way that typical spot-checking protocols do not.

TI PowderMEMS® magnets as enabler for miniaturized NV based quantum sensors

AB The implementation of PowderMEMS (R) micromagnets of varying shapes, with lateral dimensions of 700 mu m and 800 mu m, into 2.3 x 2.3 x 0.525 mm(3) silicon chips has been demonstrated successfully. These chips have been utilized as functionalized interposer for micro-scaled quantum devices. PowderMEMS (R) micromagnets offer a high biasing magnetic field flux density ranging from 30 mT to 35 mT over a distance of 100 mu m depending on the size and shape of the micromagnets. This magnetic field strength (B-Z) was proven by room temperature ODMR measurements with NV centers in diamond: B-Z was measured over a range of distances, extending to 6 mm from the center of the micromagnets. The evaluation involved the analysis of Zeeman splitting. Furthermore, a Hall measurement setup was employed to map the lateral distribution of the magnetic field strength.

TI Chip-Scale Ultra-Low Field Atomic Magnetometer Based on Coherent
   Population Trapping
SO SENSORS
AB We report a chip-scale atomic magnetometer based on coherent population trapping, which can operate near zero magnetic field. By exploiting the asymmetric population among magnetic sublevels in the hyperfine ground state of cesium, we observe that the resonance signal acquires sensitivity to magnetic field in spite of degeneracy. A dispersive signal for magnetic field discrimination is obtained near-zero-field as well as for finite fields (tens of micro-tesla) in a chip-scale device of 0.94 cm(3) volume. This shows that it can be readily used in low magnetic field environments, which have been inaccessible so far in miniaturized atomic magnetometers based on coherent population trapping. The measured noise floor of 300 pT/Hz(1/2) at the zero-field condition is comparable to that of the conventional finite-field measurement obtained under the same conditions. This work suggests a way to implement integrated atomic magnetometers with a wide operating range.

TI Applying Coherent Ising Machines for Enhancing Communication Efficiency
   in Large-Scale UAV-Aided Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used widely in wireless communications to enhance the service experience of mobile users on the ground. This study investigates a dynamic resource management problem in a large-scale UAV-aided wireless network, where multiple UAVs operate as aerial base stations to serve ground users. To enhance communication efficiency for all users in the presence of co-channel interference, we propose the use of an Ising model-based optimization method for fast and accurate UAV-user association and resource allocation. First, we formulate the dynamic user association and resource allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Subsequently, we transform the objective function in the formulated problem into the energy function of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and applied coherent ising machine (CIM), which has been proven to be robust for solving dense Ising problems. We evaluate our proposed method through simulations and the real CIM for optimization. Additionally, we compared our method with simulated annealing, steepest descent, and exhaustive search. Performance evaluation results indicate that our proposed method is superior in terms of computational time and data rate.

TI Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
   classical light
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs, ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry approaches. We present a "quantum-like" nonlinear optical method that reaches super-resolution in classical detection regime. This is achieved by replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the potential applications of this pathway.

TI Controllable Chiral Light Generation and Vortex Field Investigation
   Using Plasmonic Holes Revealed by Cathodoluminescence
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Control of the angular momentum of light is a key technology for next-generation nano-optical devices and optical communications, including quantum communication and encoding. We propose an approach to controllably generate circularly polarized light from a circular hole in a metal film using an electron beam by coherently exciting transition radiation and light scattering from the hole through surface plasmon polaritons. The circularly polarized light generation is confirmed by fully polarimetric four-dimensional cathodoluminescence mapping, where angle-resolved spectra are simultaneously obtained. The obtained intensity and Stokes maps show clear interference fringes as well as almost fully circularly polarized light generation with controllable parities by the electron beam position. By applying this approach to a three-hole system, a vortex field with a phase singularity is visualized in the middle of three holes.

TI Orbital angular momentum in the near-field of a fork grating
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Light beams with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) are explored in applications from microscopy to quantum communication, while the Talbot effect revives in applications from atomic systems to x-ray phase contrast interferometry. We evidence the topological charge of an OAM carrying THz beam in the near-field of a binary amplitude fork-grating by means of the Talbot effect, which we show to persist over several fundamental Talbot lengths. We measure and analyze the evolution of the diffracted beam behind the fork grating in Fourier domain to recover the typical donut-shaped power distribution, and we compare experimental data to simulations. We isolate the inherent phase vortex using the Fourier phase retrieval method. To complement the analysis, we assess the OAM diffraction orders of a fork grating in the far-field using a cylindrical lens.

TI Quantum Functionalities Via Feedback Amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Feedback amplification is a key technique for synthesizing various functionalities, especially in electronic circuits involving op amps. This paper presents a quantum version of this methodology, where the general phase-preserving quantum amplifier and coherent (i.e., measurement-free) feedback are employed to construct various types of systems having useful functionalities: quantum versions of differentiator, integrator, self-oscillator, and active filters. The class of active filters includes the Butterworth filter, which can be used to enhance the capacity of an optical quantum communication channel, and the nonreciprocal amplifier, which enables measurement of a superconducting qubits system as well as protection of it by separating input from output fields. A particularly detailed investigation is performed on the active phasecanceling filter for realizing a broadband gravitational-wave detector; that is, the feedback-amplification method is used to construct an active filter that compensates the phase delay of the signal and eventually recovers the sensitivity in the high-frequency regime.

TI All-Optical Parametric-Resonance Magnetometer Based on 4He
   Atomic Alignment
SO SENSORS
AB Parametric-resonance magnetometer is a high-sensitivity quantum sensor characterized by applying the non-resonant radio-frequency (RF) fields to the atomic ensemble. The RF fields lead to crosstalk in the multi-sensor design, thus disturbing the magnetic-field measurement results. We propose an optically modulated alignment-based He-4 parametric-resonance magnetometer. By using the fictitious field generated by the modulated light shift, parametric resonance is realized, and crosstalk caused by the magnetic RF field is prevented. The relative intensity noise of the lasers is suppressed to optimize the sensitivity of the magnetometer. Our magnetometer experimentally demonstrates a magnetic-field noise floor of 130 fT/Hz(1/2) in both open- and closed-loop operations and has the potential to reach 70 fT/Hz(1/2) when compared with the optimized magnetic RF scheme. It provides near-zero magnetic-field measurements with a 2 kHz bandwidth at room temperature, which is useful for high-bandwidth measurements in biomagnetic applications.

TI Chirality Switching of Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Halide
   Perovskites via Motor-Doped Chiral Liquid Crystals
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are pivotal for advanced photonics, including chiral sensing, spin-optoelectronics, and quantum communication. However, achieving dynamic and reversible control over their chirality remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a chirality-invertible CP light source by integrating a photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) modulation layer with a polycrystalline perovskite gain medium. Under ultraviolet irradiation, the CLC layer undergoes reversible handedness inversion, enabling dynamic switching of the chirality of the perovskite's amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The device features switchable CP-ASE with a tunable circular polarization dissymmetry factor (g lum) ranging from -1.38 to +1.22. Furthermore, broadband CP-ASE emission from green to near-infrared is achieved by tailoring the perovskite halide composition. This work presents a versatile strategy for fabricating reconfigurable CP light sources, offering new avenues toward spin-polarization switchable chiral laser devices.

TI Detection efficiency characterization for free-space single-photon
   detectors: Measurement facility and wavelength-dependence investigation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this paper, we present an experimental apparatus for the measurement of the detection efficiency of free-space single-photon detectors based on the substitution method. We extend the analysis to account for the wavelength dependence introduced by the transmissivity of the optical window in front of the detector's active area. Our method involves measuring the detector's response at different wavelengths and comparing it to a calibrated reference detector. This allows us to accurately quantify the efficiency variations due to the optical window's transmissivity. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the wavelength-dependent efficiency, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of single-photon detectors in various applications, including quantum communication and photonics research. This characterization technique offers a significant advancement in the precision and reliability of single-photon detection efficiency measurements.

TI Progress of Silicon Carbide Integrated Photonics
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance The industrialization in the fields of telecommunications, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things has steadily progressed. With the increasing demand for information transmission and data processing in these fields, it is not sustainable anymore to optimize processing speed only via increase in integration density and miniaturization of transistors, which are limited by the laws of physics, design complexity, and cost. Therefore, complementing the current lack of processing speed by other novel technologies is being widely discussed. Integrated photonics, which uses photons as information carriers, can be an alternative to meet the aforementioned requirements. Compared with traditional electrical circuits, photon integrated circuits leverage micro and nanoscale optical components to realize light transmission, which offer several prominent features such as high bandwidth, low power consumption, and ultrahigh transmission speed. Specifically, on-chip photonic systems can be used to host high-Q resonant cavities for enhancing light-matter interaction owing to the unique physical characteristics of photons and advanced manufacturing techniques. This in turn paves the way for applications in nonlinear photonics and quantum photonics.
   Thus far, many manufacturing processes have been established for integrated photonics on various material platforms such as silica, III-V compound semiconductors, silicon, silicon nitride, and lithium niobate. Of these platforms, silicon-integrated photonics has remarkably progressed owing to mature manufacturing techniques for Si-based integrated circuits, whereas the absence of photoelectric characteristics and the high propagation loss are not beneficial for establishment of configurable photonic systems. Lithium niobate, which is considered a promising platform for integrated photonics, has been applied in ultrafast optical modulation and microwave photonics because of its remarkable attributes of second- and third-order nonlinearities and low optical loss; however, one must consider that its incompatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and its photorefractive effect impede the commercialization of lithium niobate photonics. As direct bandgap semiconductors, the high-efficiency electroluminescence of III-V materials makes on-chip laser a plausible technique for large-scale photonic circuits; however, the relatively high propagation loss and narrow transparency window are still detrimental factors.
   The development of silicon carbide-integrated photonics is in its infancy stage. Silicon carbide has attracted considerable research interest in the recent years owing to its remarkable material and optical properties, and it has gradually emerged as a candidate for industrialization of integrated photonics on account of its CMOS compatibility. Benefiting from the high nonlinear coefficients and low optical loss, silicon carbide has been extensively used to realize many nonlinear optical effects for fabrication of compact and scalable integrated photonic circuits. These effects include efficient second-harmonic generation, rapid electro-optical modulation, and silicon optical frequency comb generation, among others. Meanwhile, similar to diamond, there exist numerous spin defects in silicon carbide materials, and they have been proven to be impressive quantum light sources in optical resonators for study of cavity quantum electrodynamics effects.
   Currently, novel research works have confirmed the potential of silicon carbide photonics as an ideal candidate, but they are still plagued by several problems related to micromachining limitation and inefficient modulation. To further explore the industrial feasibility of photonics chips, the extra innovations in fabrication and device design are still required to attain a monolithic photonic system based on silicon carbide with linear modulating methods and configurable nonlinear effects. Therefore, one must comprehensively present the latest research progress on silicon carbide-integrated photonics, while relevant prominent performance should be indicated to emphasize the prospective of silicon carbide as a universal platform for integrated photonics.
   Progress For achieving sufficient reliability and high density of integration, silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) structures can be used to confine a light field within the functional layer without suspension. Preparations, including thin film preparation for 3C-SiCOI (see Fig. 1), smart-cut technology (see Fig. 2), and grinding thinning (see Fig. 3) for 4H-SiCOI, are introduced with specific process flow and material characterization. Among them, the research groups from Columbia University, Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology, Stanford University, respectively, have prepared SiCOI with low surface roughness and low cost. The SiCOI platforms prepared using the aforementioned methods exhibit relatively low optical loss (see Table 2), which enable different nonlinear frequency conversions to be implemented on high-Q microcavities based on SiCOI. In terms of second-harmonic generation (see Fig. 4) and electro-optical modulation (Fig. 5), various devices such as waveguides, photonic crystals, and microrings in SiCOIs, as well as their fundamental principles and performance merits, are listed. Considering the generation of wide optical frequency combs, a comb spectrum with stable silicon states based on high-Q microcavities has been yielded in 4H-SiCOI (see Fig. 6); additionally, second-harmonic generation is favorable for broadening the comb spectrum by accomplishing the frequency conversion between the midinfrared and visible bands (see Fig. 7). Abundant color centers with attractive properties in silicon carbide allow for integration of color centers and microcavities (see Fig. 9) and coherent manipulation over nuclear spin qubits (see Fig. 10). Additionally, issues regarding precisely locating the color centers in 4H-SiCOI are considered vis-a-vis some recent studies (see Fig. 11). The challenges and prospects of silicon carbide photonics are discussed, including its commercialization requirements, application in quantum networks, heterogeneous integration for monolithic all-optical systems, and on-chip multiphysical field coupling.
   Conclusions and Prospects Silicon carbide-integrated photonics has attracted considerable research interest in the recent years. On account of its salient nonlinearity and CMOS compatibility, silicon carbide has gradually emerged as a candidate material for integrated photonic circuits. With a view to fully benefiting from the impressive material and optical properties of silicon carbide, advanced fabrication methods and on-chip device designs must be explored for large-scale application of integrated photonics based on SiCOI. Moreover, in conjunction with CMOS electronic devices and acoustic devices, integrated photonics based on SiCOI will be capable of making silicon carbide as a promising material platform for achieving multiphysical field coupling in monolithically integrated photonics.

TI Quantum advantages for data transmission in future networks: An overview
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB We review recent advancements in the domain of Joint Detection Receivers and Entanglement-Assisted Data transmission links with an emphasis on their potential use in future networks. Both data transmission techniques can surpass the Shannon limit by significant amounts in situations where either the number of photons per received information carrier or the number of transmitted photons per information carrier is extremely small. To obtain an advantage from shared entanglement, significant noise levels are needed as well. These fundamental constraints dictate that only certain application scenarios are of relevance to the new technology. We discuss these constraints in detail in the context of the current network architecture and stress the relation to optical computation. Based on our discussion, we go on to propose potential domains of application for the new technology.

TI Generation of transversely oriented optical polarization Mobius strips
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a time-reversal method based on the Richards-Wolf vectorial diffraction theory to generate a prescribed polarization topology on a defined trajectory within areas of relatively high intensity. An example is given to generate transversely oriented optical Mobius strips that wander around an axis perpendicular to the beam propagation direction. A number of sets of dipole antennae are purposefully positioned on a defined trajectory in the y = 0 plane and the radiation fields are collected by one high-NA objective lens. By sending the complex conjugate of the radiation fields in a time-reversed manner, the focal fields are calculated and the optical polarization topology on the trajectory can be tailored to form prescribed Mobius strips. The ability to control optical polarization topologies may find applications in nanofabrication, quantum communication, and light-matter interaction.

TI Squeezed light from an oscillator measured at the rate of oscillation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Sufficiently fast continuous measurements of the position of an oscillator approach measurements projective on position eigenstates. We evidence the transition into the projective regime for a spin oscillator within an ensemble of 2 x10(10) room-temperature atoms by observing correlations between the quadratures of the meter light field. These correlations squeeze the fluctuations of one light quadrature below the vacuum level. When the measurement is slower than the oscillation, we generate 11.5(-1.5)(+2.5) dB and detect 8.5(-0.1)(+0.1) dB of squeezing in a tunable band that is a fraction of the resonance frequency. When the measurement is as fast as the oscillation, we detect 4.7 dB of squeezing that spans more than one decade of frequencies below the resonance. Our results demonstrate a new regime of continuous quantum measurements on material oscillators, and set a new benchmark for the performance of a linear quantum sensor.

TI Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Auto-Oscillations with a Single Spin
   Sensor
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spin Hall nano-oscillators convert DC to magnetic auto-oscillations in the microwave regime. Current research on these devices is dedicated to creating next-generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. Despite intensive research on magnetic auto-oscillations within the past decade, the nanoscale mapping of those dynamics remained a challenge. We image the distribution of free-running magnetic auto-oscillations by driving the electron spin resonance transition of a single spin quantum sensor, enabling fast acquisition (100 ms/pixel). With quantitative magnetometry, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that the auto-oscillation spots are localized at magnetic field minima acting as local potential wells for confining spin-waves. By comparing the magnitudes of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.

TI Embedding of complete graphs in broken Chimera graphs
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In order to solve real-world combinatorial optimization problems with a D-Wave quantum annealer, it is necessary to embed the problem at hand into the D-Wave hardware graph, namely Chimera or Pegasus. Most hard real-world problems exhibit a strong connectivity. For the worst-case scenario of a complete graph, there exists an efficient solution for the embedding into the ideal Chimera graph. However, since real machines almost always have broken qubits, it is necessary to find an embedding into the broken hardware graph. We present a new approach to the problem of embedding complete graphs into broken Chimera graphs. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, more precisely as a matching problem with additional linear constraints. Although being NP-hard in general, it is fixed-parameter tractable in the number of inaccessible vertices in the Chimera graph. We tested our exact approach on various instances of broken hardware graphs, both related to real hardware and randomly generated. For fixed runtime, we were able to embed larger complete graphs compared to previous, heuristic approaches. As an extension, we developed a fast heuristic algorithm which enables us to solve even larger instances. We compared the performance of our heuristic and exact approaches.

TI Chordal graphs and distinguishability of quantum product states
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate a graph -theoretic approach to the problem of distinguishing quantum product states in the fundamental quantum communication framework called local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We identify chordality as the key graph structure that drives distinguishability in one-way LOCC, and we derive a one-way LOCC characterization for chordal graphs that establishes a connection with the theory of matrix completions. We also derive minimality conditions on graph parameters that allow for the determination of indistinguishability of states. We present a number of applications and examples built on these results.

TI Practical continuous-variable quantum secret sharing using local local
   oscillator
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Although continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) has been theoretically proven to be secure, it may still be vulnerable to various local oscillator (LO) attacks. To close this loophole, here we propose a practical CVQSS scheme using local LO (LLO-CVQSS), where LO is no longer generated by each user but is locally generated by the legitimate dealer. This waives the necessity that all LOs have to be transmitted through untrusted channels, making CVQSS system naturally immune to all LO-aimed attacks and enhancing its practical security. We also develop a dedicated phase compensation method for LLO-CVQSS to control the phase noise, and construct a noise model that derives its security bound against both eavesdroppers and dishonest users. Finally, numerical simulation shows that LLO-CVQSS can support 30 users at the same time and the maximal transmission distance reaches 112 km, revealing its potential for building large-scale practical quantum communication networks.

TI Time transfer over 113 km free space laser communication channel
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The space time frequency transfer plays a crucial role in applications such as space optical clock networks, navigation, satellite ranging, and space quantum communication. Here, we propose a high-precision space time frequency transfer and time synchronization scheme based on a simple intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) laser communication system, which occupies a communication bandwidth of approximately 0.2%. Furthermore, utilizing an optical-frequency comb time frequency transfer system as an out-of-loop reference, experimental verification was conducted on a 113 km horizontal atmospheric link, with a long-term stability approximately 8.3 x 10-16 over a duration of 7800 seconds. Over an 11-hour period, the peak-to-peak wander is approximately 100 ps. Our work establishes the foundation of the time frequency transfer, based on the space laser communication channel, for future ground-to-space and inter-satellite links.

TI Two-sequential conclusive discrimination between binary coherent states
   via indirect measurements
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A general scenario for an N-sequential conclusive state discrimination introduced recently in Loubenets and Namkung [arXiv:2102.04747] can provide a multipartite quantum communication realizable in the presence of a noise. In the present article, we propose a new experimental scheme for the implementation of a sequential conclusive discrimination between binary coherent states via indirect measurements within the Jaynes-Cummings interaction model. We find that if the mean photon number is less than 1.6, then, for our two-sequential state discrimination scheme, the optimal success probability is larger than the one presented in Fields, Bergou, and Varga (2020, IEEE Int. Conf. Quant. Comp. Eng.). We also show that, if the mean photon number is almost equal to 1.2, then the optimal success probability nearly approaches the Helstrom bound.

TI C-band plug-and-play all-fiber single-photon source based on InAs/InP
   quantum dots integrated via microtransfer printing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fiber-based long-haul quantum communication would greatly benefit from a robust and deterministically integrated source of quantum states. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of InAs/InP quantum dots in the InP H1 point-defect 2D photonic crystal cavity, integrated with a standard single-mode fiber employing microtransfer printing. The device is placed in a compact cryocooler maintaining a cryogenic temperature of 15 K, and it exhibits a low multiphoton contribution to emission, with g(2)(0) = 0.14(14) in the all-fiber-based optical link between two laboratory nodes. In this way, we demonstrate a plug-and-play all-fiber single-photon source operating in the third telecom window, where standard telecommunication fiber networks can be used as a low-loss medium.
