TI Performance analysis of free-space quantum key distribution using
   multiple spatial modes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the diffraction-limited near-field propagation regime, free-space optical quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can employ multiple spatial modes to improve their key rate. This improvement can be effected by means of high-dimensional QKD or by spatial-mode multiplexing of independent QKD channels, with the latter, in general, offering higher key rates. Here, we theoretically analyze spatial-mode-multiplexed, decoy-state BB84 whose transmitter mode set is either a collection of phase-tilted, flat-top focused beams (FBs) or the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Although for vacuum propagation the FBs suffer a QKD rate penalty relative to the LG modes, their potential ease of implementation make them an attractive alternative. Moreover, in the presence of turbulence, the FB modes may outperform the LG modes. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Error correction plays a major role in the reconciliation of continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) and greatly affects the performance of the system. CV-QKD requires error correction codes of extremely low rates and high reconciliation efficiencies. There are only very few code designs available in this ultra low rate regime. In this paper, we introduce a method for designing protograph-based ultra low rate LDPC codes using differential evolution. By proposing type-based protographs, a new way of representing low rate protograph-based LDPC codes, we drastically reduce the complexity of the protograph optimization, which enables us to quickly design codes over a wide range of rates. We show that the codes resulting from our optimization outperform the codes from the literature both in regards to the threshold and in finite-length performance, validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, showing gains in the regime relevant for CV-QKD.

AB Circuit knitting emerges as a promising technique to overcome the limitation of the few physical qubits in near-term quantum hardware by cutting large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits. Recent research in this area has been primarily oriented towards reducing subcircuit sampling overhead. Unfortunately, these works neglect hardware information during circuit cutting, thus posing significant challenges to the follow on stages. In fact, direct compilation and execution of these partitioned subcircuits yields low-fidelity results, highlighting the need for a more holistic optimization strategy.
   In this work, we propose a hardware-aware framework aiming to advance the practicability of circuit knitting. Drawing a contrast with prior methodologies, the presented framework designs a cutting scheme that concurrently optimizes the number of gate cuttings and SWAP insertions during circuit cutting. In particular, we leverage the graph similarity between qubits interactions and chip layout as a heuristic guide to reduces potential SWAPs in the subsequent step of qubit routing. Building upon this, the circuit knitting framework we developed has been evaluated on several quantum algorithms, leading to reduction of total subcircuits depth by up to 64% (48% on average) compared to the state-of-the-art approach, and enhancing the relative fidelity up to 2.7x.

TI Ambiguous resonances in multipulse quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy
   centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid-state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterize three of these effects present in single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, where we also develop a numerical simulation model without rotating-wave approximation, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the 15N nitrogen isotope, we observe that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice 13C nuclei, where we use the echo modulation frequencies to obtain the interaction Hamiltonian and then utilize the latter to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measure and simulate the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependence of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations data set with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused on nitrogen-vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid-state spins and quantum sensing techniques.

TI Universal approach to sending-or-not-sending twin field quantum key
   distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a universal approach to sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol of twin-field quantum key distribution with the method of actively odd parity pairing. In this improved protocol, the code bits are not limited to heralded events in time windows participated by pulses of intensity mu(z) and vacuum. All kinds of heralded events can be used for code bits to distill the final keys. The number of intensities (3 or 4) and the kinds of heralded events for code bits are automatically chosen by the key rate optimization itself. Numerical simulation shows that the key rate rises drastically in typical settings, up to 80% improvement compared with the prior results. Also, larger intensity value can be used for decoy pulses. This makes the protocol more robust in practical experiments.

TI Implementation of Single-Qubit Gates via Parametric Modulation in the
   Majorana Transmon
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a voltage gate-based method for controlling the Majorana transmon, using a sinusoidal modulation of the induced offset charge n(g). Working in the transmon regime and in the instantaneous eigenstates basis, we find the time evolution under this protocol that realizes tunable X-Z rotations. We optimize the parameters of the system for different single-qubit gates in both the laboratory frame and the qubit rotating frame, obtaining qubit control errors 1 - F smaller than about 2 x 10(-4). In addition to this, we conduct an analysis of the effects of the charge noise, assuming wide-band 1/f additive noise in n(g), both for the free and the driven evolutions. For the free evolution, the relaxation and dephasing rates are calculated perturbatively, obtaining long dephasing times of the order of milliseconds at the system's sweet spots. For the driven case, the average fidelity for the X gate is obtained via a numerical simulation, demonstrating remarkable resilience.

Spin- and topology-related quantum phenomena have several advantages, including high coherence time, topological protection and stability, low error rate, relative ease of engineering and control, and simple initiation and readout. However, the relevant technologies are at different stages of research and development, and here, we discuss their state-of-the-art, potential applications, challenges, and solutions.

TI A Quantum-Resistant FHE Framework for Privacy-Preserving Image
   Processing in the Cloud
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to the security of cloud services that handle sensitive visual data. Simultaneously, the need for computational privacy requires the ability to process data without exposing it to the cloud provider. This paper introduces and evaluates a hybrid quantum-resistant framework that addresses both challenges by integrating NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography with optimized fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Our solution uses CRYSTALS-Kyber for secure channel establishment and the CKKS FHE scheme with SIMD batching to perform image processing tasks on a cloud server without ever decrypting the image. This work provides a comprehensive performance analysis of the complete, end-to-end system. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the framework's practicality, detailing the sub-millisecond PQC setup costs and the amortized transfer of 33.83 MB of public FHE materials. The operational performance shows remarkable scalability, with server-side computations and client-side decryption completing within low single-digit milliseconds. By providing a detailed analysis of a viable and efficient architecture, this framework establishes a practical foundation for the next generation of privacy-preserving cloud applications.

TI Fusion-aware quantum variational autoencoder for brain-heart signal
   modeling in mental health applications
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging research area focused on enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and interpretability of biomedical signals. In this study, we propose a Quantum Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) framework for EEG-ECG-based mental health diagnostics, integrating quantum amplitude encoding, entanglement-driven latent space transformation, and a hybrid quantum-classical attention mechanism. The proposed QVAE model leverages quantum computational techniques to enhance classification performance, signal reconstruction, and latent feature interpretability. We introduce a quantum Wasserstein-Fisher Hybrid Loss Function, which integrates Quantum Wasserstein Distance (QWD) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) for multimodal physiological data. Through extensive experimentation on EEG and ECG datasets from Brainwave and PhysioNet repositories, the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 97.8% and an error of 0.007, significantly outperforming baseline CNNs, classical variational autocoders, and classical variationals. Importantly, extensive simulations on IBM Qiskit and PennyLane quantum simulators demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework on quantum simulators, supporting its potential for deployment on near-term quantum hardware. This study contributes to quantum machine learning for healthcare by achieving high diagnostic accuracy and robust signal reconstruction, demonstrating its suitability for immediate clinical translation into quantum-enhanced EEG diagnostics.

TI Quantum transfer learning for breast cancer detection
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB One of the areas with the potential to be explored in quantum computing (QC) is machine learning (ML), giving rise to quantum machine learning (QML). In an era when there is so much data, ML may benefit from either speed, complexity or smaller amounts of storage. In this work, we explore a quantum approach to a machine learning problem. Based on the work of Mari et al., we train a set of hybrid classical-quantum neural networks using transfer learning (TL). Our task was to solve the problem of classifying full-image mammograms into malignant and benign, provided by BCDR. Throughout the course of our work, heatmaps were used to highlight the parts of the mammograms that were being targeted by the networks while evaluating different performance metrics. Our work shows that this method may hold benefits regarding the generalization of complex data; however, further tests are needed. We also show that, depending on the task, some architectures perform better than others. Nonetheless, our results were superior to those reported in the state-of-the-art (accuracy of 84% against 76.9%, respectively). In addition, experiments were conducted in a real quantum device, and results were compared with the classical and simulator.

TI QUANTUM DIGITAL-ANALOGUE COMPUTING
SO RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL
AB Context. Nature is the relation among processes and phenomena. Nothing exists in the universe without relations. Computer is transactions of relations between data with the help of control and execution mechanisms. Quantum relations are a superposition of particles and their states. Superposition and entanglement are equivalent concepts. Entanglement is a non-local superposition of deterministic states. A quantum computer is unconditional transactions of relations between qubit data. Quantum computer is ananalog device for parallel solution of combinatorial problems. Practically oriented definitions of the quantum computer concepts are the path to development of scalable quantum parallel algorithms for combinatorial problems solving. Any algorithm can be reduced to a sequence of operations without conditions, because any truth table is a collection of a complete system of conditions-states. Any sequence of actions can always be reduced to one parallel operation. Conditions and sequences arise only when the developer wants to use previously created primitive constructs to build an always non-optimal computing unit. The paradigm of quantum computercreation is determined through the use of photonic transactions on the electrons of an atom may exclude the use of quantum logic. The evolutionary path of a quantum computer from the classical one: "memory-address-transaction" (MAT) -> "electron-address-transaction" -> "electron-address-quantaction" (EAQ) -> state-superposition-logic. The meeting point of classical and quantum computers is photon transactions on the structure of electrons. Everything that is calculated on a quantum computer can be calculated in parallel on a classical one on account of memory redundancy. The given example is a memory-driven algorithm for modeling digital products based on qubit-vector forms of functionality description for significant performance boost of computing processes by parallel execution of logical operations. Objective. Simulation of the correct SoC-component behavior based on vector representation of the logic. Formation of the triggering development of a computing based on the superposition of the classical, quantum and analog computing process, which in its development should be based on technological qubit, tabular and vector data structures for the parallel solution of combinatorial problems. Method. MAT-computing implements any algorithms on account of transactions (read-write) in memory. Qubit-vector models for describing functionalities, which differ from known truth tables in compactness of description and manufacturability for the implementation of parallel algorithms of the synthesis and analysis of digital devices and SoC-components. Results. 1) The metric of the technological data structures, focused on parallel troubleshooting in digital systems based on the usage of two logical vector operations, was proposed for the first time. 2) The metric of relations between the individual components of QC, allowing organizing a quantum deterministic computer, has been further developed. 3) Quantum architectural solutions, that allow solving coverage problems in a quasi-parallel mode, were proposed for the first time. 4) Architectural solutions based on an analog-to-digital computing, which can be used to solve the problems of the digital systems parallel analysis, have been further de-veloped. 5) Vector-qubit structures of the logic data, that allow a quasi-parallel simulation of digital circuits, were proposed. Conclusions.
   Qubit models, quantum methods and combinatorial algorithms for technical diagnostics of digital devices have been implemented, which can significantly (up to 25%) reduce the time of test synthesis, deductive modeling of faulty and correct behavior, search for defective states by introducing an innovative idea of using qubit-vector data structures for describing logical components. Comparative assessments of qubit models and methods usage show an increase in the efficiency of algorithms for modeling digital devices compared to tabular ones. The superposition of a classical, quantum and analog computer is integrallyrepresented, which allows to find the best solutions for recognition and decision making

TI A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate:
   Magneto-Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB In the development of two-qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin-spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states |00 > |01 > |10 > |11 > by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso-meso (m-m) singly-linked (VO)-O-IV-CuII porphyrin dimer. X-band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8 center dot 10(-3) cm(-1). This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g-tensors of VIV and CuII-ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single-spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.
   Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that a vanadyl-copper meso-meso linked bisporphyrin complex has good spin coherence and a sizeable magnetic exchange interaction, making it suitable for operating two-qubit molecular spin-based quantum gates over a wide range of operation conditions. Theoretical calculations show that the super-exchange interaction is granted by the out-of-plane component of the vanadyl magnetic orbital despite the tilting angle of the two rings.image

TI Constraint Relation Between Steerability and Concurrence for Two-Qubit
   States
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Entanglement and steering are used to describe quantum correlation. And steerable states form a strict subset of entangled states. A natural question arises concerning how much territory steerability occupies entanglement for a general two-qubit entangled state. In this work, the constraint relation between steerability and concurrence is investigated by using two kinds of evolutionary states and any two-qubit states (or lots of randomly generated states). By combining the theoretical and numerical proofs, the upper and lower boundaries of steerability are obtained. And the lower boundary can be used as a sufficient criterion for steering detection. Furthermore, a special kind of mixed state transformed by performing an arbitrary unitary transformation on Werner-like state is considered, and a sufficient steering criterion described by concurrence and purity is proposed.

TI Quantum Thermometry for Ultra-Low Temperatures Using Probe and Ancilla
   Qubit Chains
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a scheme to enhance the range and precision of ultra-low temperature measurements by employing a probe qubit coupled to a chain of ancilla qubits. Specifically, we analyze a qubit chain governed by Heisenberg XX and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. The precision limits of temperature measurements are characterized by evaluating quantum Fisher information (QFI). Our findings demonstrate that the achievable precision bounds, as well as the number of peaks in the QFI as a function of temperature, can be controlled by adjusting the number of ancilla qubits and the system's model parameters. These results are interpreted in terms of the influence of energy transitions on the range and the number of QFI peaks as a function of temperature. This study highlights the potential of the probe qubit-ancilla chain system as a powerful and precise tool for quantum thermometry in the ultra-low temperature regime.

TI Tunable up-conversion single-photon detector at telecom wavelengths
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Up-conversion single-photon detectors (UCSPD) are based on sum-frequency generation of the telecom band single-photons to near-infrared wavelengths at which efficient and low-noise silicon single-photon detectors are available. Moreover, because of high dynamic range of silicon single-photon detectors, UCSPD is suitable for high-speed quantum communication. UCSPDs reported to date, however, have a very narrow fixed window of detectable wavelengths, severely limiting their applications in wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks. In this work, we report a tunable UCSPD module that covers the complete telecom C band, making it suitable for quantum communication networks based on sharing wavelength-multiplexed entangled photons.

TI Quantum grey-scale image encryption method based on alternating quantum
   random walk
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, in the context of the rapid development of quantum computing technology, quantum attack methods such as Shor's algorithm pose a serious threat to the traditional public key encryption system based on number-theoretic puzzles. Using the characteristics of quantum bits, this paper proposes a quantum grey-scale image encryption method based on alternating quantum random walk. Firstly, the quantum representation model is used to transform the image into a quantum state, and then the quantum key is generated by the alternating quantum random walk algorithm, and combined with the quantum gate operation for encrypting the grey-scale image data, which not only inherits the advantage of the anti-attack of the quantum computation, but also, through the quantum parallelism and the non-clonability, which solves the security and efficiency bottleneck of traditional image encryption in the quantum era and significantly improves the security of grey-scale image encryption. The algorithm proposed in this paper has been verified by simulation experiments, and the experimental results show that the method is excellent in encryption and decryption effects, and for the encrypted image, a number of performance analyses have been carried out, and the analysis results show that the proposed encryption method has a high degree of security, and it can effectively resist the statistical attack, noise attack, etc., and the distribution of the histogram of encrypted image is more uniform, the pixel correlation analysis is close to 1, and the information entropy is close to 7.999.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution over multispan links
   employing phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive amplifiers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Transmission losses through optical fibers are one of the main obstacles preventing both long-distance quantum communications and continuous-variable quantum key distribution. Optical amplification provides a tool to obtain, at least partially, signal restoration. In this work, we address a key distribution protocol over a multi-span link employing either phase-insensitive (PIA) or phase-sensitive (PSA) amplifiers, considering Gaussian modulation of coherent states followed by homodyne detection at the receiver's side. We perform the security analysis under both unconditional and conditional security frameworks by assuming in the latter case only a single span of the whole communication link to be untrusted. We compare the resulting key generation rate (KGR) for both kinds of amplified links with the no-amplifier protocol, identifying the enhancement introduced by optical amplification. We prove an increase in the KGR for the PSA link in the unconditional scenario and for both PSA and PIA in the conditional security setting depending on position of the attack and the measured quadrature.

TI Splitting and parallelizing of quantum convolutional neural networks for
   learning translationally symmetric data
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is a promising quantum machine learning (QML) model that is expected to achieve quantum advantages in classically intractable problems. However, the QCNN requires a large number of measurements for data learning, limiting its practical applications in large-scale problems. To alleviate this requirement, we propose an architecture called split-parallelizing QCNN (sp-QCNN), which exploits the prior knowledge of quantum data to design an efficient model. This architecture draws inspiration from geometric quantum machine learning and targets translationally symmetric quantum data commonly encountered in physics and quantum computing science. By splitting the quantum circuit based on translational symmetry, the sp-QCNN can substantially parallelize the conventional QCNN without increasing the number of qubits and improve the measurement efficiency by an order of the number of qubits. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the sp-QCNN to a quantum phase recognition task and show that it can achieve comparable classification accuracy to the conventional QCNN while considerably reducing the measurement resources required. Due to its high measurement efficiency, the sp-QCNN can mitigate statistical errors in estimating the gradient of the loss function, thereby accelerating the learning process. These results open up possibilities for incorporating the prior data knowledge into the efficient design of QML models, leading to practical quantum advantages.

TI Simulating the Electronic Structure of Spin Defects on Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present calculations of both the ground- and excited-state energies of spin defects in solids carried out on a quantum computer, using a hybrid classical-quantum protocol. We focus on the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and on the double vacancy in 4H SiC, which are of interest for the realization of quantum technologies. We employ a recently developed first-principles quantum embedding theory to describe point defects embedded in a periodic crystal and to derive an effective Hamiltonian, which is then transformed to a qubit Hamiltonian by means of a parity transformation. We use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum subspace expansion methods to obtain the ground and excited states of spin qubits, respectively, and we propose a promising strategy for noise mitigation. We show that by combining zero-noise extrapolation techniques and constraints on electron occupation to overcome the unphysical-state problem of the VQE algorithm, one can obtain reasonably accurate results on near-term-noisy architectures for ground- and excited-state properties of spin defects.

TI HQNN-SFOP: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Signal Feature Overlay
   Projection for Drone Detection Using Radar Return Signals-A Simulation
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the wide application of drone technology, there is an increasing demand for the detection of radar return signals from drones. Existing detection methods mainly rely on time-frequency domain feature extraction and classical machine learning algorithms for image recognition. This method suffers from the problem of large dimensionality of image features, which leads to large input data size and noise affecting learning. Therefore, this paper proposes to extract signal time-domain statistical features for radar return signals from drones and reduce the feature dimension from 512 x 4 to 16 dimensions. However, the downscaled feature data makes the accuracy of traditional machine learning algorithms decrease, so we propose a new hybrid quantum neural network with signal feature overlay projection (HQNN-SFOP), which reduces the dimensionality of the signal by extracting the statistical features in the time domain of the signal, introduces the signal feature overlay projection to enhance the expression ability of quantum computation on the signal features, and introduces the quantum circuits to improve the neural network's ability to obtain the inline relationship of features, thus improving the accuracy and migration generalization ability of drone detection. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we experimented with the method using the MM model that combines the real parameters of five commercial drones and random drones parameters to generate data to simulate a realistic environment. The results show that the method based on statistical features in the time domain of the signal is able to extract features at smaller scales and obtain higher accuracy on a dataset with an SNR of 10 dB. On the time-domain feature data set, HQNNSFOP obtains the highest accuracy compared to other conventional methods. In addition, HQNN-SFOP has good migration generalization ability on five commercial drones and random drones data at different SNR conditions. Our method verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of signal detection methods based on quantum computation and experimentally demonstrates that the advantages of quantum computation for information processing are still valid in the field of signal processing, it provides a highly efficient method for the drone detection using radar return signals.

TI Quantum kernel methods under scrutiny: a benchmarking study
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Since the entry of kernel theory in the field of quantum machine learning, quantum kernel methods (QKMs) have gained increasing attention with regard to both probing promising applications and delivering intriguing research insights. Benchmarking these methods is crucial to gain robust insights and to understand their practical utility. In this work, we present a comprehensive large-scale study examining QKMs based on fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) across a manifold of design choices. Our investigation encompasses both classification and regression tasks for five dataset families and 64 datasets, systematically comparing the use of FQKs and PQKs quantum support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This resulted in over 20,000 models that were trained and optimized using a state-of-the-art hyperparameter search to ensure robust and comprehensive insights. We delve into the importance of hyperparameters on model performance scores and support our findings through rigorous correlation analyses. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis addressing the design freedom of PQKs and explore the underlying principles responsible for learning. Our goal is not to identify the best-performing model for a specific task but to uncover the mechanisms that lead to effective QKMs and reveal universal patterns.

TI Tuning the Coherent Interaction of an Electron Qubit and a Nuclear
   Magnon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A central spin qubit interacting coherently with an ensemble of proximal spins can be used to engineer entangled collective states or a multiqubit register. Making full use of this many-body platform requires tuning the interaction between the central spin and its spin register. GaAs quantum dots offer a model realization of the central spin system where an electron qubit interacts with multiple ensembles of similar to 104 nuclear spins. In this work, we demonstrate tuning of the interaction between the electron qubit and the nuclear many-body system in a GaAs quantum dot. The homogeneity of the GaAs system allows us to perform high-precision and isotopically selective nuclear sideband spectroscopy, which reveals the singlenucleus electronic Knight field. Together with time-resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear field, this fully characterizes the electron-nuclear interaction for a priori control. An algorithmic feedback sequence selects the nuclear polarization precisely, which adjusts the electron-nuclear exchange interaction in situ via the electronic g-factor anisotropy. This allows us to tune directly the activation rate of a collective nuclear excitation (magnon) and the coherence time of the electron qubit. Our method is applicable to similar central-spin systems and enables the programmable tuning of coherent interactions in the many-body regime.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A continuous -variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) using a true local (located at the receiver) oscillator (LO) has been proposed to remove any possibility of side -channel attacks associated with transmission of the LO as well as reduce the cross -pulse contamination. Here we report an implementation of true LO -CV QKD using "off -the -shelf" components and conduct QKD experiments using the fiber optical network at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A phase reference and quantum signal are time multiplexed and then wavelength division multiplexed with the classical communications that "coexist" with each other on a single optical network fiber. This is the first demonstration of CV QKD with a receiver -based true LO over a deployed fiber network, a crucial step for its application in real -world situations.

TI Nonreciprocal mechanical entanglement in a spinning optomechanical
   system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum entanglement between distant massive mechanical oscillators is an important resource in sensitive measurements and quantum information processing. We achieve the nonreciprocal mechanical entanglement in a compound optomechanical device consisting of two mechanical oscillators and a spinning whispering-gallery mode (WGM) optical microresonator. It is found that obvious nonreciprocal mechanical entanglement emerges in this system in the presence of the Sagnac effect which is induced by the rotation of the WGM resonator, and the nonreciprocal region can be controlled by tuning the angular velocity of the rotation. The nonreciprocity originates from the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry of this multimode system due to the presence of the Sagnac effect. The optomechanical coupling and the mechanical interaction provide cooling channels for the first and second mechanical oscillators, respectively. Two mechanical oscillators can be cooled simultaneously. The simultaneous cooling and the mechanical coupling of two mechanical oscillators ensure the generation of mechanical entanglement. Furthermore, an optimal mechanical entanglement can be achieved when the moderate optical frequency detuning and the driving power are chosen. The thermal noise of the mechanical environment has a negative effect on mechanical entanglement. Our scheme provides promising opportunities for research of quantum information processing based on phonons and sensitive measurements.

TI Rapid Initial-State Preparation for the Quantum Simulation of Strongly
   Correlated Molecules
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Studies on quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation often assume perfect ground-state preparation; however, in reality the initial state will have imperfect overlap with the true ground state. Here, we address that problem in two ways: by faster preparation of matrix-product-state (MPS) approximations and by more efficient filtering of the prepared state to find the ground-state energy. We show how to achieve unitary synthesis with a Toffoli complexity about 7x lower than that in prior work and use that to derive a more efficient MPS-preparation method. For filtering, we present two different approaches: sampling and binary search. For both, we use the theory of window functions to avoid large phase errors and minimize the complexity. We find that the binary-search approach provides better scaling with the overlap at the cost of a larger constant factor, such that it will be preferred for overlaps less than about 0.003. Finally, we estimate the total resources to perform ground-state energy estimation of Fe-S cluster systems, including the FeMo cofactor by estimating the overlap of different MPS initial states with potential ground states of the FeMo cofactor using an extrapolation procedure. With a modest MPS bond dimension of 4000, our procedure produces an estimate of approximately 0.9 overlap squared with a candidate ground state of the FeMo cofactor, producing a total resource estimate of 7.3 x 1010 Toffoli gates; neglecting the search over candidates and assuming the accuracy of the extrapolation, this validates prior estimates that have used perfect ground-state overlap. This presents an example of a practical path to prepare states of high overlap in a challenging-to-compute chemical system.

TI Proto-Quipper with Dynamic Lifting
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quipper is a functional programming language for quantum computing. Proto-Quipper is a family of languages aiming to provide a formal foundation for Quipper. In this paper, we extend Proto-Quipper-M with a construct called dynamic lifting, which is present in Quipper. By virtue of being a circuit description language, ProtoQuipper has two separate runtimes: circuit generation time and circuit execution time. Values that are known at circuit generation time are called parameters, and values that are known at circuit execution time are called states. Dynamic lifting is an operation that enables a state, such as the result of a measurement, to be lifted to a parameter, where it can influence the generation of the next portion of the circuit. As a result, dynamic lifting enables Proto-Quipper programs to interleave classical and quantum computation. We describe the syntax of a language we call Proto-Quipper-Dyn. Its type system uses a system of modalities to keep track of the use of dynamic lifting. We also provide an operational semantics, as well as an abstract categorical semantics for dynamic lifting based on enriched category theory. We prove that both the type system and the operational semantics are sound with respect to our categorical semantics. Finally, we give some examples of Proto-Quipper-Dyn programs that make essential use of dynamic lifting.

TI High-dimensional frequency entanglement filter with anomalous
   Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement is essential for various quantum information technologies that are beyond the possibilities of classical physics. However, it is susceptible to decoherence that may arise from noisy channels and environmental noise. While this deleterious problem has been explored by using filtering techniques, such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade, a concise yet efficient approach to entanglement retrieval is still a formidable challenge. Here, we present that nonunitary material provides an alternative tool to flexibly control the anomalous Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference and enables the selective entanglement filter with coherent perfect absorption of anti-symmetric quantum states. An elaborate Cr-SiN-Cr film is prepared as a nonunitary beam splitter such that its tunability over the effective photon-photon interaction in frequency modes can be readily explored in the experiment, which may introduce sophisticated nonunitary realization into integrated optical platforms. In addition, we confirm its ability for selective filtering of high-dimensional frequency entanglement by observing the output quantum state of the conventional HOM interference with a unitary beam splitter and the anomalous HOM interference with a nonunitary beam splitter. These results may offer new insights into investigating the quantum light-matter interaction and facilitating the use of two-photon interference for addressing central challenges in quantum technologies.

TI Multiparty-to-multiparty mediated quantum secret sharing protocol in a
   restricted quantum environment
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study proposes the first multiparty-to-multiparty mediated quantum secret sharing (M2M-MQSS) protocol within a restricted quantum environment. Unlike existing fully quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols, this protocol allows protocol participants with limited quantum capabilities-including (1) measuring a single qubit in the Z-basis and (2) performing a single-qubit unitary operation, Hadamard operation-to participate, significantly reducing implementation costs. By employing one-way qubit transmission, the proposed MMQSS protocol not only simplifies the quantum communication process but also effectively defends against quantum Trojan horse attacks. The correctness and security analyses demonstrate that the proposed M2M-MQSS protocol is robust against various well-known attack strategies. Simulation experiments confirm the feasibility of the protocol for various numbers of participants. It maintains high levels of efficiency and security even as the number of participants increases. Moreover, compared with existing protocols, the proposed M2M-MQSS protocol lowers the barrier to practical quantum communication deployment by reducing the quantum resources required for protocol participants.

TI Error mitigation enables PET radiomic cancer characterization on quantum
   computers
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB BackgroundCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. While routine diagnosis of cancer is performed mainly with biopsy sampling, it is suboptimal to accurately characterize tumor heterogeneity. Positron emission tomography (PET)-driven radiomic research has demonstrated promising results when predicting clinical endpoints. This study aimed to investigate the added value of quantum machine learning both in simulator and in real quantum computers utilizing error mitigation techniques to predict clinical endpoints in various PET cancer patients.MethodsPreviously published PET radiomics datasets including 11C-MET PET glioma, 68GA-PSMA-11 PET prostate and lung 18F-FDG PET with 3-year survival, low-vs-high Gleason risk and 2-year survival as clinical endpoints respectively were utilized in this study. Redundancy reduction with 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 Spearman rank thresholds (SRT), followed by selecting 8 and 16 features from all cohorts, was performed, resulting in 18 dataset variants. Quantum advantage was estimated by Geometric Difference (GD(Q)) score in each dataset variant. Five classic machine learning (CML) and their quantum versions (QML) were trained and tested in simulator environments across the dataset variants. Quantum circuit optimization and error mitigation were performed, followed by training and testing selected QML methods on the 21-qubit IonQ Aria quantum computer. Predictive performances were estimated by test balanced accuracy (BACC) values.ResultsOn average, QML outperformed CML in simulator environments with 16-features (BACC 70% and 69%, respectively), while with 8-features, CML outperformed QML with + 1%. The highest average QML advantage was + 4%. The GD(Q) scores were & LE; 1.0 in all the 8-feature cases, while they were > 1.0 when QML outperformed CML in 9 out of 11 cases. The test BACC of selected QML methods and datasets in the IonQ device without error mitigation (EM) were 69.94% BACC, while EM increased test BACC to 75.66% (76.77% in noiseless simulators).ConclusionsWe demonstrated that with error mitigation, quantum advantage can be achieved in real existing quantum computers when predicting clinical endpoints in clinically relevant PET cancer cohorts. Quantum advantage can already be achieved in simulator environments in these cohorts when relying on QML.

TI Entanglement-interference complementarity and experimental demonstration
   in a superconducting circuit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum entanglement between an interfering particle and a detector for acquiring the which-path information plays a central role for enforcing Bohr's complementarity principle. However, the quantitative relation between this entanglement and the fringe visibility remains untouched upon for an initial mixed state. Here we find an equality for quantifying this relation. Our equality characterizes how well the interference pattern can be preserved when an interfering particle, initially carrying a definite amount of coherence, is entangled, to a certain degree, with a which-path detector. This equality provides a connection between entanglement and interference in the unified framework of coherence, revealing the quantitative entanglement-interference complementarity. We experimentally demonstrate this relation with a superconducting circuit, where a resonator serves as a which-path detector for an interfering qubit. The measured fringe visibility of the qubit's Ramsey signal and the qubit-resonator entanglement exhibit a complementary relation, in well agreement with the theoretical prediction.

TI Fully Tunable Longitudinal Spin-Photon Interactions in Si and Ge Quantum
   Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spin qubits in silicon and germanium quantum dots are promising platforms for quantum computing, but entangling spin qubits over micrometer distances remains a critical challenge. Current prototypical architectures maximize transversal interactions between qubits and microwave resonators, where the spin state is flipped by nearly resonant photons. However, these interactions cause backaction on the qubit that yields unavoidable residual qubit-qubit couplings and significantly affects the gate fidelity. Strikingly, residual couplings vanish when spin-photon interactions are longitudinal and photons couple to the phase of the qubit. We show that large and tunable spin-photon interactions emerge naturally in state-of-the-art hole spin qubits and that they change from transversal to longitudinal depending on the magnetic field direction. We propose ways to electrically control and measure these interactions, as well as realistic protocols to implement fast high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates. These protocols work also at high temperatures, paving the way toward the implementation of large-scale quantum processors.

TI Quantum dimensionality reduction by linear discriminant analysis
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The dimensionality reduction is generally used as the data preprocessing stage of many machine learning tasks and has become an essential branch of information processing. Due to the exponential growth of data, how constructing reasonable and efficient dimen-sionality reduction algorithms has been an open challenge recently. In this paper, we propose a quantum linear discriminant analysis algorithm for dimensionality reduction. In the proposed algorithm, the idea of quantum solving linear equations is utilized to ob-tain the shadow principal components and an intermediate state. After that, the special unitary operations are designed to assist in completing the dimensionality reduction. The theoretical analysis shows the proposed algorithm has exponential acceleration on the number of vectors and a quadratic speedup on the dimensionality of the original data space. Since this algorithm solves the restriction that the between-class scatter matrix must be reversible, it makes the algorithm more applicable. Moreover, instead of getting the quantum state in the projection direction, the algorithm obtains the corresponding quantum state of dimensionality reduction data so that the outputs can be directly applied to other quantum machine learning algorithms. To illustrate it, a simple example, quantum K-nearest Neighbor classification, is provided.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI QRLaXAI: quantum representation learning and explainable AI
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB As machine learning grows increasingly complex due to big data and deep learning, model explainability has become essential to fostering user trust. Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field, leveraging quantum computing to enhance classical machine learning methods, particularly through quantum representation learning (QRL). QRL aims to provide more efficient and powerful machine learning capabilities on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, interpreting QRL models poses significant challenges due to the reliance on quantum gate-based parameterized circuits, which, while analogous to classical neural network layers, operate in the quantum domain. To address these challenges, we propose an explainable QRL framework combining a quantum autoencoder (QAE) with a variational quantum classifier (VQC) and incorporating theoretical and empirical explainability for image data. Our dual approach enhances model interpretability by integrating visual explanations via local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and analytical insights using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). These complementary methods provide a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process based on prediction outcomes. Experimental evaluations on simulators and superconducting quantum hardware validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for classification tasks, underscoring the importance of explainable representation learning in advancing QML towards more transparent and reliable applications.

TI Data efficient prediction of excited-state properties using quantum
   neural networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network (NN) and a conventional NN and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules with three different system sizes: H2 with four orbitals, LiH with five orbitals, and H4 with six orbitals. For these molecules, we predict the excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many cases, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models (support vector machines, Gaussian processes, and NNs) that rely solely on classical features, by up to two orders of magnitude in the test mean squared error.

AB In this paper, we study the spontaneous emission spectra and the emission decay rates of a simplest atom system that exhibits sub- and superradiant properties: a system which consists of two artificial atoms (superconducting qubits) embedded in a one-dimensional open waveguide. The calculations are based on the method of the transition operator which was firstly introduced by R. H. Lehmberg to theoretically describe the spontaneous emission of two-level atoms in a free space. We obtain the explicit expressions for the photon radiation spectra and the emission decay rates for different initial two-qubit configurations with one and two excitations. For every initial state we calculate the radiation spectra and the emission decay rates for different effective distances between qubits. In every case, a decay rate is compared with a single qubit decay to show the superradiant or subradiant nature of a two-qubit decay with a given initial state.

TI Faster classical boson sampling
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Since its introduction boson sampling has been the subject of intense study in the world of quantum computing. In the context of Fock-state boson sampling, the task is to sample independently from the set of all n x n submatrices built from possibly repeated rows of a larger m x n complex matrix according to a probability distribution related to the permanents of the submatrices. Experimental systems exploiting quantum photonic effects can in principle perform the task at great speed. For classical computing, Aaronson and Arkhipov (2011) showed that exact boson sampling problem cannot be solved in polynomial time unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Indeed for a number of years the fastest known exact classical algorithm ran in O ( m + n - 1 n n 2 n ) time per sample, emphasising the potential speed advantage of quantum computation. The advantage was reduced by Clifford and Clifford (2018), who gave a significantly faster classical solution taking O ( n 2 n + poly ( m , n ) ) time and linear space, matching the complexity of computing the permanent of a single matrix when m is polynomial in n. We continue by presenting an algorithm for Fock boson sampling whose average-case time complexity is much faster when m is proportional to n. In particular, when m = n our algorithm runs in approximately O(n <middle dot> 1.69 n ) time on average. This result further increases the problem size needed to establish quantum computational advantage via the Fock scheme of boson sampling.

TI Robust frame synchronization for continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution with coherent states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In a practical continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system, frame synchronization is crucial for its operation, especially in conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and phase drift. This paper introduces a robust frame synchronization scheme for CVQKD systems that only utilizes quantum signals. The proposed scheme effectively employs randomly selected segments of quantum signals to achieve frame synchronization, eliminating the need for additional modulation. The performance of this scheme applied in a local local oscillator scenario is thoroughly analyzed through numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of withstanding low SNR and arbitrary slow phase drift, as well as fast phase drift originates from two independent lasers, while also slightly improving the secret key rate compared to the scheme using inserted synchronization frames. These findings validate the feasibility of implementing the proposed scheme for long-distance CVQKD in practical scenarios.

Here, we demonstrate the control of spatial correlations between entangled photons in a photonic chip, designed and modeled using the singular value decomposition approach. We show that engineered loss, using an auxiliary waveguide, allows one to invert the spatial statistics from bunching to antibunching. Furthermore, we study the photon statistics within the loss-emulating channel and observe photon coincidences, which may provide insights into the design of quantum photonic integrated chips.

   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We construct product formulas for exponentials of commutators and explore their applications. First, we directly construct a third-order product formula with six exponentials by solving polynomial equations obtained using the operator differential method. We then derive higher-order product formulas recursively from the third-order formula. We improve over previous recursive constructions, reducing the number of gates required to achieve the same accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that the constituent linear terms in the commutator can be included at no extra cost. As an application, we show how to use the product formulas in a digital protocol for counterdiabatic driving, which increases the fidelity for quantum state preparation. We also discuss applications to quantum simulation of one-dimensional fermion chains with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall phases.

The VOA is based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and fabricated in a silica-based planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform. The thermo-optic effect is used to achieve intensity modulation. The measured maximum attenuation of the four-stage cascaded VOA is 88.38 dB. The chip is also tested in a quantum key distribution (QKD) system to generate signal and decoy states. The mean photon number after attenuation of the four-stage cascaded VOA is less than 0.1, which can meet the requirement of QKD.

TI Numerical Simulation of the Performance of Single Qubit Gates for
   Trapped Ions
SO JETP LETTERS
AB Finite gate errors limit performance of modern quantum computers. In this paper we study single qubit gate fidelities for trapped ions. For this we numerically solved Schrodinger equation using full Hamiltonian of the system for one, two, three and four ions. This approach allows us to analyse gate errors beyond Lamb-Dicke approximation and accounts not only for finite occupation of the phonon modes, but also for the effects related to the ions-to-mode entanglement. As a result, we show, how infidelity of the global single qubit gates depend on the initial phonon mode occupations, the Lamb-Dicke parameter, Rabi frequency and the number of ions.

TI Franson interferometer for characterizing highly non-degenerate
   correlated biphoton sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report the demonstration of a Franson interferometer for a highly non-degenerate time-energy entangled biphoton source. A Franson interferometer realizes a Bell test for time-energy entanglement and can thus be used to verify entanglement distribution in quantum networks and security in quantum key distribution. The highly non-degenerate source has signal and idler photons at 810 nm and 1550 nm, respectively, making this source a potential interconnect between free-space and fiber optic quantum networks. We observe a single channel visibility of V = 0.992(6) with an average visibility over the four output channels of V = 0.984(3). These visibilities overcome the visibility threshold necessary in closing the postselection loophole in the Franson interferometer Bell test.

TI Enhancing Quantum Synchronization in a Driven Qubit System Coupled to a
   Structured Environment
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB In this paper, the issue of Quantum Synchronization in a driven two-level (qubit) system situated within a structured environment is examined. The findings have practical implications as it is discovered that adding a time-dependent periodic modulation to the transition frequency of the qubit can significantly enhance quantum synchronization. The phase preference and, consequently, the phase locking conditions in the system is first discovered using the Husimi Q$Q$-function. It is revealed that combining frequency modulation and non-Markovian effects enables us to achieve a stable phase-locking for the system. It is shown that tuning the amplitude-to-frequency ratio of the modulation process on the zeros of the zeroth-order Bessel function led to phase locking and, thus, surprisingly enhances quantum synchronization in the system. These results provide new insights into efficiently understanding phase dynamics in quantum environments.

TI Error probability in polarization sensitive communication systems in
   terms of moments of the channel's rotation angle
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Polarization effects of channels such as turbulent free space and optical fibers can deteriorate the quality of polarization-sensitive communication schemes, for example, quantum key distribution. The exact nature of the channel is problematic to determine, and most theoretical results are based on approximations. We introduce a general model with probabilistic polarization angle rotation and analyze the average error it causes in terms of the moments of the probability distribution. For a small rotation angle variance, an inequality between distributions' errors is considered based on their kurtosis values and potentially higher-order central moments. An upper bound is determined for the error probability, holding for all practically interesting scenarios.

TI Continuous operation of a coherent 3,000-qubit system
SO NATURE
AB Neutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations1, 2-3 and computation4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9-10 to metrology, atomic clocks11, 12-13 and quantum networking14, 15-16. Although atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation17, 18, 19, 20, 21-22 could substantially enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology23 and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction24,25. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate reloading and continuous operation of a large-scale atom-array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than 2 hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for the realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors and fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Homodyne Detection Quadrature Phase Shift Keying Continuous-Variable
   Quantum key Distribution with High Excess Noise Tolerance
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution with homodyne detection is widely recognized for its ease of implementation, efficiency with respect to error correction, and its compatibility with modern optical communication devices. However, recent studies report that the application of homodyne detection obtains poor tolerance to excess noise and insufficient transmission distance, hence seriously restricting the large-scale deployment of quantum secure communication networks. In this paper, we propose a homodyne detection protocol using the quadrature phase shift keying technique. By limiting information leakage, our proposed protocol enhances excess noise tolerance to a high level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that homodyne detection performs better than heterodyne detection in quaternary-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution under the untrusted detector noise scenario. The security is analyzed using the tight numerical method against collective attacks in the asymptotic regime. Our results imply that the current protocol can distribute keys in nearly intercity area and, thus, paves the way for constructing low-cost quantum secure communication networks.

TI Ancilla-mediated qubit readout and heralded entanglement between
   rare-earth dopant ions in crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Due to their long excited-state lifetimes, rare-earth ions in crystals are widely used in quantum applications. To allow optical readout of the qubit state of individual ions, we propose to dope the crystal with an additional nearby ancilla ion with a shorter radiative lifetime. We show how a Bayesian analysis exhausts the information about the state of the qubit from the optical signal of the ancilla ion. We study the effects of incoherent processes, and we propose ways to reduce their effect on the readout. Finally, we extend the architecture to ions residing in two remote cavities, and we show how continuous monitoring of fluorescence signals from the two ancilla ions leads to entanglement of the qubit ions.

TI A Chirality-Based Quantum Leap
SO ACS NANO
AB There is increasing interest in the study of chiral degrees of freedom occurring in matter and in electromagnetic fields. Opportunities in quantum sciences will likely exploit two main areas that are the focus of this Review: (1) recent observations of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in chiral molecules and engineered nanomaterials and (2) rapidly evolving nanophotonic strategies designed to amplify chiral light-matter interactions. On the one hand, the CISS effect underpins the observation that charge transport through nanoscopic chiral structures favors a particular electronic spin orientation, resulting in large room-temperature spin polarizations. Observations of the CISS effect suggest opportunities for spin control and for the design and fabrication of room-temperature quantum devices from the bottom up, with atomic-scale precision and molecular modularity. On the other hand, chiral-optical effects that depend on both spin-and orbital-angular momentum of photons could offer key advantages in all-optical and quantum information technologies. In particular, amplification of these chiral light-matter interactions using rationally designed plasmonic and dielectric nanomaterials provide approaches to manipulate light intensity, polarization, and phase in confined nanoscale geometries. Any technology that relies on optimal charge transport, or optical control and readout, including quantum devices for logic, sensing, and storage, may benefit from chiral quantum properties. These properties can be theoretically and experimentally investigated from a quantum information perspective, which has not yet been fully developed. There are uncharted implications for the quantum sciences once chiral couplings can be engineered to control the storage, transduction, and manipulation of quantum information. This forward-looking Review provides a survey of the experimental and theoretical fundamentals of chiral-influenced quantum effects and presents a vision for their possible future roles in enabling room-temperature quantum technologies.

TI An Effective Parameter Analysis for Sending-or-Not-Sending Quantum Key
   Distribution with Untrusted Light Sources
SO ENTROPY
AB The twin-field (TF) protocol is a key protocol in quantum key distribution (QKD) that enables remote key distribution, achieving a maximum secure transmission distance of over 500 km. However, the TF protocol still faces several security issues in real-world environments. To address the issue of untrusted sources, one effective solution is to introduce a light-source monitoring module into the system. Analysis shows that a solution based on untagged bits (UBs) can achieve ideal monitoring performance. This solution can capture UB signals to accurately estimate key parameters in the protocol's security analysis, ultimately deriving a tight bound for the secure bit rate. Simulations show that this solution approximates the performance of ideal light sources in the presence of untrusted sources and effectively mitigates the impact of light-source fluctuations. It outperforms other solutions in key performance metrics, such as transmission distance.

TI Monte Carlo approach to the evaluation of the security of
   device-independent quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a generic study on the information-theoretic security of multi-setting device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) protocols, i.e. ones that involve more than two measurements (or inputs) for each party to perform, and yield dichotomic results (or outputs). The approach we develop, when applied in protocols with either symmetric or asymmetric Bell experiments, yields nontrivial upper bounds on the secure key rates, along with the detection efficiencies required upon the measuring devices. The results imply that increasing the number of measurements may lower the detection efficiency required by the security criterion. The improvement, however, depends on (i) the choice of multi-setting Bell inequalities chosen to be tested in a protocol, and (ii) either a symmetric or asymmetric Bell experiment is considered. Our results serve as an advance toward the quest for evaluating security and reducing efficiency requirement of applying DIQKD in scenarios without heralding.

TI Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Based on
   Decoherence-Free Subspaces with Logical Bell State Analyzer
SO ENTROPY
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) enables two legitimate users to generate shared information-theoretic secure keys with immunity to all detector side attacks. However, the original proposal using polarization encoding is sensitive to polarization rotations stemming from birefringence in fibers or misalignment. To overcome this problem, here we propose a robust QKD protocol without detector vulnerabilities based on decoherence-free subspaces using polarization-entangled photon pairs. A logical Bell state analyzer is designed specifically for such encoding. The protocol exploits common parametric down-conversion sources, for which we develop a MDI-decoy-state method, and requires neither complex measurements nor a shared reference frame. We have analyzed the practical security in detail and presented a numerical simulation under various parameter regimes, showing the feasibility of the logical Bell state analyzer along with the potential that double communication distance can be achieved without a shared reference frame.

TI Mechanistic understanding of entanglement and heralding in cascade
   emitters
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor quantum light sources are favorable for a wide range of quantum photonic tasks, particularly quantum computing and quantum information processing. Here, we theoretically investigate the properties of quantum emitters as a source of entangled photons with practical quantum properties including heralding of on-demand single photons. Through the theoretical analysis, we characterize the properties of a cascade (biexciton) emitter, including (1) studies of single-photon purity, (2) investigating the first- and second-order correlation functions, and (3) determining the Schmidt number of the entangled photons. The analytical expression derived for the Schmidt number of the cascade emitters reveals a strong dependence on the ratio of decay rates of the first and second photons. Looking into the joint spectral density of the generated biphotons, we show how the purity and degree of entanglement are connected to the production of heralded single photons. Our model is further developed to include polarization effects, fine structure splitting, and the emission delay between the exciton and biexciton emission. The extended model offers more details about the underlying mechanism of entangled photon production, and it provides additional degrees of freedom for manipulating the system and characterizing purity of the output photon. The theoretical investigations and the analysis provide a cornerstone for the experimental design and engineering of on-demand single photons.

TI Simple quantum key distribution using a stable transmitter-receiver
   scheme
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technology that allows secure key exchange between two distant users. A widespread adoption of QKD requires the development of simple, low-cost, and stable systems. However, implementation of the current QKD requires a complex self-alignment process during the initial stage and an additional hardware to compensate the environmental disturbances. In this study, we present the implementation of a simple QKD with the help of a stable transmitter-receiver scheme, which simplifies the self-alignment and is robust enough to withstand environmental disturbances. In case of the stability test, the implementation system is able to remain stable for 48 h and exhibits an average quantum bit error rate of less than 1% without any feedback control. The scheme is also tested over a fiber spool, obtaining a stable and secure finite key rate of 7.32k bits per second over a fiber spool extending up to 75 km. The demonstrated long-term stability and obtained secure key rate prove that our method of implementation is a promising alternative for practical QKD systems, in particular, for CubeSat platform and satellite applications.

TI Quantum monte carlo for economics: Stress testing and macroeconomic deep
   learning
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL
AB Computational methods both open the frontiers of economic analysis and serve as a bottleneck in what can be achieved. We are the first to study whether Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm can improve the runtime of economic applications and challenges in doing so. We provide a detailed introduction to quantum computing and especially the QMC algorithm. Then, we illustrate how to formulate and encode into quantum circuits (a) a bank stress testing model with credit shocks and fire sales, (b) a neoclassical investment model solved with deep learning, and (c) a realistic macro model solved with deep neural networks. We discuss potential computational gains of QMC versus classical computing systems and present a few innovations in benchmarking QMC. Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Spin qubit properties of the boron-vacancy/carbon defect in the
   two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Spin qubit defects in two-dimensional materials have a number of advantages over those in three-dimensional hosts including simpler technologies for defect creation and control, as well as qubit accessibility. In this work, we select the VBCB defect in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a possible optically controllable spin qubit and explain its triplet ground state and neutrality. In this defect a boron vacancy is combined with a carbon dopant substituting the closest boron atom to the vacancy. Our density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the system has dynamically stable spin triplet and singlet ground states. As revealed from our linear response GW calculations, the spin-sensitive electronic states are localized around the three undercoordinated N atoms and make local peaks in the density of electronic states within the bandgap. Using the triplet and singlet ground state energies, as well as the energies of the optically excited states, obtained from solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct the spin-polarization cycle, which is found to be favorable for the spin qubit initialization. The calculated zero-field splitting parameters ensure that the splitting energy between the spin projections in the triplet ground state is comparable to that of the known spin qubits. We thus propose the VBCB defect in hBN as a promising spin qubit.

TI Seamless High-Q Microwave Cavities for Multimode Circuit Quantum
   Electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics-where a two-level system interacts simultaneously with many cavity modes-provides a versatile framework for quantum information processing and quantum optics. Because of the combination of long coherence times and large interaction strengths, one of the leading experimental platforms for cavity QED involves coupling a superconducting circuit to a 3D microwave cavity. In this work, we realize a 3D multimode circuit QED system with single photon lifetimes of 2 ms across 9 modes of a novel seamless cavity. We demonstrate a variety of protocols for universal single-mode quantum control applicable across all cavity modes, using only a single drive line. We achieve this by developing a straightforward flute method for creating monolithic superconducting microwave cavities that reduces loss while simultaneously allowing control of the mode spectrum and mode-qubit interaction. We highlight the flexibility and ease of implementation of this technique by using it to fabricate a variety of 3D cavity geometries, providing a template for engineering multimode quantum systems with exceptionally low dissipation. This work is an important step towards realizing hardware efficient random access quantum memories and processors, and for exploring quantum many-body physics with photons.

TI Unconditional quantum magic advantage in shallow circuit computation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum theory promises computational speed-ups over classical approaches. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem implies that the full power of quantum computation resides in the specific resource of "magic" states-the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computation. However, it is still questionable whether magic indeed brings the believed quantum advantage, ridding unproven complexity assumptions or black-box oracles. In this work, we demonstrate the first unconditional magic advantage: a separation between the power of generic constant-depth or shallow quantum circuits and magic-free counterparts. For this purpose, we link the shallow circuit computation with the strongest form of quantum nonlocality-quantum pseudo-telepathy, where distant non-communicating observers generate perfectly synchronous statistics. We prove quantum magic is indispensable for such correlated statistics in a specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system. Then, we translate generating quantum pseudo-telepathy into computational tasks, where magic is necessary for a shallow circuit to meet the target. As a by-product, we provide an efficient algorithm to solve a general linear binary constraint system over the Pauli group, in contrast to the broad undecidability in constraint systems. We anticipate our results will enlighten the final establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum computation.

TI Discrete-modulation measurement-device-independent continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution with a quantum scissor: exact non-Gaussian
   calculation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we study non-Gaussian discrete-modulated measurement-device-independent continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol equipped with a proposed quantum scissor at the receiver side. Our suggested scissor truncates all multiphoton number states with four or more photons and amplifies remaining photon number states in a probabilistic way. Using exact non-Gaussian calculation, we find that quantum scissor meliorates the fidelity and entanglement between two legitimate parties Alice and Bob, at long distances. Therefore, quantum scissor enhances the continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol range. Examination of the system for different values of the excess noise reveals that this improvement disappears at high noisy channels.

SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In this study, we propose technologies for the device structure, gate fabrication process, and back-bias-assisted operation of Si spin qubits to realize the high robustness of the two-qubit SWAP gate operation against process variations. We performed quantum device simulations for MOS-type two-qubit devices and verified the benefits of these technologies on the SWAP gate fidelity. We clarified that these technologies significantly improve the robustness of the SWAP gate operation against process variations and achieve a 6 sigma-yield SWAP gate operation with 99% fidelity, assuming device size fluctuation of the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) target for 2022. The proposed technologies provide a solution for completing a universal quantum gate set for realizing universal quantum computers with silicon.

TI Near-field terahertz nanoscopy of coplanar microwave resonators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting quantum circuits are one of the leading quantum computing platforms. To advance superconducting quantum computing to a point of practical importance, it is critical to identify and address material imperfections that lead to decoherence. Here, we use terahertz scanning near-field optical microscopy to probe the local dielectric properties and carrier concentrations of wet-etched aluminum resonators on silicon, one of the most characteristic components of the superconducting quantum processors. Using a recently developed vector calibration technique, we extract the THz permittivity from spectroscopy in proximity to the microwave feedline. Fitting the extracted permittivity to the Drude model, we find that silicon in the etched channel has a carrier concentration greater than buffer oxide etched silicon and we explore post-processing methods to reduce the carrier concentrations. Our results show that near-field THz investigations can be used to quantitatively evaluate and identify inhomogeneities in quantum devices. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Security Analysis of Imperfect Gaussian Modulation Caused by Amplitude
   Modulator in Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a system that provides secret keys for symmetric key systems. In the application of CV-QKD, the practical security of the system is crucial. In this article, we investigate the practical security issues caused by non-ideal Gaussian modulation, which is caused by fitting defects of the amplitude modulator's (AM) modulation curve. We provide the effect of fitting error on parameter estimation. We also give the relationship between the fitting order and the secret key rate. The simulation results indicate that the system is completely unable to communicate during first-order fitting. During second-order fitting, the system's performance decreases by more than half. During third-order fitting, the system's performance will be consistent with the ideal. Therefore, to ensure the performance of the CV-QKD system, the fitting order must be at least three or higher.

AB We utilize IBM's quantum computers to perform a full quantum simulation of the optical quantum eraser (QE) utilizing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a variable partially-polarizing beam splitter (VPPBS) at the input. The use of the VPPBS motivates us to introduce the entangled quantum eraser, for which the path information is erased using a Bell-basis measurement. We also investigate the behavior of the wave aspect, i.e., the quantum coherence, as well as the particle character, represented by the predictability and entanglement, as delineated in complete complementarity relations (CCRs). As we show in this article, the utilization of the VPPBS uncover interesting aspects of the QE and CCRs. For instance, we can recover the full wave-behavior by the erasure procedure even when we have only partial knowledge about the path through entanglement.

While this is well established for free-fermionic spin chains, we extend this result to the folded XXZ model, an integrable rigid-rod deformation of the XX model with simple interactions that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We construct explicit quantum circuits that efficiently prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain. Error-mitigated noisy simulations with up to 13 qubits and various qubit connectivities achieve a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit to open boundary conditions.

TI A high-efficiency elementary network of interchangeable superconducting
   qubit devices
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Modular architectures could be used to scale quantum devices to the point of fault tolerance and utility. Such modularity is of particular value with superconducting qubits, where monolithically manufactured devices are limited in both system size and quality. However, although prototypical quantum device networks have been fabricated, the development of quantum systems with both interchangeability and high-fidelity operations remains challenging. Here we report a modular architecture for scaling quantum processors with reconfigurable and expandable networks. We develop a high-efficiency interconnect based on a low-loss detachable cable connection between two superconducting qubit devices. We overcome residual loss through a fast pump scheme, enabling intermodule SWAP efficiencies at the 99% level in less than 100 ns. We use the scheme to generate high-fidelity entanglement and operate a distributed logical dual-rail qubit. With an error rate of around 1%, our interdevice operations are at the threshold for fault tolerance.

TI One-Pixel Attack for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been employed in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems as attacking detection portions of defense countermeasures. However, the vulnerability of DNNs leaves security loopholes for hacking attacks, for example, adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose to implement the one-pixel attack in CV-QKD attack detection networks and accomplish the misclassification on a minimum perturbation. This approach is based on the differential evolution, which makes our attack algorithm fool multiple DNNs with the minimal inner information of target networks. The simulation and experimental results show that, in four different CV-QKD detection networks, 52.8%, 26.4%, 21.2%, and 23.8% of the input data can be perturbed to another class by modifying just one feature, the same as one pixel for an image. We carry out this success rate in the context of the original accuracy reaching up to nearly 99% on average. Further, by enlarging the number of perturbed features, the success rate can be raised to a satisfactory higher level of about 80%. According to our experimental results, most of the CV-QKD detection networks can be deceived by launching one-pixel attacks.

TI Indistinguishable telecom band photons from a single Er ion in the solid
   state
SO NATURE
AB Atomic defects in the solid state are a key component of quantum repeater networks for long-distance quantum communication(1). Recently, there has been significant interest in rare earth ions(2-4), in particular Er3+ for its telecom band optical transition(5-7) that allows long-distance transmission in optical fibres. However, the development of repeater nodes based on rare earth ions has been hampered by optical spectral diffusion, precluding indistinguishable single-photon generation. Here, we implant Er3+ into CaWO4, a material that combines a non-polar site symmetry, low decoherence from nuclear spins(8) and is free of background rare earth ions, to realize significantly reduced optical spectral diffusion. For shallow implanted ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities with large Purcell factor, we observe single-scan optical linewidths of 150 kHz and long-term spectral diffusion of 63 kHz, both close to the Purcell-enhanced radiative linewidth of 21 kHz. This enables the observation of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference(9) between successively emitted photons with a visibility of V = 80(4)%, measured after a 36 km delay line. We also observe spin relaxation times T-1,T-s = 3.7 s and T-2,T-s > 200 mu s, with the latter limited by paramagnetic impurities in the crystal instead of nuclear spins. This represents a notable step towards the construction of telecom band quantum repeater networks with single Er3+ ions.

TI Effect of decoherence for gate operations on a superconducting bosonic
   qubit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-quality-factor 3D cavities in superconducting circuits are ideal candidates for bosonic logical qubits as their fidelity is limited only by the low photon loss rate. However, the transmon qubits that are used to manipulate bosonic qubits result in the emergence of additional relaxation and dephasing channels. In this work, a numerical study is performed to elucidate the effect of the various loss channels on the performance of logical gates on a bosonic qubit. A gate error model is developed that encapsulates the loss mechanisms for arbitrary gate operations and predicts experimentally achievable gate errors for bosonic qubits. The insights gleaned from this study into loss mechanisms suggest more efficient optimization algorithms that could reduce gate errors on bosonic qubits.

TI Increase of signal to reference ratio for phase compensation in
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems
SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB Continuous variables quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems are a promising direction for quantum communications. Coherent detection, which is the basis of CV-QKD, requires taking into considera-tion and compensating phase distortions. Phase compensation algorithms rely on using reference pulses for phase drift estimation and correcting signal quadratures. The ratio of the number of reference pulses to that of the signal ones, affects the accuracy of the phase compensation algorithm. On the other hand, it influences the secure key rate (SKR). The paper considers the effect of the reference to signal ratio on the SKR, and proposes a modification of the phase compensation algorithm, which allows using a smaller number of references at a pulse repetition frequency close to that of the system phase noise, which results in increasing SKR. We also propose a method for estimating the phase noise in the system for selection of the optimal signal to reference ratio.

TI Pontryagin-optimal control of a non-Hermitian qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Open-system quantum dynamics described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians have become a subject of considerable interest. Studies of non-Hermitian physics have revealed general principles, including relationships between the topology of the complex eigenvalue space and the breakdown of adiabatic control strategies. We study here the control of a single non-Hermitian qubit, similar to recently realized experimental systems in which the non-Hermiticity arises from an open spontaneous emission channel. We review the topological features of the resulting non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and then present two distinct results. First, we illustrate how to realize any continuous and differentiable pure-state trajectory in the dynamics of a qubit that are conditioned on no emission. This result implicitly provides a work around for the breakdown of standard adiabatic following in such non-Hermitian systems. Second, we use Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive optimal trajectories connecting boundary states on the Bloch sphere, using a cost function which balances the desired dynamics against the controller energy used to realize them. We demonstrate that the latter approach can effectively find trajectories which maintain high state purity, even in the case of inefficient detection.

TI Electrical tuning of quantum light emitters in hBN for free space and
   telecom optical bands
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum light emitters (also known as single photon emitters) are known to be the heart of quantum information technologies. Irrespective of possessing ideal single photon emitter properties, quantum emitters in 2-D hBN defect structures, exhibit constrained quantum light emission within the 300-700 nm range. However, this emission range cannot fully satisfy the needs of an efficient quantum communication applications such as quantum key distribution (QKD), which demands the quantum light emission in fiber optic telecom wavelength bands (from 1260 to 1625 nm) and the free space optical (FSO) (UV-C-solar blind band-100 to 280 nm) wavelength ranges. Hence, there is a necessity to tune the quantum light emission into these two bands. However, the most promising technique to tune the quantum light emitters in hBN here, is still a matter of debate and till date there is no experimental and theoretical assurances. Hence, this work will focus on one of the most promising simple techniques known as Stark electrical tuning of the quantum light emission of hBN defect structures (NBVN, VB, CB, CBVN, CBCN, CBCNCBCN complex, and VBO2). These hBN defects are designed and sandwiched as metal/graphene/hBN defect structure/graphene/metal heterostructure and electrically tuned towards FSO and fiber optic bands (tuning range from UV-C to O-band IR region) region, using constrained DFT computations. The external electric field predicted to yield an atomic bond angle tilt associated with this point defect structure creates out-of-plane dipole moments, enabling the tuning of quantum emission. This electrical tuning technique leads to a simple passive photonic component which enables easier compatibility with quantum circuits and it is found to be one of the perfect alternative solutions, which does not require much external hardware setup to implement as compared to earlier published strain induced tuning experiments.

TI Efficient FPGA implementation of polar codes-based information
   reconciliation for quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to generate unconditionally secure keys for remote communication, even in the presence of an eavesdropper with unlimited computational power. A critical component of QKD is information reconciliation (IR), which corrects bit errors introduced by system imperfections and channel noise, ensuring the integrity of the shared key. Polar codes-based IR schemes have attracted considerable attention due to their near-Shannon-limit performance and low computational complexity. However, existing implementations primarily rely on CPUs or GPUs, which are suboptimal in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Here, we present a hardware accelerator designed specifically for discrete variable QKD (DV-QKD), targeting polar codes-based IR and implemented on a cost-effective FPGA platform. Our design achieves high throughput and scalability by employing a module-level pipeline parallel structure, a fully parallelized decoding strategy, and a hybrid memory architecture. This approach enhances decoder efficiency and optimizes resource utilization. On this platform, we demonstrate an IR throughput of 35.33 Mbps for a block size of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>{20}$$\end{document}, providing a real-time, cost-efficient solution that significantly enhances the performance of QKD systems.

TI Survey on Quantum Circuit Compilation for Noisy Intermediate-Scale
   Quantum Computers: Artificial Intelligence to Heuristics
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Computationally expensive applications, including machine learning, chemical simulations, and financial modeling, are promising candidates for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. In these problems, one important challenge is mapping a quantum circuit onto NISQ hardware while satisfying physical constraints of an underlying quantum architecture. Quantum circuit compilation (QCC) aims to generate feasible mappings such that a quantum circuit can be executed in a given hardware platform with acceptable confidence in outcomes. Physical constraints of a NISQ computer change frequently, requiring QCC process to be repeated often. When a circuit cannot directly be executed on a quantum hardware due to its physical limitations, it is necessary to modify the circuit by adding new quantum gates and auxiliary qubits, increasing its space and time complexity. An inefficient QCCmay significantly increase error rate and circuit latency for even the simplest algorithms. In this article, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based and heuristic-based methods recently reported in the literature that attempt to address these QCC challenges. We group them based on underlying techniques that they implement, such as AI algorithms including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and AI planning, and heuristics methods employing greedy algorithms, satisfiability problem solvers, dynamic, and graph optimization techniques. We discuss performance of each QCC technique and evaluate its potential limitations.

TI Synchronization and coexistence in quantum networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the coexistence of clock synchronization protocols with quantum signals in a common single-mode optical fiber. By measuring optical noise between 1500 nm to 1620 nm we demonstrate a potential for up to 100 quantum, 100 GHz wide channels coexisting with the classical synchronization signals. Both "White Rabbit" and pulsed laser-based synchronization protocols were characterized and compared. We establish a theoretical limit of the fiber link length for coexisting quantum and classical channels. The maximal fiber length is below approximately 100 km for off-the-shelf optical transceivers and can be significantly improved by taking advantage of quantum receivers.

We examine the interaction between the two transmission lines, as well as the excitation flow along the composite platform. We show that, by activating specific resonance conditions, this platform can be used as a quantum simulator of different phenomena in quantum optics, multimode quantum systems, and quantum thermodynamics.

TI Edge to quantum: hybrid quantum-spiking neural network image classifier
SO NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING
AB The extreme parallelism property warrant convergence of neural networks with that of quantum computing. As the size of the network grows, the classical implementation of neural networks becomes computationally expensive and not feasible. In this paper, we propose a hybrid image classifier model using spiking neural networks (SNN) and quantum circuits that combines dynamic behaviour of SNN with the extreme parallelism offered by quantum computing. The proposed model outperforms models in comparison with spiking neural network in classical computing, and hybrid convolution neural network-quantum circuit models in terms of various performance parameters. The proposed hybrid SNN-QC model achieves an accuracy of 99.9% in comparison with CNN-QC model accuracy of 96.3%, and SNN model of accuracy 91.2% in MNIST classification task. The tests on KMNIST and CIFAR-1O also showed improvements.

TI Controlled quantum authentication confidential communication protocol
   for smart healthcare
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the field of smart healthcare, video consultation has become a key way to provide medical services for remote patients. In this process, it is essential to ensure the legal identity of both parties to the communication and to protect patient privacy data from unlawful interception and tampering. Therefore, a controlled quantum authentication confidential communication protocol is proposed by using the entanglement exchange ability and measurement correlation of Bell states. With the assistance of a trusted third party, the protocol first achieves the mutual authentication of the communication parties, so as to prevent malicious users from communicating by pretending to be medical specialists or patients. The trusted party then further assists the communicating parties in generating two implicit shared keys, which they use to encrypt the message and its digest, ensuring that the patient's sensitive data is not intercepted or tampered with. In addition, the quantum sequences are transmitted only once in the channel, reducing the loss and noise effects caused by multiple transmissions. Security analysis shows that the protocol can effectively resist participant attacks and outside attacks. In addition, performance analysis provides computation in terms of qubit efficiency and experimental simulation results of the protocol.

TI Efficient and practical Hamiltonian simulation from time-dependent
   product formulas
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e., one part is "large" and another part is "small"). Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.

TI Variational quantum simulations of stochastic differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which model uncertain phenomena as the time evolution of random variables, are exploited in various fields of natural and social sciences such as finance. Since SDEs rarely admit analytical solutions and must usually be solved numerically with huge classical-computational resources in practical applications, there is strong motivation to use quantum computation to accelerate the calculation. Here, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that solves SDEs based on variational quantum simulation. We first approximate the target SDE by a trinomial tree structure with discretization and then formulate it as the time-evolution of a quantum state embedding the probability distributions of the SDE variables. We embed the probability distribution directly in the amplitudes of the quantum state whereas the previous studies took the square-root of the probability distribution in the amplitudes. Our embedding enables us to construct simple quantum circuits that simulate the time-evolution of the state for general SDEs. We also develop a scheme to compute the expectation values of the SDE variables and discuss whether our scheme can achieve quantum speedup for the expectation-value evaluations of the SDE variables. Finally, we numerically validate our algorithm by simulating several types of stochastic processes. Our proposal provides a new direction for simulating SDEs on quantum computers.

TI Theory of quantum entanglement and structure of the two-mode squeezed
   antiferromagnetic magnon vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recently, investigations of the quantum properties of an antiferromagnet in the spin wave approximation have identified the eigenstates as two-mode squeezed sublattice-magnon states. The uniform magnon states were shown to display a massive sublattice entanglement. Here we extend this idea and study the squeezing properties of all sublattice Fock states throughout the magnetic Brillouin zone. We derive the full statistics of the sublattice magnon number with wave number (kappa) over right arrow in the ground state and show that sublattice magnons occur in pairs with opposite wave vectors, hence, resulting in entanglement of both modes. To quantify the degree of entanglement we apply the Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller inequality and show that it can be violated for all modes. The degree of entanglement decreases towards the corners of the Brillouin zone. We relate the entanglement to measurable correlations of components of the Neel and the magnetization vectors, thus allowing one to experimentally test the quantum nature of the squeezed vacuum. The distinct k-space structure of the entanglement shows that the squeezed vacuum has a nonuniform shape that is revealed through the (kappa) over right arrow -dependent correlators for the magnetization and the Neel vectors.

AB Executing quantum algorithms on a quantum computer requires compilation to representations that conform to all restrictions imposed by the device. Due to devices' limited coherence times and gate fidelities, the compilation process has to be optimized as much as possible. To this end, an algorithm's description first has to be synthesized using the device's gate library. In this paper, we consider the optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits-an important subclass of quantum circuits, with various applications. Such techniques are essential to establish lower bounds for (heuristic) synthesis methods and gauging their performance. Due to the huge search space, existing optimal techniques are limited to a maximum of six qubits. The contribution of this work is twofold: First, we propose an optimal synthesis method for Clifford circuits based on encoding the task as a satisfiability (SAT) problem and solving it using a SAT solver in conjunction with a binary search scheme. The resulting tool is demonstrated to synthesize optimal circuits for up to 26 qubits-more than four times as many as the current state of the art. Second, we experimentally show that the overhead introduced by state-of-the-art heuristics exceeds the lower bound by 27 % on average. The resulting tool is publicly available at https://github.com/cda-tum/qmap.

TI Bounding and Simulating Contextual Correlations in Quantum Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations of the set of quantum correlations in generalized contextuality scenarios. This constitutes a simple and versatile tool for bounding the magnitude of quantum contextuality. To illustrate its utility, we use it to determine the maximal quantum violation of several noncontextuality inequalities whose maximum violations were previously unknown. We then go further and use it to prove that certain preparation-contextual correlations cannot be explained with pure states, thereby showing that mixed states are an indispensable resource for contextuality. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to the simulation of preparation-contextual correlations in general operational theories. We introduce the information cost of simulating preparation contextuality, which quantifies the additional, otherwise forbidden, information required to simulate contextual correlations in either classical or quantum models. In both cases, we show that the simulation cost can be efficiently bounded using a variant of our hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations, and we calculate it exactly in the simplest contextuality scenario of parity-oblivious multiplexing.

TI Nonlocality, Steering, and Quantum State Tomography in a Single
   Experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate whether paradigmatic measurements for quantum state tomography, namely mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements, can be employed to certify quantum correlations. For this purpose, we identify a simple and noise-robust correlation witness for entanglement detection, steering, and nonlocality that can be evaluated based on the outcome statistics obtained in the tomography experiment. This allows us to perform state tomography on entangled qutrits, a test of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and a Bell inequality test, all within a single experiment. We also investigate the trade-off between quantum correlations and subsets of tomographically complete measurements as well as the quantification of entanglement in the different scenarios. Finally, we perform a photonics experiment in which we demonstrate quantum correlations under these flexible assumptions, namely with both parties trusted, one party untrusted and both parties untrusted.

TI Quantum imaging of photonic spin texture in an OAM beam with NV centers
   in diamond
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Photonic spin texture (PST), the spatial distribution of the spin angular momentum of light, is connected to unique properties of light, such as optical skyrmions and topological optical N-invariants. There has been recent progress on the generation and manipulation of PST using various methodologies. However, a challenge remains for the sub-wavelength characterization of PST. Here, we demonstrate nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for imaging the PST of a beam with orbital angular momentum. Leveraging the coherent interaction between photon spin and NV center electron spin at cryogenic temperature (77 K), and using the Hahn-echo magnetometry technique, we experimentally demonstrate the imprinting of the PST on the quantum phase shift of NV centers. Our work can lead to the development of a quantum imaging platform capable of characterization of the spin texture of light at sub-wavelength scales.

TI SzegedyWalk Unitaries for Quantum Maps
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Szegedy developed a generic method for quantizing classical algorithms based on random walks (Szegedy, in: 45th annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp 32-41, 2004. https://doi.org/ 10.1109/FOCS.2004.53). A major contribution of hisworkwas the construction of a walk unitary for any reversible random walk. Such unitary posses two crucial properties: its eigenvector with eigenphase 0 is a quantum sample of the limiting distribution of the random walk and its eigenphase gap is quadratically larger than the spectral gap of the random walk. It was an open question if it is possible to generalize Szegedy's quantization method for stochastic maps to quantum maps. We answer this in the affirmative by presenting an explicit construction of a Szegedy walk unitary for detailed balanced Lindbladians-generators of quantum Markov semigroups-and detailed balanced quantum channels. We prove that our Szegedy walk unitary has a purification of the fixed point of the Lindbladian as eigenvector with eigenphase 0 and that its eigenphase gap is quadratically larger than the spectral gap of the Lindbladian. To construct the walk unitary we leverage a canonical form for detailed balanced Lindbladians showing that they are structurally related to Davies generators. We also explain how the quantization method for Lindbladians can be applied to quantum channels. We give an efficient quantum algorithm for quantizing Davies generators that describe many important dynamics of open quantum systems, for instance, the relaxation of a quantum system coupled to a bath. Our algorithm extends known techniques for simulating dynamics of quantum systems on a quantum computer.

TI Voltage-controlled Hubbard spin transistor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Transistors are key elements for enabling computational hardware in both classical and quantum domains. Here we propose a voltage-gated spin transistor using itinerant electrons in the Hubbard model which acts at the level of single electron spins. Going beyond classical spintronics, it enables the controlling of the flow of quantum information between distant spin qubits. The transistor has two modes of operation, open and closed, which are realized by two different charge configurations in the gate of the transistor. In the closed mode, the spin information between source and drain is blocked while in the open mode we have free spin information exchange. The switching between the modes takes place within a fraction of the operation time which allows for several subsequent operations within the coherence time of the transistor. The system shows good resilience against several imperfections and opens up a practical application for quantum dot arrays.

TI Harnessing coherence generation for precision single- and two-qubit
   quantum thermometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum probes, such as single- and two-qubit probes, can accurately measure the temperature of a bosonic bath. The current investigation assesses the precision of the temperature estimate by using quantum Fisher information and the accompanying quantum signal-to-noise ratio. Employing an ancilla as a mediator between the probe and the bath improves thermometric sensitivity by transmitting temperature information into the probe qubit's coherences. In addition, we analyze two interacting qubits that were initially entangled or separated as quantum probes for various environmental configurations. Our findings show that increased precision is gained when the probe approaches its steady state, which is determined by the coupling between the two qubits. Furthermore, we can obtain high-efficiency temperature estimation for any low temperature by changing the interaction between the two qubits.

TI One- and two-qubit gate infidelities due to motional errors in trapped
   ions and electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we derive analytic formulas that determine the effect of error mechanisms on one-and two-qubit gates in trapped ions and electrons. First, we analyze and derive expressions for the effect of driving field inhomogeneities on one-qubit gate fidelities. Second, we derive expressions for two-qubit gate errors, including static motional frequency shifts, trap anharmonicities, field inhomogeneities, heating, and motional dephasing. We show that, for small errors, each of our expressions for infidelity converges to its respective numerical simulation; this shows that our formulas are sufficient for determining error budgets for high-fidelity gates, obviating numerical simulations in future projects. All of the derivations are general to any internal qubit state, and any mixed state of the ion crystal's motion that is diagonal in the Fock state basis. Our treatment of static motional frequency shifts, trap anharmonicities, heating, and motional dephasing apply to both laser-based and laser-free gates, while our treatment of field inhomogeneities applies to laser-free systems.

TI A Demonstration of Multifloating Superconducting Qubits on a 3-D
   Flip-Chip Platform With TLS Loss Mitigation via Apertures
SO IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Flip-chip platforms are among the most promising approaches for scaling up superconducting qubits in quantum computing. This work presents the design, modeling, and analysis of floating transmon qubits implemented on a 3-D flip-chip platform. A major focus during qubit design is addressing coherence challenges caused by two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly from surface interfaces. TLS losses at the metal-air (MA) interface are mitigated by introducing apertures beneath the qubit pads. The aperture size is optimized to balance two key factors: minimizing total TLS loss and ensuring sufficient coupling strength between the transmon and resonator. Subsequently, a packaged 3-D chip comprising 24 floating transmons is demonstrated. The transmission spectrum is measured, with all readout resonators successfully located at their designated positions on the spectrum. Two-tone spectroscopy is demonstrated, enabling precise measurement of the qubit frequency.

TI Enhanced natural parameterized quantum circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The classical-quantum interface for loading classical data into quantum systems is an indispensable component of quantum information processing, and the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) represents significant methodology in this area. However, a challenge in designing parameterized quantum circuits that can fully utilize limited qubit resources while accurately representing classical data remains. To address this issue, we propose the enhanced natural parameterized quantum circuit (ENPQC), which achieves the maximum parameter capacity of quantum systems and preserves the local structure of the original dataset. To make the encoding circuits more experiment friendly, we further provide two near-optimal circuits that achieve near-maximum capacity and are comparable in complexity to the existing PQCs. We numerically show that the ENPQC overwhelms other encoding methods for multiple datasets, demonstrating its potential for machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we experimentally validate our scheme by demonstrating a three-class classification task on an NMR platform, which achieves over 97% accuracy. This work provides a powerful tool for the classical-quantum interface, paving the way for quantum big data processing during the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI Entanglement Generation via Single-Qubit Rotations in a Torn Hilbert
   Space
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a main bus. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces ac Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces. Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly nontrivial, and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W states, spin-squeezed states (SSSs), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing parameter xi R2 similar to 1/N0.843 approaching the Heisenberg limit. Our finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into simply switching on or off microwave. It has direct applications in the variational quantum optimizer, which is available with existing technology.

TI Multiphoton path-polarization entanglement through a single gradient
   metasurface
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Multiphoton entanglement with high information capacity plays an essential role in quantum information processing. The appearance of parallel beam splitting (BS) in a gradient metasurface provides the chance to prepare the multiphoton entanglement in one step. Here, we use a single metasurface to construct multiphoton path-polarization entanglement. Based on the parallel BS property, entanglement among N unentangled photons is created after they pass through a gradient metasurface. Also, with this ability, entanglement fusion among several pairs of entangled photons is set up, which can greatly enlarge the entanglement dimension. These theoretical results pave the way for manipulating metasurface-based multiphoton entanglement, which holds great promise for ultracompact on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Quasiparticle Poisoning of Majorana Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Qubits based on Majorana zero modes are a promising path towards topological quantum computing. Such qubits, though, are susceptible to quasiparticle poisoning which does not have to be small by topological argument. We study the main sources of the quasiparticle poisoning relevant for realistic devices-nonequilibrium above-gap quasiparticles and equilibrium localized subgap states. Depending on the parameters of the system and the architecture of the qubit either of these sources can dominate the qubit decoherence. However, we find in contrast to naive estimates that in moderately disordered, floating Majorana islands the quasiparticle poisoning can have timescales exceeding seconds.

TI Resolution limit in quantum imaging with undetected photons using

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a unique method of image acquisition where the photons illuminating the object are not detected. This method relies on quantum interference and spatial correlations between the twin photons to form an image. Here we present a detailed study of the resolution limits of position correlation enabled QIUP. We establish a quantitative relation between the spatial resolution and the twin-photon position correlation. Furthermore, we also quantitatively establish the roles that the wavelength of the undetected illumination field and the wavelength of the detected field play in the resolution. Like ghost imaging and unlike conventional imaging, the resolution limit imposed by the spatial correlation between the twin photons in QIUP cannot be further improved by conventional optical techniques.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate theoretically a type of microwave memory that is composed of a single transmon qubit and a coupling resonator. The synergy of the parametric modulation of the qubit resonance frequency and a microwave directly driving the qubit transition can constitute effective three-level Lambda-type electromagnetically induced transparency. We demonstrate that the dynamical control of such a parametric modulation allows for the possibility of microwave storage and retrieval using a single qubit. Our results pave the way towards the practical implementation of quantum information in superconducting circuits.

TI Security loophole in error verification in quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether the revealed information matches. In this paper, we point out that when error verification is performed in a QKD protocol, the definition of secrecy must be revised accordingly. We illustrate the necessity of this revision with a counterexample, showing that neglecting it can lead to an incorrect security claim. In particular, we observe that in the case of the security proof method based on phase error correction, which is one of the mainstream approaches and also known as Koashi's approach, no explicit method has been established to properly incorporate the revised secrecy definition. To resolve this issue, we present a way to translate the phase error correction-based approach into another mainstream approach, called the leftover hash lemma-based approach, also known as Renner's approach, where a solution has already been formulated. As a consequence, security proofs under the phase error correction-based approach automatically remain valid without any change in the secret key length, even if they implicitly consider error verification without revising the secrecy definition.

TI Anomalous energy exchanges and Wigner-function negativities in a
   single-qubit gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Anomalous weak values and the Wigner function's negativity are well-known witnesses of quantum contex-tuality. We show that these effects occur when analyzing the energetics of a single-qubit gate generated by a resonant coherent field traveling in a waveguide. The buildup of correlations between the qubit and the field is responsible for bounds on the gate fidelity, but also for a nontrivial energy balance recently observed in a superconducting setup. In the experimental scheme, the field is continuously monitored through heterodyne detection and then postselected over the outcomes of a final qubit's measurement. The postselected data can be interpreted as the field's weak values and can show anomalous values in the variation of the field's energy. We model the joint system dynamics with a collision model, gaining access to the qubit-field entangled state at any time. We find an analytical expression of the quasiprobability distribution of the postselected heterodyne signal, i.e., the conditional Husimi-Q function. The latter grants access to all the field's weak values: we use it to obtain that of the field's energy change and display its anomalous behavior. Finally, we derive the field's conditional Wigner function and show that anomalous weak values and Wigner function negativities arise for the same values of the gate's angle.

TI Hamiltonian Extrema of an Arbitrary Flux-Biased Josephson Circuit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Flux-biased loops including one or more Josephson junctions are ubiquitous elements in quantum information experiments based on superconducting circuits. These quantum circuits can be tuned to implement a variety of Hamiltonians, with applications ranging from decoherence-protected qubits to quantum limited converters and amplifiers. The extrema of the Hamiltonian of these circuits are of special interest because they govern their low-energy dynamics. However, the theory of superconducting quantum circuits so far lacks a systematic method to find these extrema and compute the series expansion of the Hamiltonian in their vicinity for an arbitrary nonlinear superconducting circuit. We present such a method, which can aid the synthesis of new functionalities in quantum devices.

TI Quantum computing empowering blockchain technology with post quantum
   resistant cryptography for multimedia data privacy preservation in
   cloud-enabled public auditing platforms
SO JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The multimedia environment has undergone significant growth, particularly in the area of multimedia data and its migration to cloud platforms, which has raised issues about security, confidentiality, data integrity, and privacy protection. While Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (BDLT) offers decentralized trust and transparency the advent of Quantum Computing threatens classical cryptographic primitives, which make multimedia data increasingly vulnerable. This paper proposes a novel and secure framework that collaborates BDLT with quantum-resilient, mainly known post-quantum cryptographic schemes to ensure long-term data integrity and privacy preservation in cloud-based infrastructures. Due to this, the proposed solution enables secure, efficient, and transparent that helps in public auditing of multimedia content without compromising stakeholder confidentiality. It leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), lattice-based cryptography, and smart contract automation, which model fortifies data authenticity verification against quantum attacks. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework that achieves a 98.21% accuracy in data integrity verification, a 96.84% reduction in quantum vulnerability, and an 87.85% efficiency gain in auditing speed compared to classical BDLT-enabled platforms. In addition, privacy leakage in multimedia systems is reduced by 92.47% proving the framework's robustness. This solution underscores the potential of synergizing BDLT, quantum secure cryptography, and cloud computing to build a future-proof solution for privacy-protected multimedia data management and public auditing.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Support Vector Machine for Sentiment Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers have potential computational abilities such as speeding up complex computations, parallelism by superpositions, and handling large data sets. Moreover, the field of natural language processing (NLP) is rapidly attracting researchers and engineers in order to build larger model computations of NLP. Thus, the use of quantum technology in NLP tasks, especially sentiment classification, has the potential to be developed. In this research, we investigate the best technique to represent sentiment sentences so that sentiment can be analyzed using the Quantum-Enhanced Support Vector Machine (QE-SVM) algorithm. Investigations were carried out using circuit parameter optimization methods and data transformation. The pipeline of the proposed method consists of sentence-to-circuit conversion, circuit parameter training, state vector formation, and finally the training and testing processes. As a result, we obtained the best classification results with an accuracy of 93.33% using the SPSA optimization method and PCA transformation data. These results have also outperformed the baseline SVM method.

TI Demonstrating Scalable Randomized Benchmarking of Universal Gate Sets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols are the most widely used methods for assessing the performance of quantum gates. However, the existing RB methods either do not scale to many qubits or cannot benchmark a universal gate set. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a technique for scalable RB of many universal and continuously parametrized gate sets, using a class of circuits called randomized mirror circuits. Our technique can be applied to a gate set containing an entangling Clifford gate and the set of arbitrary single-qubit gates, as well as gate sets containing controlled rotations about the Pauli axes. We use our technique to benchmark universal gate sets on four qubits of the Advanced Quantum Testbed, including a gate set containing a controlled-S gate and its inverse, and we investigate how the observed error rate is impacted by the inclusion of non-Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate that our technique scales to many qubits with experiments on a 27-qubit IBM Q processor. We use our technique to quantify the impact of crosstalk on this 27-qubit device, and we find that it contributes approximately 2/3 of the total error per gate in random many-qubit circuit layers.

TI High-powered optical superlattice with robust phase stability for
   quantum gas microscopy
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical superlattice has a wide range of applications in the study of ultracold atom physics. Especially, it can be used to trap and manipulate thousands of atom pairs in parallel which constitutes a promising system for quantum simulation and quantum computation. In the present work, we report on a high-power optical superlattice formed by a 532-nm and 1064-nm dual-wavelength interferometer with a short lattice spacing of 630 nm. The short-term fluctuation (in 10 seconds) of the relative phase between the short lattice and the long lattice is measured to be 0.003 pi, which satisfies the needs for performing two-qubit gates among neighboring lattice sites. We further implement this superlattice in a Rb-87 experiment with a quantum gas microscope of single-site resolution, where the high-power 532-nm laser is necessary for pinning atoms in the short lattice during imaging, providing a unique platform for engineering quantum states.

TI Discrete and Parallel Frequency-Bin Entanglement Generation from Quantum
   Frequency Comb
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Photons' frequency degree of freedom is promising to realize large-scale quantum information processing. Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators can produce multiple frequency modes with narrow linewidth. Here, polarization-entangled QFCs are utilized to generate discrete frequency-bin entangled states. Fourteen pairs of polarization-entangled photons with different frequencies are simultaneously transformed into frequency-bin entangled states. The characteristic of frequency-bin entanglement is demonstrated by Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which can be performed with single or multiple frequency pairs in parallel. This work paves the way for harnessing large-scale frequency-bin entanglement and converting between different degrees of freedom in quantum information processing.

TI High-Fidelity Controlled-Z Gate with Maximal Intermediate Leakage
   Operating at the Speed Limit in a Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simple tuneup of fast two-qubit gates is essential for the scaling of quantum processors. We introduce the sudden variant (SNZ) of the net zero scheme realizing controlled-Z (CZ) gates by flux control of transmon frequency. SNZ CZ gates realized in a multitransmon processor operate at the speed limit of transverse coupling between computational and noncomputational states by maximizing intermediate leakage. Beyond speed, the key advantage of SNZ is tuneup simplicity, owing to the regular structure of conditional phase and leakage as a function of two control parameters. SNZ is compatible with scalable schemes for quantum error correction and adaptable to generalized conditional-phase gates useful in intermediate-scale applications.

TI Experimental quantum conference key agreement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum networks will provide multinode entanglement enabling secure communication on a global scale. Traditional quantum communication protocols consume pair-wise entanglement, which is suboptimal for distributed tasks involving more than two users. Here, we demonstrate quantum conference key agreement, a cryptography protocol leveraging multipartite entanglement to efficiently create identical keys between N users with up to N-1 rate advantage in constrained networks. We distribute four-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, generated by high-brightness telecom photon-pair sources, over optical fiber with combined lengths of up to 50 km and then perform multiuser error correction and privacy amplification. Under finite-key analysis, we establish 1.5 x 10(6) bits of secure key, which are used to encrypt and securely share an image between four users in a conference transmission. Our work highlights a previously unexplored protocol tailored for multinode networks leveraging low-noise, long-distance transmission of GHZ states that will pave the way for future multiparty quantum information processing applications.

TI Extremal quantum correlation generation using a hybrid channel
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The preservation of quantum correlations requires optimal procedures and the proper design of the transmitting channels. In this regard, we address designing a hybrid channel comprising a single-mode cavity accompanied by a super-Gaussian beam and local dephasing parts based on the dynamics of quantum characteristics. We choose two-level atoms and various functions such as traced-distance discord, concurrence, and local-quantum uncertainty to analyze the effectiveness of the hybrid channel to preserve quantum correlations along with entropy suppression discussed using linear entropy. The joint configuration of the considered fields is found to not only preserve but also generate quantum correlations even in the presence of local dephasing. Most importantly, within certain limits, the proposed channel can be readily regulated to generate maximal quantum correlations and complete suppression of the disorder. Besides, compared to the individual parts, mixing the Fock state cavity, super-Gaussian beam, and local dephasing remains a resourceful choice for the prolonged quantum correlations' preservation. Finally, we present an interrelationship between the considered two-qubit correlations' functions, showing the deviation between each two correlations and of the considered state from maximal entanglement under the influence of the assumed hybrid channel.

TI Counteracting a Saturation Attack in Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution Using an Adjustable Optical Filter Embedded in Homodyne
   Detector
SO ENTROPY
AB A saturation attack can be employed for compromising the practical security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). In this paper, we suggest a countermeasure approach to resisting this attack by embedding an adjustable optical filter (AOF) in the CVQKD system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effects of the AOF-enabled countermeasure on the performance in terms of the secret key rate and transmission distance. The legal participants can trace back the information that has been eavesdropped by an attacker from the imperfect receiver, which indicates that this approach can be used for defeating a saturation attack in practical quantum communications.

TI Superfluorescent upconversion nanoparticles as an emerging second
   generation quantum technology material
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Superfluorescence (SF) in lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a room-temperature quantum phenomenon, first discovered in 2022. In a SF process, the many emissive lanthanide ions within a single UCNP are coherently coupled by an ultra-short (ns or fs) high-power excitation laser pulse. This leads to a superposition of excited emissive states which decrease the emissive lifetime of the UCNP by a factor proportional to the square of the number of lanthanide ions which are coherently coupled. This results in a dramatic decrease in UCNP emission lifetime from the mu s regime to the ns regime. Thus SF offers a tantalizing prospect to achieving superior upconversion photon flux in upconversion materials, with potential applications such as imaging and sensing. This perspective article contextualizes how SF-UCNPs can be regarded as a second generation quantum technology, and notes several challenges, opportunities, and open questions for the development of SF-UCNPs.

TI Galvanic Phase Coupling of Superconducting Flux Qubits
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We investigate the galvanic coupling schemes of superconducting flux qubits. From the fundamental boundary conditions, we obtain the effective potential of the coupled system of two or three flux qubits to provide the exact Lagrangian of the system. While usually the two-qubit gate has been investigated approximately, in this study we derive the exact inductive coupling strength between two flux qubits coupled directly and coupled through a connecting central loop. We observe that the inductive coupling strength needs to be included exactly to satisfy the criteria of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Thermalization of a flexible microwave stripline measured by a
   superconducting qubit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB With the demand for scalable cryogenic microwave circuitry continuously rising, recently developed flexible microwave striplines offer the tantalizing perspective of increasing the cabling density by an order of magnitude without thermally overloading the cryostat. We use a superconducting quantum circuit to test the thermalization of input flex cables with integrated 60 dB of attenuation distributed at various temperature stages. From the measured decoherence rate of a superconducting fluxonium qubit, we estimate a residual population of the readout resonator of (2.2 +/- 0.9)x10(-3) photons and we measure a 0.28 ms thermalization time for the flexible stripline attenuators. Furthermore, we confirm that the qubit reaches an effective temperature of 26.4 mK, close to the base temperature of the cryostat, practically the same as when using a conventional semi-rigid coaxial cable setup.

TI Optimizing the Electrical Interface for Large-Scale Color-Center Quantum
   Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates for futurelarge-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical interface, (relatively) high operating temper-ature, and high-fidelity operation. Similar to other quantum computing platforms, the electrical interfacerequired to control and read out such qubits may limit both the performance of the whole system and itsscalability. To address this challenge, this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface andinvestigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a scalable architecture comprisinga large number of identical unit cells. Among the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus isdevoted to the generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and nuclear spins,because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability. Following the derived requirements, different systemarchitectures, such as a qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most powerefficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit Larmor frequency across theprocessor. As a result, a non-frequency-multiplexed 1- mm(2)unit-cell architecture is proposed as the optimalsolution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and nine nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW averagepower consumption, thus establishing the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scalecolor-center quantum computers

TI On the Challenges of Quantum Circuit Encoding Using Deep and
   Reinforcement Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers may solve some computing tasks more efficiently than classical com- puters, but to do so requires the design of appropriate quantum circuits. However, it is hard to design even simple quantum programs. Recent results have shown that deep learning augmented search has the potential to discover good circuits for a problem, but it is not yet sufficiently understood how well deep learning is able to model such a complex domain: the search space and output space grow exponentially. This work explores the ability of neural networks to encode quantum circuits for tasks that require knowledge about the unitary representation of the circuit. To this end, we trained neural networks to directly learn to predict the unitary of a circuit and applied reinforcement learning to train neural networks to solve circuit based quantum state preparation. This work finds that encoding quantum circuits is quite difficult especially with regards to the amount of entanglement applied in both application domains. The use of intermediate states and structure in quantum circuits combined with a reasonable inductive bias, where applicable, can alleviate these problems to some extent. The use of intermediate states also greatly improves the results of Deep Reinforcement Learning for quantum state preparation. Based on these results, we discuss the next set of challenges to address if we are to design neural network-based approaches for the automatic generation of quantum circuits.

   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Number-conserved subspace encoding reduces resources needed for quantum simulations, but scalable complexity trade-off bounds for M modes and N particles with O(N log M) qubits have remained unknown. We study qubit-gate-measurement trade-offs through the lens of classical/quantum error correction complexity and develop a framework of fermionic gate and measurement complexity based on classical encoder/decoder appearing in the error correction framework. We demonstrate optimal encoding with random classical parity check code and propose the Fermionic Expectation Decoder for scalable probability decoding in O(M4) bases. The protocol is tested with variational quantum eigensolver on LiH in the STO-3G and 6-31G bases, and H2 potential energy curve in the 6-311G* basis.

Integrated quantum photonics has enabled the generation, manipulation, and detection of quantum states of light with steadily increasing scale and complexity levels. Importantly, the exploration of on-chip integration has accumulated substantial progresses in recent years toward the realization of low-cost, large-scale quantum photonic circuits. Here, we review the underlying mechanism and discuss state-of-the-art SFWM on-chip quantum light sources fabricated with various structures and materials on chip. Furthermore, we enumerate the most appealing applications of on-chip SFWM such as heralding single-photon source, entangled photon source, and system-level integration.

TI A Novel Metric for Assessing National Strength in Scientific Research:
   Understanding China's Research Output in Quantum Technology through
   Collaboration
SO JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB Purpose: The 5th Plenary Session of the 19th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee clearly states that developing science and technology through self-reliance and self-strengthening provides the strategic underpinning for China's development. Based on this background, this paper explores a metric model for assessing national scientific research strength through collaboration on research papers.
   Design/methodology/approach: We propose a novel metric model for assessing national scientific research strength, which sets two indicators, national scientific self-reliance (SR) and national academic contribution (CT), to reflect "self-reliance" and "self-strengthening" respectively. Taking the research papers in quantum technology as an example, this study analyzes the scientific research strength of various countries around the world, especially China in quantum technology.
   Findings: The results show that the research of quantum technology in China has always been relatively independent with fewer international collaboration papers and located in a more marginal position in cooperation networks. China's academic contribution (CT) to global quantum technology research is increasing and has been greater than that of the United States in 2020. Combining the two indicators, CT and SR, China's research strength in the quantum field closely follows the United States, and the United States is the most powerful with high research autonomy.
   Research limitations: This paper only reflects China's scientific research strength in quantum technology from collaboration on research papers and doesn't consider the segmentation of quantum technology and the industrial upstream and downstream aspects, which need further study.
   Practical implications: The model is helpful to better understand the national scientific research strength in a certain field from "self-reliance" and "self-strengthening".
   Originality/value: We propose a novel metric model to measure the national scientific research strength from the perspective of "self-reliance" and "self-strengthening", which provides a solid basis for the assessment of the strength level of scientific research in countries/regions and institutions.

TI Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation and the
   Koopman-von Neumann approach to nonlinear dynamical systems
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.

TI Quantum Advantage in Cryptography
SO AIAA JOURNAL
AB Ever since its inception, cryptography has been caught in a vicious circle: Cryptographers keep inventing methods to hide information, and cryptanalysts break them, prompting cryptographers to invent even more sophisticated encryption schemes, and so on. But could it be that quantum information technology breaks this circle? At first sight, it looks as if it just lifts the competition between cryptographers and cryptanalysts to the next level. Indeed, quantum computers will render most of today's public key cryptosystems insecure. Nonetheless, there are good reasons to believe that cryptographers will ultimately prevail over cryptanalysts. Quantum cryptography allows us to build communication schemes whose secrecy relies only on the laws of physics and some minimum assumptions about the cryptographic hardware-leaving basically no room for an attack. While we are not yet there, this paper provides an overview of the principles and state-of-the-art of quantum cryptography, as well as an assessment of current challenges and prospects for overcoming them.

TI Self-trapping in bismuth-based semiconductors: Opportunities and
   challenges from optoelectronic devices to quantum technologies
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Semiconductors based on bismuth halides have gained attention for a wide range of electronic applications, including photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and radiation detectors. Their appeal is due to their low toxicity, high environmental stability under ambient conditions, and easy processability by a wide range of scalable methods. The performance of Bi-based semiconductors is dictated by electron-phonon interactions, which limit carrier mobilities and can also influence optoelectronic performance, for example, by giving rise to a large Stokes shift for photoluminescence, unavoidable energy loss channels, or shallow optical absorption onsets. In this Perspective, we discuss the recent understanding of how polarons and self-trapped excitons/carriers form in Bi-based semiconductors (particularly for the case of Cs2AgBiBr6), their impact on the optoelectronic properties of the materials, and the consequences on device performance. Finally, we discuss the opportunities that control of electron-phonon coupling enables, including stable solid-state white lighting, and the possibilities of exploiting the strong coupling found in bipolarons for quantum technologies.

TI Photon-pair generation from a chip-scale Cs atomic vapor cell
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The realization of a narrowband photonic quantum source based on an atomic device is considered essential in the practical development of photonic quantum information science and technology. In this study, we present the first step toward the development of a photon-pair source based on a microfabricated Cs atomic vapor cell. Time-correlated photon pairs from the millimeter-scale Cs vapor cell are emitted via the spontaneous four-wave mixing process of the cascade-type 6S(1/2)-6P(3/2)-8S(1/2) transition of Cs-133. The maximum normalized cross-correlation value between the signal and idler photons is measured as 622(8) under a weak pump power of 10 mu;W. Our photon source violates the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality by a factor of >10(5). We believe that our approach has very important applications in the context of realizing practical scalable quantum networks based on atom-photon interactions.

In this article, the RF and noise performance of the InP HEMT under ultralow-power (ULP) operation at 4 K has been characterized. The small-signal and noise parameter model of the InP HEMT was extracted down to 1 mu W. The tradeoff between noise performance and dc power consumption was analyzed in terms of the drain current and drain voltage. A 4-6 GHz hybrid cryogenic HEMT LNA designed for qubit readout and optimized for lowest noise below 1 mW dc power consumption was fabricated. The measured performance of the LNA at 4 K attained 23.1 dB average gain and 2.0 K average noise temperature at 200 mu W dc power.

A promising approach for their experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50% of the original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates of spin Hamiltonians.

TI Noisy Tree Data Structures and Quantum Applications
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We suggest a new technique for developing noisy tree data structures. We call it a "walking tree". As applications of the technique we present a noisy Self-Balanced Binary Search Tree (we use a Red-Black tree as an implementation) and a noisy segment tree. The asymptotic complexity of the main operations for the tree data structures does not change compared to the case without noise. We apply the data structures in quantum algorithms for several problems on strings like the string-sorting problem and auto-complete problem. For both problems, we obtain quantum speed-up. Moreover, for the string-sorting problem, we show a quantum lower bound.

TI Quantum approximate optimization for hard problems in linear algebra
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) by Farhi et al. is a quantum computational framework for solving quantum or classical optimization tasks. Here, we explore using QAOA for binary linear least squares (BLLS); a problem that can serve as a building block of several other hard problems in linear algebra, such as the non-negative binary matrix factorization (NBMF) and other variants of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem. Most of the previous efforts in quantum computing for solving these problems were done using the quantum annealing paradigm. For the scope of this work, our experiments were done on noiseless quantum simulators, a simulator including a device-realistic noise-model, and two IBM Q 5-qubit machines. We highlight the possibilities of using QAOA and QAOA-like variational algorithms for solving such problems, where trial solutions can be obtained directly as samples, rather than being amplitude-encoded in the quantum wavefunction. Our numerics show that even for a small number of steps, simulated annealing can outperform QAOA for BLLS at a QAOA depth of p <= 3 for the probability of sampling the ground state. Finally, we point out some of the challenges involved in current-day experimental implementations of this technique on cloud-based quantum computers.

TI Machine learning aided carrier recovery in continuous-variable quantum
   key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The secret key rate of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system is limited by excess noise. A key issue typical to all modern CV-QKD systems implemented with a reference or pilot signal and an independent local oscillator is controlling the excess noise generated from the frequency and phase noise accrued by the transmitter and receiver. Therefore accurate phase estimation and compensation, so-called carrier recovery, is a critical subsystem of CV-QKD. Here, we explore the implementation of a machine learning framework based on Bayesian inference, namely an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), for estimation of phase noise and compare it to a standard reference method and a previously demonstrated machine learning method. Experimental results obtained over a 20-km fibre-optic link indicate that the UKF can ensure very low excess noise even at low pilot powers. The measurements exhibited low variance and high stability in excess noise over a wide range of pilot signal to noise ratios. This may enable CV-QKD systems with low hardware implementation complexity which can seamlessly work on diverse transmission lines.

TI Approaching Ideal Visibility in Singlet-Triplet Qubit Operations Using
   Energy-Selective Tunneling-Based Hamiltonian Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report energy-selective tunneling readout-based Hamiltonian parameter estimation of a two-electron spin qubit in a GaAs quantum dot array. Optimization of readout fidelity enables a single-shot measurement time of 16 ??s on average, with adaptive initialization and efficient qubit frequency estimation based on realtime Bayesian inference. For qubit operation in a frequency heralded mode, we observe a 40-fold increase in coherence time without resorting to dynamic nuclear polarization. We also demonstrate active frequency feedback with quantum oscillation visibility, single-shot measurement fidelity, and gate fidelity of 97.7%, 99%, and 99.6%, respectively, showcasing the improvements in the overall capabilities of GaAs-based spin qubits. By pushing the sensitivity of the energy-selective tunneling-based spin to charge conversion to the limit, the technique is useful for advanced quantum control protocols such as error mitigation schemes, where fast qubit parameter calibration with a large signal-to-noise ratio is crucial.

TI Higher key rate of measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution through joint data processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method named as double-scanning method to improve the key rate of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) drastically. In the method, two parameters are scanned simultaneously to tightly estimate the counts of single-photon pairs and the phase-flip error rate jointly. Numerical results show that the method in this work can improve the key rate by 35%-280% in a typical experimental setup. Besides, we study the optimization of MDI-QKD protocol with all parameters including the source parameters and failure probability parameters, over symmetric channel or asymmetric channel. Compared with the optimized results with only the source parameters, the all-parameter-optimization method could improve the key rate by about 10%.

TI Ramped measurement technique for robust high-fidelity spin qubit readout
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB State preparation and measurement of single-electron spin qubits typically rely on spin-to-charge conversion where a spin-dependent charge transition of the electron is detected by a coupled charge sensor. For high-fidelity, fast readout, this process requires that the qubit energy is much larger than the temperature of the system limiting the temperature range for measurements. Here, we demonstrate an initialization and measurement technique that involves voltage ramps rather than static voltages allowing us to achieve state-to-charge readout fidelities above 99% for qubit energies almost half that required by traditional methods. This previously unidentified measurement technique is highly relevant for achieving high-fidelity electron spin readout at higher temperature operation and offers a number of pragmatic benefits compared to traditional energy-selective readout such as real-time dynamic feedback and minimal alignment procedures.

TI Experimental realization of scanning quantum microscopy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications due to different physical and technical reasons. Here, we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we assess its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way toward scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology toward the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications toward the mid-infrared to access the molecular fingerprint region.

TI Effect of Etching Methods on Dielectric Losses in Transmons
SO JETP LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubits are considered as a promising platform for implementing a fault tolerant quantum computing. However, surface defects of superconductors and the substrate leading to qubit state decoherence and fluctuations in qubit parameters constitute a significant problem. The amount and type of defects depend both on the chip materials and fabrication procedure. In this work, transmons produced by two different methods of aluminum etching: wet etching in a solution of weak acids and dry etching using a chlorine-based plasma are experimentally studied. The relaxation and coherence times for dry-etched qubits are more than twice as long as those for wet-etched ones. Additionally, the analysis of time fluctuations of qubit frequencies and relaxation times, which is an effective method to identify the dominant dielectric loss mechanisms, i-ndicates a significantly lower impact of two-level systems in the dry-etched qubits compared to the wet-etched ones.

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an attractive technology for distributing secret encryption keys between distant users. The decoy-state technique has drastically improved its practicality and performance, and has been widely adopted in commercial systems. However, conventional intensity modulators can introduce security side channels in high speed QKDsystems because of their non-stationaryworking points for decoy-state generation. Here, we analyze the transfer function of an in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulator and reveal its superiority for stable decoy-state generation, followed by an experimental demonstration. Thanks to their convenient two-level modulation and inherent high speed, IQ modulators are ideal for use in high-speed decoy-state QKD systems. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

Their widespread use is currently hindered by impractical features, such as the need for operation at cryogenic temperatures and emission wavelengths lying outside telecom windows. Taking advantage of telecom technology and point defects in GaN crystals, we present, for the first time, the development of a fully-fibered source of single photons operating at room temperature, emitting photons in the telecom O-band and fulfilling the standards of telecom photonics. We characterise an emitter producting single photons at the wavelength of 1292 nm, a spectral broadening compatible with CWDM channels of 13 nm, and a brightness of 25 kcps per mW of pump power. The source shows a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.5 and a purity g(2)(0) = (5.9 +/- 0.5) x 10-2 at room temperature, showing high potential for being integrated transportable quantum cryptography devices.

TI Joint Wire Cutting with Non-Maximally Entangled States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Distributed quantum computing leverages multiple quantum devices collectively to perform computations exceeding each device's capabilities. A currently studied technique to enable this distributed approach is wire cutting, which decomposes a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits by cutting connecting wires. These subcircuits can be executed on distributed devices, and their results are then classically combined to reconstruct the original computation's result. However, wire cutting requires additional circuit executions to preserve result accuracy, with their number growing exponentially with each cut. Thus, minimizing this sampling overhead is crucial for reducing execution time. Employing shared non-maximally entangled (NME) states between distributed devices reduces this overhead for single wire cuts, approaching ideal teleportation with maximally entangled states. Extending this approach to jointly cutting multiple wires using NME states remained unexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the use of NME states for joint wire cuts, aiming to reduce the sampling overhead further. The three main contributions include (i) determining the minimal sampling overhead for this scenario, (ii) analyzing the overhead when using composite NME states constructed from smaller NME states, and (iii) introducing a wire cutting technique that achieves the optimal sampling overhead with pure NME states, advancing toward wire cutting with arbitrary NME states.

TI Fabrication and characterization of low-loss Al/Si/Al parallel plate
   capacitors for superconducting quantum information applications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Increasing the density of superconducting circuits requires compact components, however, superconductor-based capacitors typically perform worse as dimensions are reduced due to loss at surfaces and interfaces. Here, parallel plate capacitors composed of aluminum-contacted, crystalline silicon fins are shown to be a promising technology for use in superconducting circuits by evaluating the performance of lumped element resonators and transmon qubits. High aspect ratio Si-fin capacitors having widths below 300 nm with an approximate total height of 3 mu m are fabricated using anisotropic wet etching of Si(110) substrates followed by aluminum metallization. The single-crystal Si capacitors are incorporated in lumped element resonators and transmons by shunting them with lithographically patterned aluminum inductors and conventional Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions respectively. Microwave characterization of these devices suggests state-of-the-art performance for superconducting parallel plate capacitors with low power internal quality factor of lumped element resonators greater than 500 k and qubit T1 times greater than 25 mu s. These results suggest that Si-Fins are a promising technology for applications that require low-loss, compact, superconductor-based capacitors with minimal stray capacitance.

TI Intensity modulator for secure, stable, and high-performance decoy-state
   quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The decoy-state method substantially improves the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) and perfectly solves crucial issues caused by multiphoton pulses. In recent years, the decoy-state method has occupied a key position in practicality, and almost all the QKD systems have employed the decoy-state method. However, the imperfections of traditional intensity modulators limit the performance of the decoy-state method and bring side channels. In this work, a special intensity modulator and its accompanying modulation method are designed and experimentally verified for the secure, stable, and high-performance decoy-state QKDs. The experimental result indicates that its stable and adjustable intensities, convenient two-level modulation, inherently high speed, and compact structure is extremely fit for future trends and will help the decoy-state method to be perfectly applied to QKD systems.

TI LANCER: Low-Overhead, Accurate, and Non-Destructive Calibration for
   Real-World Fault-Tolerant Quantum Applications

AB The ultimate goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is to run practical applications. Due to the long execution time of practical workloads, an FTQC system must operate reliably for multiple days by correcting the errors of noisy qubits. However, drifts of error sources increase qubit error rates during execution (i.e., error drift), limiting the reliable execution time. Even worse, existing error-drift-handling methods cannot execute long-running workloads as they collapse the qubit states or fail to suppress errors.
   In this paper, we propose LANCER, a novel accurate and non-destructive calibration method for reliable execution under error drifts. We observe that only a subset of qubits store quantum states during execution. Based on the observation, we periodically stall the program and migrate the quantum states temporarily to idle qubits, enabling accurate calibrations without losing the states. However, this idea faces two major challenges: (1) crosstalk between running and calibrating qubits and (2) huge latency overhead due to stalls when the quantum states are migrated to idle qubits.
   We propose three solutions to resolve these challenges. First, we mitigate the crosstalk by toggling the frequencies of running qubits to separate them from the frequencies of calibrating qubits. Second, we reduce the latency overhead by utilizing the inherent idle times in the fault-tolerant quantum gate. Lastly, we further reduce the latency overhead by re-designing qubit layout to enable the execution even when the quantum states are migrated to idle qubits. The evaluation shows that LANCER enables the execution of 95 times larger programs (i.e., larger number of gates) compared to the baseline, with negligible latency and qubit overhead (4.3% and 4.0%, respectively).

TI Comment on "quantum identity authentication with single photon"
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A few years ago Hong et al. (Quantum Inf Process 16:236, 2017) proposed a quantum identity authentication protocol using single photons and executable on currently available quantum hardware. Zawadzki later published two attacks on this protocol, and suggested a mitigation in the same work. In this comment we point out an additional vulnerability that causes the prover Alice to leak a percentage of her secret key at every authentication attempt. The latter is due to a problematic policy in the generation and management of decoy states. We conclude by showing a simple mitigation that addresses the issue.

TI Optical Realization of Wave-Based Analog Computing with Metamaterials
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, the study of analog optical computing raised renewed interest due to its natural advantages of parallel, high speed and low energy consumption over conventional digital counterpart, particularly in applications of big data and high-throughput image processing. The emergence of metamaterials or metasurfaces in the last decades offered unprecedented opportunities to arbitrarily manipulate the light waves within subwavelength scale. Metamaterials and metasurfaces with freely controlled optical properties have accelerated the progress of wave-based analog computing and are emerging as a practical, easy-integration platform for optical analog computing. In this review, the recent progress of metamaterial-based spatial analog optical computing is briefly reviewed. We first survey the implementation of classical mathematical operations followed by two fundamental approaches (metasurface approach and Green's function approach). Then, we discuss recent developments based on different physical mechanisms and the classical optical simulating of quantum algorithms are investigated, which may lead to a new way for high-efficiency signal processing by exploiting quantum behaviors. The challenges and future opportunities in the booming research field are discussed.

TI Efficient bosonic nonlinear phase gates
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing harnesses versatile experimental tools that leverage the power of infinite-dimensional oscillators controlled by a single qubit. Increasingly available elementary Rabi gates have been proposed as a resource for implementing universal CV gates, but the requirement of many weak, non-commuting gates is a bottleneck in scaling up such an approach. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient technique using Fourier expansion to implement arbitrary non-linear phase gates in a single oscillator. This method reduces the number of sequentially required gates exponentially. These gates represented by cubic, quartic, and other arbitrary nonlinear potentials have applications in CV quantum information processing with infinite-dimensional oscillators controlled by a single qubit. Our method outperforms previous approaches and enables the experimental realization of a wide range of applications, including the development of bosonic quantum sensors, simulations, and computation using trapped ions and superconducting circuits.

TI Leakage in restless quantum gate calibration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers require high-fidelity quantum gates. These gates are obtained by routine calibration tasks that eat into the availability of cloud-based devices. Restless circuit execution speeds up characterization and calibration by foregoing qubit reset between circuits. Postprocessing the measured data recovers the desired signal. However, since the qubits are not reset, leakage-typically present at the beginning of the calibration-may cause issues. Here we develop a simulator of restless circuit execution based on a Markov chain to study the effect of leakage. In the context of error-amplifying single-qubit gates sequences, we show that restless calibration tolerates up to 0.5% of leakage, which is large compared to the 10(-4) gate fidelity of modern single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we show that restless circuit execution with leaky gates reduces by 33% the sensitivity of the ORBIT cost function developed by J. Kelly et al. which is typically used in closed-loop optimal control [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 240504 (2014)]. Our results are obtained with standard qubit state discrimination showing that restless circuit execution is resilient against misclassified noncomputational states. In summary, the restless method is sufficiently robust against leakage in both standard and closed-loop optimal control gate calibration to provided accurate results.

TI Experimental classical entanglement in a 16 acoustic qubit-analogue
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The possibility of achieving and controlling scalable classically entangled, i.e., inseparable, multipartite states, would fundamentally challenge the advantages of quantum systems in harnessing the power of complexity in information science. Here, we investigate experimentally the extent of classical entanglement in a 16 acoustic qubit-analogue platform. The acoustic qubit-analogue, a.k.a., logical phi-bit, results from the spectral partitioning of the nonlinear acoustic field of externally driven coupled waveguides. Each logical phi-bit is a two-level subsystem characterized by two independently measurable phases. The phi-bits are co-located within the same physical space enabling distance independent interactions. We chose a vector state representation of the 16-phi-bit system which lies in a 2(16)-dimensional Hilbert space. The calculation of the entropy of entanglement demonstrates the possibility of achieving inseparability of the vector state and of navigating the corresponding Hilbert space. This work suggests a new direction in harnessing the complexity of classical inseparability in information science.

TI Future proofing network encryption technology with continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a proof-of-concept establishment of quantum-secure data transfer links in field trials at two locations in Denmark: on the campus of Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby and between power grid nodes owned and operated by Energinet in Odense. Several different links, implemented physically using optical ground wires, underground fibers as well as their combinations, were investigated. Coherent 'quantum' states at 1550 nm, prepared and measured using a semi-autonomous continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) prototype, were multiplexed in wavelength with 'classical' 100 Gbps encrypted data traffic from a pair of commercial layer-2 network encryption devices operating at around 1300 nm. Under the assumptions of real-time data processing, we estimate average secret key rates of 434.8, 148.6, and 78.3 kbps in the asymptotic limit for diverse channels with losses (at 1550 nm) of 4.1, 5.5, and 6.7 dB, respectively. The demonstrations permit an evaluation of the prototype's tolerance to harsh field conditions and showcase that CVQKD can serve as an additional layer to protect sensitive network traffic propagating on insecure channels.

TI Entangling Transmons with Low-Frequency Protected Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Novel qubits with intrinsic noise protection constitute a promising route for improving the coherence of quantum information in superconducting circuits. However, many protected superconducting qubits exhibit relatively low transition frequencies, which could make their integration with conventional transmon circuits challenging. In this work, we propose and study a scheme for entangling a tunable transmon with a Cooper-pair parity-protected qubit, a paradigmatic example of a low-frequency protected qubit that stores quantum information in opposite Cooper-pair parity states on a superconducting island. By tuning the external flux on the transmon, we show that noncomputational states can mediate a two-qubit entangling gate that preserves the Cooper-pair parity independent of the detailed pulse sequence. Interestingly, the entangling gate bears similarities to a controlled-phase gate in conventional transmon devices. Hence, our results suggest that standard high-precision gate calibration protocols could be repurposed for operating heterogeneous quantum processors.

TI Formulas for Schmidt decompositions of mutually orthogonal quantum
   states in two-qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present Schmidt decomposition formulas for mutually orthogonal two-qubit pure states and classify orthonormal sets according to their entanglement structure. We begin by presenting explicit formulas for the Schmidt decomposition of arbitrary two-qubit pure states. Building on this, we construct and analyze all possible configurations of two mutually orthogonal pure states, providing corresponding Schmidt decomposition expressions for each case. For orthonormal sets of three and four states, we derive explicit formulas for selected representative types and discuss the difficulties in obtaining closed-form expressions for more general cases. In particular, we focus on special classes of orthonormal bases that include one or two maximally entangled states. Finally, we prove that no orthonormal basis can contain three product states and one entangled state, revealing a structural constraint that restricts the composition of entangled orthonormal sets.

TI Continuous-variable quantum passive optical network
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB To establish a scalable and secure quantum network, a critical milestone is advancing from basic point-to-point quantum key distribution (QKD) systems to the development of inherently multi-user protocols designed to maximize network capacity. Here, we propose a quantum passive optical network (QPON) protocol based on continuous-variable (CV) systems, particularly the quadrature of the coherent state, which enables deterministic, simultaneous, and high-rate secret key generation among all network users. We implement two protocols with different trust levels assigned to the network users and experimentally demonstrate key generation in a quantum access network with 8 users, each with an 11 km span of access link. Depending on the trust assumptions about the users, we reach 1.5 and 2.1 Mbits/s of total network key generation (or 0.4 and 1.0 Mbits/s with finite-size channels estimation). Demonstrating the potential to expand the network's capacity to accommodate tens of users at a high rate, our CV-QPON protocols open up new possibilities in establishing low-cost, high-rate, and scalable secure quantum access networks serving as a stepping stone towards a quantum internet.

TI Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study disordered Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution: the automorphisms "compete." We characterize the effect of this competition, showing how key features of the purification dynamics of mixed code states can be inferred from anyon and automorphism properties for any Abelian topological order. This perspective can explain the preservation or measurement of logical information in a dynamic automorphism (DA) code when subjected to a noise model of missing measurements. We demonstrate this using a DA color code with perturbed measurement sequences. The framework of competing automorphisms captures essential features of Floquet codes and robustness to noise, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and fault tolerance.

TI A Phase Estimation Algorithm for Quantum Speed-Up Multi-Party Computing
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Security and privacy issues have attracted the attention of researchers in the field of IoT as the information processing scale grows in sensor networks. Quantum computing, theoretically known as an absolutely secure way to store and transmit information as well as a speed-up way to accelerate local or distributed classical algorithms that are hard to solve with polynomial complexity in computation or communication. In this paper, we focus on the phase estimation method that is crucial to the realization of a general multi-party computing model, which is able to be accelerated by quantum algorithms. A novel multi-party phase estimation algorithm and the related quantum circuit are proposed by using a distributed Oracle operator with iterations. The proved theoretical communication complexity of this algorithm shows it can give the phase estimation before applying multi-party computing efficiently without increasing any additional complexity. Moreover, a practical problem of multi-party dating investigated shows it can make a successful estimation of the number of solution in advance with zero communication complexity by utilizing its special statistic feature. Sufficient simulations present the correctness, validity and efficiency of the proposed estimation method.

TI Maximum violation of monogamy of entanglement for indistinguishable
   particles by measures that are monogamous for distinguishable particles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Two important results of quantum physics are the no-cloning theorem and the monogamy of entanglement. The former forbids the creation of an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state and the latter restricts the shareability of quantum entanglement among multiple quantum systems. For distinguishable particles, one of these results implies the other. In this Letter, we show that in qubit systems with indistinguishable particles (where each particle cannot be addressed individually) a maximum violation of the monogamy of entanglement is possible by the measures that are monogamous for distinguishable particles. To derive this result, we formulate the degree of freedom trace-out rule for indistinguishable particles corresponding to a spatial location where each degree of freedom might be entangled with the other degrees of freedom. Our result removes the restriction on the shareability of quantum entanglement for indistinguishable particles, without contradicting the no-cloning theorem.

TI Kochen-Specker contextuality
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB A central result in the foundations of quantum mechanics is the Kochen-Specker theorem. In short, it states that quantum mechanics is in conflict with classical models in which the result of a measurement does not depend on which other compatible measurements are jointly performed. Here compatible measurements are those that can be implemented simultaneously or, more generally, those that are jointly measurable. This conflict is generically called quantum contextuality. In this review, an introduction to this subject and its current status is presented. Several proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem and different notions of contextuality are reviewed. How to experimentally test some of these notions is explained, and connections between contextuality and nonlocality or graph theory are discussed. Finally, some applications of contextuality in quantum information processing are reviewed.

TI On the Capacity of Quantum Private Information Retrieval From MDS-Coded
   and Colluding Servers
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB In quantum private information retrieval (QPIR), a user retrieves a classical file from multiple servers by downloading quantum systems without revealing the identity of the file. The QPIR capacity is the maximal achievable ratio of the retrieved file size to the total download size. In this paper, the capacity of QPIR from MDS-coded and colluding servers is studied for the first time. Two general classes of QPIR, called stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from classical strongly linear PIR are defined, and the related QPIR capacities are derived. For the non-colluding case, the general QPIR capacity is derived when the number of files goes to infinity. A general statement on the converse bound for QPIR with coded and colluding servers is derived showing that the capacities of stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from any class of PIR are upper bounded by twice the classical capacity of the respective PIR class. The proposed capacity-achieving scheme combines the star-product scheme by Freij-Hollanti et al. and the stabilizer QPIR scheme by Song et al. by employing (weakly) self-dual Reed-Solomon codes.

TI Studying evaporating black hole using quantum computation algorithms on
   IBM quantum processor
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Analyzing complex quantum systems using quantum computational algorithms is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of a custom variational ansatz in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm compared to predefined ansatzes. To achieve this, we employ the evaporating black hole model as a test bed for our analysis. Using the VQE approach, which integrates quantum and classical computing techniques, we aim to minimize the energy expectation value of the Hamiltonian. By training the circuit parameters of a trial wave function as a parameterized quantum circuit, we determine the upper bound for the ground state energy and assess the optimal variational form. We define a custom ansatz for the VQE protocol and compare its performance with other predefined ansatzes. Additionally, we test the performance of three different classical optimizers to further understand their impact on the VQE algorithm's efficiency and accuracy.

TI Improved Coherent One-Way Quantum key Distribution for High-Loss
   Channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The coherent one-way (COW) quantum key distribution (QKD) is a highly practical quantum com-munication protocol that is currently deployed in off-the-shelve products. However, despite its simplicity and widespread use, the security of COW QKD is still an open problem. This is largely due to its unique security feature based on the intersignal phase distribution, which makes it very difficult to analyze using standard security proof techniques. Here, to overcome this problem, we present a simple variant of COW QKD and prove its security in the infinite-key limit. The proposed modifications only involve an additional vacuum tail signal following every encoded signal and a balanced beam splitter for passive measurement basis choice. Remarkably, the resulting key rate of our protocol is comparable with both the existing upper bound on the COW-QKD key rate and the secure key rate of the coherent-state BB84 protocol. Our find-ings therefore suggest that the secured deployment of COW-QKD systems in high-loss optical networks is indeed feasible with minimal adaptations applied to its hardware and software.

TI Variational Gibbs state preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum
   devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The preparation of an equilibrium thermal state of a quantum many-body system on noisy intermediatescale quantum (NISQ) devices is an important task in order to extend the range of applications of quantum computation. Faithful Gibbs state preparation would pave the way to investigate protocols such as thermalization and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and provide useful resources for quantum algorithms, where sampling from Gibbs states constitutes a key subroutine. We propose a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to prepare Gibbs states of a quantum many-body system. The novelty of our VQA consists of implementing a parameterized quantum circuit acting on two distinct, yet connected (via CNOT gates), quantum registers. The VQA evaluates the Helmholtz free energy, where the von Neumann entropy is obtained via postprocessing of computational-basis measurements on one register, while the Gibbs state is prepared on the other register via a unitary rotation in the energy basis. Finally, we benchmark our VQA by preparing Gibbs states of the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models and achieve remarkably high fidelities across a broad range of temperatures in state-vector simulations. We also assess the performance of the VQA on IBM quantum computers, showcasing its feasibility on current NISQ devices.

TI Protecting Fiber-Optic Quantum Key Distribution Sources against
   Light-Injection Attacks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A well-protected and characterized source in a quantum key distribution system is needed for its secu-rity. Unfortunately, the source is vulnerable to light-injection attacks, such as Trojan-horse, laser-seeding, and laser-damage attacks, in which an eavesdropper actively injects bright light to hack the source unit. The hacking laser could be a high-power one that can modify properties of components via the laser -damage attack and also further help the Trojan-horse and other light-injection attacks. Here we propose a countermeasure against the light-injection attacks, consisting of an additional sacrificial component placed at the exit of the source. This component should either withstand high-power incoming light while atten-uating it to a safe level that cannot modify the rest of the source, or get destroyed into a permanent high-attenuation state that breaks up the line. We demonstrate experimentally that off-the-shelf fiber-optic isolators and circulators have these desired properties, at least under attack by a continuous-wave high-power laser.

TI Ergotropy from quantum and classical correlations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB It is an established fact that quantum coherences have thermodynamic value. The natural question arises, whether other genuine quantum properties such as entanglement can also be exploited to extract thermodynamic work. In the present analysis, we show that the ergotropy can be expressed as a function of the quantum mutual information, which demonstrates the contributions to the extractable work from classical and quantum correlations. More specifically, we analyze bipartite quantum systems with locally thermal states, such that the only contribution to the ergotropy originates in the correlations. Our findings are illustrated for a two-qubit system collectively coupled to a thermal bath.

TI Secret key rate of multi-ring M-APSK continuous variable quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key distribution (DM-CV-QKD) is highly considered in real implementations to avoid the complexity of Gaussian modulation (GM), which is optimum in terms of the key rate. DM-CV-QKD systems usually consider M-symbol phase shift keying (M-PSK) constellations. However, this type of constellation cannot reach transmission distances and key rates as high as GM, limiting the practical implementation of CV-QKD systems. Here, by considering M-symbol amplitude and phase shift keying (M-APSK) constellations, we can approximate GM. Indeed, considering finite-size effects, 4 ring 64-APSK can reach 52.0 km, only 7.2 km less than GM and 282% the maximum achievable transmission distance for 8-PSK.

TI Asymptotic Survival of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement in Noisy
   Quantum Networks Depends on the Topology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The study of entanglement in multipartite quantum states plays a major role in quantum information theory and genuine multipartite entanglement signals one of its strongest forms for applications. However, its characterization for general (mixed) states is a highly nontrivial problem. We introduce a particularly simple subclass of multipartite states, which we term pair-entangled network (PEN) states, as those that can be created by distributing exclusively bipartite entanglement in a connected network. We show that genuine multipartite entanglement in a PEN state depends on both the level of noise and the network topology and, in sharp contrast to the case of pure states, it is not guaranteed by the mere distribution of mixed bipartite entangled states. Our main result is a markedly drastic feature of this phenomenon: the amount of connectivity in the network determines whether genuine multipartite entanglement is robust to noise for any system size or whether it is completely washed out under the slightest form of noise for a sufficiently large number of parties. This latter case implies fundamental limitations for the application of certain networks in realistic scenarios, where the presence of some form of noise is unavoidable. To illustrate the applicability of PEN states to study the complex phenomenology behind multipartite entanglement, we also use them to prove superactivation of genuine multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties.

TI RF Performance Benchmarking of TSV Integrated Surface Electrode Ion Trap
   for Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface electrode ion trap is highly promising for practical quantum computing due to its superior controllability on the trapped ions. With advanced microfabrication techniques, silicon has been developed as an ion trap substrate for delicate surface electrodes design and monolithic electro-optical components integration. However, the high RF loss of silicon hinders the possible large-scale implementation. In this work, we demonstrate a through silicon via (TSV) integrated ion trap, which has low RF loss due to the elimination of wire bonding (WB) pads on the surface and the miniaturization of form factor. We also fabricate two types of conventional WB traps with or without a grounding screen layer. The RF performances of different ion traps are tested and compared, in terms of on-chip S-parameter, postpackaging resonance, and resulting power loss. The results show that the TSV trap has low S21 (similar to 0.2 dB at 50 MHz), high Q factor (similar to 22), and low power loss (0.26 W) compared to WB traps. In addition, 3-D finite element modeling (FEM) is employed for electric field visualization and RF loss analysis of different traps. The extracted results from the modeling show a decent agreement with the measurements. In addition to various RF tests, the design, fabrication, and ion trapping operation of different ion traps are presented. This work provides insights into RF loss of ion trapping devices and offers a new solution for RF loss reduction.

TI No quantum solutions to linear constraint systems in odd dimension from
   Pauli group and diagonal Cliffords
SO QUANTUM
AB Linear constraint systems (LCS) have proven to be a surprisingly prolific tool in the study of non-classical correlations and various related issues in quantum foundations. Many results are known for the Boolean case, yet the generalisation to systems of odd dimension is largely open. In particular, it is not known whether there exist LCS in odd dimension, which admit finite-dimensional quantum, but no classical solutions. In recent work, [J. Phys. A, 53, 385304 (2020)] have shown that unlike in the Boolean case, where the n-qubit Pauli group gives rise to quantum solutions of LCS such as the Mermin-Peres square, the n-qudit Pauli group never gives rise to quantum solutions of a LCS in odd dimension. Here, we generalise this result towards the Clifford hierarchy. More precisely, we consider tensor products of groups generated by (single-qudit) Pauli and diagonal Clifford operators.

TI Postselection-Free Cavity-Enhanced Narrow-Band Orbital Angular Momentum
   Entangled Photon Source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) provides a significant way to produce similar to 10 MHz narrow-band photon pairs, which matches the bandwidth of photon for quantum memory. However, the output photon pairs from the cavity are not entangled, and postselection is required to create the entanglement so far, so the direct output of cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs is still an open challenge. Here, we propose a solution that realizes the first postselection-free cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs. The entanglement is achieved in degree of freedom of orbital angular momentum (OAM) by an OAM-conservation SPDC process in an actively and precisely controlled cavity supporting degenerate high-order OAM modes. The measured linewidth and fidelity are 13.8 MHz and 0.969(3), respectively, for the directly generated OAM entangled two photons. We deterministically transfer the OAM entanglement to polarization one with almost no loss and obtain polarization entangled two photons with a fidelity of 0.948(2). Moreover, we produce narrow-band OAM-polarization hyperentangled photon pairs with a fidelity of 0.850(2), which is realized by interfering the two photons on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and postselecting the events of one and only one photon on each PBS port. Novel cavity may find applications in cavity-based light-matter interaction. Our results provide an efficient and promising approach to create narrow-band entangled photon sources for memory-based long-distance quantum communication and network.

TI Pitfalls of the Sublinear QAOA-Based Factorization Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing devices are believed to be powerful in solving the prime factorization problem, which is at the heart of widely deployed public-key cryptographic tools. However, the implementation of Shor's quantum factorization algorithm requires significant resources scaling linearly with the number size; taking into account an overhead that is required for quantum error correction the estimation is that 20 millions of (noisy) physical qubits are required for factoring 2048-bit RSA key in 8 hours. Recent proposal by Yan et al. claims a possibility of solving the factorization problem with sublinear quantum resources. As we demonstrate in our work, this proposal lacks systematic analysis of the computational complexity of the classical part of the algorithm, which exploits the Schnorr's lattice-based approach. We provide several examples illustrating the need in additional resource analysis for the proposed quantum factorization algorithm.

TI A perspective of doping in diamond: From nanoelectronics to quantum
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Diamond is a material that has been previously considered for nanoelectronic applications and more recently for quantum computing. Despite its advantageous physical properties, the difficulty to dope n-type diamond had been a major drawback to create efficient semiconductor devices based on diamond. Interestingly, nitrogen doping and, in particular, nitrogen-vacancy pairs are keys to integrate diamond in quantum computing. Here, we consider p-type and n-type doping in diamond, particularly, on the challenges to dope n-type diamond. We discuss defect engineering strategies, which should be focused on phosphorous as it is the most promising n-type dopant in diamond. We consider in detail the importance of diamond as a quantum host and the nitrogen-vacancy center as a qubit. Finally, we discuss doping strategies that can become important for quantum computing and technical details in theoretical methods.

TI Equivalence of flexible stripline and coaxial cables for superconducting
   qubit control and readout pulses
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report a comparative study on microwave control lines for a transmon qubit using (i) flexible stripline transmission lines and (ii) semi-rigid coaxial cables. During each experiment, we performed repeated measurements of the energy relaxation and coherence times of a transmon qubit using one of the wiring configurations. Each measurement run spanned 70-250 h of the measurement time, and four separate cooldowns were performed so that each configuration could be tested twice. From these datasets, we observe that changing the microwave control lines from coaxial cables to flexible stripline transmission lines does not have a measurable effect on coherence compared to thermal cycling the system or random coherence fluctuations. Our results open up the possibility of large-scale integration of qubit control lines with integrated component with planar layouts on flexible substrate.

TI Advantages and limitations of channel multiplexing for discrete-variable
   entanglement-based quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Typically practical realizations of discrete-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, based on exchanging single-photon signals between the trusted parties, can provide its users with only very low key generation rates. One of the potential solutions for this problem, that can be adapted for the case of entanglement-based QKD schemes using broadband photon-pair sources, is to utilize wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) modules in order to split the photons with different wavelengths to separate detection channels and generate multiple keys in parallel. Here, we theoretically investigate this idea in the case of pulsed laser used to pump spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. We optimize the effective phase-matching function width of the nonlinear crystal, and the intensity and duration of the pump laser pulses in order to maximize the advantage of the overall key generation rate provided by the WDM-based QKD scheme over the traditional no-WDM scenario. The results of our analysis show that the considered method can significantly accelerate the production of cryptographic keys, but proper optimization of the photon-pair source is needed to exploit its full potential.

TI Minimising surface code failures using a color code decoder
SO QUANTUM
AB The development of practical, highthe resource cost of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we propose a decoder for the surface code that finds lowweight correction operators for errors produced by the depolarising noise model. The decoder is obtained by mapping the syndrome of the surface code onto that of the color code, thereby allowing us to adopt more sophisticated graph-based decoding protocols used for the color code. Analytical arguments and exhaustive testing show that the resulting decoder can find a least-weight correction for all weight d/2 depolarising errors for even code distance d. This improves the logical error rate by an exponential factor O(2d/2) compared with decoders that treat bit-flip and strate this improvement with analytical arguments and supporting numerical simulations at low error rates. Of independent interest, we also demonstrate an exponenaffecting the color code compared with gorithms.

TI Quantum-Classical Coexistence in Multi-Band Optical Networks: A Noise
   Analysis of QKD
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB In this letter, we propose to implement quantum key distribution (QKD) by using a multi-band strategy. We present a thorough noise analysis of quantum-classical coexistence while incorporating all relevant and precise noise parameters. Our research demonstrates that utilizing the entire extended C-band for quantum and transmitting classical channels (CChs) over the extended L-band with bandwidth of 75 GHz and power of 0 dBm yields no quantum communication beyond 13 km. To address the problem, we utilize the C+L-band to serve CChs and other bands (e.g., O, E, S) for quantum channels (QChs), while taking into account impairments over the quantum one. Results indicate that, while C+L-band is fully loaded, wavelengths of 1381 nm and below (1260-1381 nm) are appropriate for quantum signals, with 1381 nm offering the highest key rate (3.08 Mbit/sec) over a fiber length of 70 km. Finally, to explore an additional operational scenario when the network is not fully loaded, we focused on determining the optimal policy for assigning CChs. The results reveal the importance of prioritizing the maximization of the gap between the CChs and QChs. In addition, the channel assignment pattern of CChs affects the performance of QChs transmitted at other bands (O, E, and S).

TI Composable finite-size security of high-dimensional
   quantum-key-distribution protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Practical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links; however, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses have been limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks, restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that uses only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional yet impractical "one-shot" key rates, we provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial under rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered in free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.

TI Quantified effects of the laser-seeding attack in quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables private communications with information-theoretic security. To guarantee the practical security of QKD, it is essential that QKD systems are implemented in accordance with theoretical requirements and are robust with regard to side-channel attacks. Here we study a prominent attack on QKD transmitters known as the laser-seeding attack (LSA). It consists in injecting photons into the laser of the transmitter in an attempt to modify the outgoing light in some way that is beneficial to the eavesdropper. In this work we measure the response of a QKD transmitter to the LSA as a function of the optical power injected, allowing us to quantify the level of optical attenuation required to mitigate the attack. Further, we use a laser-rate-equation model to numerically simulate the effects of the LSA on a gain-switched laser. With this model we are able to reproduce previous experimental results, as well as generate new insight into the LSA by examining the effects of the LSA when the QKD transmitter is operated with different laser current driving parameters.

TI Dynamic attenuation scheme in measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution over turbulent channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) offers great security in practice because it removes all detector side channels. However, conducting MDI QKD over free-space channels is challenging. One of the largest culprits is the mismatched transmittance of the two independent turbulent channels causing a reduced Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility and thus a lower secret key rate. Here we introduce a dynamic attenuation scheme, where the transmittance of each of the two channels is monitored in real time by transmitting bright light pulses from each users to the measurement device. Based on the measured channel transmittance, a suitable amount of attenuation is introduced to the low-loss channel at the measurement device. Our simulation results show a significant improvement of QKD performance, especially when using short raw keys.

AB The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result by Chia, Gilyen, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can be efficiently "dequantized" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
   We first show how to efficiently "dequantize", with arbitrarily small constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state) can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum setting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make progress on the central quantum PCP conjecture.

TI Relative-belief inference in quantum information theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce the framework of Bayesian relative belief that directly evaluates whether or not the experimental data at hand support a given hypothesis regarding a quantum system by directly comparing the prior and posterior probabilities for the hypothesis. In model-dimension certification tasks, we show that the relative-belief procedure typically chooses Hilbert spaces that are never smaller in dimension than those selected from optimizing a broad class of information criteria, including Akaike's criterion. As a concrete and focused exposition of this powerful evidence-based technique, we apply the relative-belief procedure to an important application: state reconstruction of imperfect quantum sources. In particular, just by comparing prior and posterior probabilities based on data, we demonstrate its capability of tracking multiphoton emissions using (realistically lossy) singlephoton detectors in order to assess the actual quality of photon sources without making ad hoc assumptions, thereby reliably safeguarding source integrity for general quantum-information and communication tasks with Bayesian reasoning. Finally, we discuss how relative belief can be exploited to carry out parametric model certification and estimate the total dimension of the quantum state for the combined (measured) physical and interacting external systems described by the Tavis-Cummings model.

TI Scalable Measures of Magic Resource for Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Nonstabilizerness or magic resource characterizes the amount of non-Clifford operations needed to prepare quantum states. It is a crucial resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. However, quantifying magic resource beyond a few qubits has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce efficient measures of magic resource for pure quantum states with a sampling cost that is independent of the number of qubits. Our method uses Bell measurements over two copies of a state, which we implement in experiment together with a cost-free error-mitigation scheme. We show the transition of classically simulable stabilizer states into intractable quantum states on the IonQ quantum computer. For applications, we efficiently distinguish stabilizer and nonstabilizer states with low measurement cost even in the presence of experimental noise. Further, we propose a variational quantum algorithm to maximize our measure via the shift rule. Our algorithm can be free of barren plateaus even for highly expressible variational circuits. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate a Bell-measurement protocol for the stabilizer Renyi entropy as well as the Wallach-Meyer entanglement measure. Our results pave the way to understanding the nonclassical power of quantum computers, quantum simulators, and quantum many-body systems.

TI Stochastic collision model approach to transport phenomena in quantum

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Noise-assisted transport phenomena highlight the nontrivial interplay between environmental effects and quantum coherence in achieving maximal efficiency. Due to the complexity of biochemical systems and their environments, effective open quantum system models capable of providing physical insights on the presence and role of quantum effects are highly needed. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that combines an effective quantum microscopic description with a classical stochastic one. Our stochastic collision model (SCM) describes both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics without relying on the weak coupling assumption. We investigate the consequences of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of noise on transport efficiency in a fully connected graph and in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our approach shows how to meaningfully formulate questions, and provide answers, on important open issues such as the properties of optimal noise and the emergence of the network structure as a result of an evolutionary process.

TI Fabrication of surface ion traps with integrated current carrying wires
   enabling high magnetic field gradients
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A major challenge for quantum computers is the scalable simultaneous execution of quantum gates. One approach to address this in trapped ion quantum computers is the implementation of quantum gates based on static magnetic field gradients and global microwave fields. In this paper, we present the fabrication of surface ion traps with integrated copper current carrying wires embedded inside the substrate below the ion trap electrodes, capable of generating high magnetic field gradients. The copper layer's measured sheet resistance of 1.12 m Omega/sq at room temperature is sufficiently low to incorporate complex designs, without excessive power dissipation at high currents causing a thermal runaway. At a temperature of 40 K the sheet resistance drops to 20.9 mu Omega/sq giving a lower limit for the residual resistance ratio of 100. Continuous currents of 13 A can be applied, resulting in a simulated magnetic field gradient of 144 T m(-1) at the ion position, which is 125 mu m from the trap surface for the particular anti-parallel wire pair in our design.

TI Equilibration and "Thermalization" in the Adapted Caldeira-Leggett Model
SO ENTROPY
AB I explore the processes of equilibration exhibited by the Adapted Caldeira-Leggett (ACL) model, a small unitary "toy model" developed for numerical studies of quantum decoherence between an SHO and an environment. I demonstrate how dephasing allows equilibration to occur in a wide variety of situations. While the finite model size and other "unphysical" aspects prevent the notions of temperature and thermalization from being generally applicable, certain primitive aspects of thermalization can be realized for particular parameter values. I link the observed behaviors to intrinsic properties of the global energy eigenstates, and argue that the phenomena I observe contain elements which might be key ingredients that lead to ergodic behavior in larger more realistic systems. The motivations for this work range from curiosity about phenomena observed in earlier calculations with the ACL model to much larger questions related to the nature of equilibrium, thermalization, and the emergence of physical laws.

AB In this study, we investigate Quantum Long Short-Term Memory and Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit integrated with Variational Quantum Circuits in modeling complex dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, coupled oscillators, and the Lorenz system. We implement these advanced quantum machine learning techniques and compare their performance with traditional Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models. The results of our study reveal that the quantum-based models deliver superior precision and more stable loss metrics throughout 100 epochs for both the Van der Pol oscillator and coupled harmonic oscillators, and 20 epochs for the Lorenz system. The Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit outperforms competing models, showcasing notable performance metrics. For the Van der Pol oscillator, it reports MAE 0.0902 and RMSE 0.1031 for variable x and MAE 0.1500 and RMSE 0.1943 for y; for coupled oscillators, Oscillator 1 shows MAE 0.2411 and RMSE 0.2701 and Oscillator 2 MAE is 0.0482 and RMSE 0.0602; and for the Lorenz system, the results are MAE 0.4864 and RMSE 0.4971 for x, MAE 0.4723 and RMSE 0.4846 for y, and MAE 0.4555 and RMSE 0.4745 for z.

TI Thermodynamics and Inflammation: Insights into Quantum Biology and
   Ageing
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Inflammation as a biological concept has been around a long time and derives from the Latin "to set on fire" and refers to the redness and heat, and usually swelling, which accompanies injury and infection. Chronic inflammation is also associated with ageing and is described by the term "inflammaging". Likewise, the biological concept of hormesis, in the guise of what "does not kill you, makes you stronger", has long been recognized, but in contrast, seems to have anti-inflammatory and age-slowing characteristics. As both phenomena act to restore homeostasis, they may share some common underlying principles. Thermodynamics describes the relationship between heat and energy, but is also intimately related to quantum mechanics. Life can be viewed as a series of self-renewing dissipative structures existing far from equilibrium as vortexes of "negentropy" that ages and dies; but, through reproduction and speciation, new robust structures are created, enabling life to adapt and continue in response to ever changing environments. In short, life can be viewed as a natural consequence of thermodynamics to dissipate energy to restore equilibrium; each component of this system is replaceable. However, at the molecular level, there is perhaps a deeper question: is life dependent on, or has it enhanced, quantum effects in space and time beyond those normally expected at the atomistic scale and temperatures that life operates at? There is some evidence it has. Certainly, the dissipative adaptive mechanism described by thermodynamics is now being extended into the quantum realm. Fascinating though this topic is, does exploring the relationship between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and biology give us a greater insight into ageing and, thus, medicine? It could be said that hormesis and inflammation are expressions of thermodynamic and quantum principles that control ageing via natural selection that could operate at all scales of life. Inflammation could be viewed as a mechanism to remove inefficient systems in response to stress to enable rebuilding of more functional dissipative structures, and hormesis as the process describing the ability to adapt; underlying this is the manipulation of fundamental quantum principles. Defining what "quantum biological normality" is has been a long-term problem, but perhaps we do not need to, as it is simply an expression of one end of the normal quantum mechanical spectrum, implying that biology could inform us as to how we can define the quantum world.

TI Entanglement Dynamics Induced by a Squeezed Coherent Cavity Coupled
   Nonlinearly with a Qubit and Filled with a Kerr-Like Medium
SO ENTROPY
AB An analytical solution for a master equation describing the dynamics of a qubit interacting with a nonlinear Kerr-like cavity through intensity-dependent coupling is established. A superposition of squeezed coherent states is propped as the initial cavity field. The dynamics of the entangled qubit-cavity states are explored by negativity for different deformed function of the intensity-dependent coupling. We have examined the effects of the Kerr-like nonlinearity and the qubit-cavity detuning as well as the phase cavity damping on the generated entanglement. The intensity-dependent coupling increases the sensitivity of the generated entanglement to the phase-damping. The stability and the strength of the entanglement are controlled by the Kerr-like nonlinearity, the qubit-cavity detuning, and the initial cavity non-classicality. These physical parameters enhance the robustness of the qubit-cavity entanglement against the cavity phase-damping. The high initial cavity non-classicality enhances the robustness of the qubit-cavity entanglement against the phase-damping effect.

TI A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network Model for DDoS Attack
   Detection in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks
SO INFORMATION
AB A typical Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) is open to various cyberattacks because of its centralized controller-based framework. A cyberattack, such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, can easily overload the central SDVN controller. Thus, we require a functional DDoS attack recognition system that can differentiate malicious traffic from normal data traffic. The proposed architecture comprises hybrid Classical-Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods for detecting DDoS threats. In this work, we have considered three different QML methods, such as Classical-Quantum Neural Networks (C-QNN), Classical-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (C-QBM), and Classical-Quantum K-Means Clustering (C-QKM). Emulations were conducted using a custom-built vehicular network with random movements and varying speeds between 0 and 100 kmph. Also, the performance of these QML methods was analyzed for two different datasets. The results obtained show that the hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network (C-QNN) method exhibited better performance in comparison with the other two models. The proposed hybrid C-QNN model achieved an accuracy of 99% and 90% for the UNB-CIC-DDoS dataset and Kaggle DDoS dataset, respectively. The hybrid C-QNN model combines PennyLane's quantum circuits with traditional methods, whereas the Classical-Quantum Boltzmann Machine (C-QBM) leverages quantum probability distributions for identifying anomalies.

TI Engineering Dissipation with Resistive Elements in Circuit Quantum
   Electrodynamics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The importance of dissipation engineering ranges from universal quantum computation to non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics. In recent years, more and more theoretical and experimental studies have shown the relevance of this topic for circuit quantum electrodynamics, one of the major platforms in the race for a quantum computer. This article discusses how to simulate thermal baths by inserting resistive elements in networks of superconducting qubits. Apart from pedagogically reviewing the phenomenological and microscopic models of a resistor as thermal bath with Johnson-Nyquist noise, the paper introduces some new results in the weak coupling limit, showing that the most common examples of open quantum systems can be simulated through capacitively coupled superconducting qubits and resistors. The aim of the manuscript, written with a broad audience in mind, is to be both an instructive tutorial about how to derive and characterize the Hamiltonian of general dissipative superconducting circuits with capacitive coupling, and a review of the most relevant and topical theoretical and experimental works focused on resistive elements and dissipation engineering.

TI Quantum variational rewinding for gravitational wave detection
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Gravitational waves carry information about far away phenomena which astronomers can use to form a better picture of the universe. Over the past few years, numerous gravitational waves have been detected using a method called matched filtering; however, this approach has two main drawbacks. First, it requires knowledge of the sought-after waveform beforehand. Second, it is infeasible for gravitational wave searches which are precise or cover a long time span. While attempts have been made to use classical machine learning to overcome these difficulties, the usage of quantum machine learning in this context is relatively unexplored. Quantum variational rewinding is a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithm for time series anomaly detection. This work makes the first steps in investigating its potential for gravitational wave detection. Training and testing the algorithm was done without depending on synthetic data. In a noiseless simulated environment, quantum variational rewinding was able to pick out all confirmed gravitational wave signals from the background noise of a detector with perfect accuracy when filtering was applied before hand and was able to do so to a high degree of success without filtering. Anomaly detection with this algorithm was performed with two signals on quantum hardware as a proof of concept. Using Fisher information, both the capacity and the trainability of quantum variational rewinding are described so that future approaches can be compared in these regards. With new gravitational wave detectors under development, even more data will be generated for analysis in the future, compounding the existing bottlenecks in the search pipeline. As such, approaches which help tackle issues with the current approach to gravitational wave analysis are in demand, and the empirical results from this work assert that quantum computing should not be overlooked in this process.

AB Conventional many-body quantum systems thermalize under their own dynamics, losing information about their initial configurations to the environment. However, it is known that a strong disorder results in many-body localization (MBL). A closed quantum systems with MBL retains local information even in the presence of interactions. Here, we numerically study the propagation and scrambling of quantum information of a closed system in the MBL phase from an information theoretic perspective. By simulating the dynamics and equilibration of the temporal mutual information for long times, we see that it can distinguish between MBL and ergodic phases.

TI Nanoelectromechanical Control of Spin-Photon Interfaces in a Hybrid
   Quantum System on Chip
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Color centers (CCs) in nanostructured diamond are promising for optically linked quantum technologies. Scaling to useful applications motivates architectures meeting the following criteria: C1 individual optical addressing of spin qubits; C2 frequency tuning of spin-dependent optical transitions; C3 coherent spin control; C4 active photon routing; C5 scalable manufacturability; and C6 low on-chip power dissipation for cryogenic operations. Here, we introduce an architecture that simultaneously achieves C1-C6. We realize piezoelectric strain control of diamond waveguide-coupled tin vacancy centers with ultralow power dissipation necessary. The DC response of our device allows emitter transition tuning by over 20 GHz, combined with low-power AC control. We show acoustic spin resonance of integrated tin vacancy spins and estimate single-phonon coupling rates over 1 kHz in the resolved sideband regime. Combined with high-speed optical routing, our work opens a path to scalable single-qubit control with optically mediated entangling gates.

SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we have reinvestigated probabilistic quantum communication protocols and developed a nontraditional remote state preparation protocol that allows for deterministically transferring information encoded in quantum states using a non-maximally entangled channel. With an auxiliary particle and a simple measurement method, the success probability of preparing a d-dimensional quantum state is increased to 1 without spending additional quantum resources in advance to improve quantum channels, such as entanglement purification. Furthermore, we have designed a feasible experimental scheme to demonstrate the deterministic paradigm of transporting a polarization-encoded photon from one location to another using a generalized entangled state. This approach provides a practical method to address decoherence and environmental noises in actual quantum communication.

TI A measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution network using

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), which promises secure key exchange between two remote parties, is now moving toward the realization of scalable and secure QKD networks (QNs). Fully connected, trusted node-free QNs have been realized based on entanglement distribution, in which the low key rate and the large overhead make their practical application challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fully connected multi-user QKD network based on a wavelength-multiplexed measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD protocol. By combining the MDI-QKD protocol with integrated optical frequency combs, we achieve an average secure key rate of 267 bits per second for about 30 dB of link attenuation per user pair-more than three orders of magnitude higher than previous entanglement-based works. More importantly, we realize communication between two different pairs of users simultaneously. Our work paves the way for the realization of large-scale QKD networks with full connectivity and simultaneous communication capability among multiple users.

TI Design and fabrication of robust hybrid photonic crystal cavities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Heterogeneously integrated hybrid photonic crystal cavities enable strong light-matter interactions with solid state, optically addressable quantum memories. A key challenge to realizing high quality factor (Q) hybrid photonic crystals is the reduced index contrast on the substrate compared to suspended devices in air. This challenge is particularly acute for color centers in diamond because of diamond's high refractive index, which leads to increased scattering loss into the substrate. Here, we develop a design methodology for hybrid photonic crystals utilizing a detailed understanding of substrate-mediated loss, which incorporates sensitivity to fabrication errors as a critical parameter. Using this methodology, we design robust, high-Q, GaAs-on-diamond photonic crystal cavities, and by optimizing our fabrication procedure, we experimentally realize cavities with Q approaching 30,000 at a resonance wavelength of 955 nm.

AB We present an experimental study of the coherence properties of a single heavy-hole spin qubit formed in one quantum dot of a gated GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot device. We use a modified spin-readout latching technique in which the second quantum dot serves both as an auxiliary element for a fast spin-dependent readout within a 200 ns time window and as a register for storing the spin-state information. To manipulate the single-spin qubit, we apply sequences of microwave bursts of various amplitudes and durations to make Rabi, Ramsey, Hahn-echo, and CPMG measurements. As a result of the qubit manipulation protocols combined with the latching spin readout, we determine and discuss the achieved qubit coherence times: T-1, T-Rabi, T-2*, and T-2(CPMG) vs. microwave excitation amplitude, detuning, and additional relevant parameters.

TI Quantum correlation propagation in a waveguide-QED system with
   long-range interaction
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the excitation and correlation propagations among a one-dimensional atom chain with exponentially decaying, ideal long-range, and power-law decaying interactions. We show that although a clear light-cone-like structure can appear in both the excitation and correlation propagation patterns under the exponentially decaying interaction, only an obscure light-cone-like structure appears with multi-power-law decaying interaction and surprisingly an inverse light-cone-like structure appears in the ideal long-range interaction case. The extracted excitation and correlation propagation velocities in the ideal long-range interaction case are about one order of magnitude larger than those in the multi-power-law interaction case and about two orders of magnitude larger than those in the short-range interaction case. These results indicate that the waveguide-quantum electrodynamics system with long-range interaction can boost the quantum information transfer speed and is beneficial for building fast quantum network and scalable quantum computer.

TI Coupling a high-Q resonator to a spin qubit with all-electrical control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Building a practical quantum processor involves integrating millions of physical qubits along with the necessary components for individual qubit manipulation and readout. Arrays of gated silicon spins offer a promising route toward achieving this goal. Optimized radio frequency resonators with high internal quality factor are based on superconducting inductors and enable fast spin readout. All-electrical spin control and gate-dispersive readout remove the need for additional device components and simplify scaling. However, superconducting high-Q tank circuits are susceptible to crosstalk-induced ringup from electrical qubit control pulses, which causes fluctuations of the quantum dot potential and is suspected to degrade qubit performance. Here, we report on the coherent and all-electrical control of a hole spin qubit at 1.5 K, integrated into a silicon fin field-effect transistor and connected to a niobium nitride nanowire inductor gate-sensor. Our experiments show that qubit control pulses with their broad range of higher harmonics ring up the tank when the control pulse spectrum overlaps with the tank resonance. This can cause a reduction of the readout visibility if the tank ringing amplitude exceeds the excited state splitting of the quantum dot, lifting Pauli spin blockade and thus leading to state preparation and measurement errors. We demonstrate how to circumvent these effects by engineering control pulses around the tank resonances. Importantly, we find that the ringup does not limit the spin coherence time, indicating that efficient high-Q resonators in gate-sensing are compatible with all-electrical spin control.

TI Entanglement Hamiltonian tomography in quantum simulation
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entanglement is central to theories of quantum many-body systems but is very resource intensive to measure. A protocol based on a quasilocal parametrization of physical states allows entanglement structures to be studied using very few measurements.
   Entanglement is the crucial ingredient of quantum many-body physics, and characterizing and quantifying entanglement in the closed-system dynamics of quantum simulators remains a challenge in today's era of intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here we discuss an efficient tomographic protocol for reconstructing reduced density matrices and entanglement spectra for spin systems. The key step is a parametrization of the reduced density matrix in terms of an entanglement Hamiltonian involving only quasilocal few-body terms. This ansatz is fitted to, and can be independently verified from, a small number of randomized measurements. By analysing data from trapped-ion quantum simulators for quench dynamics of a one-dimensional long-range Ising model, we demonstrate the ability of the protocol to measure the time evolution of the entanglement spectrum, in agreement with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, we develop the protocol as a testbed for predictions of entanglement structure in quantum field theories, which we illustrate for conformal field theory in quench dynamics, as well as the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem for ground states. In theoretical simulations, we demonstrate favourable scaling of sampling efficiency with subsystem size. Although the post-processing might ultimately be exponential, our protocol addresses the bottleneck of exponential sampling complexity in the investigation of entanglement structure in quantum simulation, and brings subsystems of tens of spins into reach for present experiments

TI Quantum Borrmann effect for dissipation-immune photon-photon
   correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study theoretically the second-order correlation function g((2))(t) for photons transmitted through a periodic Bragg-spaced array of superconducting qubits, coupled to a waveguide. We demonstrate that photon bunching and antibunching persist much longer than both radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of a single qubit. Due to the Borrmann effect, that is a strongly non-Markovian collective feature of light-qubit coupling inherent to the Bragg regime, the photon-photon correlations become immune to nonradiative dissipation. This persistence of quantum correlations opens new avenues for enhancing the performance of setups of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

TI Long-distance coupling of spin qubits via topological magnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider two distant spin qubits in quantum dots, both coupled to a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet hosting chiral magnon edge states at the boundary. The chiral magnon is used to mediate entanglement between the spin qubits, realizing a fundamental building block of scalable quantum computing architectures: a long-distance two-qubit gate. Previous proposals for long-distance coupling with magnons involved off-resonant coupling, where the detuning of the spin-qubit frequency from the magnonic band edge provides protection against spontaneous relaxation. The topological magnon mode, on the other hand, lies in between two magnonic bands far away from any bulk magnon resonances, facilitating strong and highly tuneable coupling between the two spin qubits. Even though the coupling between the qubit and the chiral magnon is resonant for a wide range of qubit splittings, we find that the magnon-induced qubit relaxation is vastly suppressed if the coupling between the qubit and the ferromagnet is antiferromagnetic. A fast and high-fidelity long-distance coupling protocol is presented capable of achieving spin-qubit entanglement over micrometer distances with 1MHz gate speed and up to 99.9% fidelities. The resulting spin-qubit entanglement may be used as a probe for the long-sought detection of topological edge magnons.

TI Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long timescales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.

AB We study a nanoelectromechanical system consisting of a Cooper pair box qubit performing nanomechanical vibrations between two bulk superconductors. We demonstrate that a bias voltage applied to the superconductors may generate states represented by entanglement between qubit states and quantum 'cat states', i.e. a superposition of the coherent states of the nanomechanical oscillator. We characterize the formation and development of such states in terms of the corresponding Wigner function and entropy of entanglement. Also, we propose an experimentally feasible detection scheme for the effect, in which the average current that attains the specific features created by the entanglement is measured.

TI Single-spin qubit magnetic spectroscopy of two-dimensional
   superconductivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A single-spin qubit placed near the surface of a conductor acquires an additional contribution to its 1/T-1 relaxation rate due to magnetic noise created by electric current fluctuations in the material. We analyze this technique as a wireless probe of superconductivity in atomically thin two-dimensional materials. At temperatures T less than or similar to T-c, the dominant contribution to the qubit relaxation rate is due to transverse electric current fluctuations arising from quasiparticle excitations. We demonstrate that this method enables detection of metal-to-superconductor transitions, as well as investigation of the symmetry of the superconducting gap function, through the noise scaling with temperature. We show that scaling of the noise with sample-probe distance provides a window into the nonlocal quasistatic conductivity of superconductors, both clean and disordered. At low temperatures the quasiparticle fluctuations get suppressed, yet the noise can be substantial due to resonant contributions from collective longitudinal modes, such as plasmons in monolayers and Josephson plasmons in bilayers. Potential experimental implications are discussed.

TI A Josephson junction with h-BN tunnel barrier: observation of low
   critical current noise
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Decoherence in quantum bits (qubits) is a major challenge for realizing scalable quantum computing. One of the primary causes of decoherence in qubits and quantum circuits based on superconducting Josephson junctions is the critical current fluctuation. Many efforts have been devoted to suppressing the critical current fluctuation in Josephson junctions. Nonetheless, the efforts have been hindered by the defect-induced trapping states in oxide-based tunnel barriers and the interfaces with superconductors in the traditional Josephson junctions. Motivated by this, along with the recent demonstration of 2D insulator h-BN with exceptional crystallinity and low defect density, we fabricated a vertical NbSe2/h-BN/Nb Josephson junction consisting of a bottom NbSe2 superconductor thin layer and a top Nb superconductor spaced by an atomically thin h-BN layer. We further characterized the superconducting current and voltage (I-V) relationships and Fraunhofer pattern of the NbSe2/h-BN/Nb junction. Notably, we demonstrated the critical current noise (1/f noise power) in the h-BN-based Josephson device is at least a factor of four lower than that of the previously studied aluminum oxide-based Josephson junctions. Our work offers a strong promise of h-BN as a novel tunnel barrier for high-quality Josephson junctions and qubit applications.

TI Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and
   correlations*
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.

TI Digit quantum simulation of a fermion field in an expanding universe
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with nonequilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered, and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter decomposition, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time evolution problems.

TI Entanglement dynamics in anti-PT-symmetric systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the past years, many efforts have been made to study various noteworthy phenomena in both parity-time (PT) and anti-parity-time (APT) symmetric systems. However, entanglement dynamics in APT-symmetric systems has not previously been investigated in both theory and experiments. Here, we investigate the entan-glement evolution of two qubits in an APT-symmetric system. In the APT-symmetric unbroken regime, our theoretical simulations demonstrate the periodic oscillations of entanglement when each qubit evolves identically, while the nonperiodic oscillations of entanglement when each qubit evolves differently. In particular, when each qubit evolves near the exceptional point in the APT-symmetric unbroken regime, there exist entanglement sudden vanishing and revival. Moreover, our simulations demonstrate rapid decay and delayed death of entanglement provided one qubit evolves in the APT-symmetric broken regime. In this work, we also perform an experiment with a linear optical setup. The experimental results agree well with our theoretical simulation results. Our findings reveal novel phenomena of entanglement evolution in the APT-symmetric system and opens a new direction for future studies on the dynamics of quantum entanglement in multiqubit APT-symmetric systems or other non-Hermitian quantum systems.

TI Realizing symmetry-protected topological phases in a spin-1/2 chain with
   next-nearest-neighbor hopping on superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation on near-term quantum hardware is a topic of intense interest. The preparation of novel quantum states of matter provides a quantitative assessment of the capabilities of near-term digital quantum computers to implement circuits with structure of relevance to quantum simulation. Here, we conduct a benchmark study by realizing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of a spin-1/2 Hamiltonian with next-nearest-neighbor hopping on up to 11 qubits on a programmable superconducting quantum processor using adiabatic state preparation. Using recompilation techniques to reduce the gate count to around 50 two-qubit gates, we observe clear signatures of the two distinct SPT phases, such as excitations localized to specific edges and finite string-order parameters. We identify a parasitic phase associated with the two-qubit gate as the dominant imperfection that limits the depth of the circuits, indicating a research topic of interest for future hardware development.

TI PHOTON STATISTICS AND NON-LOCAL PROPERTIES OF A TWO-QUBIT-FIELD SYSTEM
   IN THE EXCITED NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB In this paper, a quantum scheme for a two-qubit system (2QS) and field initially prepared in the excited negative binomial distribution is presented. The field photon statistics is detected from the evolution of the Mandel parameter, while the evolution of von Neumann entropy detects the nonlocal correlation between the 2QS and radiation field. The concurrence is used to detect the qubit-qubit entanglement during the time evolution. The dynamical properties of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum Fisher information are investigated. We visualize the number of photon excitations on the field in negative binomial states with influence of photon success probability. A connection is provided between the dynamical behaviors of these statistical quantities. We have found that the proposed quantities are strongly influenced by the number of excited photons of the field in negative binomial states and photon success probability.

TI Identification of Different Types of High-Frequency Defects in
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Parasitic two-level-system (TLS) defects are one of the major factors limiting the coherence times of superconducting qubits. Although there has been significant progress in characterizing basic parameters of TLS defects, exact mechanisms of interactions between a qubit and various types of TLS defects remained largely unexplored due to the lack of experimental techniques able to probe the form of qubit-defect couplings. Here we present an experimental method of TLS defect spectroscopy using a strong qubit drive that allowed us to distinguish between various types of qubit-defect interactions. By applying this method to a capacitively shunted flux qubit, we detected a rare type of TLS defect with a nonlinear qubit-defect coupling due to critical-current fluctuations, as well as conventional TLS defects with a linear coupling to the qubit caused by charge fluctuations. The presented approach could become the routine method for high-frequency defect inspection and quality control in superconducting qubit fabrication, providing essential feedback for fabrication process optimization. The reported method is a powerful tool to uniquely identify the type of noise fluctuations caused by TLS defects, enabling the development of realistic noise models relevant to noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing and fault-tolerant quantum control.

TI A geometric formulation to measure global and genuine entanglement in
   three-qubit systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We introduce a purely geometric formulation for two different measures addressed to quantify the entanglement between different parts of a tripartite qubit system. Our approach considers the entanglement-polytope defined by the smallest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the qubit-components. The measures identify global and genuine entanglement, and are respectively associated with the projection and rejection of a given point of the polytope on the corresponding biseparable segments. Solving the so called 'inverse problem', we also discuss a way to force the system to behave in a particular form, which opens the possibility of controlling and manipulating entanglement for practical purposes.

AB Current strategies for quantum software development still exhibit complexity on top of the already-intricate nature of quantum mechanics. Quantum programming languages are either restricted to low-level, gate-based operations appended to classical objects for circuit generation, or require modelling of quantum state transformations in Hilbert space through algebraic representation.
   This paper presents the Quff language which is a high-level, dynamically typed quantum-classical programming language. The Quff compiler and runtitne system facilitates quantum software development with high-level expression abstracted across the quantum-classical paradigms. Quff is constructed on top of the Truffle framework which aids the implementation and efficiency of the stack, while reusing the JVM infrastructure. The presented comparisons display that Quff lends itself as an effective, easy-to-use solution for the development of executable quantum programs with automatic circuit generation and efficient computation.

TI Quantum sensing of weak electric and magnetic fields by coherent
   amplification of energy-level-shift effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A method for measuring small energy level shifts in a qubit by coherent amplification of their effect is proposed. It is based on the repeated application of the same interaction pulse in two manners: with the same phase of each subsequent pulse, and with an alternating phase shift of pi (i.e., a minus sign) from pulse to pulse. Two specific types of pulses are considered: a resonant pi pulse and an adiabatic chirped pulse, both of which produce population inversion with high fidelity. In the presence of a weak ambient external electric or magnetic field, the ensuing Stark or Zeeman shift leads to an energy level shift and hence a static detuning. In both the resonant and adiabatic approaches, a small level shift does not alter the transition probability very much; however, it can significantly change the dynamical phases in the propagator. The repeated application of the same pulse greatly amplifies the changes in the dynamical phases and maps them onto the populations. Hence the effect of the level shift can be measured with good accuracy. It is found that sequences of pulses with alternating phases deliver much greater error amplification and much steeper excitation profiles around resonance, thereby providing much higher sensitivity to small energy level shifts. Explicit analytic estimates of the sensitivity are derived using the well-known noncrossing Rosen-Zener and Rabi models and the level-crossing Demkov-Kunike model. This recipe provides a simple tool for rapid and accurate sensing of weak electric and magnetic fields by using the same pulse generating an inversion quantum gate, without sophisticated tomography or entangling operations.

TI Quantum Simulation of the Two-Dimensional Weyl Equation in a Magnetic

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulation of 1D relativistic quantum mechanics has been achieved in well-controlled systems like trapped ions, but properties like spin dynamics and response to external magnetic fields that appear only in higher dimensions remain unexplored. Here we simulate the dynamics of a 2D Weyl particle. We show the linear dispersion relation of the free particle and the discrete Landau levels in a magnetic field, and we explicitly measure the spatial and spin dynamics from which the conservation of helicity and properties of antiparticles can be verified. Our work extends the application of an ion trap quantum simulator in particle physics with the additional spatial and spin degrees of freedom.

TI Experimental Quantum Message Authentication with Single Qubit Unitary
   Operation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We have developed a quantum message authentication protocol that provides authentication and integrity of an original message using single qubit unitary operations. Our protocol mainly consists of two parts: quantum encryption and a correspondence check. The quantum encryption part is implemented using linear combinations of wave plates, and the correspondence check is performed using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. By analyzing the coincidence counts of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, we have successfully proven the proposed protocol experimentally, and also showed its robustness against an existential forgery.

TI Interplay of Connectivity and Unwanted Physical Interactions Within the
   Architecture of the D-Wave 2000Q Chimera Processor
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB We consider dynamics relevant to annealing in qubit networks modelled on the architecture of the D-Wave 2000Q quantum processor (known as the Chimera topology). Our results report on the effects of the qubits' connectivity and variable coupling strengths (based on physical interactions) on the dynamics of network. The networks we examine are up to 32 qubits in size and include coupling lengths varying by almost an order of magnitude. We show that while information transfer within the network can be strongly affected by the different interactions, the system maintains similar clusters of qubits with comparable fidelities even in the presence of some of the physical interactions. This suggests an intrinsic robustness of the Chimera topology to these perturbations, even if it includes such a variety of coupling lengths. Moreover, a similar clustering geometry was observed for other qubit properties in previous analysis of actual data from D-Wave 2000Q. This comparable behaviour suggests that the real quantum annealing chip is subject to little or no unwanted effects due to interactions that scale with the coupling lengths. This could be due to absence of the most damaging type of physical interactions and/or to D-Wave calibration methods tuning the control lines such that the couplings perform as if there is no effect due to their physical length. Our results are also relevant to the use of chaining for the creation of logical qubits. They show that even with very strong interactions between the chain, significant unwanted perturbations may occur due to the inhomogeneous fidelities of the overall dynamics and inhomogeneous dynamics should be expected for any given algorithm.

TI Quantum systems in silicon carbide for sensing applications
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB This paper summarizes recent studies identifying key qubit systems in silicon carbide (SiC) for quantum sensing of magnetic, electric fields, and temperature at the nano and microscale. The properties of colour centres in SiC, that can be used for quantum sensing, are reviewed with a focus on paramagnetic colour centres and their spin Hamiltonians describing Zeeman splitting, Stark effect, and hyperfine interactions. These properties are then mapped onto various methods for their initialization, control, and read-out. We then summarised methods used for a spin and charge state control in various colour centres in SiC. These properties and methods are then described in the context of quantum sensing applications in magnetometry, thermometry, and electrometry. Current state-of-the art sensitivities are compiled and approaches to enhance the sensitivity are proposed. The large variety of methods for control and read-out, combined with the ability to scale this material in integrated photonics chips operating in harsh environments, places SiC at the forefront of future quantum sensing technology based on semiconductors.

TI Trainable PQC-Based QRAM for Quantum Storage
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a new domain of Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Computing (QC) that uses a trainableVariational Quantum Circuit (VQC) to solve various learning problems. Classical data is transformed to the quantum Hilbert space using an embedding scheme and the VQC performs quantum operations on this transformed quantum data using parametric quantum gates. In this work, we present a new embedding scheme using Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that takes address as input, and gives data as the output similar to a classical Random Access Memory (RAM). We propose a basic circuit-based QRAM architecture and its application in, (a) storage for ML usage and, (b) storage of binary data. For ML, we store images of digits dataset into the QRAM and perform binary classification using a Quantum Neural Network (QNN). We observe that QNN driven by the proposed QRAM converges faster (at 6th epoch) with 100% classification accuracy compared to QNN with normal embedding and classical Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) setups which converge with same accuracy at around 10th and 15th epochs, respectively. We obtain approximate to 63% classification accuracy on real hardware from IBM. For storage of binary data, we measure Hamming Distance (HD) and percentage correct predictions for quality evaluation of the proposed QRAM. We observe that the HD and percentage correct predictions worsens as the number of address lines increases. We propose two techniques to improve the QRAM accuracy namely, (i) clustering of raw data and allocating one QRAM per cluster and, (ii) bit splitting to divide wider data into smaller chunks and allocating oneQRAMper split. Clustering provides best results by improving the HD for 9-address QRAM by approximate to 1.95X than pure QRAM and approximate to 1.74X improvement compared to bit-split (which provides approximate to 1.11X improvement than pure QRAM).

Proof-of-concept experiments have been actively conducted for application to quantum computations. This article provides a review of the mechanism of JPOs and their application as a quantum annealer.

TI Quantum Sensing of Free Radicals in Primary Human Granulosa Cells with
   Nanoscale Resolution
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Cumulus granulosa cells (cGCs) and mural granulosa cells (mGCs), although derived from the same precursors, are anatomically and functionally heterogeneous. They are critical for female fertility by supporting oocyte competence and follicular development. There are various techniques used to investigate the role of free radicals in mGCs and cCGs. Yet, temporospatial resolution remains a challenge. We used a quantum sensing approach to study free radical generation at nanoscale in cGCs and mGCs isolated from women undergoing oocyte retrieval during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Cells were incubated with bare fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) or mitochondria targeted FNDs to detect free radicals in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. After inducing oxidative stress with menadione, we continued to detect free radical generation for 30 min. We observed an increase in free radical generation in cGCs and mGCs from 10 min on. Although cytoplasmic and mitochondrial free radical levels are indistinguishable in the physiological state in both cGCs and mGCs, the free radical changes measured in mitochondria were significantly larger in both cell types, suggesting mitochondria are sites of free radical generation. Furthermore, we observed later occurrence and a smaller percentage of cytoplasmic free radical change in cGCs, indicating that cGCs may be more resistant to oxidative stress.

In this work, we study an analogous question for symmetric multiqubit states. We show that symmetric absolutely PPT (SAPPT) states (symmetric states that remain PPT after any symmetry-preserving unitary evolution) are not always symmetric absolutely separable by providing explicit counterexamples. More precisely, we construct a family of entangled five-qubit SAPPT states. Similar counterexamples for larger odd numbers of qubits are identified.

TI Reference-frame-independent measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution with imperfect sources
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Reference-frame-independent measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-MDI-QKD) can remove all potential detector side-channel attacks and the requirement of real-time alignment of reference frames. However, all previous RFI-MDI-QKD implementations assume the perfect state preparation in sources, which is impractical and may lead to security loopholes. Here, we propose an RFI-MDI-QKD protocol which is robust against state preparation flaws. Comparing to the conventional six-state RFI-MDI-QKD, our scheme can be realized with only four flawed states, which improves the practical security of RFI-MDI-QKD and simplifies the experimental implementation. In addition, simulation results demonstrate that source flaws in Z basis have adverse effect on the performance of RFI-MDI-QKD while the source flaws in X and Y bases have almost no effect. We hope that this work could provide a valuable reference for practical implementations of RFI-MDI-QKD.

TI Parameter estimation calibration of discretized polar modulation
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In experimental setups of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), the ideal Gaussian modulation will suffer from discretization and degrade into discretized polar modulation (DPM), which deteriorates the accuracy of parameter estimation and results in an overestimation of excess noise. We demonstrate that in the asymptotic case, the DPM-induced estimation bias is determined exclusively by the modulation resolutions and can be modeled as a quadratic function. To obtain an accurate estimation, a calibration on the estimated excess noise is implemented based on the closed-form expression of the quadratic bias model, while statistical analysis of the model residuals defines the upper bound of estimated excess noise and the lower bound of secret key rate. Simulation results show that when modulation variance is 25 and excess noise is 0.02, the proposed calibration scheme can eliminate an estimation bias of 14.5%, thus enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of DPM CV-QKD. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Key Distribution with Nonideal Heterodyne Detection: Composable
   Security of Discrete-Modulation Continuous-Variable Protocols
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution exploits coherent measurements of the electromagnetic field, i.e., homodyne or heterodyne detection. The most advanced security proofs developed so far have relied on idealized mathematical models for such measurements, which assume that the measurement outcomes are continuous and unbounded variables. As physical-measurement devices have a finite range and precision, these mathematical models only serve as an approximation. It is expected that, under suitable conditions, the predictions obtained using these simplified models will be in good agreement with the actual experimental implementations. However, a quantitative analysis of the error introduced by this approximation, and of its impact on composable security, have been lacking so far. Here, we present a theory to rigorously account for the experimental limitations of realistic heterodyne detection. We focus on collective attacks and present security proofs for the asymptotic and finite-size regimes, the latter being within the framework of composable security. In doing this, we establish for the first time the composable security of discrete-modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution in the finite-size regime. Tight bounds on the key rates are obtained through semidefinite programming and do not rely on a truncation of the Hilbert space.

In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree-Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.18% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Mixed Binary Optimization Applied to Transaction
   Settlement
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we extend variational quantum optimization algorithms for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems to the class of mixed binary optimization problems. This allows us to combine binary decision variables with continuous decision variables, which, for instance, enables the modeling of inequality constraints via slack variables. We propose two heuristics and introduce the transaction settlement problem to demonstrate them. Transaction settlement is defined as the exchange of securities and cash between parties and is crucial to financial market infrastructure. We test our algorithms using classical simulation as well as real quantum devices provided by IBM quantum.

TI Electric-Field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated
   Charge-Transfer Triplet State in an Organic Molecule
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues by using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10'H-spiro[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately 0.51 Hz/(V/m), which is comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.

TI Full Characterization of Genuine 17-qubit Entanglement on the
   Superconducting Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a least square state estimator regularized by state purity to accomplish the task of quantum state tomography and entanglement verification, and report an experimental validation on a superconducting processor. First, a scalable full-state tomography is achieved with state fidelity 0.8217(1) for the 9-qubit W state and 0.6817(1) for the 17-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, with the latter reaching 0.7587(1) under a pure-state assumption. Then, the presence of genuine multiqubit entanglement in the majority of generated states is conclusively certified by violating the corresponding entanglement witness. Finally, it is demonstrated that our method can achieve superior tomography accuracy with limited measurement settings and that mitigating error is essential for leveraging noisy quantum systems in quantum processing tasks. Our results pave the way for more accurate full characterization of larger-scale many-body quantum systems.

TI Pseudo-spin-orbit-coupling-based manipulation of vector beams using
   electromagnetically induced transparency
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Based on the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) model and the higherorder Poincare sphere (HOPS) framework, we establish a general paradigm to investigate the paraxial evolution of a vector beam in a tripod EIT system. By quantum-optical analogy, we introduce a formalism with a generalized Pauli-like equation under rotational invariance, in which the pseudo-spin-orbit coupling (PSOC) and the spin-orbit nonseparability of light can coexist. More importantly, we find that both the PSOC-based real and imaginary potentials play a key role in controlling and modulating the nonseparable state of the vector beam to traverse the entire HOPS, where the orientation and ellipticity of the transmitted polarization can be modified by varying the PSOC coefficients. Therefore, an all-optical scheme can be proposed to improve the flexibility for tailoring the space-variant polarization of light in coherent media, where the tunable spatial-polarization multiplexing may be useful in conventional and quantum information processing.

TI Generalized uncertainty relations for multiple measurements
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB The uncertainty relation is regarded as a remarkable feature of quantum mechanics differing from the classical counterpart, and it plays a backbone role in the region of quantum information theory. In principle, the uncertainty relation offers a nontrivial limit to predict the outcome of arbitrarily incompatible observed variables. Therefore, to pursue a more general uncertainty relations ought to be considerably important for obtaining accurate predictions of multi-observable measurement results in genuine multipartite systems. In this article, we derive a generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for multi-measurement in a multipartite framework. It is proved that the bound we proposed is stronger than the one derived from Renes et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,020402(2009) ] for the arbitrary multipartite case. As an illustration, we take several typical scenarios that confirm that our proposed bound outperforms that presented by Renes et al. Hence, we believe our findings provide generalized uncertainty relations with regard to multi-measurement setting, and facilitate the EUR's applications on quantum precision measurement regarding genuine multipartite systems.

TI Toward Quantum SAGINs Harnessing Optical RISs: Applications, Advances,
   and the Road Ahead
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) concept is vital for the development of seamless next-generation (NG) wireless coverage, integrating satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and manned aircraft along with the terrestrial infrastructure to provide resilient ubiquitous communications. By incorporating quantum communications using optical wireless signals, SAGIN is expected to support a synergistic global quantum Internet alongside classical networks. However, long-distance optical beam propagation requires line-of-sight (LOS) connections in the face of beam broadening and LoS blockages. To overcome blockages among SAGIN nodes, we propose deploying optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) on building rooftops. They can also adaptively control optical beam diameters for reducing losses. This article first introduces the applications of ORISs in SAGINs, then examines their advances in quantum communications for typical SAGIN scenarios. Finally, the road ahead towards the practical realization of ORIS-aided NG quantum SAGINs is outlined.

AB Accurate and reliable diagnosis of diseases is crucial in enabling timely medical treatment and enhancing patient survival rates. In recent years, Machine Learning has revolutionized diagnostic practices by creating classification models capable of identifying diseases. However, these classification problems often suffer from significant class imbalances, which can inhibit the effectiveness of traditional models. Therefore, the interest in Quantum models has arisen, driven by the captivating promise of overcoming the limitations of the classical counterpart thanks to their ability to express complex patterns by mapping data in a higher-dimensional computational space.
   This work proposes a novel approach for enhancing the classification performance of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) consisting of multiple Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) arranged sequentially. This strategy increases the nonlinearity of the model by exploiting the measurement operation and improving its ability to capture complex patterns. In this analysis, the proposed method is compared against classical models while varying its degrees of freedom, specifically the number of involved VQCs, on three well-known healthcare datasets - Prostate Cancer, Heart Failure, and Diabetes. The results prove the potential of the quantum model and demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, showing that its advantage increases with the complexity of the classification.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with a single quadrature
   measurement at an arbitrary reference frame
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a simplified measurement scheme for a Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) protocol for continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), utilizing homodyne detection without quadrature switching. The reference frame of measurement is taken to be at an arbitrary angle, however, reconciliation converges the proposed scheme to GMCS with switching quadrature protocol. The arbitrary frame of measurement could also include the unknown random thermal drift within Bob's optical measurement setup. We found this scheme is advantageous for practical free-space and fiber-based GMCS protocol-based CV-QKD systems as it does not require a phase modulator for random measurement selection quadrature at Bob.

TI Generation of Schrodinger cat states with Wigner negativity using a
   continuous-wave low-loss waveguide optical parametric amplifier
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-wave (CW) squeezed light is used in the generation of various optical quantum states, and thus is a fundamental resource of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation using optical continuous variables. To realize a practical quantum computer, a waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA) is an attractive CW squeezed light source in terms of its THz-order bandwidth and suitability for modularization. The usages of a waveguide OPA in quantum applications thus far, however, are limited due to the difficulty of the generation of the squeezed light with a high purity. In this paper, we report the first observation of Wigner negativity of the states generated by a heralding method using a waveguide OPA. We generate Schrodinger cat states at the wavelength of 1545 nm with Wigner negativity using a quasi-single-mode ZnO-doped periodically poled LiNbO3 waveguide module we developed. Wigner negativity is regarded as an important indicator of the usefulness of the quantum states as it is essential in the fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Our result shows that our waveguide OPA can be used in wide range of quantum applications leading to a THz-clock optical quantum computer.

AB The recent availability of quantum annealers as cloud-based services has enabled new ways to handle machine learning problems, and several relevant algorithms have been adapted to run on these devices. In a recent work, linear regression was formulated as a quadratic binary optimization problem that can be solved via quantum annealing. Although this approach promises a computational time advantage for large datasets, the quality of the solution is limited by the necessary use of a precision vector, used to approximate the real-numbered regression coefficients in the quantum formulation. In this work, we focus on the practical challenge of improving the precision vector encoding: instead of setting an array of generic values equal for all coefficients, we allow each one to be expressed by its specific precision, which is tuned with a simple adaptive algorithm. This approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets of increasing size, and linear regression is solved using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer, as well as classical solvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset ever evaluated for linear regression on a quantum annealer. The results show that our formulation is able to deliver improved solution quality in all instances, and could better exploit the potential of current quantum devices.

TI On-Chip Quantum Sensing of Kondo Spins in a High-Mobility
   Quasi-One-Dimensional Nanoconstriction
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The precise nature of Kondo spins has remained enigmatic when extended to multiple spin impurities or, more intriguingly, when the localized spin itself may already be the consequence of many-body interactions in a presumably delocalized open nanoconstriction, such as a quantum point contact (QPC). It is experimentally challenging to distinguish the Kondo state from other coexisting many-body spin states in such a strongly correlated system. Here we lithographically define an all-on-chip electronic resonator (ER) and a QPC in a high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure transistor. Local Kondo screening of the QPC spin and nonlocal spin singlet across the ER-QPC integration is controllable in response to ER occupancy parity. We also show that the 0.7 anomaly, another strongly correlated state in QPCs, not only has a different physical origin but furthermore counteracts the Kondo spin singlet. These results demonstrate a noninvasive quantum method for sensing spontaneous magnetic impurities within an open nanoconstriction.

TI High-Order Qubit Dephasing at Sweet Spots by Non-Gaussian Fluctuators:
   Symmetry Breaking and Floquet Protection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Although the Gaussian noise assumption is widely adopted in studying qubit decoherence, non -Gaussian noise sources have been detected in many qubits. Further understanding and mitigating the distinctive decoherence effect of the non-Gaussian noise remain critical. Here, we study the qubit dephasing caused by non-Gaussian fluctuators, and predict a symmetry-breaking effect that is unique to non-Gaussian noise. This broken symmetry results in an experimentally measurable mismatch between the extremum points of the dephasing rate and qubit frequency, which demands extra carefulness in char-acterizing the noise and locating the optimal working point. To further enhance the coherence time, we propose suppressing the second-order derivative of the qubit frequency by Floquet engineering. Our sim-ulation on a tunable and gapped two-level quantum system, with the parameters from a heavy fluxonium, shows an order-of-magnitude improvement of the dephasing time, even after including the drive noise.

TI Quantum Sensing for Real-Time Monitoring of Drug Efficacy in Synovial
   Fluid from Arthritis Patients
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Diamond-based T-1 relaxometry is a new technique that allows nanoscale magnetic resonance measurements. Here we present its first application in patient samples. More specifically, we demonstrate that relaxometry can determine the free radical load in samples from arthritis patients. We found that we can clearly differentiate between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in both the synovial fluid itself and cells derived from it. Furthermore, we tested how synovial fluid and its cells respond to piroxicam, a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is known that this drug leads to a reduction in reactive oxygen species production in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Here, we investigated the formation of free radicals specifically. While FLS from osteoarthritis patients showed a drastic decrease in the free radical load, cells from rheumatoid arthritis retained a similar radical load after treatment. This offers a possible explanation for why piroxicam is more beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis than those with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI Quantum fluctuation dynamics of open quantum systems with collective
   operator-valued rates, and applications to Hopfield-like networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a class of open quantum many-body systems that evolves in a Markovian fashion, the dynamical generator being in GKS-Lindblad form. Here, the Hamiltonian contribution is characterized by an all-to-all coupling, and the dissipation features local transitions that depend on collective, operator-valued rates, encoding average properties of the system. These types of generators can be formally obtained by generalizing, to the quantum realm, classical (mean-field) stochastic Markov dynamics, with state-dependent transitions. Focusing on the dynamics emerging in the limit of infinitely large systems, we build on the exactness of the mean-field equations for the dynamics of average operators. In this framework, we derive the dynamics of quantum fluctuation operators, that can be used in turn to understand the fate of quantum correlations in the system. We then apply our results to quantum generalized Hopfield associative memories. Here we show that, asymptotically and at the description level of quantum fluctuations, only a very weak amount of quantum correlations, in the form of quantum discord, emerges beyond classical correlations.

TI Diamond-based quantum sensing of free radicals in migrating human breast
   cancer cells
SO CARBON
AB Cell migration is a crucial parameter for disease progression in cancer. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are involved in the regulation of the migration process, however, the exact role of free radical generation and where it occurs is unknown. Here we use a diamond-based quantum sensing technique to detect free radicals during cancer cell migration in real time with subcellular resolution. We investigated metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and observed free radical formation after 16 h of starvation and 24 h of migration under low-serum conditions. Intracellular diamond dynamics were monitored at different migration points (0, 12, and 24 h), and cell morphology was evaluated. Additionally, the number of focal adhesions was analyzed as an indicator of the migratory potential of the cells. We further measured free radical generation under nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen NADPH oxidases 2 (NOX2) inhibition by apocynin. We found that free radical levels decreased after 24 h treatment with 36 mu g/mL apocynin while the levels of ROS and the migratory capacity of the cells increased. Our results evidence the complexity of the redox regulation in migrating cancer cells and offer a novel approach to specifically and locally interrogate pivotal players of the oxidative network behind metastatic success.

TI Combating fluctuations in relaxation times of fixed-frequency transmon
   qubits with microwave-dressed states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With the long coherence time, fixed-frequency transmon qubits are a promising qubit modality for quantum computing. Currently, diverse qubit architectures that utilize fixed-frequency transmon qubits have been demonstrated with high-fidelity gate performance. Nevertheless, the relaxation times of transmon qubits can have large temporal fluctuations, causing instabilities in gate performance. The fluctuations are often believed to be caused by nearly on-resonance couplings with sparse two-level-system (TLS) defects. To mitigate their impact on qubit coherence and gate performance, one direct approach is to tune the qubits away from these TLSs. In this work, to combat the potential TLS-induced performance fluctuations in a tunable-bus architecture unitizing fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we explore the possibility of using an off-resonance microwave drive to effectively tune the qubit frequency through the ac Stark shift while implementing universal gate operations on the microwave-dressed qubit. We show that the qubit frequency can be tuned up to 20 MHz through the ac Stark shift while keeping minimal impacts on the qubit control. Besides passive approaches that aim to remove these TLSs through more careful treatments of device fabrications, this work may offer an active approach towards mitigating the TLS-induced performance fluctuations in fixed-frequency transmon qubit devices.

TI STUDY OF SMALL GALOIS HULL DIMENSIONS OF CONSTACYCLIC CODES
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB . Codes with small hull dimensions are essential in determining the complexities of the algorithms that are used to find solutions to some of the interesting and vital problems in coding theory. Due to their significant application, such codes have been studied extensively in recent years. This paper finds the conditions for the existence of constacyclic codes to have small Galois hull dimensions. In particular, we explore constacyclic codes with Galois hull dimensions 1 and 2, respectively. As an application of these codes, we construct new classes of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs), including several that outperform existing codes in terms of parameters.

AB The Quantum Angle Generator (QAG) is a cutting-edge quantum machine learning model designed to generate precise images on current Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices. It utilizes variational quantum circuits and incorporates the MERA-upsampling architecture, achieving exceptional accuracy. The study demonstrates the QAG model's ability to learn hardware noise behavior, with stable results in the presence of simulated quantum hardware noise up to 1.5% during inference and 3% during training. However, deploying the noiseless trained model on real quantum hardware reduces accuracy. Training the model directly on hardware allows it to learn the underlying noise behavior, maintaining precision comparable to the noisy simulator. The QAG model's noise robustness and accuracy make it suitable for analyzing simulated calorimeter shower images used in high-energy physics simulations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

TI Simulating a Quantum Switch With Concurrent Demands
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Quantum networks rely on entanglement distribution to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computation. Most analytical models address idealized, single-flow scenarios and overlook the impact of concurrent entanglement requests, limiting their applicability to realistic network conditions. This work studies the behavior of a quantum switch under simultaneous entanglement demands, motivated by the need to understand how concurrency affects link utilization, generation rate, and end-to-end fidelity. Our main contribution is a concurrency-aware switch model that jointly captures capacity and fidelity under multi-flow conditions, offering the first systematic simulation-based analysis of this problem. Results show that handling several requests at the same time improves throughput but reduces fidelity once the network is too busy. This highlights the need for scheduling and routing strategies that keep a good balance between efficiency and entanglement quality in future quantum networks.

TI The optimal approximation of qubit states with limited quantum states
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Measuring the closest distance between two states is an alternative and significant approach in the resource quantification, which is the core task in the resource theory. Quite limited progress has been made for this approach even in simple systems due to the various potential complexities. Here we analytically solve the optimal scheme to find out the closest distance between the objective qubit state and all the possible states convexly mixed by some limited states, namely, to optimally construct the objective qubit state using the quantum states within any given state set. In particular, we find the least number of (not more than four) states within a given set to optimally construct the objective state and also find that any state can be optimally established by at most four quantum states of the set. The examples in various cases are presented to verify our analytic solutions further. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit
   and quantum field theory
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with low-complexity
   information reconciliation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Information reconciliation is an essential step of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) because its efficiency affects both the maximum transmission distance and the final secret key rate of the whole system. Slice reconciliation can achieve high secret key rates for the CV-QKD systems under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, it suffers from the high designing cost of the error-correcting codes in the multi-level coding and multi-stage decoding step. To reconcile one set of data with fixed SNR, multiple error-correcting codes with different code rates need to be designed. If the channel environment changed, the code rates need to change along to maintain high reconciliation efficiency, making it complicated and costly. In this paper, we introduce polar codes into slice reconciliation and proposed a scheme that is simply constructed, effectively performed, and well adapted to the systems with wide-range and variational SNRs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme offers reconciliation efficiency over 95% for the systems with SNRs range from 1 to 10, which can support the systems with high secret key rates. The decrease of complexity and the increase of secret key rate have great significance for a practical CV-QKD system.

TI Orchestration for quantum services: The power of load balancing across
   multiple service providers
SO SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
AB Quantum computing plays a crucial role in solving complex problems for which classical supercomputers require an impractical amount of time. This emerging paradigm has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as cryptography, chemistry, and finance, making it a highly relevant area of research and development. Major companies such as Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft, along with prestigious research institutions such as Oxford and MIT, are investing significant efforts into advancing this technology. However, the lack of a standardized approach among different providers poses challenges for developers to effectively access and utilize quantum computing resources. In this study, we propose a quantum orchestrator that is designed to facilitate the orchestration and execution of quantum circuits across multiple quantum service providers. The proposed solution aims to simplify the process for developers and facilitate the execution of quantum tasks using resources offered by different providers. The proposal is validated with the implementation of the proposed orchestrator for Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. It can support both quantum and classical developers in defining, configuring, and executing circuits independently of the selected provider.

TI High-Speed Calibration and Characterization of Superconducting Quantum
   Processors without Qubit Reset
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In order to characterize and calibrate quantum processing devices, a large amount of measurement data has to be collected. Active qubit reset increases the speed at which data can be gathered but requires additional hardware and/or calibration. The experimental apparatus can, however, be operated at elevated repetition rates without reset. In this case, the outcome of a first measurement serves as the initial state for the next experiment. Rol et al. have used this restless operation mode to accelerate the calibration of a single-qubit gate by measuring fixed-length sequences of Clifford gates that compose to X gates [Phys. Rev. Appl. 7, 041001 (2017)]. However, we find that when measuring pulse sequences that compose to arbitrary operations, distortion appears in the measured data. Here, we extend the restless methodology by showing how to efficiently analyze restless measurements and correct distortions to achieve an identical outcome and accuracy as compared to measurements in which the superconducting qubits are reset. This allows us to rapidly characterize and calibrate qubits. We illustrate this bias-corrected restless measurements method by measuring a Rabi oscillation at a 250 kHz repetition rate without any reset, for a qubit with a decay rate of 1/2 pi T-1 = 3 kHz. We also show that we can measure a single- and a two-qubit average gate fidelity using randomized benchmarking 20 and 8 times faster, respectively, than measurements that reset the qubits through T-1 decay.

TI Optimising finite-time quantum information engines using Pareto bounds

AB Information engines harness measurement and feedback to convert energy into useful work. In this study, we investigate the fundamental trade-offs between ergotropic output power, thermodynamic efficiency and information-to-work conversion efficiency in such engines, explicitly accounting for the finite time required for measurement. As a model engine, we consider a two-level quantum system from which work is extracted via a temporarily coupled quantum harmonic oscillator that serves as the measurement device. This quantum device is subsequently read out by a classical apparatus. We compute trade-offs for the performance of the information engine using Pareto optimisation, which has recently been successfully used to optimise performance in engineering and biological physics. Our results offer design principles for future experimental implementations of information engines, such as in nano-mechanical systems and circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) platforms.

TI Modified BB84 quantum key distribution protocol robust to source
   imperfections
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol is the most widely implemented quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme. However, despite enormous theoretical and experimental efforts in the past decades, the security of this protocol with imperfect sources has not yet been rigorously established. In this paper, we address this shortcoming and prove the security of the BB84 protocol in the presence of multiple source imperfections, including state preparation flaws and side channels, such as Trojan-horse attacks, mode dependencies and classical correlations between the emitted pulses. To do so, we consider a modified BB84 protocol that exploits the basis mismatched events, which are often discarded in standard security analyses of this scheme; and employ the reference technique, a powerful mathematical tool to accommodate source imperfections in the security analysis of QKD. Moreover, we compare the achievable secret-key rate of the modified BB84 protocol with that of the three-state loss-tolerant protocol, and show that the addition of a fourth state, while redundant in ideal conditions, significantly improves the estimation of the leaked information in the presence of source imperfections, resulting in a better performance. This paper demonstrates the relevance of the BB84 protocol in guaranteeing implementation security, taking us a step further towards closing the existing gap between theory and practice of QKD.

This architecture allows for the classical and quantum parts of the model to be trained simultaneously, providing an end-to-end training framework. We show that compared to the principal component analysis, a tensor network based on the matrix product state with low bond dimensions performs better as a feature extractor for the input data of the variational quantum circuit in the binary and ternary classification of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The architecture is highly adaptable and the classical-quantum boundary can be adjusted according to the availability of the quantum resource by exploiting the correspondence between tensor networks and quantum circuits.

TI Three-Photon Pulse Interference in a Tritter: A Novel Approach for a
   Three-Party Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
SO PHYSICS
AB This study presents a theoretical investigation into the interference properties of three photons in a six-port optical beam splitter, commonly referred to as a tritter. We examine various configurations of the relative phase differences among the input photons. Our findings reveal that fully constructive interference periodically occurs at a single output port for specific constant phase differences, while fully destructive interference simultaneously manifests at the remaining two output ports. These distinctive interference patterns arise across a wide range of specific phase difference combinations among the input photons. We suggest that these unique interference characteristics provide new insights into the potential implementation of a three-party quantum key distribution protocol. Such three-photon interference phenomena are crucial for facilitating symmetric secure key distribution among three parties.

TI Polarization-stable single-mode 795 nm grating-coupled surface-emitting
   laser for quantum sensing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a polarization-stable and single-mode grating-coupled surface -emitting laser (GCSEL) with high side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of -40 dB and orthogonal polarization suppression ratio (OPSR) of -25 dB around 795 nm. The fabricated devices have low threshold current of -4.8 mA and low electrical resistance of 53 ohm at 25 degrees C. Meanwhile, a low thermal resistance of -1 K/mW is achieved, which is comparable with that of the record of ever reported for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The far-field divergence angle of surface-emitting beam is -14.5 degrees x14.7 degrees at an injection current of 12 mA indicating a relatively good beam quality. Our results open what we believe is a new way to produce polarization-stable single-mode surface-emitting lasers with simple fabrication process. While the GCSEL is specifically designed for quantum sensing applications such as atomic clocks, magnetometers, and gyroscope, its performance in terms of low-power consumption, low thermal resistance, good beam qualities, and wafer-level testing are of particular interest for a wide range of applications.

TI Cryogenic Body Bias Effect in DRAM Peripheral and Buried-Channel-Array
   Transistor for Quantum Computing Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study investigated a novel forward body bias (FBB) analysis to optimize the threshold voltage (Vth) at cryogenic temperatures in the latest dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Electrical measurements were conducted to analyze the cryogenic body bias effect in terms of performance, reliability, and short-channel effect in two types of transistors: DRAM peripheral low Vth transistors (Peri LVT) and buried-channel-array transistors (BCAT). At 77 K, the V-th shift (Delta V-th) in BCAT was larger than that in Peri LVT due to the difference in channel doping concentration. It was observed that only BCAT experienced a decrease in saturation drain current (I-d.sat) at cryogenic temperature because of the large Delta V-th. To compensate for the Delta V-th, FBB was applied to transistors. As a result, FBB effectively controlled the Vth and improved carrier mobility. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that FBB reduced hot-carrier degradation (HCD) at cryogenic temperature and improved short-channel effect, such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). These findings offer valuable solutions for optimizing cryogenic memory operation in quantum computing applications.

TI A classification method for multi-class skin damage images combining
   quantum computing and Inception-ResNet-V1
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Melanoma is a high-grade malignant tumor. Melanoma and mole lesions are highly similar and have a very high mortality rate. Early diagnosis and treatment have an important impact on the patient's condition. The results of dermoscopy are usually judged visually by doctors through long-term clinical experience, and the diagnostic results may be different under different visual conditions. Computer-aided examinations can help doctors improve efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to use an improved quantum Inception-ResNet-V1 model to classify multiple types of skin lesion images and improve the accuracy of melanoma identification. In this study, the FC layer of Inception-ResNet-V1 is removed, the average pooling layer is the last, SVM is used as the classifier, and the convolutional layer is quantized. The performance of the model was tested experimentally on the ISIC 2019 dataset. To prevent the imbalance of the sample data set from affecting the experiment, the sample data is sampled with weight. Experiments show that the method used shows excellent performance, and the classification accuracy rate reaches 98%, which provides effective help for the clinical diagnosis of melanoma.

TI Activation of metrologically useful genuine multipartite entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider quantum metrology with several copies of bipartite and multipartite quantum states. We characterize the metrological usefulness by determining how much the state outperforms separable states. We identify a large class of entangled states that become maximally useful for metrology in the limit of large number of copies, even if the state is weakly entangled and not even more useful than separable states. This way we activate metrologically useful genuine multipartite entanglement. Remarkably, not only that the maximally achievable metrological usefulness is attained exponentially fast in the number of copies, but it can be achieved by the measurement of few simple correlation observables. We also make general statements about the usefulness of a single copy of pure entangled states. We surprisingly find that the multiqubit states presented in Hyllus et al (2010 Phys. Rev. A 82 012337), which are not useful, become useful if we embed the qubits locally in qutrits. We discuss the relation of our scheme to error correction, and its possible use for quantum metrology in a noisy environment.

TI Bragg-Reflection Waveguides as Practical Photon-Pair Sources for Quantum
   Rangefinding
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are a crucial resource in the development of quantum protocols and quantum technologies, due to the strong correlation between two photons of the same pair. Efficient pair generation is necessary for protocols that require high signal-to-noise ratios when embedded in a lossy and noisy environment. Nonlinear waveguides are well-established platforms for photon pair generation. However, scattering and material absorption can inhibit the efficiency of the pair generation and require high pump powers. Here, we present an aluminum gallium arsenide Bragg-reflection waveguide, fabricated following an optimized recipe, that shows a record brightness compared to other samples with the same structure. When pumped with a sub-mW continuous wave laser, our waveguide generates photon pairs at a rate of $340\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{Hz}\cdot \mathrm{m}\mathrm{W}<^>{-1}$, and a spectral width of $100\,\mathrm{n}\mathrm{m}$ in the telecom band. As a direct application, we investigate the operation of our waveguide in quantum rangefinding, a quantum protocol that employs time correlations between photon pairs to measure objects' distances, while camouflaging within background. This protocol was implemented with nonlinear crystals engineered for broadband emission. Supported by simulations of signal-to-noise ratio, we introduce our low-loss and broadband waveguide as a novel platform for telecom quantum rangefinding, robust against loss and noise.

TI Using (1+1)D quantum cellular automata for exploring collective effects
   in large-scale quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Central to the field of quantum machine learning is the design of quantum perceptrons and neural network architectures. A key question in this regard is the impact of quantum effects on the way such models process information. Here, we establish a connection between (1 + 1)D quantum cellular automata, which implement a discrete nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics through successive applications of local quantum gates, and quantum neural networks (QNNs), which process information by feeding it through perceptrons intercon-necting adjacent layers. Exploiting this link, we construct a class of QNNs that are highly structured-aiding both interpretability and helping to avoid trainability issues in machine learning tasks-yet can be connected rigorously to continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. We further analyze the universal properties of an example case, identifying a change of critical behavior when quantum effects are varied, showing their potential impact on the collective dynamical behavior underlying information processing in large-scale QNNs.

TI Optimizing the Energy Efficiency Using Quantum Based Load Balancing in
   Open Radio Access Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The open radio access network (ORAN) aims to improve network efficiency by reducing latency through the distributed unit (DU) and virtualization in the central unit (CU). However, the deployment of additional DU servers increases power usage and competition among virtual machines for user data processing. This study proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by incorporating load balancing strategies and quantum physics concepts, particularly entanglement theory in classical communication systems. The methodology enables the production of quantum information units from a single classical information unit, aiming to conserve energy. A simplified yet effective power consumption (PC) model for the ORAN architecture captures traffic fluctuations and provides a comprehensive characterization of power usage within a virtualized system. An optimization problem is formulated to select ORAN servers for quantum load balancing that are less energy-efficient, maximizing user benefits. The Lagrange multiplier method is used to deal with nonlinear objective functions. The presented problem is addressed through the use of two numerical methods, namely sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the active-set approach. It is shown that the SQP model exhibits superior energy efficiency compared to the active-set model, with a difference of approximately 45%.

TI Low-error encoder for time-bin and decoy states for quantum key
   distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Time-bin encoding is a robust method for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD) on optical fiber channels, minimizing drift-induced errors. However, interferometric structures make achieving stable and low intrinsic Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) challenging. A key device for decoy-state QKD is the state encoder, which must produce low-error, stable states with varying photon mean values. Here, we introduce the MacZac (Mach-Zehnder-Sagnac), a time-bin encoder with ultra-low QBER (<2 x 10(-5)) and high stability. Based on nested Sagnac and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, it uses a single phase modulator for both decoy and state preparation, simplifying the optical setup. The encoder requires no active compensation and can generate states of arbitrary dimension. We experimentally tested it as a standalone component and in a QKD experiment. With its low QBER, stability, and simplicity, this device is a key building block for high-performance, low-cost QKD system

TI Effect of frequency side channels on the security of practical quantum
   key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an information-theoretic secure method for all detection-side vulnerabilities while offering exceptional security and practicality. Nevertheless, imperfections in source-side devices may still introduce security risks that necessitate precise characterization and evaluation in practical security analyses. In this study, we demonstrate that the inherent frequency-shifting properties of the Mach-Zehnder intensity modulator can induce distinguishable features between signal and decoy states in the frequency domain, fundamentally undermining the core premise of the decoy-state protocol. Experimental characterization reveals that such spectral distinguishability exhibits strong dependence on three key parameters: modulation voltage, pulse width, and modulation scheme. Leveraging this vulnerability, we develop a frequency side channel attack framework applicable to both MDI-QKD and its variant mode-pairing QKD (MP-QKD), evaluate its impact on protocol security, and ultimately devise corresponding countermeasures.

TI Resource-efficient energy test and parameter estimation in
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Symmetry plays a fundamental role in the security analysis of quantum key distribution (QKD). Here we review how symmetry is exploited in continuous-variable (CV) QKD to prove the optimality of Gaussian attacks in the finite-size regime. We then apply these results to improve the feasibility and the key rate of these protocols. First we show how to improve the feasibility of the energy test, which is one important routine aimed at establishing an upper bound on the effective dimensions of the otherwise infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of CV systems. Second, we show how the routine of parameter estimation can be made resource efficient in measurement-device independent QKD. These results show that all the raw data can be used both for key extraction and for the routines of the energy test and parameter estimation. Furthermore, the improved energy test does not require active symmetrization of the measured data, which is computationally demanding.

With the help of the novel system scheme, effective digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and advanced analytical security proof methods, the transmission results of 5.059 km, 10.314 km, 24.490 km, and 50.592 km are achieved for 1 GBaud optimized quantum signals. Correspondingly, the asymptotic secret key rates (SKRs) are 292.185 Mbps, 156.246 Mbps, 50.491 Mbps, and 7.495 Mbps for discrete Gaussian (DG) 64QAM, and 328.297 Mbps, 176.089 Mbps, 51.304 Mbps, and 9.193 Mbps for DG 256QAM, respectively. Under the same parameters, the achieved SKRs of DG 256QAM is almost same as ideal Gaussian modulation. In this case, the demonstrated highrate discrete-modulatedCV-QKDsystem has the application potential for high-speed security communication under tens of kilometers. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We use entangled multimode coherent states to produce entangled giant graviton states, in the context of gauge/gravity duality. We make a smeared distribution of the entangled multimode coherent states on the circle, or on the five-sphere, in the higher dimensional view. In gauge/gravity duality, we analyze the superposition of giant graviton states, and the entangled pairs of giant graviton states. We map a class of angular distribution functions to unitary operations on the pairs. We also use Young tableau states to construct cat states and qudit states. Various bipartite quantum states involving Young tableau states are analyzed, including micro-macro entangled states. Mixed states of Young tableau states are generated, by using ensemble mixing using angular distribution functions, and also by going through noisy quantum channels. We then produce mixed entangled pair of giant graviton states, by including interaction with the environment and using noisy quantum channels. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We utilize aMonte Carlo approach to simulate the trajectories of emitted photons transmitting in water from the transmitter towards the receiver. Based on propagation delay results, we first determine a proper value for the bit period to avoid intersymbol interference as a result of possible multiple scattering events. Then, based on the angle of arrival of the received photons, we determine a proper field of view to limit the average number of received background noise. Finally, we determine the optimal value for the single photon avalanche diode gate time in the sense of minimizing the QBER for the selected system parameters and given propagation environment.

TI Attribute-Based Encryption in Securing Big Data from Post-Quantum
   Perspective: A Survey
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Attribute-based encryption (ABE) cryptography is widely known for its potential to solve the scalability issue of recent public key infrastructure (PKI). It provides a fine-grained access control system with high flexibility and efficiency by labeling the secret key and ciphertext with distinctive attributes. Due to its fine-grained features, the ABE scheme is a protection layer in securing users' data and privacy in big data processing and analytics. However, quantum computing, new technology on the horizon that will transform the security and privacy environment, has begun to appear. Like the conventional ABE schemes, present cryptography is not excluded from the impacts of quantum technology as they are not made to be quantum-resistant. While most recent surveys generally touched on the generic features of attribute-based encryption schemes such as user revocation, scalability, flexibility, data confidentiality, and scope in pairing-based ABE schemes, this survey investigated quantum-resistant ABE schemes in securing big data. This survey reviews the challenges faced by the recent ABE cryptography in the post-quantum era and highlights its differences from the conventional pairing-based ABE schemes. Subsequently, we defined the criteria of an ideal quantum-resistant ABE scheme. Additionally, existing works on quantum-resistant ABE schemes are reviewed based on their algorithms design, security and functionalities. Lastly, we summarized quantum-resistant ABE schemes' ongoing challenges and future works.

AB What if quantum entanglement could accelerate learning by unlocking higher states of conscious experience? This study provides empirical and statistical evidence of how quantum entanglement influences consciousness at a biophysical level. We analyzed data from 106 monozygotic twin pairs (N = 212), randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Using a consanguinity-based matching technique, twin pairs (A-B) were formed. Two distinct 2-qubit circuits were designed: C1 (non-entangled) for the control group and E1 (entangled) for the experimental group. These circuits manipulated visual stimulus contingencies during a 144-trial implicit learning experiment conducted under nonlocal conditions, executed via the IBM Brisbane supercomputer. Mental states were assessed with 3D electroencephalography (EEG), while biomarkers-including Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) for neuroplasticity, Free Fatty Acids (FFA), and Alpha-Amylase for physiological arousal-were measured. To advance this field, we introduced the Quantum-Multilinear Integrated Coefficient (Q), a groundbreaking metric capable of estimating variance increases attributable to quantum entanglement effects within response matrices. Our findings revealed that the entanglement of qubits in stimulus configurations explained 13.5 % of the variance in accuracy within the experimental group. The Q coefficient captured up to a 31.6 % increase in variance across twin responses, while neuroplasticity markers explained a 26.2 % increase in cognitive performance under entangled conditions. These results provide robust evidence that quantum entanglement enhances conscious experience and facilitates faster, more efficient learning. They point to the existence of anomalous cognitive mechanisms capable of anticipating future, unpredictable stimuli, representing a profound leap in our understanding of consciousness and its quantum underpinnings.

TI Nitrogen isotope effects on boron vacancy quantum sensors in hexagonal
   boron nitride
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB There has been growing interest in studying hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) for quantum technologies. Here, we investigate nitrogen isotope effects on boron vacancy (V B) defects, one of the candidates for quantum sensors, in 15N isotopically enriched hBN synthesized using a metathesis reaction. The Raman shifts are scaled with the reduced mass, consistent with previous work on boron isotope enrichment. We obtain nitrogen isotopic composition-dependent magnetic resonance spectra of V B defects and determine the magnitude of the hyperfine interaction parameter of 15N spin to be 64 MHz. Our investigation provides a design policy for hBNs for quantum sensing.

TI Nanometer Resolution Structure-Emission Correlation of Individual
   Quantum Emitters via Enhanced Cathodoluminescence in Twisted Hexagonal
   Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Understanding the atomic structure of quantum emitters, often originating from point defects or impuritie, is essential for designing and optimizing materials for quantum technologies such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Despite the availability of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale cathodoluminescence microscopy, experimentally determining the atomic structure of individual emitters is challenging due to the conflicting needs for thick samples to generate strong cathodoluminescence signals and thin samples for structural analysis. To overcome this challenge, significantly enhanced cathodoluminescence at twisted interfaces is leveraged to achieve sub-nanometer localization precision for the first time in mapping individual quantum emitters in carbon-implanted hexagonal boron nitride. This unprecedent spatial sensitivity, together with correlative electron energy loss spectroscopy quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, and first principles density functional theory calculations, enables the identification of the atomic structure of the 440 nm blue emitter in hexagonal boron nitride as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Building on the atomic structure insights, nanoscale spatially precise creation of blue emitters is demonstrated by electron beam irradiation of carbon-coated hexagonal boron nitride. This advancement in correlating atomic structures with optical properties lays the foundation for a deeper understanding and precise engineering of quantum emitters, significantly advancing the development of cutting-edge quantum information technologies.

TI Applying the noiseless extrapolation error mitigation protocol to
   calculate real-time quantum field theory scattering phase shifts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Real -time scattering calculations on a noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) quantum computer are disrupted by errors that accumulate throughout the circuits. To improve the accuracy of such physics simulations, one can supplement the application circuits with a recent error mitigation strategy known as noiseless output extrapolation (NOX). We tested these error mitigation protocols on a transverse field Ising model and improved upon previous phase shift calculations. Our proof-of-concept 4-qubit application circuits were run on several IBM quantum computing hardware architectures. We introduce metrics that show between 22% and 73% error reduction for circuit depths ranging from 13 to 37 hard cycles, confirming that the NOX technique applies to circuits with a broad range of failure rates. We also observed an approximate 28% improvement in the accuracy of the time delay calculation of the scattering phase shift. These observations on different cloud-accessible devices confirm that NOX improves performance even when circuits are executed in substantially time -separated batches. Finally, we provide a heuristic method to obtain systematic error bars on the mitigated results, compare them with empirical errors and discuss their effects on phase shift estimates.

TI Efficient Source of Shaped Single Photons Based on an Integrated Diamond
   Nanophotonic System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An efficient, scalable source of shaped single photons that can be directly integrated with optical fiber networks and quantum memories is at the heart of many protocols in quantum information science. We demonstrate a deterministic source of arbitrarily temporally shaped single-photon pulses with high efficiency [detection efficiency = 14.9%] and purity [g(2)(0) = 0.0168] and streams of up to 11 consecutively detected single photons using a silicon-vacancy center in a highly directional fiber -integrated diamond nanophotonic cavity. Combined with previously demonstrated spin-photon entangling gates, this system enables on-demand generation of streams of correlated photons such as cluster states and could be used as a resource for robust transmission and processing of quantum information.

TI Preparation and verification of two-mode mechanical entanglement through
   pulsed optomechanical measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a protocol how to generate and verify bipartite Gaussian entanglement between two mechanical modes coupled to a single optical cavity, by means of short optical pulses and measurement. Our protocol requires neither the resolved sideband regime, nor low thermal phonon occupancy, and allows the generation and verification of quantum entanglement in less than a mechanical period of motion. Entanglement is generated via effective two-mode mechanical squeezing through conditioning position measurements. We study the robustness of entanglement to experimental deviations in mechanical frequencies and optomechanical coupling rates.

TI Numerical calculations of the finite key rate for general quantum key
   distribution protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Finite key analysis of quantum key distribution (QKD) is an important tool for any QKD implementation. While much work has been done on the framework of finite key analysis, the application to individual protocols often relies on the specific protocol being simple or highly symmetric as well as represented in small finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we extend our pre-existing reliable, efficient, tight, and generic numerical method for calculating the asymptotic key rate of device-dependent QKD protocols in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces to the finite key regime using the security analysis framework of Renner. We explain how this extension preserves the reliability, efficiency, and tightness of the asymptotic method. We then explore examples which illustrate both the generality of our method as well as the importance of parameter estimation and data processing within the framework.

TI Quantum key Distribution with a Hand-Held Sender Unit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a crucial component for truly secure communication, which enables the leakage of information due to eavesdropper attacks to be analyzed. Although impressive progress was made in the field of long-distance implementations, user-oriented applications involving short-distance links have mostly remained overlooked. Recent technological advances in integrated photonics now enable developments towards QKD also for existing hand-held communication platforms. In this work we report on the design and evaluation of a hand-held free-space QKD system including a micro-optics-based sender unit. This system implements the BB84 protocol employing polarization-encoded faint laser pulses at a rate of 100 MHz. Unidirectional beam tracking and live reference-frame alignment systems at the receiver side enable a stable operation over tens of seconds when aiming the portable transmitter to the receiver input by hand from a distance of about half a meter. The user-friendliness of our system was confirmed by successful key exchanges performed by different untrained users with an average link efficiency of about 20% relative to the case of the transmitter being stationarily mounted and aligned. In these tests we achieve an average quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of 2.4% and asymptotic secret key rates ranging from 4.0 kbps to 15.3 kbps. Given its compactness, the versatile sender optics is also well suited for integration into other free-space communication systems enabling QKD over any distance.

TI Strict Hierarchy between Parallel, Sequential, and
   Indefinite-Causal-Order Strategies for Channel Discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present an instance of a task of minimum-error discrimination of two qubit-qubit quantum channels for which a sequential strategy outperforms any parallel strategy. We then establish two new classes of strategies for channel discrimination that involve indefinite causal order and show that there exists a strict hierarchy among the performance of all four strategies. Our proof technique employs a general method of computer-assisted proofs. We also provide a systematic method for finding pairs of channels that showcase this phenomenon, demonstrating that the hierarchy between strategies is not exclusive to our main example.

TI Femtosecond laser-inscribed optical waveguides in dielectric crystals: a
   concise review and recent advances
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Femtosecond laser inscription or writing has been recognized as a powerful technique to engineer various materials toward a number of applications. By efficient modification of refractive indices of dielectric crystals, optical waveguides with diverse configurations have been produced by femtosecond laser writing. The waveguiding properties depend not only on the parameters of the laser writing but also on the nature of the crystals. The mode profile tailoring and polarization engineering are realizable by selecting appropriate fabrication conditions. In addition, regardless of the complexity of crystal refractive index changes induced by ultrafast pulses, several three-dimensional geometries have been designed and implemented that are useful for the fabrication of laser-written photonic chips. Some intriguing devices, e.g., waveguide lasers, wavelength converters, and quantum memories, have been made, exhibiting potential for applications in various areas. Our work gives a concise review of the femtosecond laser-inscribed waveguides in dielectric crystals and focuses on the recent advances of this research area, including the fundamentals, fabrication, and selected photonic applications.

TI Deep Q-learning with hybrid quantum neural network on solving maze
   problems
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing holds great potential for advancing the limitations of machine learning algorithms to handle higher dimensions of data and reduce overall training parameters in deep learning (DL) models. This study uses a trainable variational quantum circuit (VQC) on a gate-based quantum computing model to investigate the potential for quantum benefit in a model-free reinforcement learning problem. Through a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of the current model and capabilities of quantum computers, we designed and trained a novel hybrid quantum neural network based on the latest Qiskit and PyTorch framework. We compared its performance with a full-classical CNN with and without an incorporated VQC. Our research provides insights into the potential of deep quantum learning to solve a maze problem and, potentially, other reinforcement learning problems. We conclude that reinforcement learning problems can be practical with reasonable training epochs. Moreover, a comparative study of full-classical and hybrid quantum neural networks is discussed to understand these two approaches' performance, advantages, and disadvantages to deep Q-learning problems, especially on larger-scale maze problems larger than 4x4.

TI Cancer and the entangled creator: Deep incarnation and the analeptic
   cross
SO DIALOG-A JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
AB The metaphorical appropriation of quantum entanglement (non-local relational holism) helps to conceptualize the physical relationship of God to creation in a way which can support the understanding of deep incarnation. The relational holism of Divine entanglement helps clarify how deep incarnation is possible. Deep incarnation in turn assists with the understanding of God's connectivity and ongoing relationality to a suffering world, bringing hope and love in the midst of the pain and loss of evolutionary biology gone awry, including in cancer. The Logos of creation is also a suffering Logos, a Logos Pathos, that makes hope possible at such times and gives rise to what may be referred to as an Analeptic Cross, the cross embracing and "taking up" all of evolutionary suffering from the beginning. The Analeptic Cross is a way of revealing or making manifest the Logos Pathos. The article concludes with the role of faith in grounding hope in the midst of loss, providing resilience and courage in the midst of uncertainty. Deep incarnation means that God is with us even in the midst of malignancy.

TI Towards quantum enhanced adversarial robustness in machine learning
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for data-driven tasks such as image classification and feature detection. However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples-input samples manipulated to fool the algorithm-remains a serious challenge. The integration of machine learning with quantum computing has the potential to yield tools offering not only better accuracy and computational efficiency, but also superior robustness against adversarial attacks. Indeed, recent work has employed quantum-mechanical phenomena to defend against adversarial attacks, spurring the rapid development of the field of quantum adversarial machine learning (QAML) and potentially yielding a new source of quantum advantage. Despite promising early results, there remain challenges in building robust real-world QAML tools. In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress in QAML and identify key challenges. We also suggest future research directions that could determine the route to practicality for QAML approaches as quantum computing hardware scales up and noise levels are reduced.
   To fulfil the potential of quantum machine learning for practical applications in the near future, it needs to be robust against adversarial attacks. West and colleagues give an overview of recent developments in quantum adversarial machine learning, and outline key challenges and future research directions to advance the field.

TI Entanglement in flavored scalar scattering
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy 2 -> 2 scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the S-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.

TI Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate
   Set Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Crosstalk is a leading source of failure in multiqubit quantum information processors. It can arise from a wide range of disparate physical phenomena, and can introduce subtle correlations in the errors experienced by a device. Several hardware characterization protocols are able to detect the presence of crosstalk, but few provide sufficient information to distinguish various crosstalk errors from one another. In this article we describe how gate set tomography, a protocol for detailed characterization of quantum operations, can be used to identify and characterize crosstalk errors in quantum information processors. We demonstrate our methods on a two-qubit trapped-ion processor and a two-qubit subsystem of a superconducting transmon processor.

TI Tunable Spin Qubit Pairs in Quantum Dot-Molecule Conjugates
SO ACS NANO
AB Organic molecules and quantum dots (QDs) have both shown promise as materials that can host quantum bits (qubits). This is in part because of their synthetic tunability. The current work employs a combination of both materials to demonstrate a series of tunable quantum dot-organic molecule conjugates that can both host photogenerated spin-based qubit pairs (SQPs) and sensitize molecular triplet states. The photogenerated qubit pairs, composed of a spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP), are particularly intriguing since they can be initialized in well-defined, nonthermally populated, quantum states. Additionally, the radical pair enables charge recombination to a polarized molecular triplet state, also in a well-defined quantum state. The materials underlying this system are an organic molecular chromophore and electron donor, 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene, and a quantum dot acceptor composed of ZnO. We prepare a series of quantum dot-molecule conjugates that possess variable quantum dot size and two different linker lengths connecting the two moieties. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the QD-molecule conjugates undergo photoexcited charge separation to generate long-lived charge-separated radical pairs. The resulting spin states are probed using light-induced time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TR-EPR) spectroscopy, revealing the presence of singlet-generated SCRPs and molecular triplet states. Notably, the EPR spectra of the radical pairs are dependent on the geometry of this highly tunable system. The g value of the ZnO QD anion is size tunable, and the line widths are influenced by radical pair separation. Overall, this work demonstrates the power of synthetic tunability in adjusting the spin specific addressability, satisfying a key requirement of functional qubit systems.

TI Statistical Testing of Quantum Programs via Fixed-Point Amplitude
   Amplification
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We present a new technique for accelerating quantum program testing. Given a quantum circuit with an input/output specification, our goal is to check whether executing the program on the input state produces the expected output. In quantum computing, however, it is impossible to directly check the equivalence of the two quantum states. Instead, we rely on statistical testing, which involves repeated program executions, state measurements, and subsequent comparisons with the specified output. To guarantee a high level of assurance, however, this method requires an extensive number of measurements. In this paper, we propose a solution to alleviate this challenge by adapting Fixed-Point Amplitude Amplification (FPAA) for quantum program testing. We formally present our technique, demonstrate its ability to reduce the required number of measurements as well as runtime cost without sacrificing the original statistical guarantee, and showcase its runtime effectiveness through case studies.

TI Multiobjective Optimization and Network Routing With Near-Term Quantum
   Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Multiobjective optimization is a ubiquitous problem that arises naturally in many scientific and industrial areas. Network routing optimization with multiobjective performance demands falls into this problem class, and finding good quality solutions at large scales is generally challenging. In this work, we develop a scheme with which near-term quantum computers can be applied to solve multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems. We study the application of this scheme to the network routing problem in detail, by first mapping it to the multiobjective shortest-path problem. Focusing on an implementation based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)-the go-to approach for tackling optimization problems on near-term quantum computers-we examine the Pareto plot that results from the scheme and qualitatively analyze its ability to produce Pareto-optimal solutions. We further provide theoretical and numerical scaling analyses of the resource requirements and performance of QAOA and identify key challenges associated with this approach. Finally, through Amazon Braket, we execute small-scale implementations of our scheme on the IonQ Harmony 11-qubit quantum computer.

TI Supply chain logistics with quantum and classical annealing algorithms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware is almost universally incompatible with full-scale optimization problems of practical importance which can have many variables and unwieldy objective functions. As a consequence, there is a growing body of literature that tests quantum algorithms on miniaturized versions of problems that arise in an operations research setting. Rather than taking this approach, we investigate a problem of substantial commercial value, multi-truck vehicle routing for supply chain logistics, at the scale used by a corporation in their operations. Such a problem is too complex to be fully embedded on any near-term quantum hardware or simulator; we avoid confronting this challenge by taking a hybrid workflow approach: we iteratively assign routes for trucks by generating a new binary optimization problem instance one truck at a time. Each instance has similar to 2500 quadratic binary variables, putting it in a range that is feasible for NISQ quantum computing, especially quantum annealing hardware. We test our methods using simulated annealing and the D-Wave Hybrid solver as a place-holder in wait of quantum hardware developments. After feeding the vehicle routes suggested by these runs into a highly realistic classical supply chain simulation, we find excellent performance for the full supply chain. Our work gives a set of techniques that can be adopted in contexts beyond vehicle routing to apply NISQ devices in a hybrid fashion to large-scale problems of commercial interest.

TI Mixed-State Quantum Anomaly and Multipartite Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here, we explore a surprising connection between mixed-state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in d space dimensions with anomalous symmetry G where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology Hd+2[G; U(1)]. We show that any mixed state rho that is strongly symmetric under G, in the sense that G rho proportional to rho is necessarily (d + 2)nonseparable, i.e., is not the mixture of tensor products of d + 2 states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any (d + 2)-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in d <= 1 and plausibility arguments in d > 1. The anomaly-nonseparability connection, thus, allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in d = 1 we find an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze a mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly, in general, does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.

TI Teleportation of superposed nonlinear coherent states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper, we study the teleportation of nonlinear coherent cat states assuming even and odd nonlinear quasi-Bell states as the channel. Odd nonlinear quasi-Bell states are shown to be maximally entangled independent of the coherent parameter and also nonlinear function but the entanglement of the even nonlinear coherent states depends on the parameters involved. Subsequently, the teleportation probability is evaluated for some nonlinear functions. Our research reveals that when even and odd nonlinear quasi-Bell states are assumed as the quantum channel, the probabilities for successful teleportation are oppositely varied by increasing coherent parameter. For the special case of nonlinear harmonious states, the teleportation probability is a decreasing (increasing) function of the coherent parameter if even (odd) nonlinear quasi-Bell state is used as the channel.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network Model for Image
   Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Image classification plays an important role in remote sensing. Earth observation (EO) has inevitably arrived in the big data era, but the high requirement on computation power has already become a bottleneck for analyzing large amounts of remote sensing data with sophisticated machine learning models. Exploiting quantum computing might contribute to a solution to tackle this challenge by leveraging quantum properties. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QC-CNN) that applies quantum computing to effectively extract high-level critical features from EO data for classification purposes. Besides that, the adoption of the amplitude encoding technique reduces the required quantum bit resources. The complexity analysis indicates that the proposed model can accelerate the convolutional operation in comparison with its classical counterpart. The model's performance is evaluated with different EO benchmarks, including Overhead-MNIST, So2Sat LCZ42, PatternNet, RSI-CB256, and NaSC-TG2, through the TensorFlow Quantum platform, and it can achieve better performance than its classical counterpart and have higher generalizability, which verifies the validity of the QC-CNN model on EO data classification tasks.

TI Theoretical concept of error-rejecting entanglement purification of
   quantum-dots electronic spins in single-sided optical microcavity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We use the quantum-dots (QD) coupled with single-sided microcavities system to construct the error-rejecting controlled not (CNOT) gate of electronic spins system in QD; We have designed an error-rejecting entanglement purification protocol (EPP) of electronic spins system in QD by using the error-rejecting CNOT gate and unitary operation. It can extract the high entanglement from the mixed entanglement states of the electronic spins with low entangled states. This EPP can eliminate the operation errors caused by the nonideal interaction between photons and QD coupled with optical microcavities system, and improve the fidelity of the EPP through iteration. Our scheme is more practical in future long-distance quantum communications, especially providing significant benefits for solving decoherence problems in quantum networks and quantum repeaters.

TI High cooperativity coupling to nuclear spins on a circuit quantum
   electrodynamics architecture
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Superconducting hybrid systems are becoming an increasingly important platform to conduct investigations in the field of quantum information processing. Here, the authors report a highly cooperative coupling between the nuclear spin of an Yb(III) molecular complex with a superconducting microwave resonator achieving a large hyperfine-mediated coupling between a resonator mode and the nuclear spin that could be used for the realization and readout of qudits.
   Nuclear spins are candidates to encode qubits or qudits due to their isolation from magnetic noise and potentially long coherence times. However, their weak coupling to external stimuli makes them hard to integrate into circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures, the leading technology for solid-state quantum processors. Here, we study the coupling of Yb-173(III) nuclear spin states in an [Yb(trensal)] molecule to superconducting cavities. Experiments have been performed on magnetically dilute single crystals placed on the inductors of lumped-element LC superconducting resonators with characteristic frequencies spanning the range of nuclear and electronic spin transitions. We achieve a high cooperative coupling to all electronic and most nuclear [Yb-173(trensal)] spin transitions, a necessary ingredient for the implementation of qudit protocols with molecular spins using a hybrid architecture.

We provide a feasible experimental strategy to implement, in principle, the quantum probing protocol based on the quantum Fisher information using a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometric setup.

TI Using Kondo entanglement to induce spin correlations between
   disconnected quantum dots
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We investigate the entanglement between the spins of two quantum dots that are not simultaneously connected to the same system. Quantum entanglement among localized spins is a crucial property for the advancement of quantum computing and quantum information. Generating and controlling an entangled state between quantum dots have garnered significant attention in recent years for this reason. In this study, we demonstrate that information about the spin orientation of a quantum dot can be preserved, utilizing Kondo entanglement, within a reservoir of electrons. Subsequently, this information can be transmitted to another dot after the initial dot has been decoupled from the reservoirs. We employ a double quantum dot system in a parallel geometry to establish the initial state, where each dot interacts with reservoirs of different symmetries. A specific phase in the couplings is chosen to induce antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the dots. The time evolution of the initial state is analyzed using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method. Our findings reveal that a partially entangled state between the dots can be achieved, even when they are not simultaneously connected. This entangled state arises transiently and dissipates in the stationary state. The stability of the state observed during the transient phase is demonstrated. To comprehend the details of these phenomena, we employ a canonical transformation of real space. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI How Secure Are Two-Way Ping-Pong and LM05 QKD Protocols under a
   Man-in-the-Middle Attack?
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider a man-in-the-middle attack on two-way quantum key distribution ping-pong and LM05 protocols in which an eavesdropper copies all messages in the message mode, while being undetectable in the mode. Under the attack there is therefore no disturbance in the message mode and the mutual information between the sender and the receiver is always constant and equal to one and messages copied by the eavesdropper are always genuine. An attack can only be detected in the control mode but the level of detection at which the protocol should be aborted is not defined. We examine steps of the protocol to evaluate its security and find that the protocol should be redesigned. We also compare it with the security of a one-way asymmetric BB84-like protocol in which one basis serves as the message mode and the other as the control mode but which does have the level of detection at which the protocol should be aborted defined.

TI Digital quantum simulation of bosonic systems and quantum
   complementarity
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Digital quantum simulation (DQS) has emerged as a powerful approach to investigate complex quantum systems using digital quantum computers. Such systems, like many-particle bosonic systems and intricate optical experimental setups, pose significant challenges for classical simulation methods. In this paper, we utilize a general formalism for the DQS of bosonic systems, which consists of mapping bosonic operators to Pauli operators using the Gray code, in order to simulate interferometric variants of Afshar's experiment-an intricate optical experiment-on IBM's quantum computers. We investigated experiments analogous to Afshar's double-slit experiment performed by Unruh and Pessoa J & uacute;nior, exploring discussions on the apparent violation of Bohr's complementarity principle when considering the entire experimental setup. Based on the aforementioned experiments, we construct a variation of a delayed-choice setup. We also explore another experiment starting with a two-photon initial state. Finally, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of Quantum Mechanics.

TI VQ-Rice: Integrating Variational Quantum Models for Intelligent Rice
   Disease Classification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB This study presents a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework for rice disease diagnosis, leveraging variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to address the limitations of traditional and deep learning models in precision agriculture. The proposed Quantum Variational Rice Disease Network (QVRDN) integrates quantum feature encoding, variational quantum processing, and adaptive optimization to achieve superior classification accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Using a curated dataset of 3000 annotated rice leaf images spanning major disease categories, the QVRDN framework applies dimensionality reduction and quantum angle encoding to transform the image features into quantum states, which are then processed by parameterized quantum circuits for disease classification. Experimental results demonstrate that QVRDN outperforms classical models, including SVM, random forest, CNN, and ResNet50-achieving, the highest accuracy of 97.8%, faster inference times, and greater resilience to noise and limited data. The compact design of the framework enables edge deployment without GPU dependency, making it suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. By demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of quantum machine learning in crop health monitoring, this study establishes a foundation for quantum-enhanced, data-efficient agricultural diagnostics and paves the way for future advances in intelligent, field-ready quantum geoinformatics systems.

TI Birefringence compensation utilizing quarter-wave plates in
   cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion process br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Single-photon source is an essential element in quantum information processing, and extensively used in the proof-in-principle demonstration in quantum physics, quantum imaging, quantum cryptography, etc. Considering the operating temperature and system complexity, it is a favorable option to choose spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) combined with the enhancement effect of a cavity. When generating significant single-photon source via the cavity-enhanced type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion method, there appears inevitable birefringence effect which obviously influences the resonance condition. In order to compensate for birefringence effect, different approaches have been used such as introducing compensating crystal, placing a half-wave plate, tuning the temperature of the nonlinear crystal, customized conjoined double-cavity structure, and cluster effect. In this work, two quarter-wave plates, with an angle of 45 degrees between the optical axis and the crystal axis, are placed in the cavity to ensure the double resonance of signal photon and idler photon. In the process, the signal photon and idler photon generated simultaneously have different polarizations perpendicular to each other through the type-II nonlinear crystal. Considering horizontally polarized photon, its polarization is changed into left circular polarization by the first quarter-wave plate and then returns as vertical polarization. After traversing a long optical path, it shifts to right circular polarization through the second quarter-wave plate. When the photon passes through the same quarter-wave plate again, the polarization state is originally converted into horizontal polarization state. Then the photon completes a round-trip. The other photon with vertical polarization experiences the same process. As a result, the signal photon and idler photon travel identical optical path. The general explanation is described by the Jones matrices, with the emphasis on the transformation of the polarizations of photons. This method can effectively compensate for birefringence effect, achieving double resonance by using a relatively simple device under the condition of smaller intra-cavity loss and more flexible for adjustment. The signal (idler) photon has a sub-natural linewidth of , demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed technique. This introduced compensating method paves the way to the realization of single-photon quantum source applied to the research of single-photon-single-atom quantum information processing, quantum interface and quantum network node with a single cesium atom confined in the strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics system.

TI Decomposable dynamics on matrix algebras
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We explore a notion of decomposably divisible (D-divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 485202 (2023). Both necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for highly- symmetric qubit and qudit dynamical maps. Through a restructurization of the evolution generators, we encode the decomposable divisibility into the positivity of time-dependent coefficients that multiply generators of Ddivisible dynamical maps. This provides an analogy to the CP-divisibility property, which is equivalent to the positivity of decoherence rates that multiply Markovian semigroup generators.

TI Quantum image dataset transform (QIDT) for image processing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Existing CNN architectures have been developed to train digital image datasets obtained from hardware systems operating with classical bits, such as optical cameras. With the increase of quantum computing algorithms and quantum system providers, academic research is being conducted to combine the strengths of classical computing and quantum algorithms. This fusion allows for the development of hybrid quantum systems, with proposed methods specifically for the quantum representation of digital images. While methods for transforming digital images into quantum-compatible circuits have been proposed, no study has been found on the quantum transformation of entire datasets, especially for the use of fully classical CNN architectures. This article presents the quantum image dataset transform method, which utilizes quantum circuits to transform digital images and create a new dataset of the transformed images. Each of the 10,000 digital images of 28 x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times $$\end{document} 28 dimensions in the MNIST handwritten digits dataset is individually sub-parts, and the common weight values of each segment are determined as the phase value to be used in the quantum circuit. The quantum outputs of each sub-part are converted into classical equivalents by creating a quantum converter, and a new digital image is obtained by combining all the sub-parts. The newly generated digital images are labeled as MNISTQimage+\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\textbf {MNIST}} {\textbf {Q}}<^>{{\textbf {+}}}_{{{\textbf {image}}}}$$\end{document} and are publicly shared along with the original MNIST dataset. The paper evaluates both a custom 3-layer CNN architecture and several pre-trained models, including EfficientNetV2B3, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and ConvNeXt Tiny. After training for 30 epochs, the 3-layer CNN architecture achieved the highest accuracy of 99.23%, significantly outperforming the pre-trained models, with DenseNet-121 achieving 81.70%, EfficientNetV2B3 64.23%, ResNet-50 53.25%, and ConvNeXt Tiny 53.41%. The results highlight the superior performance of the 3-layer CNN in adapting to the quantum-transformed dataset and demonstrate the potential of quantum transformations to enhance the learning ability of classical CNN models. This foundational research aims to pave the way for further exploration into the integration of quantum-transformed datasets in classical deep learning frameworks.

TI Photon-Mediated Stroboscopic Quantum Simulation of a
   Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, aiming at tackling nonperturbative particle and condensed matter physics, has recently received a lot of interest and attention, resulting in many theoretical proposals as well as several experimental implementations. One of the current challenges is to go beyond 1 + 1 dimensions, where four-body (plaquette) interactions, not contained naturally in quantum simulating devices, appear. In this Letter, we propose a method to obtain them based on a combination of stroboscopic optical atomic control and the nonlocal photon-mediated interactions appearing in nanophotonic or cavity QED setups. We illustrate the method for a Z(2) lattice gauge theory. We also show how to prepare the ground state and measure Wilson loops using state-of-the-art techniques in atomic physics.

TI Fast, High-Fidelity Addressed Single-Qubit Gates Using Efficient
   Composite Pulse Sequences
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We use electronic microwave control methods to implement addressed single-qubit gates with high speed and fidelity, for Ca-43(+) hyperfine "atomic clock" qubits in a cryogenic (100 K) surface trap. For a single qubit, we benchmark an error of 1.5 x 10(-6) per Clifford gate (implemented using 600 ns pi/2 pulses). For 2 qubits in the same trap zone (ion separation 5 mu m), we use a spatial microwave field gradient, combined with an efficient four-pulse scheme, to implement independent addressed gates. Parallel randomized benchmarking on both qubits yields an average error 3.4 x 10(-5) per addressed pi/2 gate. The scheme scales theoretically to larger numbers of qubits in a single register.

TI Quantum sensors for biomedical applications
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensors enable new possibilities in biomedical applications due to their high sensitivity. In this Review, the status of quantum sensing is presented, and the path towards real-world applications on the molecular, cellular and organism scale is evaluated.
   Quantum sensors are finding their way from laboratories to the real world, as witnessed by the increasing number of start-ups in this field. The atomic length scale of quantum sensors and their coherence properties enable unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. Biomedical applications could benefit from these quantum technologies, but it is often difficult to evaluate the potential impact of the techniques. This Review sheds light on these questions, presenting the status of quantum sensing applications and discussing their path towards commercialization. The focus is on two promising quantum sensing platforms: optically pumped atomic magnetometers, and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The broad spectrum of biomedical applications is highlighted by four case studies ranging from brain imaging to single-cell spectroscopy.

TI Unitary quantum process tomography with unreliable pure input states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum process tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying a given quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it allows one to characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. The present paper focuses on the estimation of a unitary process. This class is of particular interest because quantum mechanics postulates that the evolution of any closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. The standard approach of QPT is to measure copies of a particular set of predetermined (generally pure) states after they have been modified by the process to be identified. The main problem with this setup is that preparing an input state and setting it precisely to a predetermined value is challenging and thus yields errors. These errors can be decomposed into a sum of centered errors (i.e., whose average on all the copies is zero) and systematic errors that are the same for all the copies. The latter is often the main source of error in QPT. The algorithm we introduce works for any input states that make QPT theoretically possible (i.e., unless there are several solutions due to, e.g., a lack of diversity in the input states). The fact that we do not require the input states to be precisely set to predetermined values means that we can use a trick to remove the issue of systematic errors by considering that some states' copies are unknown but measured before they go through the process to be identified. We achieve this by splitting the copies of each input state into several groups and measuring the copies of the kth group after they have successively been transferred through k instances of the process to be identified (each copy of each input state is used for only a single measurement). Using this approach, we can compute estimates of the measured states before and after they go through the process without using the knowledge we might have about the initial states. We test our algorithm with simulated data, and we assess its performance with a CNOT gate on a trapped -ions qubit quantum computer.

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We numerically study the implementation of a universal two-qubit gate set, composed of CNOT, Hadamard, phase and pi/8 gates, for transmon-based systems. The control signals to implement such gates are obtained using the Chopped Random Basis optimal control technique, with a target gate infidelity of 10(-2). During the optimization processes we account for the leakage toward non-computational states, an important non-ideality affecting transmon qubits. We also test and benchmark the optimal control solutions against the introduction of Gaussian white noise and spectral distortion, two key non-idealities that affect the control signals in transmon systems.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Rate compatible reconciliation for continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution using Raptor-like LDPC codes
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB In the practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system, the postprocessing process, particularly the error correction part, significantly impacts the system performance. Multi-edge type low-density parity-check (MET-LDPC) codes are suitable for CV-QKD systems because of their Shannon-limit-approaching performance at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the process of designing a low-rate MET-LDPC code with good performance is extremely complicated. Thus, we introduce Raptor-like LDPC (RL-LDPC) codes into the CV-QKD system, exhibiting both the rate compatible property of the Raptor code and capacity-approaching performance of MET-LDPC codes. Moreover, this technique can significantly reduce the cost of constructing a new matrix. We design the RL-LDPC matrix with a code rate of 0.02 and easily and effectively adjust this rate from 0.016 to 0.034. Simulation results show that we can achieve more than 98% reconciliation efficiency in a range of code rate variation using only one RL-LDPC code that can support high-speed decoding with an SNR less than -16.45 dB. This code allows the system to maintain a high key extraction rate under various SNRs, paving the way for practical applications of CV-QKD systems with different transmission distances.

TI Exploring quantum perceptron and quantum neural network structures with
   a teacher-student scheme
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Near-term quantum devices can be used to build quantum machine learning models, such as quantum kernel methods and quantum neural networks (QNN), to perform classification tasks. There have been many proposals on how to use variational quantum circuits as quantum perceptrons or as QNNs. The aim of this work is to introduce a teacher-student scheme that could systematically compare any QNN architectures and evaluate their relative expressive power. Specifically, the teacher model generates the datasets mapping random inputs to outputs which then have to be learned by the student models. This way, we avoid training on arbitrary data sets and allow to compare the learning capacity of different models directly via the loss, the prediction map, the accuracy and the relative entropy between the prediction maps. Here, we focus particularly on a quantum perceptron model inspired by the recent work of Tacchino et al. (2019) and compare it to the data re-uploading scheme that was originally introduced by Perez-Salinas et al. (2020). We discuss alterations of the perceptron model and the formation of deep QNN to better understand the role of hidden units and the non-linearities in these architectures.

TI Scalable approach to quantum simulation via projection-based embedding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Owing to the computational complexity of electronic structure algorithms running on classical digital computers, the range of molecular systems amenable to simulation remains tightly circumscribed even after many decades of work. Many believe quantum computers will transcend such limitations although in the current era the size and noise of these devices militates against significant progress. Here we describe a chemically intuitive approach that permits a subdomain of a molecule's electronic structure to be calculated accurately on a quantum device, while the rest of the molecule is described at a lower level of accuracy using density functional theory running on a classical computer. We demonstrate that this approach produces improved results for molecules that cannot be simulated fully on current quantum computers but which can be resolved classically at a cheaper level of approximation. The algorithm is tunable, so that the size of the quantum simulation can be adjusted to run on available quantum resources. Therefore, as quantum devices become larger, this method will enable increasingly large subdomains to be studied accurately.

TI Quantum Game Theory-Based Cloud Resource Allocation: A Novel Approach
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper explores the application of quantum game theory to optimize cloud resource allocation. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, the proposed framework aims to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve scalability in cloud computing environments. The study introduces a quantum-based game-theoretic model and compares its performance with classical approaches. The results demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and decision-making efficiency. While prior works have explored classical game theory and auction-based methods, this study is among the first to implement quantum game theory in a practical cloud computing context, propose a resource allocation mechanism that incorporates both fairness and efficiency while leveraging the computational advantages of quantum systems, and highlight the strategic benefits of quantum entanglement in fostering collaboration between competing entities in cloud environments. This work not only addresses the current limitations of resource allocation but also redefines the possibilities for optimization in complex systems, making a substantial contribution to both quantum computing and cloud resource management domains.

TI Towards Quantum Simulation of Black Holes in a dc-SQUID Array
SO UNIVERSE
AB We propose quantum simulations of 1 + 1D radial sections of different black hole spacetimes (Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr and Kerr-Newman), by means of a dc-SQUID array embedded on an open transmission line. This was achieved by reproducing the spatiotemporal dependence of 1 + 1D sections of the spacetime metric with the propagation speed of the electromagnetic field in the simulator, which can be modulated by an external magnetic flux. We show that the generation of event horizons-and therefore Hawking radiation-in the simulator could be achieved for non-rotating black holes, although we discuss limitations related to fluctuations of the quantum phase. In the case of rotating black holes, it seems that the simulation of ergospheres is beyond reach.

TI Automated Charge Transition Detection in Quantum Dot Charge Stability
   Diagrams
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots require an appropriate number of electrons to function as qubits. The number of electrons is usually tuned by analyzing charge stability diagrams, in which charge transitions manifest as edges. Therefore, to fully automate qubit tuning, it is necessary to recognize these edges automatically and reliably. This article investigates possible detection methods, describes their training with simulated data from the SimCATS framework, and performs a quantitative comparison with a future hardware implementation in mind. Furthermore, we investigated the quality of the optimized approaches on experimentally measured data from a GaAs and a SiGe qubit sample.

TI Suppressing classical noise in the accelerated geometric phase gate by
   optimized dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the quantum-computation scenario, the geometric phase gates are becoming increasingly attractive for their intrinsic fault tolerance to disturbance. With an adiabatic cyclic evolution, Berry phase appears to realize a geometric transformation. Performing the quantum gates as many as possible within the timescale of coherence, however, remains an inconvenient bottleneck due to the systematic errors. Here we propose an accelerated adiabatic quantum gate based on the Berry phase, the transitionless driving, and the dynamical decoupling. It reconciles a high fidelity with a high speed in the presence of control noise or imperfection. We optimize the dynamical-decoupling sequence in the time domain under a popular Gaussian noise spectrum following the inversely quadratic power law.

TI Multi-shot readout error benchmark of the nitrogen-vacancy center's
   electronic qubit
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as Delta /root N , with N being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient Delta as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.

AB In recent years, standard CMOS microprocessors have approached their maximum power dissipation per unit area, effectively placing a limit on computational power. This highlights the urgent need to explore alternative technologies. One promising avenue is the use of superconductors, which demonstrate zero resistivity below a critical temperature. However, circuits based on superconductors necessitate the use of cryostats to maintain low temperatures, presenting challenges in data transfer with the room temperature environment. While coaxial cables are often employed for this purpose, they suffer from limited data transfer rates and contribute significantly to heat load. On the contrary, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) coupled with optical fibers present a viable solution. They enable scalable, cost-effective, and power-efficient optical interconnections capable of supporting high data transfer rates while minimizing heat transfer. In this presentation, We will discuss the latest advancements in cryogenic PICs, focusing on their application in interfacing with cryogenic computing systems such as single-flux-quantum logic circuits and superconducting qubits.

TI Clifford Circuit Optimization with Templates and Symbolic Pauli Gates
SO QUANTUM
AB The Clifford group is a finite subgroup of the unitary group generated by the Hadamard, the CNOT, and the Phase gates. This group plays a prominent role in quantum error correction, randomized benchmarking protocols, and the study of entanglement. Here we consider the problem of finding a short quantum circuit implementing a given Clifford group element. Our methods aim to minimize the entangling gate count assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity. First, we consider circuit optimization based on template matching and design Clifford-specific templates that leverage the ability to factor out Pauli and SWAP gates. Second, we introduce a symbolic peephole optimization method. It works by projecting the full circuit onto a small subset of qubits and optimally recompiling the projected subcircuit via dynamic programming. CNOT gates coupling the chosen subset of qubits with the remaining qubits are expressed using symbolic Pauli gates. Software implementation of these methods finds circuits that are only 0.2% away from optimal for 6 qubits and reduces the two-qubit gate count in circuits with up to 64 qubits by 64.7% on average, compared to the Aaronson-Gottesman canonical form [3].

TI Modeling the effect of steering mirrors on polarization for free-space
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTIK
AB In polarization-encoding free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), unwanted variations in the states of polarization may cause errors, leading to an increase in the quantum bit error rate (QBER), and a reduction of the Secure Key Rate (SKR). Optical elements that reflect or transmit the quantum signal at the transmitter and/or receiver are the main cause of polarization variations in the quantum states. Although most of these optical elements affect polarization in a constant manner, requiring relatively simple compensation techniques, mobile elements such as steering mirrors, cause time-varying polarization variations that are more complex to characterize and correct. In this work, we simulate the effect of steering mirrors' typical values of angular rotation on the QBER. In particular, we show that, for most cases, an active correction of the polarization reference frame and a passive correction of the phase shift between the electric field components is sufficient to obtain QBER values due to the steering mirrors below 0.2%. This avoids the need of a fully active correction strategy, which increases the complexity, weight, and cost of the implementation. Furthermore, we present different design considerations to further reduce the steering mirrors' contribution to the QBER (less than 0.05%).

TI Observation of exceptional point in a PT broken non-Hermitian system
   simulated using a quantum circuit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Exceptional points (EPs), the degeneracy points of non-Hermitian systems, have recently attracted great attention because of their potential of enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Unlike the usual degeneracies in Hermitian systems, at EPs, both the eigenenergies and eigenvectors coalesce. Although EPs have been widely explored, the range of EPs studied is largely limited by the underlying systems, for instance, higher-order EPs are hard to achieve. Here we propose an extendable method to simulate non-Hermitian systems and study EPs with quantum circuits. The system is inherently parity-time (PT) broken due to the non-symmetric controlling effects of the circuit. Inspired by the quantum Zeno effect, the circuit structure guarantees the success rate of the post-selection. A sample circuit is implemented in a quantum programming framework, and the phase transition at EP is demonstrated. Considering the scalable and flexible nature of quantum circuits, our model is capable of simulating large-scale systems with higher-order EPs.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Sensing with Squeezed Light: From Fundamentals to

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Squeezed light, a prominent non-classical state of light, exhibits reduced quantum noise in one quadrature component below the standard quantum limit (SQL). The property enables quantum-enhanced precision measurements, surpassing the SQL in quantum sensing applications. This review comprehensively introduces the fundamental concepts, classifications, and experimental generation techniques of squeezed light. It further explores its pivotal role and recent advances in diverse quantum sensing domains, including interferometry, gravitational wave detection, magnetometry, force sensing, biomedical sensing, and quantum radar. The review covers theoretical foundations of squeezed states (including quadrature operators and classification schemes, experimental generation techniques in atomic ensembles, nonlinear crystals, and fibers), fundamentals of quantum sensing with squeezed light (from quantum noise theory to quantum-enhanced metrology), and quantum-enhanced sensing applications across the aforementioned domains. Finally, future challenges and opportunities in the field are discussed.

TI Quantum algorithms and approximating polynomials for composed functions
   with shared inputs
SO QUANTUM
AB We give new quantum algorithms for evaluating composed functions whose inputs may be shared between bottom-level gates. Let f be an m-bit Boolean function and consider an n-bit function F obtained by applying f to conjunctions of possibly overlapping subsets of n variables. If f has quantum query complexity Q(f), we give an algorithm for evaluating F using (O) over tilde(root Q(f).n) quantum queries. This improves on the bound of O(Q(f).root n) that follows by treating each conjunction independently, and our bound is tight for worst-case choices of f. Using completely different techniques, we prove a similar tight composition theorem for the approximate degree of f.
   By recursively applying our composition theorems, we obtain a nearly optimal (O) over tilde (n(1-2-d)) upper bound on the quantum query complexity and approximate degree of linear-size depth-d AC(0) circuits. As a consequence, such circuits can be PAC learned in subexponential time, even in the challenging agnostic setting. Prior to our work, a subexponential-time algorithm was not known even for linear-size depth-3 AC(0) circuits.
   As an additional consequence, we show that AC(0) circle circle plus circuits of depth d +1 require size (Omega) over tilde (n(1/(1-2-d))) > omega(n(1+2-d)) to compute the Inner Product function even on average. The previous best size lower bound was Omega(n(1+4-(d+1))) and only held in the worst case (Cheraghchi et al., JCSS 2018).

TI Deterministic Nanofabrication of Quantum Dot - Circular Bragg Grating
   Resonators with High Process Yield Using In Situ Electron Beam
   Lithography
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in situ electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into a circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality. To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for use in photonic quantum technology applications.

TI Control of a Josephson Digital Phase Detector via an SFQ-Based Flux Bias

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computation requires high-fidelity qubit readout, preserving the quantum state. In the case of superconductings qubits, readout is typically performed using a complex analog experimental setup operating at room temperature, which poses significant technological and economic barriers to large system scalability. An alternative approach is to perform a cryogenic on-chip qubit readout based on a Josephson digital phase detector (JDPD): a flux switchable device capable of digitizing the phase sign of a coherent input. The readout operation includes the flux excitation of the JDPD to evolve from a single- to a double-minima potential. In this work, the effect of the flux bias characteristics on the JDPD performances is studied numerically. To meet the identified requirements that maximize detection fidelity and tackle the engineering challenges, a cryogenic on-chip single flux quantum-based flux bias driver is proposed and discussed.

TI Noisy monitored quantum dynamics of ergodic multi-qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB I employ random-matrix methods to set up and solve statistical models of noisy nonunitary dynamics that appear in the context of monitored quantum systems. The models cover a range of scenarios combining random dynamics and measurements of variable strength of one or several qubits. The combined dynamics drive the system into states whose statistics reflect the competition of randomizing unitary evolution and the measurement-induced backaction collapsing the state. These effects are mediated by entanglement, as I describe in detail by analytical results. For the paradigmatic case of monitoring via a single designated qubit, this reveals a simple statistical mechanism, in which the monitoring conditions the state of the monitored qubit, which then imposes statistical constraints on the remaining quantities of the system. For the case of monitoring several qubits with prescribed strength, the developed formalism allows one to set up the statistical description and solve it numerically. Finally, I also compare the analytical results to the monitored dynamics of a quantum kicked top, revealing two regimes where the statistical model either describes the full stationary dynamics, or resolves time scales during particular parts of the evolution.

TI Generation of non-Gaussian states of light using deterministic photon
   subtraction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We explore a recently demonstrated deterministic photon subtraction scheme, based on single-photon Raman interaction with a Lambda-type three-level atom, as a tool for manipulating quantum state of few-photon light pulses. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework using input-output formalism and quantum regression theorem, enabling calculation of the first order autocorrelation matrices of the output light and identification of the temporal modes present in the generated light via their eigendecomposition. By modeling the entire system as a quantum network consisting multiple virtual cavities and a lambda-type emitter cascaded in two parallel guided modes of opposite propagation directions, we extract the quantum state occupying the modes of interest. For both squeezed vacuum and coherent light input pulses, the Wigner function of the output light after photon subtraction clearly reveals its non-Gaussian character. Furthermore, we propose a measurement-based scheme on the subtracted photon which can lead to conditional generation of quantum states resembling Schrodinger's kitten state directly from coherent input light with fidelities above 99%. This result is particularly nothworthy, as coherent pulses, unlike the squeezed vacuum inputs commonly used in previous studies, are readily available in most experimental setups.

TI Quantum enhancement of qutrit dynamics of a three-level giant atom
   coupling to a one-dimensional waveguide
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Dynamics of quantum coherence and non-Markovianity of a three-level giant atom coupling to a one-dimensional waveguide and a classical field are investigated theoretically. The time delay of the photo propagation in the waveguide is taken into account and our aim is to access the collective impact of a waveguide and classical control of the system on the time evolution of coherence and non-Markovianity. For a giant atom, we find that the various values of the accumulated phase and time delay does not make much difference for the coherence evolution but there exists non-Markovian behavior for the vast majority of the chosen parameter values. With regard to the initial relative phase, the quantum coherence takes a monotonic behavior for a small atom but decreases with oscillations for a giant atom with majority values of the initial relative phase. Quantum coherence of a small atom decreases monotonically with regardless of the Rabi frequency and the atom's detuning to a large extent but a large Rabi frequency or a large atom's detuning will induce non-Markovian behavior for a giant atom. With a comparative analysis, the coherence evolution is enhanced significantly in that there is non-Markovian behavior for the dynamics of quantum coherence in a much larger range of scaled time for a giant atom than that for a small atom. Our study provide clues to preserve and to enhance quantum coherence in qutrit systems.

TI Spontaneous decay of artificial atoms in a multi-qubit system
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB We consider a one-dimensional chain of N equidistantly spaced noninteracting qubits embedded in an open waveguide. In the frame of single-excitation subspace, we systematically study the evolution of qubits' amplitudes if the only qubit in the chain was initially excited. We show that the temporal dynamics of qubits' amplitudes crucially depend on the value of kd, where k is the wave vector, d is a distance between neighbor qubits. If kd is equal to an integer multiple of pi, then the qubits are excited to a stationary level which scales as N-1. We show that in this case, it is the dark states which prevent qubits from decaying to zero even though they do not contribute to the output spectrum of photon emission. For other values of kd the excitations of qubits have the form of damping oscillations, which represent the vacuum Rabi oscillations in a multi-qubit system. In this case, the output spectrum of photon radiation is defined by a subradiant state with the smallest width.

TI Mitigating variability in epitaxial-heterostructure-based spin-qubit
   devices by optimizing gate layout
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The scalability of spin-qubit devices is conditioned by qubit-to-qubit variability. Disorder in the host materials indeed affects the wave functions of the confined carriers, which leads to variations in their charge and spin properties. Charge disorder in the amorphous oxides is particularly detrimental owing to its long-range influence. Here we analyze the effects of charge traps at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which are generally believed to play a dominant role in variability. We consider multiple random distributions of these interface traps and numerically calculate their impact on the chemical potentials, detuning, and tunnel coupling of two adjacent quantum dots in SiGe heterostructure. Our results highlight the beneficial screening effect of the metal gates. The surface of the heterostructure shall, therefore, be covered as much as possible by the gates in order to limit variability. We propose an alternative layout with tip-shaped gates that maximizes the coverage of the semiconductor-oxide interface and outperforms the usual planar layout in some regimes. This highlights the importance of design in the management of device-to-device variability.

TI Quantum Computing Based Collaborative Optimum Mission Allocation
   Approach for Heterogeneous Multi Unmanned Vehicles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the developing autonomous driving technologies today, unmanned vehicles - unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned marine vehicles (UMV) - autonomously reach the desired target without human intervention. However, effective and efficient methods for the coordination of these vehicles in multiples need to be developed. Quantum computing has much more potential than classical computers due to its nature. In this study, a quantum-classical hybrid system is proposed to ensure that autonomous transportation unmanned vehicles can assign tasks in a collaborative and fully autonomous manner. Since the constraints of land vehicles navigating on roads and marine vehicles navigating at sea are taken into account in the study, the problem is approached from a different perspective compared to common studies in the literature. First, the QEA algorithm used in the ranking operations was adapted to the problem. Improvements were made to the adapted method to increase its performance. Then, a framework was proposed to operate this method as a quantum-classical hybrid. Significant contributions have been made to the proposed quantum-classical hybrid method by offering advantages in learning the parameters and solution update equations. The problem was solved using classical genetic algorithms (GA), QEA and the proposed method, and their solution performances were compared. It was observed that the proposed method was superior to QEA and produced results very close to those produced by GA. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Implementing the method as a quantum-classical hybrid brings one step closer to the goal of realizing the solution in a quantum environment.

TI Two-qubit atomic gates: spatio-temporal control of Rydberg interaction
SO NANOSCALE
AB By controlling the temporal and spatial features of light, we propose a novel protocol to prepare two-qubit entangling gates on atoms trapped at close distance, which could potentially speed up the operation of the gate from the sub-micro to the nanosecond scale. The protocol is robust to variations in the pulse areas and the position of the atoms, by virtue of the coherent properties of a dark state, which is used to drive the population through Rydberg states. From the time-domain perspective, the protocol generalizes the one proposed by Jaksch and coworkers [Jaksch et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2000, 85, 2208], with three pulses that operate symmetrically in time, but with different pulse areas. From the spatial-domain perspective, it uses structured light. We analyze the map of the gate fidelity, which forms rotated and distorted lattices in the solution space. Finally, we study the effect of an additional qubit to the gate performance and propose generalizations that operate with multi-pulse sequences.

TI Transmon Qubit constraints on dark matter-nucleon scattering
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We recently pointed out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices can be used to detect dark matter. These devices have the lowest known energy thresholds, far surpassing standard direct detection experiments, requiring energy deposition above only about an meV. We calculate dark matter induced quasiparticle densities in transmon qubits, and use the latest transmon qubit measurements that provide one of the strongest existing lab-based bounds on dark matter-nucleon scattering below about 100 MeV. We strongly constrain sub-component dark matter, using both a dark matter population thermalized in the Earth as well as the dark matter wind from the Galactic halo. We demonstrate future potential sensitivities using devices with low quasiparticle densities.

TI Effective Excess Noise Suppression in Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution through Carrier Frequency Switching
SO ENTROPY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a promising protocol that can be easily integrated with classical optical communication systems. However, in the case of quantum-classical co-transmissions, such as dense wavelength division multiplexing with classical channels and time division multiplexing with large-power classical signal, a quantum signal is more susceptible to crosstalk caused by a classical signal, leading to signal distortion and key distribution performance reduction. To address this issue, we propose a noise-suppression scheme based on carrier frequency switching (CFS) that can effectively mitigate the influence of large-power random noise on the weak coherent state. In this noise-suppression scheme, a minimum-value window of the channel's noise power spectrum is searched for and the transmission signal frequency spectrum shifts to the corresponding frequency to avoid large-power channel noise. A digital filter is also utilized to filter out most of the channel noise. Simulation results show that compared to the traditional fixed carrier frequency scheme, the proposed noise-suppression scheme can reduce the excess noise to 1.8%, and the secret key rate can be increased by 1.43 to 2.86 times at different distances. This noise-suppression scheme is expected to be applied in scenarios like quantum-classical co-transmission and multi-QKD co-transmission to provide noise-suppression solutions.

TI Low-loss polarization-maintaining optical router for photonic quantum
   information processing
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In photonic quantum applications, optical routers are required to handle single photons with low loss, high speed, and preservation of their quantum states. Single-photon routing with maintained polarization states is particularly important for utilizing them as qubits. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-maintaining electro-optic router compatible with single photons. Our custom electro-optic modulator is embedded in a configuration of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where each optical component achieves polarization-maintaining operation. We observe the performance of the router with 2%-4% loss, 20 dB switching extinction ratio, 2.9 ns rise time, and >99% polarization process fidelity to an ideal identity operation.

TI Effect of Nonunital Noise on Random-Circuit Sampling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, drawing inspiration from the type of noise present in real hardware, we study the output distribution of random quantum circuits under practical nonunital noise sources with constant noise rates. We show that even in the presence of unital sources such as the depolarizing channel, the distribution, under the combined noise channel, never resembles a maximally entropic distribution at any depth. To show this, we prove that the output distribution of such circuits never anticoncentrates-meaning that it is never too "flat"-regardless of the depth of the circuit. This is in stark contrast to the behavior of noiseless random quantum circuits or those with only unital noise, both of which anticoncentrate at sufficiently large depths. As a consequence, our results shows that the complexity of random-circuit sampling under realistic noise is still an open question, since anticoncentration is a critical property exploited by both state-of-the-art classical hardness and easiness results.

TI Cryogenic CMOS Analog Circuits and Chip Packaging Techniques towards
   Large-Scale Silicon Quantum Computers
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS
AB Silicon spin qubits are a promising technology for scalable quantum computing, leveraging their inherent compatibility with CMOS integration process. However, as the number of silicon spin qubits increases, the exponential growth in signal cables required to control qubits within a dilution refrigerator become a significant bottleneck, along with the thermal inflow from external control systems. In addition, the implementation of signal wiring for qubit chips with a large number of I/O pads and internal heat generation of qubits themselves are also barriers to scale-up. To address these issues, we have developed cryogenic CMOS (Cryo-CMOS) analog circuits and advanced chip packaging techniques at deep cryogenic temperatures inside the refrigerator. These techniques enable the implementation of extensive signal wiring while suppressing heat generation, contributing to the realization of large-scale silicon spin qubit control. In this paper, we introduce cryogenic analog circuit designs including digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for biasing spin qubits and acquiring their environmental data, respectively, with a focus on low power consumption and small area to meet space and power budget within the refrigerator. Furthermore, we introduce cryogenic flip-chip packaging techniques using silicon interposer and Cu-Cu bonding technology to enhance heat dissipation as examples of packaging strategies for installing large-scale qubit chips. These proposed techniques have been implemented as prototype chips, and their effectiveness has been demonstrated through cryogenic experiments using refrigerators.

TI Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit
   geometries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We revisit the integrability of quantum circuits constructed from two-qubit unitary gates U that satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. A brickwork arrangement of U typically corresponds to an integrable Trotterization of some Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we consider more general circuit geometries which include circuits without any nontrivial space periodicity. We show that any time-periodic quantum circuit in which U is applied to each pair of neighbouring qubits exactly once per period remains integrable. We further generalize this framework to circuits with time-varying two-qubit gates. The spatial arrangement of gates in the integrable circuits considered herein can break the space-reflection symmetry even when U itself is symmetric. By analysing the dynamical spin susceptibility on ballistic hydrodynamic scale, we investigate how an asymmetric arrangement of gates affects the spin transport. While it induces nonzero higher odd moments in the dynamical spin susceptibility, the first moment, which corresponds to a drift in the spreading of correlations, remains zero. We explain this within a quasiparticle picture which suggests that a nonzero drift necessitates gates acting on distinct degrees of freedom.To the memory of Marko Medenjak, a dear friend and a brilliant colleague.

TI The Proposal of a Fully Quantum Neural Network and Fidelity-Driven
   Training Using Directional Gradients for Multi-Class Classification
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In this work, we present a training method for a Fully Quantum Neural Network (FQNN) based entirely on quantum circuits. The model processes data exclusively through quantum operations, without incorporating classical neural network layers. In the proposed architecture, the roles of classical neurons and weights are assumed, respectively, by qubits and parameterized quantum gates: input features are encoded into quantum states of qubits, while the network weights correspond to the rotation angles of quantum gates that govern the system's state evolution. The optimization of gate parameters is performed using directional gradient estimation, where gradients are numerically approximated via finite differences, eliminating the need for analytic derivation. The training objective is defined as the quantum-state fidelity, which measures the similarity between the network's output state and a reference state representing the correct class. Experiments were conducted using the Qiskit AerSimulator, which allows for the accurate simulation of quantum circuits on a classical computer. The proposed approach was applied to the classification of the Iris dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the FQNN is capable of effectively learning to distinguish between classes based on input features, achieving stable test accuracy across runs. These findings confirm the feasibility of constructing fully quantum classifiers without relying on hybrid quantum-classical architectures. The FQNN architecture consists of multiple quantum layers, each incorporating parameterized rotation operations and entanglement between qubits. The number of layers is determined by the ratio of quantum parameters (weights) to the number of input features. Each layer functions analogously to a hidden layer in a classical neural network, transforming the quantum-state space into a richer feature representation through controlled quantum operations. As a result, the network is capable of dynamically modeling dependencies among input features without the use of classical activation functions.

TI Secure and robust randomness with sequential quantum measurements
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum correlations between measurements of separated observers are crucial for applications like randomness generation and key distribution. Although device-independent security can be certified with minimal assumptions, current protocols have limited performance. Here, we exploit sequential measurements, defined with a precise temporal order, to enhance performance by reusing quantum states. We provide a geometric perspective and a general mathematical framework, analytically proving a Tsirelson-like boundary for sequential quantum correlations, which represents a trade-off in nonlocality shared by sequential users. This boundary is advantageous for secure quantum randomness generation, certifying maximum bits per state with one remote and two sequential parties, even if one sequential user shares no nonlocality. Our simple qubit protocol reaches this boundary, and numerical analysis shows improved robustness under realistic noise. A photonic implementation confirms feasibility and robustness. This study advances the understanding of sequential quantum correlations and offers insights for efficient device-independent protocols.

TI Hamiltonian of a flux qubit-LC oscillator circuit in the
   deep-strong-coupling regime
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We derive the Hamiltonian of a superconducting circuit that comprises a single-Josephson-junction flux qubit inductively coupled to an LC oscillator, and we compare the derived circuit Hamiltonian with the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, which describes a two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. We show that there is a simple, intuitive correspondence between the circuit Hamiltonian and the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian. While there is an overall shift of the entire spectrum, the energy level structure of the circuit Hamiltonian up to the seventh excited states can still be fitted well by the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian even in the case where the coupling strength is larger than the frequencies of the qubit and the oscillator, i.e., when the qubit-oscillator circuit is in the deep-strong-coupling regime. We also show that although the circuit Hamiltonian can be transformed via a unitary transformation to a Hamiltonian containing a capacitive coupling term, the resulting circuit Hamiltonian cannot be approximated by the variant of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian that is obtained using an analogous procedure for mapping the circuit variables onto Pauli and harmonic oscillator operators, even for relatively weak coupling. This difference between the flux and charge gauges follows from the properties of the qubit Hamiltonian eigenstates.

TI Multipartite entanglement generation with high-order non-Hermitian
   exceptional points from dressing-controlled atomic nonlinearity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multipartite entanglement has emerged as a valuable quantum resource for construct-ing large-scale quantum networks. However, the presence of non-Hermitian features induced by natural microscopic quantum systems significantly modifies the overall response of nonlinear parametric processes, thereby enabling direct manipulation of multipartite entanglement proper-ties. In this study, we demonstrate the generation of multimode entanglement through atomic four-wave mixing (FWM) and analyze the properties of exceptional points (EP) under dressing control in non-Hermitian systems. By leveraging dressing-controlled atomic nonlinearity, we achieve versatile EPs and higher-order EPs by carefully tuning the atomic multi-parameter in the cascading FWM system. Additionally, we investigate the entanglement properties of various permutations of the output signal modes using the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion. Notably, under non-Hermitian control, the application of single-, double-, and N-dressing splits leads to coherent multichannel control and further extends the scale of quantum entanglement. The outcomes of our research offer a novel approach to actively control non-Hermitian quantum phenomena without relying on artificial photonic structures. Furthermore, this paves the way for the realization of complex quantum information tasks by exploiting the non-Hermitian characteristics of the light-matter interaction.

TI Strengthening practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution
   against measurement angular error
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The optical phase shifter that constantly rotates the local oscillator phase is a necessity in continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems with heterodyne detection. In previous experimental implementations, the optical phase shifter is generally regarded as an ideal passive optical device that perfectly rotates the phase of the electromagnetic wave of 90 degrees. However, the optical phase shifter in practice introduces imperfections, mainly the measurement angular error, which inevitably deteriorates the security of the practical systems. Here, we will give a concrete interpretation of measurement angular error in practical systems and the corresponding entanglement-based description. Subsequently, from the parameter estimation, we deduce the overestimated excess noise and the underestimated transmittance, which lead to a reduction in the final secret key rate. Simultaneously, we propose an estimation method of the measurement angular error. Next, the practical security analysis is provided in detail, and the effect of the measurement angular error and its corresponding compensation scheme are demonstrated. We conclude that measurement angular error severely degrades the security, but the proposed calibration and compensation method can significantly help improve the performance of the practical CV-QKD systems.

TI SPARQ: Efficient Entanglement Distribution and Routing in
   Space–Air–Ground Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, a space-air-ground quantum (SPARQ) network is developed as a means for providing a seamless on-demand entanglement distribution. The node mobility in SPARQ poses significant challenges to entanglement routing. Existing quantum routing algorithms focus on stationary ground nodes and utilize link distance as an optimality metric, which is unrealistic for dynamic systems, like SPARQ. Moreover, in contrast to the prior art that assumes homogeneous nodes, SPARQ encompasses heterogeneous nodes with different functionalities further complicates the entanglement distribution. To solve the entanglement routing problem, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework is proposed and trained using deep Q-network (DQN) on multiple graphs of SPARQ to account for the network dynamics. Subsequently, an entanglement distribution policy, third-party entanglement distribution (TPED), is proposed to establish entanglement between communication parties. A realistic quantum network simulator is designed for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that the TPED policy improves entanglement fidelity by 3% and reduces memory consumption by 50% compared with benchmark. The results also show that the proposed DQN algorithm improves the number of resolved teleportation requests by 39% compared with shortest path baseline and the entanglement fidelity by 2% compared with an RL algorithm that is based on long short-term memory. It also improved entanglement fidelity by 6% and 9% compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, the entanglement fidelity is improved by 15% compared with DQN trained on a snapshot of SPARQ. Additionally, SPARQ enhances the average entanglement fidelity by 23.5% compared with existing networks spanning only space and ground layers.

TI Feasibility of a Novel Quantum Communication Protocol in Jerlov Type I
   Water
SO ENTROPY
AB Underwater communication based on the use of optical quantum resources has attracted a lot of attention in the last five years due to the potential advantages offered by quantum states of light. In this context, we propose to operate in the mesoscopic intensity regime, where the optical states are well populated and the employed detectors have photon-number resolution. By exploiting these features, we demonstrate that a novel communication protocol based on the experimental quantification of nonclassicality of mesoscopic twin-beam states can be used to transmit binary signals encoded in two single-mode pseudothermal states with different mean values through a Jerlov type I water channel. The experimental results are in perfect agreement with the developed theoretical model, and the feasibility of the protocol is also investigated as a function of the data samples corresponding to each one of the two signals. The good quality of the results encourages a more realistic implementation of the protocol, also exploring the maximum distance at which the quantum states remain nonclassical and thus can be still properly discriminated.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Superconducting quantum computing is at the forefront of demonstrating quantum advantages for revolutionary applications in science and technology. One key component for the readout of qubit state information is given by superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) due to their low power dissipation and unprecedented quantum-limited noise performance. This work presents a black-box circuit quantum electrodynamic model for TWPAs with arbitrary superconducting nonlinear elements. A unified Hamiltonian description for directly pumped and flux-driven amplifiers is derived, and analytic results for the gain and the added quantum noise are presented, closely matching recent experimental realizations. We also offer an optimization strategy for nonlinear elements for large gain and low noise based on the proposed black-box quantum model. The results of this article will be helpful in the design and multitarget optimization of new and improved quantum-limited low-noise amplifiers.

TI Numerical method for finite-size security analysis of quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure information exchange with untrusted quantum links between remote communication parties. A central task in the studies of QKD protocols is security analysis, which aims at deriving the length of the final key such that it is secure regardless of the eavesdropper's computational power. In literature, the security analysis has been done both analytically and numerically. Compared to analytical methods which tend to require techniques specific to each QKD protocol, numerical ones are more general since they can be directly applied to many QKD protocols with little adaptation. However, current numerical methods are carried out based on some assumptions such as working in the asymptotic limit and collective attacks from eavesdroppers. In this work, we remove these assumptions and develop a numerical finite-size security analysis against general attacks for a large class of QKD protocols. We also give an example of applying the method to the recent phase-matching QKD protocol with a simplified protocol design. Our result shows that the finite-size key rate can surpass the linear key-rate bound with a practical QKD system operated for only several hours.

AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. The braiding of MZMs can be used toconstruct the basic unit - topological qubit - of the topological quantum computation, which is immune toenvironmental noise and can achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. The existing MZM platforms includehybrid structures such as topological insulator/superconductor, semiconducting nanowire/superconductor and1d magnetic atomic chain/superconductor, and single materials such as 2M-WS2, 4Hb-TaS2, and iron-basedsuperconductors (IBSs). The IBSs have advantages such as easy to fabricate, pure MZMs and high survivingtemperatures of MZMs. Recently, a large-scale, ordered and tunable MZM lattice has been observed in LiFeAs,which provides a promising platform to future topological quantum computation. In this paper, first, we reviewthe experimental observations of MZMs in IBSs, focusing on FeTe0.55Se0.45, (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe, CaKFe(4)As(4)and LiFeAs. Next, we introduce the critical experimental evidences of the MZMs. We also review the recentresearch work on the ordered and tunable MZM lattice in LiFeAs.

TI Solving Vehicle Routing Problem Using Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are a critical component of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, particularly having applications in logistic management. One of their crucial utilization is in supply-chain management and scheduling for optimally routing transportation of goods by vehicles at a given set of locations. This paper discusses the broader problem of vehicle traffic management, more popularly known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and investigates the possible use of near-term quantum devices for solving it. For this purpose, we give the Ising formulation for VRP and some of its constrained variants. Then, we present a detailed procedure to solve VRP by minimizing its corresponding Ising Hamiltonian using a hybrid quantum-classical heuristic called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), implemented on the IBM Qiskit platform. We compare the performance of QAOA with classical solvers such as CPLEX on problem instances of up to 15 qubits. We find that performance of QAOA has a multifaceted dependence on the classical optimization routine used, the depth of the ansatz parameterized by p, initialization of variational parameters, and problem instance itself.

TI Quantum-inspired classification based on quantum state discrimination
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We present quantum-inspired algorithms for classification tasks inspired by the problem of quantum state discrimination. While these algorithms could be implemented on a quantum computer, we focus here on their classical implementation. The training of some of these classifiers involves semi-definite programming to find the optimal measurement for the quantum state discrimination problem. We examine how the optimal solution for state discrimination behaves for classification tasks. We also present a relaxation of these classifiers that utilizes linear programming (but that can no longer be interpreted as a quantum measurement). Finally, we consider a classifier based on the pretty good measurement (PGM) and show how to implement it using an analog of the so-called Kernel Trick, which allows us to study its performance on any number of copies of the input state. We evaluate these classifiers on the MNIST and MNIST-1D datasets and find that the PGM generally outperforms the other quantum-inspired classifiers, although it does not perform as well as other, classical, classifiers. Our work thus provides a deeper understanding of the relation between quantum state discrimination and quantum machine learning methods, as well as of the use of kernel methods for quantum machine learning.

TI A rigorous and robust quantum speed-up in supervised machine learning
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Many quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed, but it is typically unknown whether they would outperform classical methods on practical devices. A specially constructed algorithm shows that a formal quantum advantage is possible.
   Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed that may offer quantum speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Most of these algorithms are either heuristic or assume that data can be accessed quantum-mechanically, making it unclear whether a quantum advantage can be proven without resorting to strong assumptions. Here we construct a classification problem with which we can rigorously show that heuristic quantum kernel methods can provide an end-to-end quantum speed-up with only classical access to data. To prove the quantum speed-up, we construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Furthermore, we construct a family of parameterized unitary circuits, which can be efficiently implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and use them to map the data samples to a quantum feature space and estimate the kernel entries. The resulting quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.

TI Practical Security of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   Ascribable to Imperfect Modulator for Fiber Channel
SO MATHEMATICS
AB An amplitude modulator plays an essential role in the implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), whereas it may bring about a potential security loophole in the practical system. The high-frequency modulation of the actual transmitter usually results in the high rate of the system. However, an imperfect amplitude modulator (AM) can give birth to a potential information leakage from the modulation of the transmitter. To reveal a potential security loophole from the high-frequency AM embedded in the transmitter, we demonstrate an influence on the practical security of the system in terms of the secret key rate and maximal transmission distance. The results indicate the risk of this security loophole in the imperfect AM-embedded transmitter. Fortunately, the legal participants can trace back the potential information leakage that has been produced from the imperfect transmitter at high frequencies, which can be used for defeating the leakage attack in CVQKD. We find the limitations of the imperfect AM-embedded transmitter of the high-frequency quantum system, and hence, we have to trade off the practical security and the modulation frequency of the AM-embedded transmitter while considering its implementation in a practical environment.

TI An Architecture Superposing Indefinite Causal Order and Path
   Superposition Improving Pauli Channels' Parameter Estimation
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum Parameter Estimation (QPE) is commonly led using quantum probe states for the characterization of quantum systems. For these purposes, Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) plays a crucial role by imposing a lower bound for the parametric estimation of quantum channels. Several schemes for obtaining QFI lower bounds have been proposed, particularly for Pauli channels regarding qubits. Those schemes commonly employ either the individual channel, multiple copies of it, or arrangements including communication architectures. The present work aims to propose an architecture involving path superposition and causal indefinite order in superposition. Thus, by controlling the symmetry balance of this superposition, it reaches notable improvements in quantum parameter estimation. The proposed architecture has been tested to find the best possible QPE bounds for a representative and emblematic set of Pauli channels. Further, for the most reluctant channels, it was revisited testing the architecture again under a primary path superposition (using double teleportation) and also using entangled probe states to recombine their outputs with the original undisturbed state. Notable outcomes practically near zero were found for the QPE bounds, stating a hierarchy between the approaches, but anyway reaching a perfect theoretical QPE, particularly for the last path superposition including the proposed architecture.

TI Optimal individual and collective measurements for nonorthogonal quantum
   key distribution signals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider how the theory of optimal quantum measurements determines the maximum information available to the receiving party of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system employing linearly independent but nonorthogonal quantum states. Such a setting is characteristic of several practical QKD protocols. Due to nonorthogonality, the receiver is not able to discriminate unambiguously between the signals. To understand the fundamental limits that this imposes, the quantity of interest is the maximum mutual information between the transmitter (Alice) and the receiver, whether legitimate (Bob) or an eavesdropper (Eve). To find the optimal measurement-taken individually or collectively-we use a framework based on operator algebra and general results derived from singular -value decomposition, achieving optimal solutions for von Neumann measurements and positive operator -valued measures (POVMs). The formal proof and quantitative analysis elaborated for two signals allow us to conclude that optimal von Neumann measurements are uniquely defined and provide a higher information gain compared to POVMs. Interestingly, collective measurements not only do not provide additional information gain with respect to individual ones but also suffer from a gain reduction in the case of POVMs.

TI Scalable Circuits for Preparing Ground States on Digital Quantum
   Computers: The Schwinger Model Vacuum on 100 Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle -processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call "scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE" (SC-ADAPTVQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined with use of classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPTVQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and is shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wave functions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, L . This allows a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined with use of small or modest -sized systems, to arbitrarily large L . The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to L = 14 (28 qubits) with the Qiskit classical simulator, and are subsequently scaled up to prepare the L = 50 (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127-superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introduction of an improved error -mitigation technique, which we call "operator decoherence renormalization", the chiral condensate and charge -charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical matrix product state simulations.

TI Correlation-boosted quantum engine: A proof-of-principle demonstration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Employing currently available quantum technology, we design and implement a nonclassically correlated SWAP heat engine that allows to achieve an efficiency above the standard Carnot limit. Such an engine also boosts the amount of extractable work, in a wider parameter window, with respect to engine's cycle in the absence of initial quantum correlations in the working substance. The boosted efficiency arises from a trade-off between the entropy production and the consumption of quantum correlations during the full thermodynamic cycle. We derive a generalized second-law limit for the correlated cycle and implement a proof-of-principle demonstration of the engine efficiency enhancement by effectively tailoring the thermal engine on a cloud quantum processor.

TI Perfect Photon Indistinguishability from a Set of Dissipative Quantum
   Emitters
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Single photon sources (SPS) based on semiconductor quantum dot (QD) platforms are restricted to low temperature (T) operation due to the presence of strong dephasing processes. Although the integration of QD in optical cavities provides an enhancement of its emission properties, the technical requirements for maintaining high indistinguishability (I) at high T are still beyond the state of the art. Recently, new theoretical approaches have shown promising results by implementing two-dipole-coupled-emitter systems. Here, we propose a platform based on an optimized five-dipole-coupled-emitter system coupled to a cavity which enables perfect I at high T. Within our scheme the realization of perfect I single photon emission with dissipative QDs is possible using well established photonic platforms. For the optimization procedure we have developed a novel machine-learning approach which provides a significant computational-time reduction for high demanding optimization algorithms. Our strategy opens up interesting possibilities for the optimization of different photonic structures for quantum information applications, such as the reduction of quantum decoherence in clusters of coupled two-level quantum systems.

TI Strategies for Noise-Resilient Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithms: A Review and Classification of Error Mitigation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum hardware. However, its practical deployment remains severely limited by hardware-induced noise and decoherence. In the absence of full fault tolerance, Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) techniques offer a viable approach to enhance QAOA performance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a unified classification of QEM strategies specifically tailored for QAOA, systematically categorized into preprocessing, during execution, and post-processing phases. We further classify QAOA deployment settings-such as hardware-constrained devices, stochastic noise-dominated environments, and dense graphs problem-and recommend appropriate QEM techniques for each. A comparative analysis highlights the trade-offs among mitigation accuracy, resource overhead, and robustness to different noise types. By synthesizing recent advances and identifying open challenges, our paper provides both a comprehensive survey and a practical framework for designing robust, noise-resilient QAOA pipelines on near-term quantum platforms.

TI 'Quantum technology will change my life.' Citizens' attitudes and
   knowledge of quantum science and technology
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Technology experts, industry leaders, and policy makers expect that a revolution in quantum technology is imminent. From earlier emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, it has become clear that an early connection with the public is beneficial for the societal impact of the technology. However, little research has yet been done on public attitudes and knowledge of quantum science and technology. In this work, we quantitatively measure the attitude of N = 145 citizens of Leiden (NL) towards quantum science and technology and probe their knowledge on quantum concepts. Results indicate that these citizens have heard about 'quantum' through a wide variety of sources. They see quantum as globally important and admirable and most would like to learn more about quantum, but they do feel disconnected from developments in the field. Recommendations for the future include emphasizing any personal connections between citizens and quantum, adapting explanations to fit any level of education, and providing either reliable sources or a framework for critically evaluating quantum-related information.

TI Experimental realization of phase-controlled dynamics with hybrid
   digital-analog approach
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulation can be implemented in pure digital or analog ways, each with their pros and cons. By taking advantage of the universality of a digital route and the efficiency of analog simulation, hybrid digital-analog approaches can enrich the possibilities for quantum simulation. We use a hybrid approach to experimentally perform a quantum simulation of phase-controlled dynamics resulting from a closed-contour interaction (CCI) within certain multi-level systems in superconducting quantum circuits. Due to symmetry constraints, such systems cannot host an inherent CCI. Nevertheless, by assembling analog modules corresponding to their natural evolutions and specially designed digital modules constructed from standard quantum logic gates, we can bypass such constraints and realize an effective CCI in these systems. Based on this realization, we demonstrate a variety of related and interesting phenomena, including phase-controlled chiral dynamics, separation of chiral enantiomers, and a mechanism to generate entangled states based on CCI.

TI How a Quantum Computer Could Quantify Uncertainty in Microkinetic Models
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB A method of uncertainty quantification on a quantum circuit using three samples for the Rh(111)-catalyzed CO oxidation reaction is demonstrated. Three parametrized samples of a reduced, linearized microkinetic model populate a single block diagonal matrix for a quantum circuit. This approach leverages the logarithmic scaling of the number of qubits with respect to matrix size. The Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving linear systems is employed, and the results are compared with the classical results. This application area of uncertainty quantification in chemical kinetics can experience a quantum advantage using the method reported here, although issues related to larger systems are discussed.

TI The effects of disorder in superconducting materials on qubit coherence
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Introducing disorder in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorder and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made by spinodal titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorder. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the 1/f alpha flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorder; while the dielectric loss are largely similar under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density (sigma) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorder are found to be approximately correlated by sigma proportional to rho xx3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sigma \propto {\rho }_{xx}<^>{3}$$\end{document}, or effectively (kFl)-3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${({k}_{F}l)}<^>{-3}$$\end{document}.

TI Quantum eigenstate preparation assisted by a coherent link
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Preparing the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is a crucial problem in understanding quantum many-body systems, with applications in a variety of physics fields and connections to combinatorial optimization. While various quantum algorithms exist which can prepare the ground state with high precision and provable guarantees from an initial approximation, current devices are limited to shallow circuits. Here we consider the setting where Alice and Bob, in a distributed quantum computing architecture, want to prepare the same Hamiltonian eigenstate. We demonstrate that the circuit depth of the eigenstate preparation algorithm can be reduced when the devices can share entanglement via a coherent link. This is especially so in the case where one of them has a near-perfect eigenstate, which is more efficiently broadcast to the other device. Our approach requires only a single auxiliary qubit per device to be entangled with the outside. We show that, in the near-convergent regime, the average relative suppression of unwanted amplitudes is improved to 1/(2 root e) 0.30 per run of the protocol, outperforming the average relative suppression of 1/e 0.37 achieved with a single device alone for the same protocol.

TI High-Rate and High-Fidelity Modular Interconnects between Neutral Atom
   Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum links between physically separated modules are important for scaling many quantum computing technologies. The key metrics are the generation rate and fidelity of remote Bell pairs. In this work, we propose an experimental protocol for generating remote entanglement between neutral ytterbium atom qubits using an optical cavity. By loading a large number of atoms into a single cavity, and controlling their coupling using only local light shifts, we amortize the cost of transporting and initializing atoms over many entanglement attempts, maximizing the entanglement generation rate. A twisted ring cavity geometry suppresses many sources of error, allowing high-fidelity entanglement generation. We estimate a spin-photon entanglement rate of 5 x 105 s-1, and a Bell pair rate approaching 105 s-1, with an average fidelity near 0.999. Furthermore, we show that the photon detection times provide a significant amount of soft information about the location of errors, which may be used to improve the logical qubit performance. This approach provides a practical path to scalable modular quantum computing using neutral ytterbium atoms.

TI Simulating Z2 lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The utility of quantum computers for simulating lattice gauge theories is currently limited by the noisiness of the physical hardware. Various quantum error mitigation strategies exist to reduce the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quantum simulations via improved algorithms and analysis strategies. We perform quantum simulations of Z(2) gauge theory with matter to study the efficacy and interplay of different error mitigation methods: readout error mitigation, randomized compiling, rescaling, and dynamical decoupling. We compute Minkowski correlation functions in this confining gauge theory and extract the mass of the lightest spin-1 state from fits to their time dependence. Quantum error mitigation extends the range of times over which our correlation function calculations are accurate by a factor of 6 and is therefore essential for obtaining reliable masses.

TI On Linear Codes Whose Hermitian Hulls are MDS
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Hermitian hulls of linear codes are interesting for theoretical and practical reasons alike. In terms of recent application, linear codes whose hulls meet certain conditions have been utilized as ingredients to construct entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes. This family of quantum codes is often seen as a generalization of quantum stabilizer codes. Theoretically, compared with the Euclidean setup, the Hermitian case is much harder to deal with. Hermitian hulls of MDS linear codes with low dimensions have been explored, mostly from generalized Reed-Solomon codes. Characterizing Hermitian hulls which themselves are MDS appears to be more involved and has not been extensively studied. This paper introduces some tools to study linear codes whose Hermitian hulls are MDS. Using the tools, we then propose explicit constructions of such codes. We consider Hermitian hulls of both Reed-Solomon and non Reed-Solomon types of linear MDS codes. We demonstrate that, given the same Hermitian hull dimensions, the codes from our constructions have dimensions which are larger than those in the literature.

TI Comparison of DeNovix, NanoDrop and Qubit for DNA quantification and
   impurity detection of bacterial DNA extracts
SO PLOS ONE
AB Accurate DNA quantification is key for downstream application including library preparations for whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the quantification of standards for quantitative PCR. Two commonly used technologies for nucleic acid quantification are based on spectrometry, such as NanoDrop, and fluorometry, such as Qubit. The DS-11+ Series spectrophotometer/fluorometer (DeNovix) is a UV spectrophotometry-based instrument and is a relatively new spectrophotometric method but has not yet been compared to established platforms. Here, we compared three DNA quantification platforms, including two UV spectrophotometry-based techniques (DeNovix and NanoDrop) and one fluorometry-based approach (Qubit). We used genomic prokaryotic DNA extracted from Streptococcus pneumoniae using a Roche DNA extraction kit. We also evaluated purity assessment and effect of a single freeze-thaw cycle. Spectrophotometry-based methods reported 3 to 4-fold higher mean DNA concentrations compared to Qubit, both before and after freezing. The ratio of DNA concentrations assessed by spectrophotometry on the one hand, and Qubit on the other hand, was function of the A(260/280). In case DNA was pure (A(260/280) between 1.7 and 2.0), the ratio DeNovix or Nanodrop vs. Qubit was close or equal to 2, while this ratio showed an incline for DNA with increasing A(260/280) values > 2.0. The A(260/280) and A(260/230) purity ratios exhibited negligible variation across spectrophotometric methods and freezing conditions. The comparison of DNA concentrations from before and after freezing revealed no statistically significant disparities for each technique. DeNovix exhibited the highest Spearman correlation coefficient (0.999), followed by NanoDrop (0.81), and Qubit (0.77). In summary, there is no difference between DeNovix and NanoDrop in estimated gDNA concentrations of S. pneumoniae, and the spectrophotometry methods estimated close or equal to 2 times higher concentrations compared to Qubit for pure DNA.

TI Dynamics of a dispersively coupled transmon qubit in the presence of a
   noise source embedded in the control line
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We describe transmon qubit dynamics in the presence of noise introduced by an impedance-matched resistor (50 S2) that is embedded in the qubit control line. To obtain the time evolution, we rigorously derive the circuit Hamiltonian of the qubit, readout resonator and resistor by describing the latter as an infinite collection of bosonic modes through the Caldeira-Leggett model. Starting from this Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with inductive coupling to the remote bath comprised of the resistor, we consistently obtain the Lindblad master equation for the qubit and resonator in the dispersive regime. We exploit the underlying symmetries of the master equation to transform the Liouvillian superoperator into a block diagonal matrix. The block diagonalization method reveals that the rate of exponential decoherence of the qubit is well-captured by the slowest decaying eigenmode of a single block of the Liouvillian superoperator, which can be easily computed. The model captures the often used dispersive strong limit approximation of the qubit decoherence rate being linearly proportional to the number of thermal photons in the readout resonator but predicts remarkably better decoherence rates when the dissipation rate of the resonator is increased beyond the dispersive strong regime. Our work provides a full quantitative description of the contribution to the qubit decoherence rate coming from the control line in chips that are currently employed in circuit QED laboratories and suggests different possible ways to reduce this source of the noise.

TI Leakage reduction in fast superconducting qubit gates via optimal
   control
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Reaching high-speed, high-fidelity qubit operations requires precise control over the shape of the underlying pulses. For weakly anharmonic systems, such as superconducting transmon qubits, short gates lead to leakage to states outside of the computational subspace. Control pulses designed with open-loop optimal control may reduce such leakage. However, model inaccuracies can severely limit the usability of such pulses. We implemented a closed-loop optimization that simultaneously adapts all control parameters based on measurements of a cost function built from Clifford gates. We directly optimize the amplitude and phase of each sample point of the digitized control pulse. We thereby fully exploit the capabilities of the pulse generation electronics and create a 4.16ns single-qubit pulse with 99.76% fidelity and 0.044% leakage. This is a sevenfold reduction of the leakage rate and a threefold reduction in standard errors of the best DRAG pulse we have calibrated at such short durations on the same system.

TI Quantum data assimilation: a new approach to solving data assimilation
   on quantum annealers
SO NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS
AB Data assimilation is a crucial component in the Earth science field, enabling the integration of observation data with numerical models. In the context of numerical weather prediction (NWP), data assimilation is particularly vital for improving initial conditions and subsequent predictions. However, the computational demands imposed by conventional approaches, which employ iterative processes to minimize cost functions, pose notable challenges in computational time. The emergence of quantum computing provides promising opportunities to address these computation challenges by harnessing the inherent parallelism and optimization capabilities of quantum annealing machines.In this investigation, we propose a novel approach termed quantum data assimilation, which solves the data assimilation problem using quantum annealers. Our data assimilation experiments using the 40-variable Lorenz model were highly promising, showing that the quantum annealers produced an analysis with comparable accuracy to conventional data assimilation approaches. In particular, the D-Wave Systems physical quantum annealing machine achieved a significant reduction in execution time.

TI Nonequilibrium thermal transport and photon squeezing in a quadratic
   qubit-resonator system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate steady-state thermal transport and photon statistics in a nonequilibrium hybrid quantum system, in which a qubit shows longitudinal and quadratic coupling with an optical resonator. Our calculations are conducted with the method of the quantum dressed master equation combined with full counting statistics. The effect of negative differential thermal conductance is unravelled at finite temperature bias, which stems from the suppression of cyclic heat transitions and large mismatch of two squeezed photon modes at weak and strong qubit-resonator hybridizations, respectively. The giant thermal rectification is also exhibited at large temperature bias. It is found that the asymmetric composition of the hybrid system by spin and boson roles and negative differential thermal conductance show the cooperative contribution. Noise power and skewness, as typical current fluctuations, exhibit global maximum with strong hybridization at small and large temperature bias limits, respectively. Moreover, the effect of photon quadrature squeezing is discovered in the strong hybridization and low-temperature regime, which shows asymmetric response to two bath temperatures. These results would provide some insight to thermal functional design and photon manipulation in qubit-resonator hybrid quantum systems.

TI Adaptive Quantum State Tomography with Active Learning
SO QUANTUM
AB Recently, tremendous progress has been made in the field of quantum science and technologies: different platforms for quantum simulation as well as quantum computing, ranging from superconduct-ing qubits to neutral atoms, are start-ing to reach unprecedentedly large sys-tems. In order to benchmark these sys-tems and gain physical insights, the need for efficient tools to characterize quantum states arises. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size ren-ders a full reconstruction of the quantum state prohibitively demanding in terms of the number of necessary measurements. Here we propose and implement an ef-ficient scheme for quantum state tomog-raphy using active learning. Based on a few initial measurements, the active learn-ing protocol proposes the next measure-ment basis, designed to yield the max-imum information gain. We apply the active learning quantum state tomogra-phy scheme to reconstruct different multi-qubit states with varying degree of entan-glement as well as to ground states of the XXZ model in 1D and a kinetically con-strained spin chain. In all cases, we obtain a significantly improved reconstruction as compared to a reconstruction based on the exact same number of measurements and measurement configurations, but with ran-domly chosen basis configurations. Our scheme is highly relevant to gain physical insights in quantum many-body systems as well as for benchmarking and character-izing quantum devices, e.g. for quantum simulation, and paves the way for scalable adaptive protocols to probe, prepare, and manipulate quantum systems.

TI Speeding Up Quantum Measurement Using Space-Time Trade-Off
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealized situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modeling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate midcircuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.

TI A High-Sensitivity Charge Sensor for Silicon Qubits above 1 K
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Recent studies of silicon spin qubits at temperatures above 1 K are encouraging demonstrations that the cooling requirements for solid-state quantum computing can be considerably relaxed. However, qubit readout mechanisms that rely on charge sensing with a single-island single-electron transistor (SISET) quickly lose sensitivity due to thermal broadening of the electron distribution in the reservoirs. Here we exploit the tunneling between two quantized states in a double-island single-electron transistor (SET) to demonstrate a charge sensor with an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio by an order of magnitude compared to a standard SISET, and a single-shot charge readout fidelity above 99% up to 8 K at a bandwidth greater than 100 kHz. These improvements are consistent with our theoretical modeling of the temperature-dependent current transport for both types of SETs. With minor additional hardware overhead, these sensors can be integrated into existing qubit architectures for a high-fidelity charge readout at few-kelvin temperatures.

TI Fast single-photon detectors and real-time key distillation enable high
   secret-key-rate quantum key distribution systems
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution has emerged as the most viable scheme to guarantee information security in the presence of large-scale quantum computers and, thanks to the continuous progress made in the past 20 years, it is now commercially available. However, the secret key rates remain limited to just over 10 Mbps due to several bottlenecks on the receiver side. Here we present a custom multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector that is designed to guarantee high count rates and precise timing discrimination. Leveraging the performance of the detector and coupling it to fast acquisition and real-time key distillation electronics, we remove two major roadblocks and achieve a considerable increase of the secret key rates with respect to the state of the art. In combination with a simple 2.5-GHz clocked time-bin quantum key distribution system, we can generate secret keys at a rate of 64 Mbps over a distance of 10.0 km and at a rate of 3.0 Mbps over a distance of 102.4 km with real-time key distillation.

TI Single-photon frequency shifting with a quadrature phase-shift keying
   modulator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deterministic frequency manipulation of single photons is an essential tool for quantum communications and quantum networks. We demonstrate a 15.65 GHz frequency shift for classical and nonclassical light using a commercially available quadrature phase-shift keying modulator. The measured spectrum of frequency-shifted single photons indicates a high carrier-to-sideband ratio of 30 dB. We illustrate our frequency shifter's utility in quantum photonics by performing Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference between two photons whose initial frequency spectra overlap only partially, and showing visibility improvement from 62.7 to 89.1% after one of the photons undergoes a corrective frequency shift.

As resource estimates we indicate the total number of gates N and simulation time T, expressed in terms of the number n of spin 1/2 lattice sites (qubits), target accuracy epsilon, and simulated time t. We provide circuit constructions that realize the simulation time T(1) proportional to nt2/epsilon and T(2q) proportional to t1+eta n eta/epsilon eta for arbitrarily small eta = 1/2q for the first-order and higher-order Trotter expansions. We also discuss the potential impact of scaled gates, which have not yet been fully explored.

TI QCA-Based Secure RAM Cell Structure Using Logic Transformation and Cell
   Interaction with Signal Reliability and Energy Dissipation in Quantum
   Computing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A RAM cell, one of the components that greatly affects the performance of quantum computing, outputs mostly stored values on quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) as they are. Currently, a problem is that the stored value may be initialized according to the selection input. To solve this problem, circuits that separate the stored value from the output value have recently been designed, but most of them have long latency, large areas, and many plane structure intersections, resulting in unstable signals. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new secure QRAM (QCA-based RAM) cell logic by analyzing and modifying the existing cell logic in nanotechnology. We initially propose 2-to-1 multiplexers based on cell interaction, and a QRAM cell is proposed based on our multiplexer and an optimized QRAM cell logic diagram. Compared with existing designs, the proposed circuits produce superior results in terms of circuit performance and energy dissipation. Additionally, the operation of our multiplexers is verified mathematically using physical proof. The secure QRAM cell proposed in this paper does not have the initialization problem based on the selection input that is present in some existing circuits, thus it is very easy to design an extension to N x N RAM, and it has high signal stability, reliability, connectivity, and scalability because there is no intersection.

TI Predicting the minimum control time of quantum protocols with artificial
   neural networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum control relies on the driving of quantum states without the loss of coherence, thus the leakage of quantum properties into the environment over time is a fundamental challenge. One work-around is to implement fast protocols, hence the Minimal Control Time (MCT) is of upmost importance. Here, we employ a machine learning network in order to estimate the MCT in a state transfer protocol. An unsupervised learning approach is considered by using a combination of an autoencoder network with the k-means clustering tool. The Landau-Zener (LZ) Hamiltonian is analyzed given that it has an analytical MCT and a distinctive topology change in the control landscape when the total evolution time is either under or over the MCT. We obtain that the network is able to not only produce an estimation of the MCT but also gains an understanding of the landscape's topologies. Similar results are found for the generalized LZ Hamiltonian while limitations to our very simple architecture were encountered.

TI Scalable quantum processors empowered by the Fermi scattering of Rydberg
   electrons
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing promises exponential speed-up compared to its classical counterpart. While the neutral atom processors are the pioneering platform in terms of scalability, the dipolar Rydberg gates impose the main bottlenecks on the scaling of these devices. This article presents an alternative scheme for neutral atom quantum processing, based on the Fermi scattering of a Rydberg electron from ground-state atoms in spin-dependent lattice geometries. Instead of relying on Rydberg pair-potentials, the interaction is controlled by engineering the electron cloud of a sole Rydberg atom. The present scheme addresses the scaling obstacles in Rydberg processors by exponentially suppressing the population of short-lived states and by operating in ultra-dense atomic lattices. The restoring forces in molecule type Rydberg-Fermi potential preserve the trapping over a long interaction period. Furthermore, the proposed scheme mitigates different competing infidelity criteria, eliminates unwanted cross-talks, and significantly suppresses the operation depth in running complicated quantum algorithms.
   Current Rydberg quantum processors suffer from limitations in fidelity and scalability. Here, the authors address these limitations by proposing highly controllable multi-qubit operations that utilize the Fermi scattering of Rydberg electrons trapped in an optical lattice.

AB In neutral atom quantum computers, readout and preparation of the atomic qubits are usually based on fluorescence imaging and subsequent analysis of the acquired image. For each atom site, the brightness or some comparable metric is estimated and used to predict the presence or absence of an atom. Across different setups, we can see a vast number of different approaches used to analyze these images. Often, the choice of detection algorithm is either not mentioned at all or it is not justified.
   We investigate several different algorithms and compare their performance in terms of both precision and execution run time. To do so, we rely on a set of synthetic images across different simulated exposure times with known occupancy states, which we generated using a previously validated imaging simulation. Since the use of simulation provides us with the ground truth of atom site occupancy, we can easily state precise error rates and variances of the reconstructed property.
   However, knowing the relative performance of these algorithms is not sufficient to justify their use, since better ones can exist that were not compared. To investigate this possibility, we calculated the Cramer-Rao bound in order to establish an upper limit that even a perfect estimator cannot outperform. As the metric of choice, we used the number of photonelectrons that can be contributed to a specific atom site. Every estimator that reconstructs a different property can simply be scaled accordingly. Since the bound depends on the occupancy of neighboring sites, we provide the best and worst cases, as well as a half filled one, which should represent an averaged bound best.
   Our comparison shows that of our tested algorithms, a global non-linear least-squares solver that uses the optical system's point spread function (PSF) to return a global bias and each sites' number of photoelectrons performed the best, on average crossing the worst-case bound for longer exposure times. Its main drawback is its huge computational complexity and, thus, required calculation time. We manage to somewhat reduce this problem, suggesting that its use may be viable, leading us to a novel group of algorithms that present a compromise between speed and precision. However, our study also shows that for cases where utmost speed is required, simple algorithms, like summing up pixel values around atom sites, may be preferable.

TI Designing a Robust Quantum Signature Protocol Based on Quantum Key
   Distribution for E-Voting Applications
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The rapid advancement of internet technology has raised attention to the importance of electronic voting in maintaining democracy and fairness in elections. E-voting refers to the use of electronic technology to facilitate the casting and counting of votes in elections. The need for designated verification arises from concerns about voter privacy, auditability, and the prevention of manipulation. Traditional e-voting systems use cryptographic techniques for security but lack verifiable proof of integrity. Integrating e-voting with a quantum designated verifier could address these challenges by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance security and trustworthiness. In light of this, we propose a quantum e-voting scheme that uses a designated verifier signature. To ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of the voting process, the scheme uses quantum features like the no-cloning theorem and quantum key distribution. The proposed scheme has security properties like source hiding, non-transferability, and message anonymity. The proposed scheme is resistant to many quantum attacks, such as eavesdropping and impersonation. Due to designated verification, the scheme minimizes the risk of tempering. This paper provides a detailed description of the proposed scheme and analyzes its security properties. Therefore, the proposed scheme is efficient, practical, and secure.

TI Impact of Imbalanced Modulation on Security of Continuous-Variable
   Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution
SO PHOTONICS
AB Continuous variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) removes all known or unknown side-channel attacks on detectors. However, it is difficult to fully implement assumptions in the security demonstration model, which leads to potential security vulnerabilities inevitably existing in the practical system. In this paper, we explore the impact of imbalanced modulation at transmitters on the security of the CV-MDI-QKD system mainly using a coherent state and squeezed state under symmetric and asymmetric distances. Assuming two different modulation topologies of senders, we propose a generalized theoretical scheme and evaluate the key parameter achievable of the protocol with the mechanism of imbalanced modulation. The presented results show that imbalanced modulation can achieve a relatively nonlinearly higher secret key rate and transmission distances than the previous protocol which is the balanced modulation variance used by transmitters. The advantage of imbalanced modulation is demonstrated for the system key parameter estimation using numerical simulation under different situations. In addition, the consequences indicate the importance of imbalanced modulation on the performance of CV-MDI-QKD protocol and provide a theoretical framework for experimental implementation as well as the optimal modulated mode.

TI Local unitary classes of states invariant under permutation subgroups
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The study of entanglement properties of multiqubit states that are invariant under permutations of qubits is motivated by potential applications in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. In this work we generalize the notions of symmetrization, Dicke states, and the Majorana representation to the alternating, cyclic, and dihedral subgroups of the full group of permutations. We use these tools to characterize states that are invariant under these subgroups and analyze their entanglement properties.

TI Dark Spin-Cat States as Biased Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a biased atomic qubit, universally implementable across all atomic platforms, encoded as a "spin cat" within ground state Zeeman levels. The key characteristic of our configuration is the coupling of the ground state spin manifold of size F-g >> 1 to an excited Zeeman spin manifold of size F-e = F-g - 1 using light. This coupling results in eigenstates of the driven atom that include exactly two dark states in the ground state manifold, which are decoupled from light and immune to spontaneous emission from the excited states. These dark states constitute the spin cat, leading to the designation "dark spin cat." We demonstrate that under strong Rabi drive and for large F-g, the dark spin cat is autonomously stabilized against common noise sources and encodes a qubit with significantly biased noise. Specifically, the bit-flip error rate decreases exponentially with F-g relative to the dephasing rate. We provide an analysis of dark spin cats and their robustness to noise, and we discuss bias-preserving single qubit and entangling gates, exemplified on a Rydberg tweezer platform.

TI Quantum adiabatic brachistochrone for open systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a variational principle to compute a quantum adiabatic brachistochrone (QAB) for open systems. Using the notion of "adiabatic speed" based on the energy gaps, we derive a Lagrangian associated to the functional measuring the time spent to achieve adiabatic behavior, which in turn allows us to perform the optimization. The QAB is illustrated for the nonunitary dynamics of a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process, the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum computing algorithm, and of a transmon qutrit. A numerical protocol is devised, which allows one to compute the QAB for arbitrary quantum systems for which exact simulations can be afforded. We also establish sufficient conditions for the equivalence between the Lagrangians, and thus the QAB, of open and closed systems.

TI Effects of quantum noise on Shor's algorithm
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Shor's quantum factoring algorithm (Shor's algorithm) can solve factorization problem of large integers by using a fully-operational quantum computer with the complexity of polynomial-time level, thereby cracking a series of encryption algorithms (such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol) whose security is guaranteed by factorizing large integers, which is a difficult problem. We are currently in a noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, which means that we can only operate on quantum computers with a limited number of qubits and we have to take care of the effects of quantum noise. Quantum states on a quantum computer are prone to quantum noise caused by low-fidelity gates or interactions between qubits and the environment, which results in inaccurate measurements. We study the influence of quantum noise on Shor's algorithm through 3 typical quantum noise channels: the depolarizing channel, the state preparation and measurement channel, and the thermal relaxation channel. We successfully simulate the factorization of the numbers 15, 21, and 35 into their corresponding prime factors by using the quantum circuit we have constructed on a classical computer. Then we simulate a running quantum circuit of Shor's algorithm in a noisy environment with different level of noise for a certain type of noise channel and present numerical results. We can obtain precise measurements by calculating the state vector prior to measurement, instead of simulating and measuring expending much time, which contributes to higher efficiency. Each experiment is repeated 1000 times to reduce discrepancy. Our research indicates that Shor's algorithm is easily affected by quantum noise. Successful rate of Shor's algorithm decreases exponentially with the increase of noise level in the depolarizing channel, where the successful rate is an indicator we propose in this research to quantify the influence of noise on Shor's algorithm, meanwhile the noise in the state preparation and measurement channel and the thermal relaxation channel can linearly affect the successful rate of Shor's algorithm. There are quantum gates in the circuit, each of which is disrupted by noise in depolarizing channel during running the circuit, meanwhile there are only O(n) interruptions caused by noise in state preparation and measurement channel since we repeat the measurements only O(n) times in the circuit where n is the number of bits of the integer about to be factored. Linear relationship in thermal relaxation channel is mainly due to the large gap between quantum gate time and relaxation time even if each gate in the circuit is disrupted by noise in thermal relaxation channel such as depolarizing channel. The present research results can be used for correcting the subsequent errors, improving Shor's algorithm, and providing guidance for the fidelity required in engineering implementation of Shor's algorithm.

TI Quantum relaxed row and column iteration methods based on block-encoding
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Iteration method is commonly used in solving linear systems of equations. We present quantum algorithms for the relaxed row and column iteration methods by constructing unitary matrices in the iterative processes, which generalize row and column iteration methods to solve linear systems on a quantum computer. Comparing with the conventional row and column iteration methods, the convergence accelerates when appropriate parameters are chosen. Once the quantum states are efficiently prepared, the complexity of our relaxed row and column methods is improved exponentially and is linear with the number of the iteration steps. In addition, phase estimations and Hamiltonian simulations are not required in these algorithms.

TI Scalable implementation of (d+1) mutually unbiased bases for
   d-dimensional quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) can improve error rate tolerance and the secret key rate. Many d-dimensional QKDs have used two mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), while (d + 1) MUBs enable a more robust QKD, especially against correlated errors. However, a scalable implementation has not been achieved because the setups have required d devices even for two MUBs or a flexible convertor for a specific optical mode. Here, we propose a scalable and general implementation of (d + 1) MUBs using logp d interferometers in prime power dimensions d = pN. We implemented the setup for time-bin states and observed an average error rate of 3.8% for phase bases, which is lower than the 23.17% required for a secure QKD against coherent attack in d=4.

TI Quantum technology to expand soft computing
SO SYSTEMS AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Soft computing was founded to unify and advance computing methods beyond the limits of binary variables, Boolean logic and Turing machines. David Deutsch invented a way to use massive quantum parallelism to massively improve the power of Turing machines in some applications. Here we give a roadmap to use quantum parallelism to massively improve the power of soft computing, focusing on tasks in optimization ranging from function optimization, finding a needle in a haystack, optimal control, energy technology and reinforcement learning (Quantum artificial general intelligence, AGI) in a path leading up to optimization of physical plants themselves put into quantum superpositions. The path begins with design and test of prototypes built on platforms such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, sparse quantum optics, superconductors (sQuID), quantum dots and new high speed electronics.

TI Theoretical study of the EDFA optical amplifier implementation scheme
   improving the performance of a quantum key distribution system
   integrated with an WDM optical transport network
SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB A version of an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) application scheme designed to increase the efficiency of the simultaneous quantum key distribution session and transmission of information by classical channels in a single optical fiber is explored. A theoretical study of the possibility to use EDFA in the explored way was conducted by numerical simulation methods. The mathematical model is based on the EDFA dynam-ics equations and the equations that determine the secure key generation rate in case of the subcarrier-wave quantum key distribution. A method for determining the optimal parameters of the scheme under study is de-scribed and the evaluation of the feasibility of using EDFA in the explored way is performed. A comparative analysis of the subcarrier-wave quantum key distribution system performance when integrated into an optical network is made in terms of the secure key generation rate for the cases when EDFA is either used or not. The results obtained demonstrate high efficiency of the scheme under study, i.e., the maximum achievable distance of the secure key distribution is increased while maintaining the efficiency of the information transmission.

TI Performance analysis of inter-satellite round-robin
   differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB As the vision of global-scale unconditional information security becomes gradually realized, the importance of inter-satellite quantum communications has been rapidly increasing. The recently proposed round-robin differential-phase-shift (RRDPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol has attracted much attention not only due to its potential high error tolerance, but also due to its distinct feature that the information leakage can be bounded without monitoring signal disturbances. Despite many existing implementations over fiber-optic channels, the feasibility of RRDPS QKD over an inter-satellite channel is still unknown. Moreover, despite the current advances in orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoding and temporal mode (TM) encoding, most of the existing studies on RRDPS QKD are restricted to time-bin encoding. In this work, we remedy this situation by exploring the feasibility of performing RRDPS QKD using OAM encoding and TM encoding over an inter-satellite channel. Our results indicate that OAM encoding is preferable to time-bin encoding only under the circumstances where a low dimension and a large receiver aperture are used. However, we find that TM encoding is the best encoding scheme in RRDPS QKD over an inter-satellite channel. In particular, we show that TM encoding not only leads to the best performance and the largest feasible parameter range, but also, for the first time, enables all the theoretically available advantages of an increased dimension to be realized in the context of RRDPS QKD.

TI Trust-Aware Causal Consistency Routing for Quantum Key Distribution
   Networks Against Malicious Nodes
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks promise information-theoretic security for multiple nodes by leveraging the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. In practice, QKD networks require dedicated routing protocols to coordinate secure key distribution among distributed nodes. However, most existing routing protocols operate under the assumption that all relay nodes are honest and fully trustworthy, an assumption that may not hold in realistic scenarios. Malicious nodes may tamper with routing updates, causing inconsistent key-state views or divergent routing plans across the network. Such inconsistencies increase routing failure rates and lead to severe wastage of valuable secret keys. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed routing framework that combines two key components: (i) Causal Consistency Key-State Update, which prevents malicious nodes from propagating inconsistent key states and routing plans; and (ii) Trust-Aware Multi-path Flow Optimization, which incorporates trust metrics derived from discrepancies in reported states into the path-selection objective, penalizing suspicious links and filtering fabricated demands. Across 50-node topologies with up to 30% malicious relays and under all three attack modes, our protocol sustains a high demand completion ratio (DCR) (mean 0.90, range 0.81-0.98) while keeping key utilization low (16.6 keys per demand), decisively outperforming the baselines-Multi-Path Planned (DCR 0.48, 30.8 keys per demand) and OSPF (DCR <= 0.12, 296 keys per demand; max 1601). These results highlight that our framework balances reliability and efficiency, providing a practical and resilient foundation for secure QKD networking in adversarial environments.

TI Experimental Online Quantum Dots Charge Autotuning Using Neural Networks
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. This exploration leverages the model's uncertainty estimation to find the appropriate gate configuration with minimal measurements while reducing the risk of failures. In 20 experimental runs, our method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this approach against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 h and 9 min, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine-learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.

TI Analog quantum simulation of partial differential equations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum simulators were originally proposed for simulating one partial differential equation (PDE) in particular-Schr & ouml;dinger's equation. Can quantum simulators also efficiently simulate other PDEs? While most computational methods for PDEs-both classical and quantum-are digital (they must be discretised first), PDEs have continuous degrees of freedom. This suggests that an analog representation can be more natural. While digital quantum degrees of freedom are usually described by qubits, the analog or continuous quantum degrees of freedom can be captured by qumodes. Based on a method called Schr & ouml;dingerisation, we show how to directly map D-dimensional linear PDEs onto a ( D + 1 ) -qumode quantum system where analog or continuous-variable (CV) Hamiltonian simulation on D + 1 qumodes can be used. This very simple methodology does not require one to discretise PDEs first, and it is not only applicable to linear PDEs but also to some nonlinear PDEs and systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We show some examples using this method, including the Liouville equation, heat equation, Fokker-Planck equation, Black-Scholes equations, wave equation and Maxwell's equations. We also devise new protocols for linear PDEs with random coefficients, important in uncertainty quantification, where it is clear how the analog or CV framework is most natural. This also raises the possibility that some PDEs may be simulated directly on analog quantum systems by using Hamiltonians natural for those quantum systems.

TI Illuminating Ligand Field Contributions to Molecular Qubit Spin
   Relaxation via T1 Anisotropy
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Electron spin relaxation in paramagnetic transition metal complexes constitutes a key limitation on the growth of molecular quantum information science. However, there exist very few experimental observables for probing spin relaxation mechanisms, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent theoretical models. Here we demonstrate that spin relaxation anisotropy in pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance is a powerful spectroscopic probe for molecular spin dynamics across a library of highly coherent Cu(II) and V(IV) complexes. Neither the static spin Hamiltonian anisotropy nor contemporary computational models of spin relaxation are able to account for the experimental T1 anisotropy. Through analysis of the spin-orbit coupled wave functions, we derive an analytical theory for the T1 anisotropy that accurately reproduces the average experimental anisotropy of 2.5. Furthermore, compound-by-compound deviations from the average anisotropy provide a promising approach for observing specific ligand field and vibronic excited state coupling effects on spin relaxation. Finally, we present a simple density functional theory workflow for computationally predicting T1 anisotropy. Analysis of spin relaxation anisotropy leads to deeper fundamental understanding of spin-phonon coupling and relaxation mechanisms, promising to complement temperature dependent relaxation rates as a key metric for understanding molecular spin qubits.

TI Single-electron spin resonance in a nanoelectronic device using a global
   field
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Spin-based silicon quantum electronic circuits offer a scalable platform for quantum computation, combining the manufacturability of semiconductor devices with the long coherence times afforded by spins in silicon. Advancing from current few-qubit devices to silicon quantum processors with upward of a million qubits, as required for fault-tolerant operation, presents several unique challenges, one of the most demanding being the ability to deliver microwave signals for large-scale qubit control. Here, we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nano-electronic circuit. Critically, this technique uses only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously. We show that the global field can be used to perform spin resonance of single electrons confined in a silicon double quantum dot device, establishing the feasibility of this approach for scalable spin qubit control.

TI Futurising science education: students' experiences from a course on
   futures thinking and quantum computing
SO INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE
AB To promote students' value-based agency, responsible science and sustainability, science education must address how students think about their personal and collective futures. However, research has shown that young people find it difficult to fully relate to the future and its possibilities, and few studies have focused on the potential of science education to foster futures thinking and agency. We report on a project that further explored this potential by developing future-oriented science courses drawing on the field of futures studies. Phenomenographic analysis was used on interview data to see what changes upper-secondary school students saw in their futures perceptions and agentic orientations after attending a course which adapted futures thinking skills in the context of quantum computing and technological approaches to global problems. The results show students perceiving the future and technological development as more positive but also more unpredictable, seeing their possibilities for agency as clearer and more promising (especially by identifying with their peers or aspired career paths), and feeling a deeper connection to the otherwise vague idea of futures. Students also felt they had learned to question deterministic thinking and to think more creatively about their own lives as well as technological and non-technological solutions to global problems. Both quantum physics and futures thinking opened new perspectives on uncertainty and probabilistic thinking. Our results provide further validation for a future-oriented approach to science education, and highlight essential synergies between futures thinking skills, agency, and authentic socio-scientific issues in developing science education for the current age.

TI Protected Hybrid Superconducting Qubit in an Array of Gate-Tunable
   Josephson Interferometers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a protected qubit based on a modular array of superconducting islands connected by semiconductor Josephson interferometers. The individual interferometers realize effective cos 20 elements that exchange "pairs of Cooper pairs" between the superconducting islands when gate tuned into balance and frustrated by a half-flux quantum. If a large capacitor shunts the ends of the array, the circuit forms a protected qubit because its degenerate ground states are robust to offset-charge and magnetic field fluctuations for a sizable window around zero offset charge and half-flux quantum. This protection window broadens upon increasing the number of interferometers if the individual elements are balanced. We use an effective spin model to describe the system and show that a quantum phase transition sets the critical flux value at which protection is destroyed.

TI Quantum Tomography of Rydberg Atom Graphs by Configurable Ancillas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tomographic reconstruction of the many-body quantum state of a scalable qubit system is of paramount importance in quantum computing technologies. However, conventional approaches that use tomo-graphically orthogonal base measurements require precise and individual qubit controls, which are often experimentally daunting. Here we propose, as a quantum mechanically robust alternative, using configurable ancillas, the continuously tunable interactions of which can generate independent base measurements tomographically sufficient for the quantum state reconstruction of the system of inter-est. Experimental tests are performed for Rydberg atom arrays in N-body W states, the results of which demonstrate reliable high-fidelity full quantum state reconstruction by the proposed method.

TI Algorithm for operating an ordinary engineering system as a quantum bit
SO SICE JOURNAL OF CONTROL MEASUREMENT AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION
AB We show an algorithm for the previously proposed quantum computer using classical apparatuses. The target system is not limited to mass points but is a general engineering system that has a more manageable form in equipping terminal edge. After we define such system as "ordinary engineering system," the method of quantum mechanical optimum feedback control of the nonlinear system is applied. The method makes an ordinary engineering system into a quantum one. As an example that is as stale as possible, a temperature control system is taken. Simulation studies show that our system works as a 1- $ \mathsf {qubit} $ qubit quantum computer without the special large-scale peripheral equipment required to maintain quantumness. The proposed system is a classic system that is everywhere, so it is easy for anyone to understand. Another advantage is that easy-to-use one-dimensional system can be applied.

TI Compiling arbitrary single-qubit gates via the phase shifts of microwave
   pulses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We give an arbitrary single-qubit gate compilation scheme on superconducting processors that takes advantage of tuning the phase shift of microwave pulses to obtain a continuous gate set. This scheme is compatible with any two-qubit gate, and we only need to calibrate the X pi and X pi /2 pulses. We report an experimental implementation on a fluxonium device in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 070601 (2023)] and obtain state-of-the-art fidelities. We give two other schemes: the first requires one X pi pulse and one pulse with a variable rotation angle, and the second requires four X pi /2 pulses. We also find that if we can do virtual Z gates, then we can also do virtual gates around any axis. Our results apply to any physical platform that natively supports virtual Z.

TI Tripartite entropic uncertainty relation under phase decoherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We formulate the tripartite entropic uncertainty relation and predict its lower bound in a three-qubit Heisenberg XXZ spin chain when measuring an arbitrary pair of incompatible observables on one qubit while the other two are served as quantum memories. Our study reveals that the entanglement between the nearest neighbors plays an important role in reducing the uncertainty in measurement outcomes. In addition we have shown that the Dolatkhah's lower bound (Phys Rev A 102(5):052227, 2020) is tighter than that of Ming (Phys Rev A 102(01):012206, 2020) and their dynamics under phase decoherence depends on the choice of the observable pair. In the absence of phase decoherence, Ming's lower bound is time-invariant regardless the chosen observable pair, while Dolatkhah's lower bound is perfectly identical with the tripartite uncertainty with a specific choice of pair.

TI Radio frequency mixing modules for superconducting qubit room
   temperature control systems
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB As the number of qubits in nascent quantum processing units increases, the connectorized RF (radio frequency) analog circuits used in first generation experiments become exceedingly complex. The physical size, cost, and electrical failure rate all become limiting factors in the extensibility of control systems. We have developed a series of compact RF mixing boards to address this challenge by integrating I/Q quadrature mixing, intermediate frequency/LO (local oscillator)/RF power level adjustments, and direct current bias fine tuning on a 40 x 80 mm(2) four-layer printed circuit board with electromagnetic interference shielding. The RF mixing module is designed to work with RF and LO frequencies between 2.5 and 8.5 GHz. The typical image rejection and adjacent channel isolation are measured to be similar to 27 dBc and similar to 50 dB. By scanning the drive phase in a loopback test, the module short-term amplitude and phase linearity are typically measured to be 5 x10(-4) (V-pp/V-mean) and 1 x10(-3) radian (pk-pk). The operation of the RF mixing board was validated by integrating it into the room temperature control system of a superconducting quantum processor and executing randomized benchmarking characterization of single and two qubit gates. We measured a single-qubit process infidelity of 9.3(3) x 10(-4) and a two-qubit process infidelity of 2.7(1) x 10(-2).

TI Dynamics of two central spins immersed in spin baths
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this article we derive the exact dynamics of a two-qubit (spin 1/2) system interacting centrally with separate spin baths composed of qubits in a thermal state. Furthermore, each spin of the bath is coupled to every other spin of the same bath. The corresponding dynamical map is constructed. It is used to analyze the non-Markovian nature of the two qubit central spin dynamics. We further observe the evolution of quantum correlations like entanglement and discord under the influence of the environmental interaction. Moreover, we demonstrate the comparison between this exact two-qubit dynamics and the locally acting central spin model in a spin bath. This work is a stepping stone towards the realization of non-Markovian heat engines and other quantum thermal devices.

TI A quantum hamiltonian simulation benchmark
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most important problems in quantum computation, and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) is an efficient way to simulate a general class of Hamiltonians. However, the QSVT circuit typically involves multiple ancilla qubits and multi-qubit control gates. In order to simulate a certain class of n-qubit random Hamiltonians, we propose a drastically simplified quantum circuit that we refer to as the minimal QSVT circuit, which uses only one ancilla qubit and no multi-qubit controlled gates. We formulate a simple metric called the quantum unitary evolution score (QUES), which is a scalable quantum benchmark and can be verified without any need for classical computation. Under the globally depolarized noise model, we demonstrate that QUES is directly related to the circuit fidelity, and the potential classical hardness of an associated quantum circuit sampling problem. Under the same assumption, theoretical analysis suggests there exists an 'optimal' simulation time t(opt) approximate to 4.81, at which even a noisy quantum device may be sufficient to demonstrate the potential classical hardness.

TI Tailoring the Emission Wavelength of Color Centers in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride for Quantum Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Optical quantum technologies promise to revolutionize today's information processing and sensors. Crucial to many quantum applications are efficient sources of pure single photons. For a quantum emitter to be used in such application, or for different quantum systems to be coupled to each other, the optical emission wavelength of the quantum emitter needs to be tailored. Here, we use density functional theory to calculate and manipulate the transition energy of fluorescent defects in the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride. Our calculations feature the HSE06 functional which allows us to accurately predict the electronic band structures of 267 different defects. Moreover, using strain-tuning we can tailor the optical transition energy of suitable quantum emitters to match precisely that of quantum technology applications. We therefore not only provide a guide to make emitters for a specific application, but also have a promising pathway of tailoring quantum emitters that can couple to other solid-state qubit systems such as color centers in diamond.

We present an experimental demonstration of the polarization-based three-level decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, at a clock frequency of 50 MHz, that relies on fewer resources at the receiver and increases robustness to side-channel attacks for both the transmitter and receiver. A single-laser source and cascade of electro-optic modulators provide the four polarization states, while a photonic recombiner with time-multiplexed inputs enables detection with a single detector.

TI Quantum Automated Tools for Finding Impossible Differentials
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Due to the superiority of quantum computing, traditional cryptography is facing a severe threat. This makes the security evaluation of cryptographic systems in quantum attack models both significant and urgent. For symmetric ciphers, the security analysis heavily relies on cryptanalysis tools. Thus, exploring the use of quantum algorithms in traditional cryptanalysis tools has garnered considerable attention. In this study, we utilize quantum algorithms to improve impossible differential attacks and design two quantum automated tools to search for impossible differentials. The proposed quantum algorithms exploit the idea of miss-in-the-middle and the properties of truncated differentials. We rigorously prove their validity and calculate the quantum resources required for their implementation. Compared to the existing classical automated cryptanalysis, the proposed quantum tools have the advantage of accurately characterizing S-boxes while only requiring polynomial complexity, and can take into consideration the impact of the key schedules in a single-key model.

The dynamics of the optical tomography is explored for an open cavity field. We show an aspect of the alteration of the optical tomography distribution.

TI Multi-Objective Optimization of Independent Automotive Suspension by AI
   and Quantum Approaches: A Systematic Review
SO MACHINES
AB The optimization of independent automotive suspension systems, which is one of the main pillars of the vehicle performance and comfort, is currently going through a revolutionary change due to the development of artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This paper aims to review the multi-objective optimization of suspension parameters including camber, caster, and toe to discuss the complex design issues that arise from geometric and dynamic considerations. Some of the most common computational methodologies, which are Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gradient Descent, are discussed in this paper along with the new quantum computing techniques such as Gate-Based quantum computing and Quantum Annealing (QA). In addition, this review incorporates information from the practice of automotive manufacturers who have incorporated the use of artificial intelligence and quantum computing in their suspension systems. However, there are still some issues remaining, such as the computational cost, real-time flexibility, and the applicability of theoretical concepts to actual engineering structures. Some potential future research directions are introduced in this paper, such as hybrid optimization approaches, quantum techniques, and adaptive materials, which are considered as potential directions for future development. This systematic review presents a conceptual framework for researchers and engineers to follow, stressing the importance of interdisciplinarity in the development of intelligent suspension systems with performance objectives that are capable of adjusting to various road conditions. The findings of this work underscore the growing importance of complex computational techniques in modern automotive industry and highlight their potential to shape future developments based on emerging trends and industry practices.

TI General Approach to Error Detection of Bosonic Codes via Phase
   Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a general approach to error detection of bosonic quantum error-correction codes via an adaptive quantum phase estimation algorithm assisted by a single ancilla qubit. The approach is applicable to a broad class of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.

SO PLOS ONE
AB Identification of the external electromagnetic fields and internal hyperfine parameters which optimize the quantum singlet-triplet yield of simplified radical pairs modeled by Schrodinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms are analyzed. A method that combines sensitivity analysis with Tikhonov regularization is implemented. Numerical results demonstrate that the quantum singlet-triplet yield of the radical pair system can be significantly reduced if optimization is pursued simultaneously for both external magnetic fields and internal hyperfine parameters. The results may contribute towards understanding the structure-function relationship of a putative magnetoreceptor to manipulate and enhance quantum coherences at room temperature and leveraging biofidelic function to inspire novel quantum devices.

TI Taxonomy of Polar Subspaces of Multi-Qubit Symplectic Polar Spaces of
   Small Rank
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We study certain physically-relevant subgeometries of binary symplectic polar spaces W(2N - 1,2) of small rank N, when the points of these spaces canonically encode N-qubit observables. Key characteristics of a subspace of such a space W(2N - 1, 2) are: the number of its negative lines, the distribution of types of observables, the character of the geometric hyperplane the subspace shares with the distinguished (non-singular) quadric of W(2N - 1, 2) and the structure of its Veldkamp space. In particular, we classify and count polar subspaces of W(2N - 1, 2) whose rank is N - 1. W(3, 2) features three negative lines of the same type and its W(1, 2)'s are of five different types. W(5, 2) is endowed with 90 negative lines of two types and its W(3, 2)'s split into 13 types. A total of 279 out of 480 W(3, 2)'s with three negative lines are composite, i.e., they all originate from the two-qubit W(3, 2). Given a three-qubit W(3, 2) and any of its geometric hyperplanes, there are three other W(3, 2)'s possessing the same hyperplane. The same holds if a geometric hyperplane is replaced by a 'planar' tricentric triad. A hyperbolic quadric of W(5, 2) is found to host particular sets of seven W(3, 2)'s, each of them being uniquely tied to a Conwell heptad with respect to the quadric. There is also a particular type of W(3, 2)'s, a representative of which features a point each line through which is negative. Finally, W(7,2) is found to possess 1908 negative lines of five types and its W(5, 2)'s fall into as many as 29 types. A total of 1524 out of 1560 W(5, 2)'s with 90 negative lines originate from the three-qubit W(5, 2). Remarkably, the difference in the number of negative lines for any two distinct types of four-qubit W(5, 2)'s is a multiple of four.

AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a promising solution for providing high secure key rates in moderate loss channels. A great advantage with respect to discrete-variable (DV) systems is the use of a technology similar to the one used in classical coherent communication, in particular for the detection system, which can operate at room temperature and benefits from an easier integration process. In addition to this, the use of advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques developed for classical communication allows for bandwidth-efficient temporal shaping, which optimizes the performance of the CV-QKD system. These techniques applied to the detected signal are also fundamental for using a locally generated local oscillator, correcting frequency and phase differences using frequency-multiplexed pilots generated by the transmitter. In this presentation, we will describe how these DSP techniques can be applied to a CV-QKD system and show some recent experimental results obtained by our research group, including results for a receiver based on a Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC).

TI Rigorous calibration of homodyne detection efficiency for
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a rigorous calibration method for homodyne detection efficiency, which combines all the factors that affect detection efficiency to calibrate together through the actual homodyne detection. With this method, the transmittance converted from electronic noise in the one-time calibration method of the shot noise can be attributed to the detection inefficiency. Thus, a trusted detection noise-free model for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) can be established, which simplifies the calibration of shot noise while having the same performance as the trusted detection noise model. We demonstrate this calibration method with a balanced detector based on a transimpedance amplifier. Experimental results show that detection efficiency will be overestimated if the integration factor of the detector is overlooked. The overestimation of the detection efficiency leads to an underestimation of modulation variance and excess noise when the modulation variance is monitored by the balanced detector, which opens security loopholes. Our method may prove a necessary method in the calibration of detection efficiency for CV-QKD. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB As quantum computing hardware systems continue to advance, the research and development of performant, scalable, and extensible software architectures, languages, models, and compilers is equally as important to bring this novel coprocessing capability to a diverse group of domain computational scientists. For the field of quantum chemistry, applications and frameworks exist for modeling and simulation tasks that scale on heterogeneous classical architectures, and we envision the need for similar frameworks on heterogeneous quantum-classical platforms. Here, we present the XACC system-level quantum computing framework as a platform for prototyping, developing, and deploying quantum-classical software that specifically targets chemistry applications. We review the fundamental design features in XACC, with special attention to its extensibility and modularity for key quantum programming workflow interfaces and provide an overview of the interfaces most relevant to simulations of chemistry. A series of examples demonstrating some of the state-of-the-art chemistry algorithms currently implemented in XACC are presented, while also illustrating the various APIs that would enable the community to extend, modify, and devise new algorithms and applications in the realm of chemistry.

TI Functionalized Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Simultaneous Drug Delivery
   and Quantum Sensing in HeLa Cells
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Here, we present multifunctional fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) for simultaneous drug delivery and free radical detection. For this purpose, we modified FNDs containing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with a diazoxide derivative. We found that our particles enter cells more easily and are able to deliver this cancer drug into HeLa cells. The particles were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and secondary electron microscopy. Compared to the free drug, we observe a sustained release over 72 h rather than 12 h for the free drug. Apart from releasing the drug, with these particles, we can measure the drug's effect on free radical generation directly. This has the advantage that the response is measured locally, where the drug is released. These FNDs change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. More specifically, we make use of a technique called relaxometry to detect spin noise from the free radical at the nanoscale with subcellular resolution. We further compared the results from our new technique with a conventional fluorescence assay for the detection of reactive oxygen species. This provides a new method to investigate the relationship between drug release and the response by the cell via radical formation or inhibition.

TI Filter-function formalism and software package to compute quantum
   processes of gate sequences for classical non-Markovian noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Correlated, non-Markovian noise is present in many solid-state systems employed as hosts for quantum information technologies, significantly complicating the realistic theoretical description of these systems. In this regime, the effects of noise on sequences of quantum gates cannot be described by concatenating isolated quantum operations if the environmental correlation times are on the scale of the typical gate durations. The filter-function formalism has been successful in characterizing the decay of coherence under the influence of such classical, non-Markovian environments, and here we show it can be applied to describe unital evolution within the quantum operations formalism. We find exact results for the quantum process and a simple composition rule for a sequence of operations. This enables the detailed study of effects of noise correlations on algorithms and periodically driven systems. Moreover, we point out the method's suitability for numerical applications and present the open-source Python software package filter_functions. Amongst other things, it facilitates computing the noise-averaged transfer matrix representation of a unital quantum operation in the presence of universal classical noise for arbitrary control sequences. We apply the presented methods to selected examples.

TI Routing and scheduling optimization for urban air mobility fleet
   management using quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The growing integration of urban air mobility (UAM) for urban transportation and delivery has accelerated due to increasing traffic congestion and its environmental and economic repercussions. Efficiently managing the anticipated high-density air traffic in cities is critical to ensure safe and effective operations. In this study, we propose a routing and scheduling framework to address the needs of a large fleet of UAM vehicles operating in urban areas. Using mathematical optimization techniques, we plan efficient and deconflicted routes for a fleet of vehicles. Formulating route planning as a maximum weighted independent set problem enables us to utilize various algorithms and specialized optimization hardware, such as quantum annealers, which has seen substantial progress in recent years. Our method is validated using a traffic management simulator tailored for the airspace in Singapore. Our approach enhances airspace utilization by distributing traffic throughout a region. This study broadens the potential applications of optimization techniques in UAM traffic management.

TI Practical semi-quantum key distribution with one-way key and one basis
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols are used to distribute secret keys between a quantum party and a classical party. However, existing SQKD protocols rely on two-way communication, and may still be vulnerable to Trojan horse side-channel attacks where Eve sends her own photon into a receiver's apparatus and measures the reflected photon to estimate the key. In this paper, we propose a practical SQKD with one-way key. This requires that the single photons travelling through the one-way channel are used to encode bit information, and the returned photons are used to quantify Eve's information, thus reducing the security analysis of the Trojan horse attack in SQKD. Meanwhile, our protocol with one basis enjoys security advantage in practical SQKD systems when source flaws are taken into account. In particular, the present protocol is secure under practical conditions when weak coherent pulses (WCP) are used. Our simulation results show that the protocol using WCP can distribute secret keys over a distance of 110 km without decoy states.

TI Experimental measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   with the double-scanning method
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can be immune to all detector side-channel attacks. Moreover, it can be easily implemented combining with the matured decoy-state methods under current technology. It, thus, seems a very promising candidate in practical implementation of quantum communications. However, it suffers from a severe finite-data-size effect in most existing MDI-QKD protocols, resulting in relatively low key rates. Recently, Jiang et al. [Phys. Rev A 103, 012402 (2021).] proposed a double-scanning method to drastically increase the key rate of MDI-QKD. Based on Jiang et al's theoretical work, here we for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, implement the double-scanning method into MDI-QKD and carry out corresponding experimental demonstration. With a moderate number of pulses of 10(10), we can achieve 150 km secure transmission distance, which is impossible with all former methods. Therefore, our present work paves the way toward practical implementation of MDI-QKD. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Dissipative Superradiant Spin Amplifier for Enhanced Quantum Sensing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum metrology protocols exploiting ensembles of N two-level systems and Ramsey-style measurements are ubiquitous. However, in many cases excess readout noise severely degrades the measurement sensitivity; in particular in sensors based on ensembles of solid-state defect spins. We present a dissipative "spin-amplification" protocol that allows us to dramatically improve the sensitivity of such schemes, even in the presence of realistic intrinsic dissipation and noise. Our method is based on exploiting collective (i.e., superradiant) spin decay, an effect that is usually seen as a nuisance because it limits spin-squeezing protocols. We show that our approach can allow a system with a highly imperfect spin readout to approach standard-quantum-limit-like scaling in N within a factor of 2, without needing to change the actual readout mechanism. Our ideas are compatible with several state-of-the-art experimental platforms where an ensemble of solid-state spins (NV centers, SiV centers) is coupled to a common microwave or mechanical mode.

TI Vibrational parametric arrays with trapped ions: Non-Hermitian
   topological phases and quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a linear array of trapped ions subjected to local parametric modulation of the trapping potential and continuous laser cooling. In our model, the phase of the parametric modulation varies linearly along the array, breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing nontrivial topological effects. The linear response to an external force is investigated with the Green's function formalism. We predict the appearance of topological amplification regimes in which the trapped ion array behaves as a directional amplifier of vibrational excitations. The emergence of topological phases is determined by a winding number related to non-Hermitian point-gap topology. Beyond its fundamental interests as a topological driven-dissipative system, our setup can be used for quantum sensing of ultraweak forces and electric fields. We consider a scheme in which a trapped ion at one edge of the array acts as a sensor of an ultraweak force, and the vibrational signal gets amplified toward the last trapped ion, which acts as a detector. We consider arrays of 2-30 25Mg+ ions, assuming that the detector ion's displacement is measured via fluorescence with a spatial resolution of 200-500 nm, and predict sensitivities as small as 1 yN Hz-1/2. Our system has the advantage that the detected force frequency can be tuned by adjusting the frequency of the periodic drive.

TI Nonorthogonal coding in spectrally-entangled photons
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Controlling and engineering continuous spectral modes of entangled photons represents one of the promising approaches toward secure quantum communications. By using the telecom bandwidth generated from a cascade-emitted biphoton in atomic ensembles, a fiber-based long-distance quantum communication can be feasible owing to its low transmission loss. With multiplexed photon pairs, we propose to implement a nonorthogonal coding scheme in their spectral modes and present an architecture of multiple channels enabling a high-capacity transfer of codewords. Using the measures of the second-order correlations and associated visibility and contrast, we further quantify the performance of the proposed nonorthogonal coding scheme. Our results demonstrate the capability to encode and decode quantum information beyond the orthogonal coding scheme, and in particular, the multi-channel setup manifests a resilience and an advantage in a design with multiple channel errors. The proposed scheme here can be applicable to a large-scale and multiuser quantum communication and pave the way toward an efficient and functional quantum information processing.

TI Rabi oscillations and entanglement between two atoms interacting by the
   Rydberg blockade studied by the Jaynes-Cummings Model
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The interaction between atoms and a quantized radiation field is fundamentally important in quantum optics and quantum information science. Due to their unusual properties, Rydberg atoms are promising building blocks for two-qubit gates and atom-light quantum interfaces, exploiting the Rydberg blockade interaction which prevents two atoms at close distance (< 10 mu m) from being simultaneously excited to Rydberg states. Recently, this effect was used to engineer quantum processors based on arrays of interacting Rydberg atoms illuminated by Raman lasers. Motivated by these experiments, we extend the Jaynes-Cummings model to study the interaction between two Rydberg atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade and a quantized radiation field. We consider both number (Fock) states of the field and single-mode quantum coherent states. In particular, we discuss different types of entanglements between various components of the total system consisting of the two Rydberg-interacting atoms and coherent states of the field, and show that the behavior is significantly different compared to a system with non-interacting atoms corresponding to the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model. Our results are relevant in view of atom-light quantum interfaces as components for future long-distance quantum communication.

TI Drive-induced nonlinearities of cavity modes coupled to a transmon
   ancilla
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB High-Q microwave cavity modes coupled to transmon ancillas provide a hardware-efficient platform for quantum computing. Due to their coupling, the cavity modes inherit finite nonlinearity from the transmons. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally investigate how an off-resonant drive on the transmon ancilla modifies the nonlinearities of the cavity modes in qualitatively different ways, depending on the interrelation among cavity-transmon detuning, drive-transmon detuning, and transmon anharmonicity. For a cavity-transmon detuning that is smaller than or comparable to the drive-transmon detuning and transmon anharmonicity, the off-resonant transmon drive can induce multiphoton resonances among cavity and transmon excitations that strongly modify cavity nonlinearities as drive parameters vary. For a large cavity-transmon detuning, the drive induces cavity-photon-number-dependent ac Stark shifts of transmon levels that translate into effective cavity nonlinearities. In the regime of weak transmon-cavity coupling, the cavity Kerr nonlinearity relates to the third-order nonlinear susceptibility function chi((3)) of the driven ancilla. This susceptibility function provides a numerically efficient way of computing the cavity Kerr, particularly for systems with many cavity modes controlled by a single transmon. It also serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying undesired drive-induced multiphoton resonance processes. Lastly, we show that by judiciously choosing the drive amplitude, a single off-resonant transmon drive can be used to cancel the cavity self-Kerr nonlinearity or the intercavity cross-Kerr. This provides a way of dynamically correcting the cavity Kerr nonlinearity during bosonic operations and quantum error correction protocols that rely on the cavity modes being linear.

TI Nearly optimal quasienergy estimation and eigenstate preparation of
   time-periodic Hamiltonians by Sambe space formalism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Time-periodic (Floquet) systems are one of the most interesting nonequilibrium systems. As the computation of energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians is a central problem in both classical and quantum computation, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates are the important targets. However, their computation has difficulty of time dependence; the problem can be mapped to a time-independent eigenvalue problem by the Sambe space formalism, but it instead requires additional infinite-dimensional space and seems to yield higher computational cost than the time-independent cases. It is still unclear whether they can be computed with guaranteed accuracy as efficiently as the time-independent cases. We address this issue by rigorously deriving the cutoff of the Sambe space to achieve the desired accuracy and organizing quantum algorithms for computing quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates based on the cutoff. The quantum algorithms return quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates with guaranteed accuracy like quantum phase estimation, which is the optimal algorithm for outputting energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians. While the time periodicity provides the additional dimension for the Sambe space and defines two different kinds of eigenstates, the query complexity of the algorithms achieves the near-optimal scaling in allowable errors. In addition, as a by-product of these algorithms, we also organize a quantum algorithm for Floquet eigenstate preparation, in which a preferred gapped Floquet eigenstate can be deterministically implemented with nearly optimal query complexity in the gap. These results show that, despite the difficulty of time dependence, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates can be computed almost as efficiently as time-independent cases, shedding light on the accurate and fast simulation of nonequilibrium systems on quantum computers.

TI Time-bin entangled Bell state generation and tomography on thin-film
   lithium niobate
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Optical quantum communication technologies are making the prospect of unconditionally secure and efficient information transfer a reality. The possibility of generating and reliably detecting quantum states of light, with the further need of increasing the private data-rate is where most research efforts are focusing. The physical concept of entanglement is a solution guaranteeing the highest degree of security in device-independent schemes, yet its implementation and preservation over long communication links is hard to achieve. Lithium niobate-on-insulator has emerged as a revolutionising platform for high-speed classical telecommunication and is equally suited for quantum information applications owing to the large second-order nonlinearities that can efficiently produce entangled photon pairs. In this work, we generate maximally entangled quantum states in the time-bin basis using lithium niobate-on-insulator photonics at the fibre optics telecommunication wavelength, and reconstruct the density matrix by quantum tomography on a single photonic integrated circuit. We use on-chip periodically-poled lithium niobate as source of entangled qubits with a brightness of 242 MHz/mW and perform quantum tomography with a fidelity of 91.9 +/- 1.0 %. Our results, combined with the established large electro-optic bandwidth of lithium niobate, showcase the platform as perfect candidate to realise fibre-coupled, high-speed time-bin quantum communication modules that exploit entanglement to achieve information security.

AB A general structure of unitary evolution (evaporation) of the black hole, respecting causality imposed by the event horizon (semicausality), has been derived and presented in the language of quantum circuits. The resulting consequences for the evolution of the corresponding entanglement entropy and the entropy curve have been determined. As an illustration of the general scheme, two families of qubit toy models have been discussed: tensor product models and controlled non-product models.

TI Satellite continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems using
   code-division multiple access
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of the satellite continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system that can not only support multiple users but also enhance the security. The satellite CV-QKD system is based on a code-division multiple access (CDMA) technique to simultaneously transmit multiple key streams from a trusted satellite to a ground station, which passively forwards these key streams to multiple users nearby via optical fibers. Our proposed architecture avoids using multiple ground stations that result in high costs. We analyze the performance of the proposed system under the negative impacts of atmospheric attenuation and atmospheric turbulence, as well as beam spreading and pointing error loss. Especially, the impact of multiple user interference is also considered in our analysis. The numerical results show that the proposed QKD system using CDMA can support multiple users, whose performance metrics such as quantum bit-er ror rate (QBER), sifted probability, and secret key rate meet the designed targets. The eavesdroppers suffer high QBER and low sifted probability, thus the security is guaranteed.

TI Quantum-safe hybrid key exchanges with KEM-based authentication
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is a foundational cryptographic building block that plays a critical role in safeguarding digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher, and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol dubbed Muckle+, which is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. The Muckle+ protocol is of a hybrid nature, in that it facilitates the incorporation of key material from conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography primitives into a unified authenticated shared key.To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, the efficiency of available instantiations of such signature schemes is not yet comparable to that of their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time. In order to address this discrepancy, the present work proposes Muckle#, a protocol that aims to expand the existing boundaries of efficiency within the HAKE framework. Muckle# utilizes post-quantum KEMs for implicit authentication, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in the domain of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly in KEMTLS (CCS'20).Our KEM-based approach results in a slightly different message flow compared to prior work and we developed novel proof techniques in the process. Moreover, we implemented a proof of concept, thereby demonstrating practicality of this alternative approach to authentication within HAKE.

TI Efficient Bipartite Entanglement Detection Scheme with a Quantum
   Adversarial Solver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The recognition of entanglement states is a notoriously difficult problem when no prior information is available. Here, we propose an efficient quantum adversarial bipartite entanglement detection scheme to address this issue. Our proposal reformulates the bipartite entanglement detection as a two-player zero-sum game completed by parameterized quantum circuits, where a two-outcome measurement can be used to query a classical binary result about whether the input state is bipartite entangled or not. In principle, for an N-qubit quantum state, the runtime complexity of our proposal is O(poly(N)T) with T being the number of iterations. We experimentally implement our protocol on a linear optical network and exhibit its effectiveness to accomplish the bipartite entanglement detection for 5-qubit quantum pure states and 2-qubit quantum mixed states. Our work paves the way for using near-term quantum machines to tackle entanglement detection on multipartite entangled quantum systems.

TI Composable end-to-end security of Gaussian quantum networks with
   untrusted relays
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Gaussian networks are fundamental objects in network information theory. Here many senders and receivers are connected by physically motivated Gaussian channels, while auxiliary Gaussian components, such as Gaussian relays, are entailed. Whilst the theoretical backbone of classical Gaussian networks is well established, the quantum analog is yet immature. Here, we theoretically tackle composable security of arbitrary Gaussian quantum networks, with generally untrusted nodes, in the finite-size regime. We put forward a general methodology for parameter estimation, which is only based on the data shared by the remote end-users. Taking a chain of identical quantum links as an example, we further demonstrate our study. Additionally, we find that the key rate of a quantum amplifier-assisted chain can ideally beat the fundamental repeaterless limit with practical block sizes. However, this objective is practically questioned leading the way to future network/chain designs.

TI A new design of an IoT-based industrial data management for smart
   manufacturing based on quantum circuits
SO CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND
   APPLICATIONS
AB Industrial data processing refers to the collecting, storage, and analysis of data for the linked enterprise. Effective data management boosts the efficiency of industrial businesses. Modern industrial firms create a significant volume of data, which overwhelms and inefficiently uses existing technologies. Previous data management techniques impede the working process of smart manufacturing. The data generated by manufacturing facilities grows quickly and must be processed, categorized, and saved in the proper sequence. All of this requires time and human work. In addition, on the Internet of Things (IoT), all parts of the network are connected in the same way, resulting in a common image structure. Ironically, these integrated IoT devices have low battery life, are time-consuming, and have long-lasting performance. To be effective in such work, these tools must solve many problems, including the use of sustainable practices, improved management, and facilitate rapid data communication. In a manufacturing environment, these devices serve as data sources, providing a wealth of information for production operations. Nonetheless, the enormous, varied, and time-sensitive nature of the data presents significant obstacles to real-time gathering, processing, and decision-making. As smart manufacturing is increasingly used in digital computing, IoT will become an integral part of the industrial data management they came. Moreover, due to their low power consumption and long lifespan, they are very easy to develop using quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology. The benefits of QCA technology not only apply to small IoT systems, but also focus on optimizing space utilization, energy efficiency, and performance. The performance and effectiveness of the model have been rigorously tested using tools such as QCADesigner-E 2.2 and QCAPro.

TI Efficient truncations of SU(Nc) lattice gauge theory for quantum
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the nonperturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large Nc expansions are performed to order 1/Nc to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU(Nc) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches, provided that the truncations in this work can reach lattice spacings in three-dimensional simulations comparable to the twodimensional simulations performed.

TI Quantum sensing of electric field distributions of liquid electrolytes
   with NV-centers in nanodiamonds
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB To use batteries as large-scale energy storage systems it is necessary to measure and understand their degradation in-situ and in-operando. As a battery's degradation is often the result of molecular processes inside the electrolyte, a sensing platform which allows to measure the ions with a high spatial resolution is needed. Primary candidates for such a platform are NV-centers in diamonds. We propose to use a single NV-center to deduce the electric field distribution generated by the ions inside the electrolyte through microwave pulse sequences. We show that the electric field can be reconstructed with great accuracy by using a protocol which includes different variations of the free induction decay to obtain the mean electric field components and a pulse sequence consisting of three polarized pi-pulses to measure the electric field's standard deviation sigma(E) . From a semi-analytical ansatz we find that for a lithium ion battery there is a direct relationship between sigma(E) and the ionic concentration. Our results show that it is therefore possible to use NV-centers as sensors to measure both the electric field distribution and the local ionic concentration inside electrolytes.

TI Polarization compensation method based on the wave plate group in phase
   mismatch for free-space quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Maintaining the polarization state in communication terminals is vital for polarization-encoding free-space quantum key distribution (QKD). Wave plate group phase mismatch caused by manufacturing errors, complex environmental effects, and the working wavelength deviation can reduce the polarization compensation effect. We found in theoretical analysis, that increasing phase mismatch of wave plates leads to the compensation method failure and reduces robustness. We propose a complementary polarization compensation method, which can effectively improve the robustness. Experimental results show that this method can improve the compensation effect by 50% at a slight phase mismatch, and realize a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 250:1 at the ergodic area even if the phase deviates to 0.27 pi. This method is beneficial to the high-stability design of free-space QKD systems and has the potential to be applied to QKD systems operating at multiple wavelengths.

TI Fast Reset Protocol for Superconducting Transmon Qubits
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB For larger-scale quantum information processing, qubit reset plays an important role, as the coherent times for qubits are limited. However, previous schemes require either long reset times or a complex pulse calibration technique, leading to low efficiency in qubit reset. Here, we propose a fast and simple reset protocol for superconducting transmon qubits based on the coupler-coupled qubits architecture. In this setup, a mixing pulse is used to transfer the qubit excitation to the combined excitation of a low-qulity coupler and readout resonator, which will quickly decay to their respectively ground states, leading to efficient qubit reset to the ground state. Our numerical results show that the residual population of the qubit's excited state can be suppressed to 0.04% within 28 ns; the reset time will be 283 ns if photon depletion of the readout resonator is required. Thus, our protocol provides a promising way for the high-efficiency superconducting qubit reset.

TI Tunable transverse spin-motion coupling for quantum information
   processing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Laser-controlled entanglement between atomic qubits ('spins') and collective motion in trapped ion Coulomb crystals requires conditional momentum transfer from the laser. Since the spin-dependent force is derived from a spatial gradient in the spin-light interaction, this force is typically longitudinal-parallel and proportional to the average laser k-vector (or two beams' k-vector difference), which constrains both the direction and relative magnitude of the accessible spin-motion coupling. Here, we show how momentum can also be transferred perpendicular to a single laser beam due to the gradient in its transverse profile. By controlling the transverse gradient at the position of the ion through beam shaping, the relative strength of the sidebands and carrier can be tuned to optimize the desired interaction and suppress undesired, off-resonant effects that can degrade gate fidelity. We also discuss how this effect may already be playing an unappreciated role in recent experiments.

TI A quantum algorithm for linear autonomous differential equations using
   Padé approximation
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Pad & eacute; approximation. For linear autonomous ODEs, the discretized solution can be represented by a product of matrix exponentials. The proposed algorithm approximates the matrix exponential by the diagonal Pad & eacute; approximation, which is then encoded into a large, block-sparse linear system and solved via quantum linear system algorithms (QLSA). The detailed quantum circuit is given based on quantum oracle access to the matrix, the inhomogeneous term, and the initial state. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Compared to the method based on Taylor approximation, which approximates the matrix exponential using a k-th order Taylor series, the proposed algorithm improves the approximation order k from two perspectives: 1) the explicit complexity dependency on k is improved, and 2) a smaller k suffices for the same precision. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm comparing to other related algorithms.

This paper introduces the "k-agents"framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. The framework uses large-language-model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge, including available operations and methods for analyzing results. To automate experiments, execution agents break multistep procedures into agent-based state machines, interact with other agents to execute steps, and analyze results. These results drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. We demonstrate the system on a superconducting quantum processor, where agents autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at human-level performance. Our knowledge-based agent system opens new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.

TI Cross-platform protected qubits from entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A crucial ingredient for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise protection, in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence we term them entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space CP(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the nonlinear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons, which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection, and in which the qubit-basis states are the two lowest-energy states with a higher-energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits, and trapped ion platforms, to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in nonlinear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault tolerance.

TI High-Performance Carrier Phase Recovery for Local Local Oscillator
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has been increasingly studied, which offers the advantage of compatibility with modern coherent optical communication systems. In contrast to CV-QKD with a transmitting local oscillator, the local local oscillator CV-QKD avoids the security vulnerabilities of a local oscillator by generating a local oscillator at the receiver. In practice, the frequency offset of the two lasers introduces extra phase noise, which is generally suppressed by various carrier phase recovery algorithms. However, the accuracy of carrier phase recovery can be influenced by the power of the pilot tone, particularly as the transmission distance increases. To further improve accuracy, we propose a method based on the unscented particle filter algorithm, to increase the accuracy of phase estimation, effectively restore the quantum signal and reduce excess noise. In our work, we demonstrated a local local oscillator CV-QKD experiment with a finite-size block of 1x108 under a transmission distance of 50 km. Through our method, we achieved a secret key rate of 525 kbps, which represents a 28% improvement. These results confirm that our proposed method not only improves the accuracy of carrier phase recovery, but also provides a new approach for future research on algorithms for long-distance CV-QKD. Furthermore, our study improves the phase compensation performance, enabling the orthogonal components of the quantum signal to exhibit enhanced symmetry in phase space.

TI Nanoscale electric-field imaging based on a quantum sensor and its
   charge-state control under ambient condition
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can be used as quantum sensors to image the magnetic field with nanoscale resolution. However, nanoscale electric-field mapping has not been achieved so far because of the relatively weak coupling strength between NV and electric field. Here, using individual shallow NVs, we quantitatively image electric field contours from a sharp tip of a qPlus-based atomic force microscope (AFM), and achieve a spatial resolution of similar to 10nm. Through such local electric fields, we demonstrated electric control of NV's charge state with sub-5 nm precision. This work represents the first step towards nanoscale scanning electrometry based on a single quantum sensor and may open up the possibility of quantitatively mapping local charge, electric polarization, and dielectric response in a broad spectrum of functional materials at nanoscale.

TI Modeling Si/SiGe quantum dot variability induced by interface disorder
   reconstructed from multiperspective microscopy
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB SiGe heteroepitaxial growth yields pristine host material for quantum dot qubits, but residual interface disorder can lead to qubit-to-qubit variability that might pose an obstacle to reliable SiGe-based quantum computing. By convolving data from scanning tunneling microscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reconstruct 3D interfacial atomic structure and employ an atomistic multi-valley effective mass theory to quantify qubit spectral variability. The results indicate (1) appreciable valley splitting (VS) variability of similar to 50% owing to alloy disorder and (2) roughness-induced double-dot detuning bias energy variability of order 1-10 meV depending on well thickness. For measured intermixing, atomic steps have negligible influence on VS, and uncorrelated roughness causes spatially fluctuating energy biases in double-dot detunings potentially incorrectly attributed to charge disorder. Our approach yields atomic structure spanning orders of magnitude larger areas than post-growth microscopy or tomography alone, enabling more holistic predictions of disorder-induced qubit variability.

TI Probing the spectral dimension of quantum network geometries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB We consider an environment for an open quantum system described by a 'quantum network geometry with flavor' (QNGF) in which the nodes are coupled quantum oscillators. The geometrical nature of QNGF is reflected in the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix of the network which display a finite spectral dimension, determining also the frequencies of the normal modes of QNGFs. We show that an a priori unknown spectral dimension can be indirectly estimated by coupling an auxiliary open quantum system to the network and probing the normal mode frequencies in the low frequency regime. We find that the network parameters do not affect the estimate; in this sense it is a property of the network geometry, rather than the values of, e.g., oscillator bare frequencies or the constant coupling strength. Numerical evidence suggests that the estimate is also robust both to small changes in the high frequency cutoff and noisy or missing normal mode frequencies. We propose to couple the auxiliary system to a subset of network nodes with random coupling strengths to reveal and resolve a sufficiently large subset of normal mode frequencies.

TI Robust multipartite entanglement without entanglement breaking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entangled systems in experiments may be lost or off-line in distributed quantum information processing. This inspires a general problem to characterize quantum operations, which result in breaking of entanglement or not. Our goal in this paper is to solve this problem both in single entanglement and network scenarios. We firstly propose a local model for characterizing all entangled states that are breaking for losing particles. This implies a simple criterion for witnessing single entanglement such as generalized GHZ states and Dicke states. It further provides an efficient witness for entangled quantum networks depending on its connectivity such as k-independent quantum networks, completely connected quantum networks, and k-connected quantum networks. These networks are universal resources for measurement-based quantum computations. The strong nonlocality can be finally verified by using nonlinear inequalities. These results show distinctive features of both single entangled systems and entangled quantum networks.

TI Resource-effective quantum key distribution: a field trial in Padua city
   center
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Field trials are of key importance for novel technologies seeking commercialization and widespread adoption. This is also the case for quantum key distribution (QKD), which allows distant parties to distill a secret key with unconditional security. Typically, QKD demonstrations over urban infrastructures require complex stabilization and synchronization systems to maintain a low quantum bit error and high secret key rates over time. Here we present a field trial that exploits low-complexity self-stabilized hardware and a novel synchronization technique, to perform QKD over optical fibers deployed in the city center of Padua, Italy. Two techniques recently introduced by our research group are evaluated in a real-world environment: the iPOGNAC polarization encoder was used for preparation of the quantum states, while temporal synchronization was performed with the Qubit4Sync algorithm. The results here presented demonstrate the validity and robustness of our resource-effective QKD system, which can be easily and rapidly installed in an existing telecommunication infrastructure, thus representing an important step towards mature, efficient, and low-cost QKD systems.

TI D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance
   Analysis
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.

TI Optimally Band-Limited Noise Filtering for Single-Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We introduce a quantum control protocol that produces smooth, experimentally implementable control sequences optimized to combat temporally correlated noise for single-qubit systems. The control ansatz is specifically chosen to be a functional expansion of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, a discrete time basis known to be optimally concentrated in time and frequency, and quite attractive when faced with experimental control hardware constraints. We leverage the filter function formalism to transform the control problem into a filter design problem, and show that the frequency response of a quantum system can be carefully tailored to avoid the most relevant dynamical contributions of noise processes. Using gradient ascent, we obtain optimized filter functions and exploit them to elucidate important details about the relationship between filter function design, control bandwidth, and noise characteristics. In particular, we identify regimes of optimal noise suppression and, in turn, optimal control bandwidth directly proportional to the size of the frequency bands where the noise power is large. In addition to providing guiding principles for filter design, our approach enables the development of controls that simultaneously yield robust noise filtering and high-fidelity single-qubit logic operations in a wide variety of complex noise environments.

TI Diagnosing emergent isotropy in anisotropic holographic systems using

Through rigorous semi-analytical methods, we uncover the existence of an isotropic point emerging at a critical temperature TII,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$T_{II},$$\end{document} marking a significant transition in the system's anisotropic properties. We offer a systematic analysis of the mechanisms driving anisotropy and isotropy transitions, finding that this emergent isotropy point is unique to the p-wave model and absent in other anisotropic systems like anisotropic axion models with metal-insulator transitions. We propose that the explicit dependence of the vector field components in anisotropy is the key driver of the emergent isotropy. Our analysis of holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity demonstrates their distinct sensitivities to bulk anisotropy. Among them, EWCS and butterfly velocity stand out as superior probes for detecting the isotropic point. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the interplay between unique emergent isotropic point and quantum information measures in strongly correlated systems.

TI Qubit-photon bound states in topological waveguides with long-range
   hoppings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum emitters interacting with photonic band-gap materials lead to the appearance of qubit-photon bound states that mediate decoherence-free, tunable emitter-emitter interactions. Recently, it has been shown that when these band gaps have a topological origin, like in the photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, these qubit-photon bound states feature chiral shapes and certain robustness to disorder. In this paper, we consider a more general situation where the emitters interact with an extended SSH photonic model with longer-range hoppings that displays a richer phase diagram than its nearest-neighbor counterpart, e.g., phases with larger winding numbers. In particular, we first study the features of the qubit-photon bound states when the emitters couple to the bulk modes in the different phases, discern their connection with the topological invariant, and show how to further tune their shape through the use of giant atoms, i.e., nonlocal couplings. Then, we consider the coupling of emitters to the edge modes appearing in the different topological phases. Here, we show that giant-atom dynamics can distinguish between all different topological phases, in contrast to the case with local couplings. Finally, we provide a possible experimental implementation of the model based on periodic modulations of circuit QED systems. Our paper enriches the understanding of the interplay between topological photonics and quantum optics.

TI Circadian system coordination: new perspectives beyond classical models
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Background This review examines novel interaction mechanisms contributing to the robustness of circadian rhythms, focusing on enhanced communication between the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks. While classical models explain biological clocks through molecular interactions and biochemical signaling, they incompletely account for several key features: precision maintenance despite cellular noise, rapid system-wide synchronization, and temperature compensation. We propose that the SCN, acting as a central hub, may utilize non-classical mechanisms to maintain robust synchronization of peripheral clocks, contributing to biological timekeeping stability. The clinical implications of this model are significant, potentially offering new approaches for treating circadian-related disorders through quantum-based interventions. Recent advances in quantum biosensors and diagnostic tools show promise for early detection and monitoring of circadian disruptions, while quantum-based therapeutic strategies may provide novel treatments for conditions ranging from sleep disorders to metabolic syndromes.Aim of review To evaluate classical models of circadian rhythm robustness and propose a novel synchronization model incorporating quantum mechanical principles, supported by recent advances in quantum biology and chronobiology, with emphasis on potential clinical applications.Key scientific concepts Recent research in quantum biology suggests potential mechanisms for enhanced circadian system coordination. The proposed model explores how quantum effects, including entanglement and coherence, may facilitate rapid system-wide synchronization and temporal coherence across tissues. These mechanisms could explain features not fully addressed by classical models: precision maintenance in noisy cellular environments, rapid resynchronization following environmental changes, temperature compensation of circadian periods, and sensitivity to weak electromagnetic fields. The framework integrates established chronobiology with quantum biological principles to explain system-wide temporal coordination and suggests new therapeutic approaches for circadian-related disorders.

TI Photophysics of blue quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as intriguing contenders for integrated quantum photonics. In this work, we present a detailed photophysical analysis of hBN single emitters emitting at the blue spectral range. The emitters are fabricated by different electron beam irradiation and annealing conditions and exhibit narrow-band luminescence centred at 436 nm. Photon statistics as well as rigorous photodynamics analysis unveils potential level structure of the emitters, which suggests lack of a metastable state, supported by a theoretical analysis. The potential defect can have an electronic structure with fully occupied defect state in the lower half of the hBN band gap and empty defect state in the upper half of the band gap. Overall, our results are important to understand the photophysical properties of the emerging family of blue quantum emitters in hBN as potential sources for scalable quantum photonic applications.

TI Compact and stable source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs based
   on a folded linear displacement interferometer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The realization of quantum networks requires the development of robust, low-size, weight, and power (SWaP) systems suitable for operation under harsh environments in remote and mobile nodes such as satellites. We present a source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs in a folded linear displacement interferometer based on spontaneous parametric down conversion using a Type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The qualities and demonstrated performance of the source make it suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.

TI Simulating strongly interacting Hubbard chains with the variational
   Hamiltonian ansatz on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to circumvent noise limitations in quantum computers. Such algorithms delegate only a calculation of the expectation value to the quantum computer. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver has been implemented to study molecules and condensed matter systems on small size quantum computers. Condensed matter systems described by the Hubbard model exhibit a rich phase diagram alongside exotic states of matter. In this paper we try to answer the question: How much of the underlying physics of a 1D Hubbard chain is described by a problem-inspired variational Hamiltonian ansatz in a broad range of parameter values? We start by probing how much the solution increases fidelity with increasing ansatz complexity. Our findings suggest that even low fidelity solutions capture energy and number of doubly occupied sites well, while spin-spin correlations are not well captured even when the solution is of high fidelity. Our powerful simulation platform allows us to incorporate a realistic noise model and shows a successful implementation of noise-mitigation strategies-postselection and the Richardson extrapolation. Finally, we compare our results with an experimental realization of the algorithm on IBM Quantum's ibmq_quito device.

TI Fast Quantum Control of Cavities Using an Improved Protocol without
   Coherent Errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The selective number-dependent arbitrary phase gates form a powerful class of quantum gates, imparting arbitrarily chosen phases to the Fock states of a cavity. However, for short pulses, coherent errors limit the performance. Here, we demonstrate in theory and experiment that such errors can be completely suppressed, provided that the pulse times exceed a specific limit. The resulting shorter gate times also reduce incoherent errors. Our approach needs only a small number of frequency components, the resulting pulses can be interpreted easily, and it is compatible with fault-tolerant schemes.

TI Using Quantum Key Distribution With Free Space Optics to Secure
   Communications in High-Speed Trains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the emerging era of quantum communications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices in high-speed train (HST) environments encounter formidable challenges. These devices are constrained by limited power and computational capabilities while needing to safeguard their data and communications against adversaries equipped with quantum-grade computational power. To counter such threats, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) emerges as a vital solution, facilitating secure communication between servers and IoT controllers, thereby shielding the more vulnerable IoT sensors. This paper delves into the application of QKD within the unique scenario of HSTs, employing Free Space Optics (FSO) to establish high data rate communication channels. Our experimental setup involves the integration of FSO links for photon exchange essential to QKD. We meticulously explore the QKD process in the context of HSTs, detailing our methodology that involves the alignment of FSO transceivers on ground base stations with those on the moving trains, thereby enabling efficient photon exchange. The study presents quantitative results demonstrating that this approach allows for the exchange of a substantial number of keys, with negligible impact on FSO data throughput. These findings highlight that our proposed method can significantly enhance IoT communication security in HSTs without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to train passengers. Furthermore, we assess the system's performance under various visibility conditions, which is crucial for FSO viability. Our results indicate the robustness of the proposed QKD method in diverse operational scenarios, underlining its practical applicability in securing IoT communications within HST environments. Through this study, we provide a comprehensive understanding of implementing QKD in high-speed mobile settings, contributing valuable insights into its effectiveness and feasibility.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As the field of superconducting quantum computing approaches maturity, optimization of single-device performance is proving to be a promising avenue toward large-scale quantum computers. However, this optimization is possible only if performance metrics can be accurately compared among measurements, devices, and laboratories. Currently, such comparisons are inaccurate or impossible due to understudied errors from a plethora of sources. In this Perspective, we outline the current state of error analysis for qubits and resonators in superconducting quantum circuits and discuss what future investigations are required before superconducting quantum device optimization can be realized.

TI QUANTUM LOGIC UNDER SEMICLASSICAL LIMIT: INFORMATION LOSS
SO UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider the quantum computation efficiency from a new perspective. The efficiency is reduced to its classical counterpart by imposing the semiclassical limit. We show that this reduction is caused by the fact that any elementary quantum logic operation (gate) suffers the information loss during the transition to its classical analog. Amount of the information lost is estimated for any gate from the complete set. We demonstrate that the largest loss is obtained for non-commuting gates. This allows us to consider the non-commutativity as the quantum computational speed-up resource. Our method allows us to quantify advantages of a quantum computation as compared to the classical one by the direct analysis of the involved basic logic. The obtained results are illustrated by the application to a quantum discrete Fourier transform and Grover search algorithms.

TI QRoNS: Quantum Resilience over IPsec Tunnels for Network Slicing
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Modern high-performance network infrastructures must address the challenges of scalability and quantum-resistant security, particularly in multi-tenant and virtualized environments. In this work, we introduce a novel implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-IPsec using the NVIDIA BlueField-3 Data Processing Unit (Santa Clara, CA, USA), capable of achieving 400 Gbit/s. We demonstrate line-rate performance through quantum-resilient communication channels using Kyber1024 (ML-KEM) and Dilithium5 (ML-DSA). We evaluate our implementation on two experimental setups; a host-to-host configuration and a 16 Virtual Machines (VMs)-to-host setup, both across a direct high-speed link. We set the Data Processing Unit (DPU) on both Network Interface Card (NIC) mode with no/crypto/full packet offload and on DPU mode by configuring Open vSwitch (OvS) on the ARM cores and offloading the packet processing to the hardware. We achieve 97.5% of the available line-rate for 14 VMs and 99.9% for 16 VMs, in DPU mode. Our findings confirm that PQC-enabled IPsec can operate at line-rate speeds in modern data centers, providing a practical and future-proof foundation for secure, high-throughput communication in the post-quantum computing era.

TI Coexistence of Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution and
   Classical Data over 120 km Fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical data transmission over the same fiber is crucial for scalable quantum-secured communication. However, noise from classical channels limits QKD distance. We demonstrate the longest-distance continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) over 120 km (20 dB loss) in the asymptotic regime, and over 100 km (17 dB loss) in the finite-size regime, both coexisting with a fully populated coarse wavelength division multiplexing system. Natural mode filtering of the local oscillator and phase noise mitigation enabled this without additional filtering or wavelength reallocation. Benchmarking against a commercial discrete-variable QKD system and considering finite-size effects confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD as a plug-and-play solution for typical 80-100 km long-haul optical networks. Our results set a record fiber distance for CV-QKD, showing its potential for cost-effective, largescale deployment in existing network infrastructure.

TI A demonstration of quantum key distribution with entangled photons for
   the undergraduate laboratory
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Now that fundamental quantum principles of indeterminacy and measurement have become the basis of new technologies that provide secrecy between two communicating parties, there is a need to provide teaching laboratories that illustrate how these technologies work. In this article, we describe a laboratory exercise in which students perform quantum key distribution with single photons, and see how the secrecy of the communication is ensured by the principles of quantum superposition and state projection. We used a table-top apparatus, similar to those used in correlated-photon undergraduate laboratories, to implement the Bennett-Brassard-84 protocol with polarization-entangled photons. Our experiment shows how the communication between two parties is disrupted by an eavesdropper. We use a simple quartz plate to mimic how an eavesdropper intercepts, measures, and resends the photons used in the communication, and we analyze the state of the light to show how the eavesdropper changes it.

TI Quantum simulation of conical intersections
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We explore the simulation of conical intersections (CIs) on quantum devices, setting the groundwork for potential applications in nonadiabatic quantum dynamics within molecular systems. The intersecting potential energy surfaces of H3+ are computed from a variance-based contracted quantum eigensolver. We show how the CIs can be correctly described on quantum devices using wavefunctions generated by the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrodinger equation ansatz, which is a unitary transformation of wavefunctions that preserves the topography of CIs. A hybrid quantum-classical procedure is used to locate the seam of CIs. Additionally, we discuss the quantum implementation of the adiabatic to diabatic transformation and its relation to the geometric phase effect. Results on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices showcase the potential of quantum computers in dealing with problems in nonadiabatic chemistry.

TI A Class of Three-Qubit Contextual Configurations Located in Fano Pentads
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Given the symplectic polar space of type W(5,2), let us call a set of five Fano planes sharing pairwise a single point a Fano pentad. Once 63 points of W(5,2) are appropriately labeled by 63 non-trivial three-qubit observables, any such Fano pentad gives rise to a quantum contextual set known as a Mermin pentagram. Here, it is shown that a Fano pentad also hosts another, closely related, contextual set, which features 25 observables and 30 three-element contexts. Out of 25 observables, ten are such that each of them is on six contexts, while each of the remaining 15 observables belongs to two contexts only. Making use of the recent classification of Mermin pentagrams (Saniga et al., Symmetry 12 (2020) 534), it was found that 12,096 such contextual sets comprise 47 distinct types, falling into eight families according to the number (3,5,7, horizontal ellipsis ,17) of negative contexts.

TI Group Transference Techniques for the Estimation of the Decoherence
   Times and Capacities of Quantum Markov Semigroups
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating capacities directly is known to be intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called transferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. In particular, we study two subclasses of such kernels: Hormander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on d qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels that randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application of this transference principle to the estimation of decoherence time, of private and quantum capacities, of entanglement-assisted classical capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our estimates hold for nonergodic channels such as the collective decoherence channels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques.

TI Towards a Unified Quantum Risk Assessment
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum computing poses an unprecedented threat to classical cryptography, requiring new risk assessment paradigms. This paper proposes a Quantum-Adjusted Risk Score (QARS) model, a theoretical and methodological innovation within the EU's PAREK framework (Post-quantum asset and algorithm inventory, risk assessment, road mapping, execution, key governance). QARS extends Mosca's inequality-which defines a quantum threat timeline threshold-into a multi-factor risk scoring formula. We formalise QARS with mathematical expressions incorporating timeline, sensitivity, and exposure dimensions, each calibrated by factor weights and scaling functions. The design motivations for including these dimensions are discussed in depth. We present method for model calibration (including sector-specific weight adjustments) and outline validation strategies combining quantitative analysis and expert judgement. The proposed QARS model is situated in the context of the EU's coordinated roadmap for post-quantum cryptography and cybersecurity regulations, illustrating how QARS supports compliance and strategic migration prioritisation. A prototype tool implementing QARS model is also provided to demonstrate practical applicability. Our contributions provide a unified approach to quantum risk assessment, marrying theoretical rigour with policy-relevant risk management needs to help organizations proactively address the quantum threat.

TI Measuring Chern-Simons level k by braiding SU(2)k anyons
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Chern-Simons theory in application to the quantum computing is actively developing at the present. However, most discussed are the questions of using materials with known parameters and building corresponding quantum gates and algorithms. In this paper we discuss opposite problem of finding Chern-Simons level k in the unknown material. For this purpose, we use the previously derived braiding rules for Chern-Simons SU(2)k anyons. Using certain operations (turnarounds) on three anyons, one can measure probabilities of annihilation of pairs of anyons, which depend on the parameter of the theory. Therefore, Chern-Simons level k can be found from such an experiment. It is implied that anyons additionally possess certain properties which are required for topological quantum computations.

TI Quantum Hacking: Induced-Photorefraction Attack on a Practical
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In a practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system, a new security loophole opened by the photorefractive effect of lithium niobate-based (LN-based) modulators is explored. Exploiting this loophole, a quantum hacking strategy called the induced-photorefraction attack is proposed. This strategy utilizes the induced photorefraction on the LN-based modulators to conceal a classical intercept-resend attack. Specifically, the induced photorefraction biases the response curve of the LN-based modulator, which affects the intensity of the modulated signal. Based on the investigation of channel parameter estimation and the analysis of the secret key rate of the practical CVQKD system, the simulation results show that the communication parties overestimate the secret key rate, which reveals that Eve can actively open a security loophole via the induced-photorefraction attack to obtain secret key information. To defend against this attack, a random monitoring scheme for modulation variance is proposed to detect the attack, along with an improved optical power limiter to mitigate the irradiation beam. Additionally, a Sagnac-based IM is suggested to stabilize the practical CVQKD system. Furthermore, the impact of this attack is analyzed on continuous-variable measurement-device-independent QKD systems ((CV-MDI-QKD) and on local-local-oscillator (LLO) systems and propose countermeasures for each. Finally, the passive-state-preparation CVQKD protocol is proposed to fundamentally close the security loopholes originating from the modulators.

TI Quantum Time-Space Tradeoff for Finding Multiple Collision Pairs
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATION THEORY
AB We study the problem of finding K collision pairs in a random function f : [ N]. [N] by using a quantum computer. We prove that the number of queries to the function in the quantum random oracle model must increase significantly when the size of the available memory is limited. Namely, we demonstrate that any algorithm using S qubits of memory must perform a number T of queries that satisfies the tradeoff (TS)-S-3 >= Omega((KN)-N-3). Classically, the same question has only been settled recently by Dinur [22], who showed that the Parallel Collision Search algorithm of van Oorschot and Wiener [36] achieves the optimal time-space tradeoff of T S-2 = Theta((KN)-N-2). Our result limits the extent to which quantum computing may decrease this tradeoff. Our method is based on a novel application of Zhandry's recording query technique [42] for proving lower bounds in the exponentially small success probability regime. As a second application, we give a simpler proof of the time-space tradeoff (TS)-S-2 >= Omega(N-3) for sorting N numbers on a quantum computer, which was first obtained by Klauck, Spalek, and de Wolf [30].

TI Disentanglement Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Environments
SO ENTROPY
AB We theoretically study the non-Markovian disentanglement dynamics of a two-qubit system coupled to nonequilibrium environments with nonstationary and non-Markovian random telegraph noise statistical properties. The reduced density matrix of the two-qubit system can be expressed as the Kraus representation in terms of the tensor products of the single qubit Kraus operators. We derive the relation between the entanglement and nonlocality of the two-qubit system which are both closely associated with the decoherence function. We identify the threshold values of the decoherence function to ensure the existences of the concurrence and nonlocal quantum correlations for an arbitrary evolution time when the two-qubit system is initially prepared in the composite Bell states and the Werner states, respectively. It is shown that the environmental nonequilibrium feature can suppress the disentanglement dynamics and reduce the entanglement revivals in non-Markovian dynamics regime. In addition, the environmental nonequilibrium feature can enhance the nonlocality of the two-qubit system. Moreover, the entanglement sudden death and rebirth phenomena and the transition between quantum and classical nonlocalities closely depend on the parameters of the initial states and the environmental parameters in nonequilibrium environments.

TI Tunable quantum frequency conversion enabled by intermodal nonlinearity
   in optical fiber
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Optical frequency conversion plays a key role in realizing large-scale quantum networks, including multi-qubit discrete-variable quantum computers and quantum communication links where photons serve as the fundamental qubits. However, achieving efficient conversion via nonlinear optical processes for specific target wavelengths remains a significant challenge, as precise dispersion control is essential to satisfy phase-matching conditions across specific frequency ranges. An intriguing approach to solve this challenge is leveraging the modal degree of freedom in spatially multimoded waveguides and realizing intermodal nonlinear interaction. Following this approach, we present the experimental demonstration of tunable, number-state-preserving frequency conversion of true single photons emitted from a quantum dot. The conversion is achieved in a multimode fiber and exhibits a peak internal efficiency of 85% while retaining single photon purity of 99% during conversion. Our results show that the intermodal platform presents a promising and versatile approach for overcoming phase-matching limitations in quantum frequency conversion, thus allowing the efficient interfacing of different optical quantum devices.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Spectral Allocation and Performance in
   Coexistence With Passive Optical Network Standards
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB We provide design guidelines for the integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) into legacy passive optical networks (PONs). Our study addresses the challenge of quantum coexistence with various PON standards in different network topologies. We develop a novel theoretical model to assess the impact of the passive optical distribution network on both the quantum signal and the generation of scattered Raman photons from classical signals. This work also includes an extensive Raman efficiency experimental evaluation over a wide frequency range. The study evaluates the integration of upstream QKD systems in 32- or 64-user PON scenarios, determining quantum-available bandwidths and maximum supported PON lengths. In single-fibre architectures the coexistence with standards having upstream and downstream classical channels in different telecommunication fibre windows (e.g. XG-PON) is extremely challenging due to the pervasive spectrum placement of the spontaneous Raman scattering noise. However dual-feeder architectures (i.e., placing the QKD receiver at the OLT-side of the protection feeder fibre) can significantly enhance QKD performance and support the key-exchange over the entire standardized PON length for most PON standards and even in case of two-PON standard presence. Finally, the dual-fibre topology allows the quantum coexistence in access networks where three classical standards share the same infrastructure.

TI Dictionary Learning Based Scheme for Adversarial Defense in
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB There exist various attack strategies in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system in practice. Due to the powerful information processing ability of neural networks, they are applied to the detection and classification of attack strategies in CVQKD systems. However, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, resulting in the CVQKD system using neural networks also having security risks. To solve this problem, we propose a defense scheme for the CVQKD system. We first perform low-rank dimensionality reduction on the CVQKD system data through regularized self-representation-locality preserving projects (RSR-LPP) to filter out some adversarial disturbances, and then perform sparse coding reconstruction through dictionary learning to add data details and filter residual adversarial disturbances. We test the proposed defense algorithm in the CVQKD system. The results indicate that our proposed scheme has a good monitoring and alarm effect on CVQKD adversarial disturbances and has a better effect than other compared defense algorithms.

TI Deep learning the hierarchy of steering measurement settings of
   qubit-pair states
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum steering has attracted increasing research attention because of its fundamental importance, as well as its applications in quantum information science. Here we leverage the power of the deep learning model to infer the steerability of quantum states with specific numbers of measurement settings, which form a hierarchical structure. A computational protocol consisting of iterative tests is constructed to overcome the optimization, meanwhile, generating the necessary training data. According to the responses of the well-trained models to the different physics-driven features encoding the states to be recognized, we can numerically conclude that the most compact characterization of the Alice-to-Bob steerability is Alice's regularly aligned steering ellipsoid; whereas Bob's ellipsoid is irrelevant. We have also provided an explanation to this result with the one-way stochastic local operations and classical communication. Additionally, our approach is versatile in revealing further insights into the hierarchical structure of quantum steering and detecting the hidden steerability.
   To prepare steerable assembles from a bipartite quantum state is a cumbersome task due to the optimization over all possible incompatible measurements. Here the authors leverage the power of the deep learning model to infer the hierarchy of steering measurement settings and reveal the most compact parameters to characterize the Alice-to-Bob steerability.

TI Security loophole induced by photorefractive effect in
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Modulators based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure are widely used in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems. MZI-based variable optical attenuator (VOA) and amplitude modulator can reshape the waveform and control the intensity of the coherent state signal to realize secret key information modulation in the CVQKD system. However, these devices are not ideal; internal and external effects like non-linear effects and temperature may degrade their performance. In this paper, we analyzed the security loophole of CVQKD under the photorefractive effect (PE), which originates from the crystal characteristics of lithium niobate (LN). It is found that the refractive index change of modulators because of PE may lead to an overestimate or underestimate of the final secret key rate. This allows Eve to perform further attacks like intercept-resend to get more secret key information. To solve this problem, several countermeasures are proposed, which can effectively eliminate potential risks.

TI Real-time operation of a multi-rate, mult-protocol quantum key
   distribution transmitter
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the best candidate for securing communications against attackers, who may in the future exploit quantum-enhanced computational powers to break classical encryption. As such, new challenges are arising from our need for large-scale deployment of QKD systems. In a realistic scenario, transmitting and receiving devices from different vendors should be able to communicate with each other without the need for matching hardware. Therefore, practical deployment of QKD would require hardware capable of adapting to different protocols and clock rates. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a multi-rate, multi-protocol QKD transmitter linked to a correspondingly adaptable QKD receiver. The flexibility of the transmitter, achieved by optical injection locking, allows us to connect it with two receivers with inherently different clock rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the multi-protocol operation of our transmitter, communicating with receiving parties employing different decoding circuits.

TI Arbitrarily-high-dimensional reconciliation via cross-rotation for
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Multidimensional rotation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing information reconciliation and extending the transmission distance in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, the lack of closed-form orthogonal transformations for high-dimensional rotations has limited the maximum reconciliation efficiency to channels with eight dimensions over the past decade. This paper presents a cross-rotation scheme to overcome this limitation and enable reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions, constrained to even multiples of eight. The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into matrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in a cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order per cross rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over the classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from the perspective of achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that 64-dimensional cross rotation nearly approaches the upper bound, making it a recommended choice for practical implementations.

TI Real-time gigahertz free-space quantum key distribution within an
   emulated satellite overpass
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD) intermediated by a trusted satellite in a low-Earth orbit to ground stations along the satellite's path allows remote users to connect securely. To establish a secure connection, a SatQKD session must be conducted to each user over a dynamically changing free-space link, all within just a few hundred seconds. Because of the short time and large losses under which the QKD protocol will be implemented, it has not yet been possible to form a complete key by transmitting all the relevant information required within a single overpass of the satellite. Here, we demonstrate a real-time QKD system that is capable of forming a 4.58-megabit secure key between two nodes within an emulated satellite overpass. We anticipate that our system will set the stage for practical implementations of intercontinental quantum secure communications that can operate over large networks of nodes and enable the secure transmission of data globally.

TI Enhancing Post-Quantum Information Security: A Novel Two-Dimensional
   Chaotic System for Quantum Image Encryption
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Ensuring information security in the quantum era is a growing challenge due to advancements in cryptographic attacks and the emergence of quantum computing. To address these concerns, this paper presents the mathematical and computer modeling of a novel two-dimensional (2D) chaotic system for secure key generation in quantum image encryption (QIE). The proposed map employs trigonometric perturbations in conjunction with rational-saturation functions and hence, named as Trigonometric-Rational-Saturation (TRS) map. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and computational simulations, the map is extensively evaluated for bifurcation behaviour, chaotic trajectories, and Lyapunov exponents. The security evaluation validates the map's non-linearity, unpredictability, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In addition, the proposed TRS map has further been tested by integrating it in a QIE scheme. The QIE scheme first quantum-encodes the classic image using the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) technique, the TRS map is used for the generation of secure diffusion key, which is XOR-ed with the quantum-ready image to obtain the encrypted images. The security evaluation of the QIE scheme demonstrates superior security of the encrypted images in terms of statistical security attacks and also against Differential attacks. The encrypted images exhibit zero correlation and maximum entropy with demonstrating strong resilience due to 99.62% and 33.47% results for Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). The results validate the effectiveness of TRS-based quantum encryption scheme in securing digital images against emerging quantum threats, making it suitable for secure image encryption in IoT and edge-based applications.

TI Variational Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Process Tomography with
   Arbitrary Ancillary Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum process tomography is a pivotal technique in fully characterizing quantum dynamics. However, exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the increasing system size extremely restrains its experimental implementations. Here, we put forward a more efficient, flexible, and error-mitigated method: variational entanglement-assisted quantum process tomography with arbitrary ancillary qubits. Numerically, we simulate up to eight-qubit quantum processes and show that this tomography with m ancillary qubits (0 <= m <= n) alleviates the exponential costs on state preparation (from 4(n) to 2(n-m)), measurement settings (at least a 1 order of magnitude reduction), and data postprocessing (efficient and robust parameter optimization). Experimentally, we first demonstrate our method on a silicon photonic chip by rebuilding randomly generated one-qubit and two-qubit unitary quantum processes. Further using the error mitigation method, two-qubit quantum processes can be rebuilt with average gate fidelity enhanced from 92.38% to 95.56%. Our Letter provides an efficient and practical approach to process tomography on the noisy quantum computing platforms.

TI Experimental semi-autonomous eigensolver using reinforcement learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The characterization of observables, expressed via Hermitian operators, is a crucial task in quantum mechanics. For this reason, an eigensolver is a fundamental algorithm for any quantum technology. In this work, we implement a semi-autonomous algorithm to obtain an approximation of the eigenvectors of an arbitrary Hermitian operator using the IBM quantum computer. To this end, we only use single-shot measurements and pseudo-random changes handled by a feedback loop, reducing the number of measures in the system. Due to the classical feedback loop, this algorithm can be cast into the reinforcement learning paradigm. Using this algorithm, for a single-qubit observable, we obtain both eigenvectors with fidelities over 0.97 with around 200 single-shot measurements. For two-qubits observables, we get fidelities over 0.91 with around 1500 single-shot measurements for the four eigenvectors, which is a comparatively low resource demand, suitable for current devices. This work is useful to the development of quantum devices able to decide with partial information, which helps to implement future technologies in quantum artificial intelligence.

TI Superconductor qubits hamiltonian approximations effect on quantum state
   evolution and control
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Microwave IQ-mixer controllers are designed for the three approximated Hamiltonians of charge, phase and flux qubits and the controllers are exerted both on approximate and precise quantum system models. The controlled qubits are for the implementation of the two quantum-gates with these three fundamental types of qubits, Quantum NOT-gate and Hadamard-gate. In the charge-qubit, for implementation of both gates, in the approximated and precise model, we observed different controlled trajectories. But fortunately, applying the controller designed for the approximated system over the precise system leads to the passing of the quantum state from the desired state sooner that the expected time. Phase-qubit and flux qubit have similar behaviour under the control system action. In both of them, the implementation of NOT-gate operation led to same trajectories which arrive at final goal state at different times. But in both of those two qubits for implementation of Hadamard-gate, desired trajectory and precise trajectory have some angle of deviation, then by exerting the approximated design controller to precise system, it caused the quantum state to approach the goal state for Hadamard gate implementation, and since the quantum state does not completely reach the goal state, we can not obtain very high gate fidelity.

TI Learning classical readout quantum PUFs based on single-qubit gates
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have been proposed as a way to identify and authenticate electronic devices. Recently, several ideas have been presented to that aim to achieve the same for quantum devices. Some of these constructions apply single-qubit gates in order to provide a secure fingerprint of the quantum device. In this work, we formalize the class of classical readout quantum PUFs (CR-QPUFs) using the statistical query (SQ) model and explicitly show insufficient security for CR-QPUFs based on single-qubit rotation gates, when the adversary has SQ access to the CR-QPUF. We demonstrate how a malicious party can learn the CR-QPUF characteristics and forge the signature of a quantum device through a modelling attack using a simple regression of low-degree polynomials. The proposed modelling attack was successfully implemented in a real-world scenario on real IBM Q quantum machines. We thoroughly discuss the prospects and problems of CR-QPUFs where quantum device imperfections are used as a secure fingerprint.

TI Quantum Key Recovery Attacks On Prost-COPA and Prost-OTR Using Simon's
   Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Due to its innovative and performance advantages, Prost-COPA and Prost-OTR have attracted widespread attention. For the Prost-COPA without associated data and with associated data, the corresponding quantum key recovery attacks are proposed using Simon's algorithm, respectively. In the first scenario, the messages are used to calculate the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and construct a period function to recover the secret parameter L. Then, utilizing ciphertext, a periodic function is constructed with a periodic value equal to the key value. MAC is calculated from messages and the associated data in the second scenario. Considering the impact of the associated data on the periodicity of the function, the messages are treated as a constant and further construct two periodic functions to recover the secret parameter L and the key. For Prost-OTR, by constructing two periodic functions using two tags with different numbers of message blocks, the secret parameter L can be recovered, and then the key can be recovered using Simon's algorithm. Compared to the classical attacks, the quantum-based methods only require O(n) quantum queries (where 2n is the message block size), resulting in an exponential speed acceleration and the success probability of the method is close to 1. These methods also show a lower query complexity than the state-of-the-art quantum methods.

TI Quantum algorithm for Green's-function measurements in the Fermi-Hubbard
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm that uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.

TI Modeling noise in global Molmer-Sorensen interactions applied to quantum
   approximate optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many-qubit Molmer-Sorensen (MS) interactions applied to trapped ions offer unique capabilities for quantum information processing, with applications including quantum simulation and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Here, we develop a physical model to describe many-qubit MS interactions under four sources of experimental noise: vibrational mode frequency fluctuations, laser power fluctuations, thermal initial vibrational states, and state preparation and measurement errors. The model parametrizes these errors from simple experimental measurements, without free parameters. We validate the model in comparison with experiments that implement sequences of MS interactions on two 171Yb+ ions. The model shows reasonable agreement after several MS interactions as quantified by the reduced chi-squared statistic chi 2red approximate to 2. As an application we examine MaxCut QAOA experiments on three and six ions. The experimental performance is quantified by approximation ratios that are 91% and 83% of the optimal theoretical values. Our model predicts -0.03, respectively, with disagreement in the latter value attributable to secondary noise sources beyond those considered in our analysis. With realistic experimental improvements to reduce measurement error and radial trap frequency variations, the model achieves approximation ratios that are 99% of the optimal. Incorporating these improvements into future experiments is expected to reveal new aspects of noise for future modeling and experimental improvements.

TI Switching of topological phase and topological channel via asymmetric
   hopping modulations in a one-dimensional superconducting circuit lattice
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a theoretical scheme for a one-dimensional superconducting circuit lattice system to achieve that topological phase transition and topological multi-channel transfer, which is adjusted by the asymmetric hopping modulations. The system consists of an array of coupled superconducting microwave cavities, the hopping between its can be modulated by the qubits. Here, we explore topological stages by introducing parameters to expand the hopping modulation range. We found that the energy bands in the system exhibit different structural characteristics, which can achieve topological phase switching. Meanwhile, the edge modes can undergo a flipping process, which can not only realize dual-channel topological quantum information transfer, but also can achieve four-channel. Furthermore, it is noted that the defect can induce new topological phases, which can be optimized by adjusting the hopping parameters, while disorder can only cause band fluctuations and inversions, but does not change the position and period of edge states, verifying that the edge state transport is robust. The results obtained in this work can be applied to the storage and transmission of quantum information, and have a guiding role in the future development of quantum technology.

TI Sub-Gbps key rate four-state continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution within metropolitan area
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has potential advantages of high secret key rate, which is very suitable for high-speed metropolitan network application. However, the secret key rates of the reported CVQKD systems are only a few Mbps over typical transmission distance so far. Here, we address the fundamental experimental problems and demonstrate a single-carrier four-state CVQKD with sub-Gbps key rate within metropolitan area. In the demonstrated four-state CVQKD using local local oscillator, an ultra-low level of excess noise is obtained and a high efficient post-processing setup is designed for practically extracting the final secure keys. Thus, the achieved secret key rates are 190.54 Mbps, 137.76 Mbps and 52.48 Mbps using linear channel assuming security analysis method and 233.87 Mbps, 133.6 Mbps and 21.53 Mbps using semidefinite programming security analysis method over transmission distances of 5 km, 10 km and 25 km, respectively. This result increases the asymptotic secret key rate to sub-Gbps level, which is sufficient to achieve the one-time pad cryptographic task. Moreover, our work shows the road for future high-rate and large-scale CVQKD deployment in secure broadband metropolitan and access networks.
   With the continuous development of metropolitan broadband and network, the need of secure and faster transmission also increases. The authors demonstrate a single-carrier four-state continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) with sub-Gbps key rate within metropolitan area and secure transmissions up to 25 km

TI Training quantum neural networks using the quantum information
   bottleneck method
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We provide in this paper a concrete method for training a quantum neural network to maximize the relevant information about a property that is transmitted through the network. This is significant because it gives an operationally well founded quantity to optimize when training autoencoders for problems where the inputs and outputs are fully quantum. We provide a rigorous algorithm for computing the value of the quantum information bottleneck quantity within error epsilon that requires O(log(2)(1/epsilon) + 1/delta(2)) queries to a purification of the input density operator if its spectrum is supported on {0} boolean OR [delta, 1-delta] for delta > 0 and the kernels of the relevant density matrices are disjoint. We further provide algorithms for estimating the derivatives of the QIB function, showing that quantum neural networks can be trained efficiently using the QIB quantity given that the number of gradient steps required is polynomial.

TI Generalized Lindblad master equation for neutrino evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A new theoretical framework, based on the quantum field theory of open systems applied to neutrinos, has been developed. This framework aims to describe the neutrino evolution in external environment, taking into account the effect of neutrino quantum decoherence. We have applied this approach to investigate a novel mechanism for neutrino quantum decoherence, which arises due to the neutrino decay into a lighter neutrino state and a massless particle, as well as the inverse process of absorption of a massless particle by a neutrino. We derived the new generalized Lindblad master equation for the neutrino evolution that accounts for neutrino transitions between states with different momenta. We also demonstrate that studying of neutrino quantum decoherence through this master equation provides a unique possibility to determine or limit the neutrino decay width. On this basis we obtained the constraint degenerate hierarchy).

TI Quantum Adversarial Transfer Learning
SO ENTROPY
AB Adversarial transfer learning is a machine learning method that employs an adversarial training process to learn the datasets of different domains. Recently, this method has attracted attention because it can efficiently decouple the requirements of tasks from insufficient target data. In this study, we introduce the notion of quantum adversarial transfer learning, where data are completely encoded by quantum states. A measurement-based judgment of the data label and a quantum subroutine to compute the gradients are discussed in detail. We also prove that our proposal has an exponential advantage over its classical counterparts in terms of computing resources such as the gate number of the circuits and the size of the storage required for the generated data. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that our model can be successfully trained, achieving high accuracy on certain datasets.

TI Simulating dimensionally reduced 4D Yang-Mills theory on a quantum

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We compute the low-lying spectrum of 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills in a finite volume using quantum simulations. In contrast to small-volume lattice truncations of the Hilbert space, we employ toroidal dimensional reduction to the "femtouniverse" matrix quantum mechanics model. In this limit the theory is equivalent to the quantum mechanics of three interacting particles moving inside a 3-ball with certain boundary conditions. We use the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum subspace expansion techniques to compute the string tension to glueball mass ratio near the small/large-volume transition point, finding qualitatively good agreement with large volume Euclidean lattice simulations.

TI Ultra-low loss visible light waveguides for integrated atomic,
   molecular, and quantum photonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) visible light systems are the heart of precision applications including quantum, atomic clocks and precision metrology. As these systems scale in terms of number of lasers, wavelengths, and optical components, their reliability, space occupied, and power consumption will push the limits of using traditional laboratory-scale lasers and optics. Visible light photonic integration is critical to advancing AMO based sciences and applications, yet key performance aspects remain to be addressed, most notably waveguide losses and laser phase noise and stability. Additionally, a visible light integrated solution needs to be wafer-scale CMOS compatible and capable of supporting a wide array of photonic components. While the regime of ultra-low loss has been achieved at telecommunication wavelengths, progress at visible wavelengths has been limited. Here, we report the lowest waveguide losses and highest resonator Qs to date in the visible range, to the best of our knowledge. We report waveguide losses at wavelengths associated with strontium transitions in the 461 nm to 802 nm wavelength range, of 0.01 dB/cm to 0.09 dB/cm and associated intrinsic resonator Q of 60 Million to 9.5 Million, a decrease in loss by factors of 6x to 2x and increase in Q by factors of 10x to 1.5x over this visible wavelength range. Additionally, we measure an absorption limited loss and Q of 0.17 dB/m and 340 million at 674 nm. This level of performance is achieved in a wafer-scale foundry compatible Si3N4 platform with a 20nm thick core and TEOS-PECVD deposited upper cladding oxide, and enables waveguides for different wavelengths to be fabricated on the same wafer with mask-only changes per wavelength. These results represent a significant step forward in waveguide platforms that operate in the visible, opening up a wide range of integrated applications that utilize atoms, ions and molecules including sensing, navigation, metrology and clocks.

TI True decoherence-free-subspace derived from a semiconductor double
   quantum dot Heisenberg spin-trimer
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spins in solid systems can inherently serve as qubits for quantum simulation or quantum information processing. Spin qubits are usually prone to environmental magnetic field fluctuations; however, a spin qubit encoded in a decoherence-free-subspace (DFS) can be protected from certain degrees of environmental noise depending on the specific structure of the DFS. Here, we derive the "true" DFS from an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 trimer, which protects the qubit states against both short- and long-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations. We define the spin trimer with three electrons confined in a gate-defined GaAs double quantum dot (DQD) where we exploit Wigner-molecularization in one of the quantum dots. We first utilize the trimer for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which generates a sizable magnetic field difference, Delta Bz, within the DQD. We show that large Delta Bz significantly alters the eigenspectrum of the trimer and results in the "true" DFS in the DQD. Real-time Bayesian estimation of the DFS energy gap explicitly demonstrates protection of the DFS against short-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations in addition to long-wavelength ones. Our findings pave the way toward compact DFS structures for exchange-coupled quantum dot spin chains, the internal structure of which can be coherently controlled completely decoupled from environmental magnetic fields.

TI Topology-Optimized on-Chip Quantum Plasmonic Generator
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Scalable integrated single-photon sources are critical for quantum photonics and can enable applications such as high-speed quantum communication and quantum information processing. To establish a scalable platform, the single-photon sources require large on-chip photon extraction rates, which means the emission rates need to be substantially enhanced and the excited photons should be directly coupled to an on-chip circuit. The photon emission rate speed-up is best achieved via coupling to plasmonic nanostructures, while on-chip extraction can be realized by directly coupling emitters to dielectric nanofibers. However, current approaches to enhance emission speed in nanostructures have inadequately tackled the choice of metals and dielectrics. Additionally, they solely concentrate on individual aspects (spontaneous emission rate or coupling efficiency), thereby neglecting comprehensive performance. Here, drawing inspiration from additive manufacturing, a layer-by-layer topology optimization framework is proposed for an on-chip quantum plasmonic generator that can comprehensively enhance the photon extraction rate of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. As a result, a topology-optimized three-layered hybrid structure is obtained that comprehensively enhances the spontaneous emission rate of the NV center and coupling efficiency into a dielectric nanofiber (F(p)x eta approximate to 30. The work introduces an innovative approach to material selection and structural design for improving the performance of single-photon sources.

TI Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution with multi-ring discrete modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with multi-ring discrete modulation (MR-CV-MDI-QKD) protocol. In our scheme, coherent states are allocated across distinct rings (amplitudes) in the phase space, and each ring is subjected to traditional M-symbol phase shift keying (MPSK) modulation. The analysis and simulation are given to demonstrate the security of our scheme under collective attacks. The results show that, compared with the traditional discrete modulated (DM)-CV-MDI-QKD where only the MPSK is used for modulation with a fixed amplitude, MR-CV-MDI-QKD can decrease the upper bound of the information accessible to an eavesdropper, thereby facilitating an extended transmission distance and increasing the secret key rate, furthermore, it exhibits a higher tolerance to diminished reverse reconciliation efficiency. This work provides an effective way for the practical implementation of the CV-MDI-QKD protocol. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Finite-Key Analysis of 1-Decoy Method Quantum Key Distribution with
   Intensity Fluctuation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The decoy state quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is proven to be an effective strategy against the photon number splitting attack. It was shown that the 1-decoy state protocol, easier to implement in the practical QKD system, outperforms the 2-decoy state protocol for block sizes of up to 10(8) bits. How intensity fluctuations influence the performance of the 1-decoy state protocol with finite resources remains a pending issue. In this paper, we present a finite-key analysis of the 1-decoy state protocol with intensity fluctuations and obtain the secret key rate formula about intensity fluctuations. Our numerical simulation results show that the stronger the intensity fluctuations, the lower the secret key rate for a small data block size of a few bits. Our research can provide theoretical implications for the selection of data size in the QKD system with intensity fluctuations.

TI Experimental demonstration of underwater decoy-state quantum key
   distribution with all-optical transmission
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate the underwater quantum key distribution (UWQKD) over a 10.4-meter Jerlov type III seawater channel by building a complete UWQKD system with all-optical transmission of quantum signals, a synchronization signal and a classical communication signal. The wavelength division multiplexing and the space-time-wavelength filtering technology are applied to ensure that the optical signals do not interfere with each other. The system is controlled by FPGA and can be easily integrated into watertight cabins to perform the field experiment. By using the decoy-state BB84 protocol with polarization encoding, we obtain a bit rate of secure keys of 1.82 Kbps and an error rate of 1.55% at the attenuation of 13.26 dB. We prove that the system can tolerate the channel loss up to 23.7 dB and therefore may be used in the 300-meter-long Jerlov type I clean seawater channel.

TI Quantum enhanced stratification of breast cancer: exploring quantum
   expressivity for real omics data
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is considered one of the most promising applications of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era for the impact it is thought to have in the near future. Although promising theoretical assumptions, the exploration of how QML could foster new discoveries in medicine and biology fields is still in its infancy with few examples. In this study, we aim to assess whether quantum kernels (QK) could effectively classify subtypes of breast cancer (BC) patients based on molecular characteristics. We performed a heuristic exploration of encoding configurations with different entanglement levels to determine a trade-off between kernel expressivity and performances. Our results show that QKs yield comparable clustering results with classical methods while using fewer data points and are able to fit the data with a higher number of clusters. Additionally, we conducted the experiments on the quantum processing unit (QPU) to evaluate the effect of noise on the outcome. We found that less expressive encodings showed a higher resilience to noise, indicating that the computational pipeline can be reliably implemented on NISQ devices. Our findings suggest that QK methods show promises for application in precision oncology, especially in scenarios where the dataset is limited in size and a granular non-trivial stratification of complex molecular data cannot be achieved classically.

TI Dynamics of quantum information resources in two-flavor neutrino
   oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The burgeoning intersection of particle physics and quantum information science unveils significant connections, particularly in the context of neutrinos-fundamental particles that challenge our understanding of mass, mixing, and coherence at the quantum level. This work investigates the quantum informational aspects of two-flavor neutrino oscillations, treating neutrino flavor change as a dynamic carrier of quantum resources in addition to a fundamental lepton physics phenomenon. Employing realistic experimental parameters from the Daya Bay, KamLAND, and MINOS experiments, we systematically evaluate four key quantum metrics: quantum coherence, entanglement, local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), and Bell non-locality. Our formalism utilizes time-dependent density matrices, incorporating environmental interactions modeled by a correlated dephasing channel to capture both Markovian (memoryless) and non-Markovian (memory-retaining) regimes. In the Markovian regime, coherence and LQFI exhibit exponential decay, with MINOS demonstrating the highest persistence of quantum features attributed to its long baseline (735 km) and high energy range (0.5-50 GeV). KamLAND, with a medium baseline and moderate energy, shows intermediate behavior, while Daya Bay's short baseline limits the survival of these quantum properties. Notably, Bell non-locality violation in the Markovian regime is exclusive to MINOS under high classical correlation strength, whereas Daya Bay and KamLAND remain within classical bounds. Across both regimes, particularly the non-Markovian where information backflow enhances coherence and entanglement, MINOS consistently emerges as the most robust setup for the preservation of quantum information.

TI A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Solution for Deep Anomaly Detection
SO ENTROPY
AB Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications. In recent ML research, deep anomaly detection (AD) has been a hot topic with the aim of discriminating among anomalous data with deep neural networks (DNNs). Notably, image AD is one of the most representative tasks in current deep AD research. ML's interaction with quantum computing is giving rise to a heated topic named quantum machine learning (QML), which enjoys great prospects according to recent academic research. This paper attempts to address the image AD problem in a deep manner with a novel QML solution. Specifically, we design a quantum-classical hybrid DNN (QHDNN) that aims to learn directly from normal raw images to train a normality model and then exclude images that do not conform to this model as anomalies during its inference. To enable the QHDNN to perform satisfactorily in deep image AD, we explore multiple quantum layer architectures and design a VQC-based QHDNN solution. Extensive experiments were conducted on commonly used benchmarks to test the proposed QML solution, whose results demonstrate the feasibility of addressing deep image AD with QML. Importantly, the experimental results show that our quantum-classical hybrid solution can even yield superior performance to that of its classical counterpart when they share the same number of learnable parameters.

TI Security and Performance Analyses of Post-Quantum Digital Signature
   Algorithms and Their TLS and PKI Integrations
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Quantum computing challenges the mathematical problems anchoring the security of the classical public key algorithms. For quantum-resistant public key algorithms, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has undergone a multi-year standardization process and selected the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) public key digital signatures of Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+. Finding common ground to compare these algorithms can be difficult because of their design differences, including the fundamental math problems (lattice-based vs. hash-based). We use a visualization model to show the key/signature size vs. security trade-offs for all PQC algorithms. Our performance analyses compare the algorithms' computational loads in the execution time. Building on the individual algorithms' analyses, we analyze the communication costs and implementation overheads when integrated with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP). Our results show that the lattice-based algorithms of Dilithium and Falcon induce lower computational overheads than the hash-based algorithms of SPHINCS+. In addition, the lattice-based PQC can outperform the classical algorithm with comparable security strength; for example, Dilithium 2 and Falcon 512 outperform RSA 4096 in the TLS handshake time duration.

TI Implementation and analysis of quantum computing application to Higgs
   boson reconstruction at the large Hadron Collider
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the advent of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era, high energy physics (HEP) event selection will require new approaches to rapidly and accurately analyze vast databases. The current study addresses the enormity of HEP databases in an unprecedented manner-a quantum search using Grover's Algorithm (GA) on an unsorted database, ATLAS Open Data, from the ATLAS detector. A novel method to identify rare events at 13 TeV in CERN's LHC using quantum computing (QC) is presented. As indicated by the Higgs boson decay channel H -> ZZ* -> 4l, the detection of four leptons in one event may be used to reconstruct the Higgs boson and, more importantly, evince Higgs boson decay to some new phenomena, such as H -> ZZ(d) -> 4l. Searching the dataset for collisions resulting in detection of four leptons using a Jupyter Notebook, a classical simulation of GA, and several quantum computers with multiple qubits, the current application was found to make the proper selection in the unsorted dataset. Quantum search efficacy was analyzed for the incoming HL-LHC by implementing the QC method on multiple classical simulators and IBM's quantum computers with the IBM Qiskit Open Source Software. The current QC application provides a novel, high-efficiency alternative to classical database searches, demonstrating its potential utility as a rapid and increasingly accurate search method in HEP.

TI Entangling gates on degenerate spin qubits dressed by a global field
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor spin qubits represent a promising platform for future large-scale quantum computers owing to their excellent qubit performance, as well as the ability to leverage the mature semiconductor manufacturing industry for scaling up. Individual qubit control, however, commonly relies on spectral selectivity, where individual microwave signals of distinct frequencies are used to address each qubit. As quantum processors scale up, this approach will suffer from frequency crowding, control signal interference and unfeasible bandwidth requirements. Here, we propose a strategy based on arrays of degenerate spins coherently dressed by a global control field and individually addressed by local electrodes. We demonstrate simultaneous on-resonance driving of two degenerate qubits using a global field while retaining addressability for qubits with equal Larmor frequencies. Furthermore, we implement SWAP oscillations during on-resonance driving, constituting the demonstration of driven two-qubit gates. Significantly, our findings highlight how dressing can overcome the fragility of entangling gates between superposition states and increase their noise robustness. These results constitute a paradigm shift in qubit control in order to overcome frequency crowding in large-scale quantum computing.

TI Relationship between costs for quantum error mitigation and
   non-Markovian measures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has been proposed as an alternative method of quantum error correction to compensate errors in quantum systems without qubit overhead. While Markovian gate errors on digital quantum computers have been mainly considered previously, it is indispensable to discuss a relationship between QEM and non-Markovian errors because non-Markovian noise effects inevitably exist in most of the solid-state systems. In this work, we investigate the QEM for non-Markovian noise, and show that there is a clear relationship between costs for QEM and non-Markovian measures. As examples, we show several non-Markovian noise models to bridge a gap between our theoretical framework and concrete physical systems. This discovery may help in designing better QEM strategies for realistic quantum devices with non-Markovian environments.

TI Quantum Krylov subspace algorithms for ground- and excited-state energy
   estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) algorithms provide a low-cost alternative to the conventional quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the ground- and excited-state energies of a quantum many-body system. While QKSD algorithms typically rely on using the Hadamard test for estimating Krylov subspace matrix elements of the form (phi(i)|e(-i (H) over cap tau)|phi(j)), the associated quantum circuits require an ancilla qubit with controlled multiqubit gates that can be quite costly for near-term quantum hardware. In this paper, we show that a wide class of Hamiltonians relevant to condensed-matter physics and quantum chemistry contain symmetries that can be exploited to avoid the use of the Hadamard test. We propose a multifidelity estimation protocol that can be used to compute such quantities, showing that our approach, when combined with efficient single-fidelity estimation protocols, provides a substantial reduction in circuit depth. In addition, we develop a unified theory of quantum Krylov subspace algorithms and present three quantum-classical algorithms for the ground- and excited-state energy estimation problems, where each algorithm provides various advantages and disadvantages in terms of total number of calls to the quantum computer, gate depth, classical complexity, and stability of the generalized eigenvalue problem within the Krylov subspace.

TI Disparities in access to US quantum information education
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB Driven in large part by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, quantum information science (QIS) coursework and degree programs are rapidly spreading across U.S. institutions. Yet prior work suggests that access to quantum workforce education is unequally distributed, disproportionately benefiting students at private research-focused institutions whose student bodies are unrepresentative of U.S. higher education as a whole. We use regression analysis to analyze the distribution of QIS coursework across 456 institutions of higher learning as of Fall 2022, identifying statistically significant disparities across institutions in particular along the axes of institution classification, funding, and geographic distribution suggesting today 's QIS education programs are largely failing to reach low-income and rural students. We also conduct a brief analysis of the distribution of emerging dedicated QIS degree programs, discovering much the same trends. We conclude with a discussion of implications for educators, policymakers, and education researchers including specific policy recommendations to direct investments in QIS education to schools serving low-income and rural students, leverage existing grassroots diversity and inclusion initiatives that have arisen within the quantum community, and update and modernize procedures for collecting QIS educational data to better track these trends.

TI Interacting random-field dipole defect model for heating in
   semiconductor-based qubit devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Semiconductor qubit devices suffer from the drift of important device parameters as they are operated. The most important example is a shift in qubit operating frequencies. This effect appears to be directly related to the heating of the system as gate operations are applied. We show that the main features of this phenomenon can be explained by the two-level systems that can also produce charge noise if these systems are considered to form an interacting random-field glass. The most striking feature of the theory is that the frequency shift can be nonmonotonic in temperature. The success of the theory and the questions it raises considerably narrow the possible models for the two-level systems.

TI Quantum coherence bounds the distributed discords
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Establishing quantum correlations between two remote parties by sending an information carrier is an essential step of many protocols in quantum information processing. We obtain trade-off relations between discords and coherence within a bipartite system. Then we study the distribution of coherence in a bipartite quantum state by using the relations of relative entropy and mutual information. We show that the increase of the relative entropy of discord between two remote parties is bounded by the nonclassical correlations quantified by the relative entropy of coherence between the carrier and two remote parties, providing an optimal protocol for discord distribution and showing that quantum correlations are the essential resource for such tasks.

TI Quantum Radon Transforms and Their Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article extends the Radon transform, a classical image-processing tool for fast tomography and denoising, to the quantum computing platform. A new kind of periodic discrete Radon transform (PDRT), called the quantum periodic discrete Radon transform (QPRT), is proposed. The quantum implementation of QPRT based on the amplitude encoding method is exponentially faster than the classical PDRT. We design an efficient quantum image denoising algorithm using QPRT. The simulation results show that QPRT preserves good denoising capability as in the classical PDRT. Also, a quantum algorithm for IDRT is proposed, which can be used for fast line detection. Both the quantum extension of IDRT and the line detection algorithm can provide polynomial speedups over the classical counterparts in certain cases.

TI Spin property improvement of boron vacancy defect in hexagonal boron
   nitride by thermal treatment
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Negatively charged boron vacancy (V (B) (-)) in hexagonal boron nitride has attracted attention as a promising spin defect for quantum sensing applications. Hence, a fabrication method for generation of V (B) (-) with superior spin properties would be desirable. In this study, we demonstrated V (B) (-) formation by two thermal treatment methods. Both methods improve the signal-to-noise ratio of optically detected magnetic resonance signal by a factor of 4. Furthermore, a zero-field splitting parameter E which reflects crystal distortion after irradiation significantly reduces for irradiation above 650 degrees C. These findings indicate that thermal treatment is an effective method for a V (B) (-) based quantum sensor.

TI Digital quantum simulation of Floquet symmetry-protected topological
   phases
SO NATURE
AB Quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium host a rich variety of exotic phenomena that are forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. A prominent example is that of discrete time crystals(1-8), in which time-translational symmetry is spontaneously broken in periodically driven systems. Pioneering experiments have observed signatures of time crystalline phases with trapped ions(9,10), solid-state spin systems(11-15), ultracold atoms(16,17) and superconducting qubits(18-20). Here we report the observation of a distinct type of non-equilibrium state of matter, Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases, which are implemented through digital quantum simulation with an array of programmable superconducting qubits. We observe robust long-lived temporal correlations and subharmonic temporal response for the edge spins over up to 40 driving cycles using a circuit of depth exceeding 240 and acting on 26 qubits. We demonstrate that the subharmonic response is independent of the initial state, and experimentally map out a phase boundary between the Floquet symmetry-protected topological and thermal phases. Our results establish a versatile digital simulation approach to exploring exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors(21).

AB We propose a modification to the transpiler of a quantum computer to safeguard against side-channel attacks aimed at learning information about a quantum circuit. We demonstrate that if it is feasible to shield a specific subset of gates from side-channel attacks, then it is possible to conceal all information in a quantum circuit by transpiling it into a new circuit whose depth grows linearly, depending on the quantum computer's architecture. We provide concrete examples of implementing this protection on IBM's quantum computers, utilizing their virtual gates and editing their transpiler.

TI A Quantum States Preparation Method Based on Difference-Driven
   Reinforcement Learning
SO SPIN
AB Due to the large state space of the two-qubit system, and the adoption of ladder reward function in the existing quantum state preparation methods, the convergence speed is slow and it is difficult to prepare the desired target quantum state with high fidelity under limited conditions. To solve the above problems, a difference-driven reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for quantum state preparation of two-qubit system is proposed by improving the reward function and action selection strategy. Firstly, a model is constructed for the problem of preparing quantum states of a two-qubit system, with restrictions on the type of quantum gates and the time for quantum state evolution. In the preparation process, a weighted differential dynamic reward function is designed to assist the algorithm quickly obtain the maximum expected cumulative reward. Then, an adaptive e-greedy action selection strategy is adopted to achieve a balance between exploration and utilization to a certain extent, thereby improving the fidelity of the final quantum state. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can prepare quantum state with high fidelity under limited conditions. Compared with other algorithms, it has different degrees of improvement in convergence speed and fidelity of the final quantum state.

TI Not All Entangled States are Useful for Ancilla-Assisted Quantum Process
   Tomography
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB It is well known that one can extract all the information of an unknown quantum channel by means of quantum process tomography, such as standard quantum-process tomography and ancilla-assisted quantum process tomography (AAQPT). Furthermore, it is shown that entanglement is not necessary for AAQPT; there exist separable states that are also useful for it. Surprisingly, in this work we find that not all entangled states are useful for AAQPT; there also exist some entangled states that are useless. The realignment operation used in entanglement detection can be related to the question whether a bipartite state is useful for AAQPT. The relationship between them is derived and the process of extracting the complete information of an unknown channel by the realignment operation shown. Based on this relationship, examples of a two-qutrit entangled state and a two-qutrit bound entangled state are presented. Both of these two examples are entangled but they cannot be used for AAQPT. Last but not the least, experimental verification is been performed on the IBM platform.

TI A quantum "black box" for entropy calculation
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB A significant part of global quantum computing research has been conducted based on quantum mechanics, which can now be used with quantum computers. However, designing a quantum algorithm requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and physics procedures. This work presents a generic quantum "black box" for entropy calculation. It does not depend on the data type and can be applied to building and maintaining machine learning models. The method has two main advantages. First, it is accessible to those without preliminary knowledge of quantum computing. Second, it is based on the quantum circuit with a constant depth of three, which is equivalent to three operations the circuit would perform to achieve the same result. We implemented our method using the IBM simulator and tested it over different types of input. The results showed a high correspondence between the classical and quantum computations that raised an error of up to 8.8e-16 for different lengths and types of information.

TI Polarization-independent enhancement of optical absorption in a GaAs
   quantum well embedded in an air-bridge bull's-eye cavity with metal
   electrodes
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Electron spins in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) formed in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) are promising stationary qubits for implementing large-scale quantum networks in a scalable manner. One key ingredient for such a network is an efficient photon-spin interface that converts any polarization state of a flying photonic qubit to the corresponding spins state of the electron in gate-defined QDs. A bull's-eye cavity is an optical cavity structure that can enhance the photon absorption of an embedded gate-defined QD without polarization dependence. In this paper, we report the successful fabrication of air-bridge bull's-eye cavities with metal electrodes and demonstrate the nearly polarization-independent optical absorption of a GaAs QW embedded in the cavities. This work marks an important step toward realizing an efficient photon-spin interface using gate-defined QDs.

AB Operating on the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithms hold the promise for solving problems that are beyond the reach of the best-available classical algorithms. An integral part of realizing such speedup is the implementation of quantum queries, which read data into forms that quantum computers can process. Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a promising architecture for realizing quantum queries. However, implementing QRAM in practice poses significant challenges, including query latency, memory capacity and fault-tolerance.
   In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end system architecture for QRAM. First, we introduce a novel QRAM that hybridizes two existing implementations and achieves asymptotically superior scaling in space (qubit number) and time (circuit depth). Like in classical virtual memory, our construction enables queries to a virtual address space larger than what is actually available in hardware. Second, we present a compilation framework to synthesize, map, and schedule QRAM circuits on realistic hardware. For the first time, we demonstrate how to embed large-scale QRAM on a 2D Euclidean space, such as a 2D square grid layout, with minimal routing overhead. Third, we show how to leverage the intrinsic biased-noise resilience of the proposed QRAM for implementation on either Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) or Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) hardware. Finally, we validate these results numerically via both classical simulation and quantum hardware experimentation. Our novel Feynman-path-based simulator allows for efficient simulation of noisy QRAM circuits at a larger scale than previously possible. Collectively, our results outline the set of software and hardware controls needed to implement practical QRAM.

TI Extended spin relaxation times of optically addressed vanadium defects
   in silicon carbide at telecommunication frequencies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optically interfaced solid-state defects are promising candidates for quantum communication technologies. The ideal defect system would feature bright telecom emission, long-lived spin states, and a scalable material platform, simultaneously. Here we use one such system, vanadium (V4+) in silicon carbide, to establish a potential telecom spin-photon interface within a mature semiconductor host. This demonstration of efficient optical spin polarization and readout facilitates all-optical measurements of temperature-dependent spin relaxation times (T1). By using this technique, and lowering the temperature from approximately 2 K to approximately 100 mK, we observe a remarkable 4-orders-of-magnitude increase in spin T1 across all measured sites, with site-specific values ranging from 57.1 ms to 27.9 s. Furthermore, we identify the underlying relaxation mechanisms, which involve a two-phonon Orbach process, indicating the opportunity for strain tuning to enable qubit operation at higher temperatures. These results position V4+ in SiC as a prime candidate for scalable quantum nodes in future quantum networks.

TI Dissipative stabilization of entangled qubit pairs in quantum arrays
   with a single localized dissipative channel
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the dissipative stabilization of entangled states in arrays of quantum systems. Specifically, we are interested in the states of qubits (spin-1/2) which may or may not interact with one or more cavities (bosonic modes). In all cases only one element, either a cavity or a qubit, is lossy and irreversibly coupled to a reservoir. When the lossy element is a cavity, we consider a squeezed reservoir and only interactions which conserve the number of cavity excitations. Instead, when the lossy element is a qubit, pure decay and a properly selected structure of XY-interactions are taken into account. We show that in all cases, in the steady state, many pairs of distant, non-directly interacting qubits, which cover the whole array, can get entangled in a stationary way, by means of the interplay of dissipation and local interactions.

TI Compact and Fully Integrated LED Quantum Sensor Based on NV Centers in
   Diamond
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum magnetometry based on optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond nano or microcrystals is a promising technology for sensitive, integrated magnetic-field sensors. Currently, this technology is still cost-intensive and mainly found in research. Here we propose one of the smallest fully integrated quantum sensors to date based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond microcrystals. It is an extremely cost-effective device that integrates a pump light source, photodiode, microwave antenna, filtering and fluorescence detection. Thus, the sensor offers an all-electric interface without the need to adjust or connect optical components. A sensitivity of 28.32nT/Hz and a theoretical shot noise limited sensitivity of 2.87 nT/Hz is reached. Since only generally available parts were used, the sensor can be easily produced in a small series. The form factor of (6.9 x 3.9 x 15.9) mm3 combined with the integration level is the smallest fully integrated NV-based sensor proposed so far. With a power consumption of around 0.1W, this sensor becomes interesting for a wide range of stationary and handheld systems. This development paves the way for the wide usage of quantum magnetometers in non-laboratory environments and technical applications.

TI Data-centric machine learning in quantum information science
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a series of data-centric heuristics for improving the performance of machine learning systems when applied to problems in quantum information science. In particular, we consider how systematic engineering of training sets can significantly enhance the accuracy of pre-trained neural networks used for quantum state reconstruction without altering the underlying architecture. We find that it is not always optimal to engineer training sets to exactly match the expected distribution of a target scenario, and instead, performance can be further improved by biasing the training set to be slightly more mixed than the target. This is due to the heterogeneity in the number of free variables required to describe states of different purity, and as a result, overall accuracy of the network improves when training sets of a fixed size focus on states with the least constrained free variables. For further clarity, we also include a 'toy model' demonstration of how spurious correlations can inadvertently enter synthetic data sets used for training, how the performance of systems trained with these correlations can degrade dramatically, and how the inclusion of even relatively few counterexamples can effectively remedy such problems.

TI Erbium-doped yttrium oxide thin films grown by chemical vapor deposition
   for quantum technologies
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth-doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y2O3) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y2O3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.

TI Practical high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol over
   deployed multicore fiber
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure communication scheme for sharing symmetric cryptographic keys based on the laws of quantum physics, and is considered a key player in the realm of cyber-security. A critical challenge for QKD systems comes from the fact that the ever-increasing rates at which digital data are transmitted require more and more performing sources of quantum keys, primarily in terms of secret key generation rate. High-dimensional QKD based on path encoding has been proposed as a candidate approach to address this challenge. However, while proof-of-principle demonstrations based on lab experiments have been reported in the literature, demonstrations in realistic environments are still missing. Here we report the generation of secret keys in a 4-dimensional hybrid time-path-encoded QKD system over a 52-km deployed multicore fiber link forming by looping back two cores of a 26-km 4-core optical fiber. Our results indicate that robust high-dimensional QKD can be implemented in a realistic environment by combining standard telecom equipment with emerging multicore fiber technology.
   High-dimensional QKD would in principle allow for several advantages over its bidimensional counterpart, but in-the-field demonstrations are missing. Here, the authors realise 4- dimensional hybrid time-path-encoded QKD using a 52-km deployed multicore fiber link.

AB Quantum photonic circuits with integrated on-demand quantum emitters can act as building blocks for photonic gates and processors with enhanced quantum functionality. To scale up such quantum devices to larger and more powerful systems, eventually reaching the quantum advantage, the scalable integration of many emitters with identical emission wavelengths is of utmost importance. Here, we report on the deterministic integration of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) in waveguide structures by means of in situ electron beam lithography (EBL). Applying external bias voltages to the p-i-n-doped and electrically contacted quantum circuits allows for spectral fine-tuning of the QDs via the quantum confined Stark effect. We achieve a tuning range of (0.40 +/- 0.16) nm, which together with a spectral pre-selection accuracy of (0.2 +/- 1.6) nm in the in situ EBL process is on average large enough to tune individual QDs into resonance. Thus, deterministic QD integration with spectral pre-selection in conjunction with Stark tuning of the QD emission wavelength is an attractive combination that has high potential to enable the scalable fabrication of integrated quantum photonic circuits in the future.

TI Enhanced entangled photon-pair generation rate with dual quasi-bound
   states in the continuum metasurfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a fundamental quantum optical technique for generating entangled photon pairs, which serves as the foundation for various quantum applications, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, quantum metrology, and the exploration of fundamental physical laws in quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, SPDC is plagued by low efficiency due to the extremely weak nature of this spontaneous quantum nonlinear process. In this work, we design a simple dielectric metasurface structure composed of lithium niobate (LN) defect disks that can support dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in the near-infrared range. By aligning the high-Q quasi-BIC resonances with the generated signal and idler frequencies, our numerical simulation results demonstrate that the local electric field in the nonlinear medium reaches a substantial enhancement of up to two orders of magnitude, resulting in a significant improvement in the efficiency of the classical nonlinear optical sum frequency generation (SFG) and its inverse SPDC quantum process. Our findings pave the way for the development of high-quality compact nanosources of entangled photon pairs with potential applications spanning across cutting-edge fields such as quantum communications, computing, and imaging that can potentially revolutionize the field of quantum technology.

TI Probabilistic nonunitary gate in imaginary time evolution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Simulation of quantum materials is a significant application of quantum computers. In contrast with the unitary operation which can be realized naturally on a quantum computer, the implementation of nonunitary operation, widely used in classical approaches, needs special designing. Here, by application of Grover's algorithm, we extend the probabilistic method of implementing nonunitary operation and show that it can promote success probability without fidelity decreasing. This method can be applied to problems of imaginary time evolution and contraction of tensor networks on a quantum computer.

TI Space-based quantum networking in the presence of a nuclear disturbed
   environment
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB Space-based quantum networks provide a means for near-term long-distance transmission of quantum information. This article analyzed the performance of a downlink quantum network between a low-Earth-orbit satellite and an observatory operating in less-than-ideal atmospheric conditions. The effects from fog, haze, and a nuclear disturbed environment on the long-range distribution of quantum states were investigated. A density matrix that estimates the quantum state by capturing the effects from increased signal loss and elevated background noise to estimate the state fidelity of the transmitted quantum state was developed. It was found that the nuclear disturbed environment and other atmospheric effects have a degrading effect on the quantum state. These environments impede the ability to perform quantum communications for the duration of the effects. In the case of the nuclear disturbed environment, the nuclear effects subside quickly, and network performance should return to normal by the next satellite pass. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Intra-QLAN Connectivity via Graph States: Beyond the Physical Topology
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In the near to mid future, Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) - the fundamental building block of the Quantum Internet - will unlike exhibit physical topologies characterized by densely physical connections among the nodes. On the contrary, it is pragmatic to consider QLANs based on simpler, scarcely-connected physical topologies, such as star topologies. This constraint, if not properly tackled, will significantly impact the QLAN performance in terms of communication delay and/or overhead. Thankfully, it is possible to create on-demand links between QLAN nodes, without physically deploying them, by properly manipulating a shared multipartite entangled state, namely, a graph state. Thus, it is possible to build an overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one, by only performing Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). In this paper, we address the fundamental issue of engineering the artificial topology of a QLAN to bypass the limitations induced by the physical topology. The designed framework relays only on local operations, without exchanging signaling among the client nodes of the QLAN, which, in turn, would introduce further delays in a scenario very sensitive to the decoherence. Finally, by exploiting the artificial topology, it is proved that the troubleshooting is simplified, by overcoming the single point of failure, typical of classical LAN star topologies.

TI Photon-Noise-Tolerant Dispersive Readout of a Superconducting Qubit
   Using a Nonlinear Purcell Filter
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Residual noise photons in a readout resonator become a major source of dephasing for a superconducting qubit when the resonator is optimized for a fast, high-fidelity dispersive readout. Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonlinear Purcell filter that suppresses such an undesirable dephasing process without sacrificing the readout performance. When a readout pulse is applied, the filter automatically reduces the effective linewidth of the readout resonator, increasing the sensitivity of the qubit to the input field. The noise tolerance of the device we have fabricated is shown to be enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to a device with a linear filter. The measurement rate is enhanced by another factor of 3 by utilizing the bifurcation of the nonlinear filter. A readout fidelity of 99.4% and a quantum nondemolition fidelity of 99.2% are achieved using a 40-ns readout pulse. The nonlinear Purcell filter will be an effective tool for realizing a fast, high-fidelity readout without compromising the coherence time of the qubit.

TI Recent progress on photon-integrated quantum key distribution and
   quantum random number generator
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and can theoretically achieve unconditionally secure communication that is provable by information theory. Quantum random number generators, on the other hand, utilize the inherent randomness of quantum phenomena and are capable of generating a truly random entropy source that is unpredictable, unbiased and unrepeatable. These two technologies are crucial for building highly trustworthy and secure communication systems resistant to quantum attacks. However, their large-scale deployment still faces challenges such as system performance optimization, cost control and scale production.

It significantly improves the miniaturization, operational stability and cost-effectiveness of the system, and enhances the intrinsic security, and becomes a key enabling platform to drive QKD and QRNG from laboratory to engineering applications.
   In this paper, we systematically review the recent breakthroughs of photonic integrated QKD based on different material platforms (SOI/InP/TFLN/Si3N4) in terms of core metrics, such as transmission distance and key rate, as well as the significant breakthroughs of integrated QRNG in terms of random number generation rate and system integration. Finally, the future development direction of this field is discussed and outlooked from the four dimensions of practical security of QKD systems, on-chip implementation of cutting-edge QKD protocols, practical fully-integrated QKD systems, and synergistic optimization of high performance and high integration of integrated QRNG.

TI Stabilizing two-qubit entanglement by mimicking a squeezed environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB It is well known that qubits immersed in a squeezed vacuum environment exhibit many exotic phenomena, including dissipative entanglement stabilization. Here we show that these effects only require interference between excitation and decay processes, and can be faithfully mimicked without nonclassical light using a simple classical temporal modulation. We present schemes that harness this idea to stabilize entanglement between two remote qubits coupled via a transmission line or waveguide, where either the qubit-waveguide coupling is modulated, or the qubits are directly driven. We analyze the resilience of these approaches against various imperfections and also characterize the trade-off between the speed and quality of entanglement stabilization. Our protocols are compatible with state-of-the-art cavity QED systems.

TI Graph Coarsening Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem: An
   Approximation Strategy
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, solving complex optimization problems such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce a novel method in this paper that focuses on reducing the number of edges in a graph based on Euclidean distances between vertices while preserving the crucial characteristics needed for solving the VRP. Our graph coarsening approach combined with the inflation method enables the reduced graph to be processed efficiently by classical, quantum or hybrid (quantum-classical) solvers, resulting in a faster computation time. When using the proposed method with hybrid algorithms, we have demonstrated an improvement of approximately 50% in the solution found by the hybrid solver. The practicality of our method on quantum hardware highlights its potential to contribute to the advancement of quantum and hybrid algorithms and applications during the NISQ era.

TI Measurement-induced population switching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum information processing is a key technology in the ongoing second quantum revolution, with a wide variety of hardware platforms competing toward its realization. An indispensable component of such hardware is a measurement device, i.e., a quantum detector that is used to determine the outcome of a computation. The act of measurement in quantum mechanics, however, is naturally invasive as the measurement apparatus becomes entangled with the system that it observes. This always leads to a disturbance in the observed system, a phenomenon called quantum measurement backaction, which should solely lead to the collapse of the quantum wave function and the physical realization of the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics. Here we demon- strate that backaction can fundamentally change the quantum system through the detection process. For quantum information processing, this means that the readout alters the system in such a way that a faulty measurement outcome is obtained. Specifically, we report a backaction-induced population switching, where the bare presence of weak, nonprojective measurements by an adjacent charge sensor inverts the electronic charge configuration of a semiconductor double quantum dot system. The transition region grows with measurement strength and is suppressed by temperature, in excellent agreement with our coherent quantum backaction model. Our result exposes backaction channels that appear at the interplay between the detector and the system environments, and opens new avenues for controlling and mitigating backaction effects in future quantum technologies.

TI Predicting Non-Markovian Superconducting-Qubit Dynamics from Tomographic
   Reconstruction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Non-Markovian noise presents a particularly relevant challenge in understanding and combating decoherence in quantum computers, yet is challenging to capture in terms of simple models. Here we show that a simple phenomenological dynamical model known as the post-Markovian master equation (PMME) accurately captures and predicts non-Markovian noise in a superconducting qubit system. The PMME is constructed using experimentally measured state dynamics of an IBM Quantum Experience cloud-based quantum processor, and the model thus constructed successfully predicts the non-Markovian dynamics observed in later experiments. The model also allows the extraction of information about crosstalk and measures of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate definitively that the PMME model predicts subsequent dynamics of the processor better than the standard Markovian master equation.

TI Quantum information as the scientific basis for the explanation of human
   consciousness and its evolution
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB A scientific explanation of consciousness and its evolution has become possible by a generalized quantum information concept. Crucial to this is a new understanding of matter and energy. Our consciousness, being an information structure, processes the information that we absorb from our bodies and our environment. This information reaches us as properties of material objects and the massless quanta of light, the photons. One of the properties of matter is motion-physically, kinetic energy. Einstein's E = mc2 shows that motion can be converted into matter. Matter is thus equivalent to one of its properties. The mathematical-physical structure of quantum theory has opened up a comprehensive view of the construction of complex systems from simple structures. Such a construction can and should begin with the simplest quantum structure, a quantum bit. Matter and also photons can thereby ultimately be understood as manifestations of abstract quantum information. Abstract, i.e. still meaning-free, and absolute, i.e. cosmically based, bits of quantum information, AQIs, provide the common basis for consciousness, energy and matter. This explains the mutual influences between matter, energy and the information that is meaningful for a living being.

TI Low power single flux quantum qubit control circuit without
   high-frequency input
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The use of high-frequency input signals from room-temperature microwave sources makes it difficult to scale up the number of quantum bits in universal quantum computers. To address this issue, superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ) integrated circuits are being explored as suitable candidates for qubit manipulation in universal quantum computers. This paper deals with a scalable SFQ qubit control circuit (SQCC) structure that requires only low-frequency input. The circuit mainly consists of a pulse generator and a counter, that output the SFQ pulse train with adjustable frequency and a controllable number of pulses, which is applicable to control single-qubit Clifford operations. The design of low-voltage rapid single flux quantum (LV-RSFQ) and energy-efficient rapid single flux quantum (ERSFQ) for the SQCC achieves low power consumption and provides a basis for scaling up SQCC to control more qubits. The proposed circuits are fabricated under the SIMIT-Nb03 process and successfully pass test verification. The achieved test results reveal that the adjustable output frequency ranges of the SQCC based on the LV-RSFQ and ERSFQ designs in order are [2.40, 8.11] GHz and [4.81, 5.14] GHz. In the operating frequency range, the circuit is able to generate the correct number of SFQ pulses under control. The controllable number range is from 1 to 128. When the circuits operate at 5 GHz, the total power consumptions of the above circuits in order are 23.88 & mu;W and 6.2 & mu;W. All input signals are low-frequency signals, which frees the control of large-scale qubits from limitations caused by high-frequency inputs produced by room-temperature microwave sources.

TI Variational simulation of Schwinger's Hamiltonian with polarization
   qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The numerical emulation of quantum physics and quantum chemistry often involves an intractable number of degrees of freedom and admits no known approximation in the general form. In practice, representing quantum-mechanical states using available numerical methods becomes exponentially more challenging with increasing system size. Recently, quantum algorithms implemented as variational models have been proposed to accelerate such simulations. Here, we study the effect of noise on the quantum phase transition in the Schwinger model within a variational framework. The experiments are built using a free space optical scheme to realize a pair of polarization qubits and enable any two-qubit state to be experimentally prepared up to machine tolerance. We specifically exploit the possibility to engineer noise and decoherence for polarization qubits to explore the limits of variational algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum architectures in identifying and quantifying quantum phase transitions with noisy qubits. We find that despite the presence of noise, one can detect the phase transition of the Schwinger Hamiltonian even for a two-qubit system using variational quantum algorithms.

TI Two-qubit controlled-Z gates robust against charge noise in silicon
   while compensating for crosstalk using neural network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The fidelity of two-qubit gates using silicon spin qubits is limited by charge noise. When attempting to dynamically compensate for charge noise using single-qubit echo pulses, crosstalk can cause complications. We present a method of using a deep neural network to optimize the components of an analytically designed composite pulse sequence, resulting in a two-qubit gate robust against charge noise errors while also taking crosstalk into account. We analyze two experimentally motivated scenarios. For a scenario with strong electron dipole spin resonance driving and negligible crosstalk, the composite pulse sequence yields up to an order of magnitude improvement over a simple cosine pulse. In a scenario with moderate electron spin resonance driving and appreciable crosstalk such that simple analytical control fields are not effective, optimization using the neural network approach allows one to maintain order-of-magnitude improvement despite the crosstalk.

TI Catch and release of propagating bosonic field with non-Markovian giant
   atom
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The non-Markovianity of physical systems is considered to be a valuable resource that has potential applications to quantum information processing. The control of traveling quantum fields encoded with information (flying qubit) is crucial for quantum networks. In this work, we propose to catch and release the propagating photon/phonon with a non-Markovian giant atom, which is coupled to the environment via multiple coupling points. Based on the Heisenberg equation of motion for the giant atom and field operators, we calculate the time-dependent scattering coefficients from the linear response theory and define the criteria for the non-Markovian giant atom. We analyze and numerically verify that the field bound states due to non-Markovianity can be harnessed to catch and release the propagating bosonic field on demand by tuning the parameters of giant atom.

TI Query complexity of unitary operation discrimination
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Discrimination of unitary operations is fundamental in quantum computation and information. A lot of quantum algorithms including the well-known Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm can essentially be regarded as discriminating among individual, or sets of unitary operations (oracle operators). The problem of discriminating between two unitary operations U and V can be described as: Given X & ISIN; {U, V}, determine which one X is. If X is given with multiple copies, then one can design an adaptive procedure that takes multiple queries to X to output the identification result of X. In this paper, we consider the problem: How many queries are required for achieving a desired failure probability epsilon of discrimination between U and V. We prove in a uniform framework: (i) if U and V are discriminated with bound gamma 2 >=-4 epsilon(1-epsilon)- error epsilon , then the number of queries T must satisfy T > gamma(U & DAG;V) , and (ii) if they are [ 2 >= 1-epsilon 2 1 discriminated with one-sided error epsilon, then there is T > left perpendicular(U & DAG;V) right perpendicular, where ski denotes iota the minimum integer not less than k and & UTheta;(W) denotes the length of the smallest arc containing all the eigenvalues of W on the unit circle.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI High-dimensional two-photon quantum controlled phase-flip gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB High-dimensional quantum systems have been used to reveal interesting fundamental physics and to improve information capacity and noise resilience in quantum information processing. However, it remains a significant challenge to realize universal two-photon quantum gates in high dimensions with high success probability. Here, by considering an ion-cavity QED system, we theoretically propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first highdimensional, deterministic, and universal two-photon quantum gate. By using an optical cavity embedded with a single trapped 40Ca+ ion, we achieve a high average fidelity larger than 98% for a quantum controlled phase-flip gate in four-dimensional space, spanned by photonic spin angular momenta and orbital angular momenta. Our proposed system can be an essential building block for high-dimensional quantum information processing, and also provides a platform for studying high-dimensional cavity QED.

TI Enhancing Cryptographic Security in Smart Consumer Electronics With a
   Hybrid ClassicalPost-Quantum Framework
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
AB With the proliferation of smart consumer electronics in edge computing environments, ensuring lightweight and long-term cryptographic security has become a pressing concern. Traditional encryption standards such as AES and ECC are increasingly vulnerable in the face of quantum computing advancements, necessitating quantum-resistant alternatives to safeguard future IoT ecosystems. This study proposes a hybrid cryptographic framework that combines AES-128 and ECC-P256 with quantum-resistant CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, aiming to secure smart consumer electronics against confidentiality attacks while ensuring forward secrecy in message authentication. The framework utilizes two encryption keys, ECC and Kyber, to hash the session key using SHA-256. Data encryption employs AES-128, while Dilithium signatures authenticate messages through the session key. The framework was evaluated using real-world IoT traffic from the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, deployed across four Azure B2s nodes simulating consumer-grade edge environments. Simultaneously, the simulation measured entropy, correlation values, and decryption capabilities following key tampering, as well as the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) under noise attacks and recovery rates from packet loss. The proposed hybrid scheme achieved entropy levels exceeding 7.999 while maintaining zero correlation strength compared to classical and post-quantum cryptography (PQC)-only schemes. The system demonstrated a 100% key success rate with standard keys; however, it exhibited failure when encountering a 2-bit key error, indicating its high sensitivity to key variations. The hybrid scheme attained a PSNR of 34.5 dB while subjected to 30% noise and successfully recovered 88.9% of packets under 20% loss conditions, further confirming its robustness in adverse communication conditions. These results demonstrate the framework's practical viability in securing smart consumer devices while preparing them for future quantum-era threats.

AB With the continuous growth of quantum hardware and its increasing accessibility, there is a shift away from theoretical research towards real-world problems. One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is drug discovery, which is a complex and multi-disciplinary process. To increase the success probability of finding new drugs, we can introduce an in-silico step to virtual screen the drug candidates. In this paper, we address the molecular docking problem of virtual screening. In particular, we analyze the performance of a molecular docking application, which is modeled as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) instance. We leveraged the computational power offered by different quantum computing models, gate-based and quantum annealing, to speed the solution of the QUBO formulation. Experimental results show how quantum annealer is still the best in class for our case study. Moreover, we report here the experience and the takeaways we obtained by executing quantum molecular docking on publicly accessible quantum hardware and software.

TI Universal Shot-Noise Limit for Quantum Metrology with Local Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum many-body interactions can induce quantum entanglement among particles, rendering them valuable resources for quantum-enhanced sensing. In this work, we establish a link between the bound on the growth of the quantum Fisher information and the Lieb-Robinson bound, which characterizes the operator growth in locally interacting quantum many-body systems. We show that for initial separable states, despite the use of local many-body interactions, the precision cannot surpass the shot noise limit at all times. This conclusion also holds for an initial state that is the nondegenerate ground state of a local and gapped Hamiltonian. These findings strongly hint that when one can only prepare separable initial states, nonlocal and long-range interactions are essential resources for surpassing the shot noise limit. This observation is confirmed through numerical analysis on the long-range Ising model. Our results bridge the field of many-body quantum sensing and operator growth in many-body quantum systems and open the possibility to investigate the interplay between quantum sensing and control, many-body physics and information scrambling.

TI Reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution based on passive
   light source monitoring
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In quantum key distribution (QKD), the users need to share the same reference frame. If their reference frames are inconsistent, the QKD system will not function properly. The most widely used method today is the active real-time calibration of both communication reference frames by using classical communication. In order to get rid of the real-time calibration operation of the reference frames, a QKD protocol independent of reference frame is proposed, called reference-frame-independent QKD (RFI-QKD). The RFI-QKD protocol is immune to the effects of slowly changing reference frame drift, requiring that only one set of bases should be aligned by Alice and Bob, and the remaining two sets of bases can slowly change in the channel. In the real QKD system, a set of basis vectors can always be found to maintain a stable alignment. However, some assumptions are made for the sources in most reported researches, i.e. with a trusted and fixed photon-number distribution (PND), which usually cannot be satisfied in practical implementations. Those unreasonable assumptions will inevitably compromise the security of practical QKD systems. To solve the problem, in this work, we present a passive light source monitoring (PLSM) scheme for RFI-QKD, which is accomplished by a passive monitoring module consisting of a beam splitter and two detectors on the source side. Through the PLSM module, we can have four monitoring events by using two local detectors and then precisely estimate the bounds of source distributions. Specifically, we take the three-intensity decoy-state-based RFI-QKD for example for illustraing the events. Compared with the original RFI-QKD, our PLSM method can passively monitor the PND and has many advantages, with light source fluctuations, finite-size effects and reference frame deflection angles taken into account.

The temperature dependence of device parameters, such as the threshold voltage, the gate/subthreshold leakage, and the variability, severely alters the memories' performance between room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K). To assess the best memory design for a given application, this paper benchmarks three custom DRAMs and a custom SRAM in 40-nm CMOS at 4.2 K and RT, e.g., identifying that, while the SRAM is more power efficient for moderate-to-high speeds at RT, the 2T DRAM performs better than SRAM and 3T DRAMs at 4.2 K.

TI Quantum sensing for gravity cartography
SO NATURE
AB A study reports a quantum gravity gradient sensor with a design that eliminates the need for long measurement times, and demonstrates the detection of an underground tunnel in an urban environment.
   The sensing of gravity has emerged as a tool in geophysics applications such as engineering and climate research(1-3), including the monitoring of temporal variations in aquifers(4) and geodesy(5). However, it is impractical to use gravity cartography to resolve metre-scale underground features because of the long measurement times needed for the removal of vibrational noise(6). Here we overcome this limitation by realizing a practical quantum gravity gradient sensor. Our design suppresses the effects of micro-seismic and laser noise, thermal and magnetic field variations, and instrument tilt. The instrument achieves a statistical uncertainty of 20 E (1 E = 10(-9) s(-2)) and is used to perform a 0.5-metre-spatial-resolution survey across an 8.5-metre-long line, detecting a 2-metre tunnel with a signal-to-noise ratio of 8. Using a Bayesian inference method, we determine the centre to +/- 0.19 metres horizontally and the centre depth as (1.89 -0.59/+2.3) metres. The removal of vibrational noise enables improvements in instrument performance to directly translate into reduced measurement time in mapping. The sensor parameters are compatible with applications in mapping aquifers and evaluating impacts on the water table(7), archaeology(8-11), determination of soil properties(12) and water content(13), and reducing the risk of unforeseen ground conditions in the construction of critical energy, transport and utilities infrastructure(14), providing a new window into the underground.

TI Microwave-Optics Entanglement via Coupled Opto- and Magnomechanical
   Microspheres
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, a new mechanism is presented to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., an yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. It is shown that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. The protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.

TI Quantum Variational vs. Quantum Kernel Machine Learning Models for
   Partial Discharge Classification in Dielectric Oils
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, electrical discharge images are classified using AI with quantum machine learning techniques. These discharges were originated in dielectric mineral oils and were detected by a high-resolution optical sensor. The captured images were processed in a Scikit-image environment to obtain a reduced number of features or qubits for later training of quantum circuits. Two quantum binary classification models were developed and compared in the Qiskit environment for four discharge binary combinations. The first was a quantum variational model (QVM), and the second was a conventional support vector machine (SVM) with a quantum kernel model (QKM). The execution of these two models was realized on three fault-tolerant physical quantum IBM computers. The novelty of this article lies in its application to a real problem, unlike other studies that focus on simulated or theoretical data sets. In addition, a study is carried out on the impact of the number of qubits in QKM, and it is shown that increasing the number of qubits in this model significantly improves the accuracy in the classification of the four binary combinations studied. In the QVM, with two qubits, an accuracy of 92% was observed in the first discharge combination in the three quantum computers used, with a margin of error of 1% compared to the simulation obtained on classical computers.

TI Nonorthogonal-qubit-state expansion for the asymmetric quantum Rabi
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a physically motivated variational wave function for the ground state of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM). The wave function is a weighted superposition of squeezed coherent states entangled with nonorthogonal qubit states and relies only on three variational parameters in the regimes of interest where the squeezing effect becomes negligible. The variational expansion describes the ground state remarkably well in almost all parameter regimes, especially with arbitrary bias. We use the variational result to calculate various relevant physical observables of the ground state and make a comparison with existing approximations and the exact solution. The results show that the variational expansion is a significant improvement over the existing approximations for the AQRM.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the closed expressions of the convex roof coherence measures for onequbit states in this paper. We present the analytical expressions for the convex roof coherence measures, C-f(rho), of one-qubit states with C-f(phi) := f(|c(0) |(2), |c(1) |(2)) (where |phi > = c(0)|0 > + c(1)|1 >) being convex with respect to the l1 norm of coherence of phi (i.e. Cl-1 (phi)), such coherence measures including the coherence of formation, the geometric measure of coherence, the coherence concurrence, and the coherence rank. We further present the operational interpretations of these measures. Finally, we present the usefulness of the convex roof coherence measures C-f(phi) being non-convex with respect to Cl-1 (phi) by giving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the transformations pf1.(1- p)f2. q.1.(1- q).2 via incoherent operations, where phi(i),phi(j) (i, j = 1, 2) are one-qubit pure states and 0 <= p, q <= 1.

TI Toward quantum sensing of chiral induced spin selectivity: Probing
   donor-bridge-acceptor molecules with NV centers in diamond
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Photoexcitable donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) molecules that support intramolecular charge transfer are ideal platforms to probe the influence of chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) in electron transfer and resulting radical pairs. In particular, the extent to which CISS influences spin polarization or spin coherence in the initial state of spin-correlated radical pairs following charge transfer through a chiral bridge remains an open question. Here, we introduce a quantum sensing scheme to measure directly the hypothesized spin polarization in radical pairs using shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond at the single- to few-molecule level. Importantly, we highlight the perturbative nature of the electron spin-spin dipolar coupling within the radical pair and demonstrate how Lee-Goldburg decoupling can preserve spin polarization in D-B-A molecules for enantioselective detection by a single NV center. The proposed measurements will provide fresh insight into spin selectivity in electron transfer reactions.

TI Multiparameter transmission estimation at the quantum Cramer-Rao limit
   on a cloud quantum computer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Estimating transmission or loss is at the heart of spectroscopy. To achieve the ultimate quantum resolution limit, one must use probe states with definite photon number and detectors capable of distinguishing the number of photons impinging thereon. In practice, one can outperform classical limits using two-mode squeezed light, which can be used to herald definite-photon-number probes, but the heralding is not guaranteed to produce the desired probes when there is loss in the heralding arm or its detector is imperfect. We show that this paradigm can be used to simultaneously measure distinct loss parameters in both modes of the squeezed light, with attainable quantum advantages. We demonstrate this protocol on Xanadu's X8 chip, accessed via the cloud, building photon-number probability distributions from 10(6) shots and performing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) on these distributions 10(3) independent times. Because pump light may be lost before the squeezing occurs, we also simultaneously estimate the actual input power, using the theory of nuisance parameters. MLE converges to estimate the transmission amplitudes in X8's eight modes to be 0.392 02(6), 0.307 06(8), 0.369 37(6), 0.287 30(9), 0.382 06(6), 0.304 41(8), 0.372 29(6), and 0.286 21(8) and the squeezing parameters, which are proxies for effective input coherent-state amplitudes, their losses, and their nonlinear interaction times, to be 1.3000(2), 1.3238(3), 1.2666(2), and 1.3425(3); all of these uncertainties are within a factor of two of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. This study provides crucial insight into the intersection of quantum multiparameter estimation theory, MLE convergence, and the characterization and performance of real quantum devices.

TI Investigating the relationship between CSAT scores and prefrontal fNIRS
   signals during cognitive tasks using a quantum annealing algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Academic achievement is a critical measure of intellectual ability, prompting extensive research into cognitive tasks as potential predictors. Neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offer insights into brain hemodynamics, allowing understanding of the link between cognitive performance and academic achievement. Herein, we explored the association between cognitive tasks and academic achievement by analyzing prefrontal fNIRS signals. A novel quantum annealer (QA) feature selection algorithm was applied to fNIRS data to identify cognitive tasks correlated with CSAT scores. Twelve features (signal mean, median, variance, peak, number of peaks, sum of peaks, range, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation, and root mean square) were extracted from fNIRS signals at two time windows (10- and 60-s) to compare results from various feature variable conditions. The feature selection results from the QA-based and XGBoost regressor algorithms were compared to validate the former's performance. In a two-step validation process using multiple linear regression models, model fitness (adjusted R2) and model prediction error (RMSE) values were calculated. The quantum annealer demonstrated comparable performance to classical machine learning models, and specific cognitive tasks, including verbal fluency, recognition, and the Corsi block tapping task, were correlated with academic achievement. Group analyses revealed stronger associations between Tower of London and N-back tasks with higher CSAT scores. Quantum annealing algorithms have significant potential in feature selection using fNIRS data, and represents a novel research approach. Future studies should explore predictors of academic achievement and cognitive ability.

TI Analysis of grover's quantum search algorithm on a classical computer:
   Identifying opportunities for improvement
SO SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE
   FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI
AB In this paper, Grover's quantum search algorithm is analyzed using a classical computer by calculating the amplitudes and the probabilities of finding a single marked state for n=5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 27 qubit states. The calculations show that the marked state can be found in O(root N) iterations, where N = 2(n) is the number of items. The possibility of improving Grover's search algorithm to find a single item in N search elements is discussed by calculating the amplitudes and hence the probabilities of finding a single marked state for n=5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 qubit states. The calculations showed that the marked state could be found with sufficiently high probability in (ln(N)) iterations. This is quite a remarkable speed-up that can be achieved to find a single marked element in an unsorted N search element.

TI Anisotropic qubit-photon interactions inducing multiple
   antibunching-to-bunching transitions of photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate photon correlations in the open anisotropic quantum Rabi model via quantum dressed master equation. Multiple antibunching-to-bunching transitions are generally exhibited at deep-strong qubit-photon coupling, which becomes vanishing in the standard open quantum Rabi model. The observed two-photon statistics can be well described analytically within a few lowest eigenstates at low temperatures. It is revealed that the additional photon antibunching effect mainly originates from the selection rule of the correlation-measurement-induced eigenstate transitions. Furthermore, we also unravel the phenomena that higher-order correlation function lifts up dramatically once passing the crossing point of excited states, which is attributed to the on-off switch of dominant cooperative transition with level crossing. We hope these results may fertilize the analysis of the nonclassical photon statistics in anisotropic coupled qubit-photon systems.

AB We extend Bloch sphere formalism to pure two-qubit systems. Combining insights from Geometric Algebra and the analysis of entanglement in different conjugate bases we identify two Bloch sphere geometry that is suitable for representing maximally entangled states. It turns out that the relative direction of the coordinate axes of the two Bloch spheres may be used to describe the states. Moreover, the coordinate axes of one Bloch sphere should be rignt-handed and those of the other one should be left-handed. We describe and depict separable and maximally entangled states as well as entangling and non-entangling rotations. We also offer a graphical representation of the workings of a CNOT gate for different inputs. Finally, we provide a way to also represent partially entangled states and describe entanglement measures related to the surface area of the sphere enclosing the state representation.

TI Bell Nonlocality in Hybrid Networks
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB In a generic hybrid network, classical, quantum, and no-signaling sources emit local hidden variables, stabilizer states, and no-signaling systems, respectively. The maximal correlation strength is investigated as the non-classical feature in this network. Given the associated fully-quantum network of a hybrid network, the stabilizing operators of the distributed quantum state are exploited to construct segmented Bell operators and the Bell inequalities tailored to the state. The upper bounds of the maximal correlation strengths in the associated full-classical, full-quantum, and fully-no-signaling networks are derived as the benchmarks. The study shows that the achievable correlation strength depends on the number of type- measurements and that of nonlocal sources. The -nonlocality criteria are also introduced, indicating that the achievable maximal correlation strength cannot modeled by the network with at least observers with local hidden variables performing type- measurements.

TI Certification of continuous-variable gates using average
   channel-fidelity witnesses
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce witnesses for the average channel fidelity between a known target gate and an arbitrary unknown channel, for continuous-variable (CV) systems. These are observables whose expectation value yields a tight lower bound to the average channel fidelity in question, thus constituting a practical tool for certification of experimental CV gates. Our framework applies to a broad class of target gates. Here, we focus on three specific types of targets: multi-mode Gaussian unitary channels, single-mode coherent state amplifiers, and the single-mode (non-Gaussian) cubic phase gate, which is a crucial ingredient for CV universal quantum computation. Our witnesses are experimentally-friendly as they rely exclusively on Gaussian measurements, even for the non-Gaussian-target case. Moreover, in all three cases, they can be measured efficiently in the estimation error epsilon and failure probability Delta, as well as in the number of modes m for the Gaussian-target case. To end up with, our approach for the Gaussian-target case relies on an improved measurement scheme for Gaussian state-fidelity witnesses, which is polynomially and exponentially more efficient in m and Delta, respectively, than previous schemes. The latter constitutes an interesting byproduct result on its own. Our findings are relevant to the experimental validation of many-body quantum technologies.

TI Fingerprints of Qubit Noise in Transient Cavity Transmission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Noise affects the coherence of qubits and thereby places a bound on the performance of quantum computers. We theoretically study a generic two-level system with fluctuating control parameters in a photonic cavity and find that basic features of the noise spectral density are imprinted in the transient transmission through the cavity. We obtain analytical expressions for generic noise and proceed to study the cases of quasistatic, white and 1/f(alpha) noise in more detail. Additionally, we propose a way of extracting the noise power spectral density in a frequency band only bounded by the range of the qubit-cavity detuning and with an exponentially decaying error due to finite measurement times. Our results suggest that measurements of the time-dependent transmission probability represent a novel way of extracting noise characteristics.

TI Experimental preparation of generalized cat states for itinerant
   microwave photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Generalized cat states represent arbitrary superpositions of coherent states, which are of great importance in various quantum information processing protocols. Here we demonstrate a versatile approach to creating generalized itinerant cat states in the microwave domain, by reflecting coherent-state photons from a microwave cavity containing a superconducting qubit. We show that with a coherent control of the qubit state, a full control over the coherent-state superposition can be realized. The prepared cat states are verified through quantum state tomography of the qubit-state-dependent reflection photon field. We further quantify quantum coherence in the prepared cat states based on the resource theory, revealing a good experimental control on the coherent-state superpositions. The photon number statistic and the squeezing properties are also analyzed. Remarkably, fourth-order squeezing is observed in the experimental states. Those results open up new possibilities of applying generalized cat states for the purpose of quantum information processing.

TI Dispensing of quantum information beyond no-broadcasting theorem-is it
   possible to broadcast anything genuinely quantum?
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB No-broadcasting theorem is one of the most fundamental results in quantum information theory; it guarantees that the simplest attacks on any quantum protocol, based on eavesdropping and copying of quantum information, are impossible. Due to the fundamental importance of the no-broadcasting theorem, it is essential to understand the exact boundaries of this limitation. We generalize the standard definition of broadcasting by restricting the set of states which we want to broadcast and restricting the sets of measurements which we use to test the broadcasting. We show that in some of the investigated cases broadcasting is equivalent to commutativity, while in other cases commutativity is not necessary.

TI Highly efficient encoding for job-shop scheduling problems and its
   application on quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Combinatorial optimization problems are considered to be an application, where quantum computing can have transformative impact. In the industrial context, job shop scheduling problems that aim at finding the optimal schedule for a set of jobs to be run on a set of machines are of immense interest. Here we introduce an efficient encoding of job shop scheduling problems, which requires much fewer bit-strings for counting all possible schedules than previously employed encodings. For problems consisting of N jobs with N operations, the number of required bit-strings is at least reduced by a factor N/log(2)(N) as compared to time indexed encodings. This is particularly beneficial for solving job shop scheduling problems on quantum computers, since much fewer qubits are needed to represent the problem. Our approach applies to the large class of flexible and usual job-shop scheduling problems, where operations can possibly be executed on multiple machines. Using variational quantum algorithms, we show that the encoding we introduce leads to significantly better performance of quantum algorithms than previously considered strategies. Importantly, the encoding we develop also enables significantly more compact classical representations and will therefore be highly useful even beyond applicability on quantum hardware.

TI A divide-and-conquer algorithm for quantum state preparation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Advantages in several fields of research and industry are expected with the rise of quantum computers. However, the computational cost to load classical data in quantum computers can impose restrictions on possible quantum speedups. Known algorithms to create arbitrary quantum states require quantum circuits with depth O(N) to load an N-dimensional vector. Here, we show that it is possible to load an N-dimensional vector with exponential time advantage using a quantum circuit with polylogarithmic depth and entangled information in ancillary qubits. Results show that we can efficiently load data in quantum devices using a divide-and-conquer strategy to exchange computational time for space. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a real quantum device and present two applications for quantum machine learning. We expect that this new loading strategy allows the quantum speedup of tasks that require to load a significant volume of information to quantum devices.

TI Quantum differential privacy under noise channels
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum differential privacy is a way to protect privacy in quantum computing. It perturbs the final state of quantum computing by a specific quantum noise channel and makes the output useless to the attackers, so as to achieve privacy protection. In this paper, we study the quantum differential privacy under three channels: bit flip channel, phase flip channel and depolarizing channel. We calculate the privacy parameters for these three channels based on the proportional distance. We show the privacy protection capability by calculating the decay rates of the trace distances of two arbitrary quantum states before and after passing through the channels. Under the same privacy budget, we compare the fidelities, the trace distances between the real outputs and the outputs after entering the channels, and analyze the privacy protection performance of different quantum channels in detail.

TI The influence of experimental imperfections on photonic GHZ state
   generation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB While the advantages of photonic quantum computing, including direct compatibility with communication, are apparent, several imperfections such as loss and distinguishability presently limit actual implementations. These imperfections are unlikely to be completely eliminated, and it is therefore beneficial to investigate which of these are the most dominant and what is achievable under their presence. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation of the influence of photon loss, multi-photon terms and photon distinguishability on the generation of photonic 3-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states via established fusion protocols. We simulate the generation process for spontaneous parametric down-conversion and solid-state-based single-photon sources using realistic parameters and show that different types of imperfections are dominant with respect to the fidelity and generation success probability. Our results indicate what are the dominant imperfections for the different photon sources and in which parameter regimes we can hope to implement photonic quantum computing in the near future.

TI Manipulating the direction of one-way steering in an optomechanical ring
   cavity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum steering refers to the apparent possibility of exploiting nonseparable quantum correlations to remotely influence the quantum state of an observer via local measurements. Different from entanglement and Bell nonlocality, quantum steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric property, which makes it relevant for many asymmetric quantum information processing tasks. Here, we study Gaussian quantum steering between two mechanical modes in an optomechanical ring cavity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we show that the state of the two considered modes can exhibit two-way steering and even one-way steering. Instead of using unbalanced losses or noises, we propose a simple practical way to control the direction of one-way steering. A comparative study between the steering and entanglement of the studied modes shows that both steering and entanglement undergo a sudden death-like behavior. In particular, steering is found more fragile against thermal noise remaining constantly upper-bounded by entanglement. The proposed scheme may be meaningful for one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution, where the security of such protocol depends fundamentally on the direction of steering.

TI Optimal quantum circuit generation for pixel segmentation in multiband
   images
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB A novel approach is proposed for multiband image processing via quantum models in real situations. Quantum circuits are automatically generated ad-hoc for each use case via multiobjective genetic algorithms. Using this universal method, image processing tasks such as segmentation can be carried out by considering the properties that constitute each pixel. The generated circuits present a low level of correlation between qubits, and thus can be considered quantum-inspired machine learning models. The effectiveness of this methodology has been validated by applying it to different segmentation use cases. Comparisons are made between optimized classical kernel methods and the generated quantum-inspired models to understand their behaviors. The results show that quantum models for multiband image processing achieve accuracies similar to those of classical methods.

AB Quantum computers are evolving at a rapid pace and are considered next-generation computers with high computational capabilities. However, due to the unique characteristics of qubits, state-of-the-art quantum computers are vulnerable to noise caused by qubit instability. To overcome this, high-performance computing (HPC) systems are utilized for quantum circuit simulations to evaluate complex quantum algorithms with great accuracy. However, quantum circuit simulations have high computational demands, and the data volume increases exponentially as the number of qubits increases.
   In this paper, we propose SWIFTN, a quantum circuit simulation optimization framework for HPC systems with scalability. To achieve this, it enhances parallelism by dividing the tensor networks and distributing them across multiple GPUs and nodes. Additionally, it reduces computational costs by bypassing tasks through intermittent tensor contraction. Finally, to mitigate the degradation in accuracy due to intermittent tensor contraction, SWIFTN performs amplitude adjustments. We implement and evaluate SWIFTN using a Perlmutter supercomputer. Our evaluation results using popular quantum algorithm benchmark (i.e., QAOA) shows that SWIFTN can improve the performance by 7.85x with 99.997% accuracy.

AB Optical communications have enabled high-speed data transmission over long distances. However, data are transmitted plain unless are encrypted on higher layers, e.g., IP and TCP, precisely because of: i) the high data rates; and ii) the need of secure key exchange between the end-points of the optical connection. Meanwhile, quantum enabled cryptography has emerged as a promising solution for securing communications by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics which provides unlimited and unconditional security. Although Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols can deliver quantum keys to distant end-points, there are scenarios where one of them is not within the security perimeter of the quantum network. This demonstration focuses on the intersection of optical communication and quantum security, highlighting the synergies between these two domains and their potential to ensure secure communication networks. We explore the integration of optical communication with quantum technologies and showcase how optical encryption using quantum keys retrieved from QKD and Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) systems is performed. Retrieved keys are expanded to the required rate and then used to encrypt the input data at line speed.

TI qTrustNet Virtual Private Network (VPN): Enhancing Security in the
   Quantum Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper introduces qTrustNet VPN, a next-generation Virtual Private Network (VPN) designed to enhance security in the quantum era. As traditional encryption methods face obsolescence due to the advent of quantum computing, there is an urgent need for more robust security solutions. qTrustNet VPN addresses this need by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission through the WireGuard protocol, known for its simplicity and high performance. At the core of qTrustNet VPN's enhanced security is the integration of a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithm, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This PQC algorithm is designed to withstand the decryption capabilities of quantum computers, thus providing long-term security. To further bolster security, the encryption key of the PQC algorithm is protected using Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) technology. PUFs offer a hardware-based security mechanism that is resistant to cloning and tampering, ensuring that the encryption keys remain secure against both classical and quantum attacks. This innovative combination of WireGuard protocol, PQC algorithms, and PUF technology creates a VPN system with significantly improved security features. To validate its effectiveness, the performance of the proposed qTrustNet VPN was rigorously evaluated in a 10GbE NIC network environment. The results demonstrated a remarkable throughput of up to 8.5 Gbps, ensuring high-speed data transmission capabilities. Additionally, the latency was measured at 1ms or less, highlighting the system's efficiency in maintaining low-latency communication. In summary, qTrustNet VPN represents a significant advancement in VPN technology, offering robust security features tailored for the quantum era while maintaining high performance and low latency. This paper details the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of qTrustNet VPN, showcasing its potential to secure data transmission against emerging quantum threats.

TI Non-Restoring Array Divider Using Optimized CAS Cells Based on
   Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata with Minimized Latency and Power
   Dissipation for Quantum Computing
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Many studies have addressed the physical limitations of complementary metal-oxide semi-conductor (CMOS) technology and the need for next-generation technologies, and quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) are emerging as a replacement for nanotechnology. Meanwhile, the divider is the most-used circuit in arithmetic operations with squares and multipliers, and the development of effective dividers is crucial for improving the efficiency of inversion and exponentiation, which is known as the most complex operation. In most public-key cryptography systems, the corresponding operations are used by applying algebraic structures such as fields or groups. In this paper, an improved design of a non-restoring array divider (N-RAD) is proposed based on the promising technology of QCA. Our QCA design is focused on the optimization of dividers using controlled add/subtract (CAS) cells composed of an XOR and full adder. We propose a new CAS cell using a full adder that is designed to be very stable and compact so that power dissipation is minimized. The proposed design is considerably improved in many ways compared with the best existing N-RADs and is verified through simulations using QCADesigner and QCAPro. The proposed full adder reduces the energy loss rate by at least 25% compared to the existing structures, and the divider has about 23%~4.5% lower latency compared to the latest coplanar and multilayer structures.

TI Predicting molecular vibronic spectra using time-domain analog quantum
   simulation
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Spectroscopy is one of the most accurate probes of the molecular world. However, predicting molecular spectra accurately is computationally difficult because of the presence of entanglement between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Although quantum computers promise to reduce this computational cost, existing quantum approaches rely on combining signals from individual eigenstates, an approach whose cost grows exponentially with molecule size. Here, we introduce a method for scalable analog quantum simulation of molecular spectroscopy: by performing simulations in the time domain, the number of required measurements depends on the desired spectral range and resolution, not molecular size. Our approach can treat more complicated molecular models than previous ones, requires fewer approximations, and can be extended to open quantum systems with minimal overhead. We present a direct mapping of the underlying problem of time-domain simulation of molecular spectra to the degrees of freedom and control fields available in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. We experimentally demonstrate our algorithm on a trapped-ion device, exploiting both intrinsic electronic and motional degrees of freedom, showing excellent quantitative agreement for a single-mode vibronic photoelectron spectrum of SO2.

TI Avoiding barren plateaus in the variational determination of geometric
   entanglement
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The barren plateau (BP) phenomenon is one of the main obstacles to implementing variational quantum algorithms in the current generation of quantum processors. Here, we introduce a method capable of avoiding the BP phenomenon in the variational determination of the geometric measure of entanglement for a large number of qubits. The method is based on measuring compatible two-qubit local functions whose optimization allows for achieving a well-suited initial condition from which a global function can be further optimized without encountering a BP. We analytically demonstrate that the local functions can be efficiently estimated and optimized. Numerical simulations up to 18 qubit GHZ and W states demonstrate that the method converges to the exact value. In particular, the method allows for escaping from BPs induced by hardware noise or global functions defined on high-dimensional systems. Numerical simulations with noise agree with experiments carried out on IBM's quantum processors for seven qubits.

TI Quantum information meets high-energy physics: input to the update of
   the European strategy for particle physics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.

TI Quantum model learning agent: characterisation of quantum systems
   through machine learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Accurate models of real quantum systems are important for investigating their behaviour, yet are difficult to distil empirically. Here, we report an algorithm-the quantum model learning agent (QMLA)-to reverse engineer Hamiltonian descriptions of a target system. We test the performance of QMLA on a number of simulated experiments, demonstrating several mechanisms for the design of candidate Hamiltonian models and simultaneously entertaining numerous hypotheses about the nature of the physical interactions governing the system under study. QMLA is shown to identify the true model in the majority of instances, when provided with limited a priori information, and control of the experimental setup. Our protocol can explore Ising, Heisenberg and Hubbard families of models in parallel, reliably identifying the family which best describes the system dynamics. We demonstrate QMLA operating on large model spaces by incorporating a genetic algorithm to formulate new hypothetical models. The selection of models whose features propagate to the next generation is based upon an objective function inspired by the Elo rating scheme, typically used to rate competitors in games such as chess and football. In all instances, our protocol finds models that exhibit F (1) score > 0.88 when compared with the true model, and it precisely identifies the true model in 72% of cases, whilst exploring a space of over 250 000 potential models. By testing which interactions actually occur in the target system, QMLA is a viable tool for both the exploration of fundamental physics and the characterisation and calibration of quantum devices.

TI Enforcing exact permutation and rotational symmetries in the application
   of quantum neural networks on point cloud datasets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of S n-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNNs) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this paper, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a structure of the QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the SO(1, , 3) Lorentz symmetry.

TI Quasiparticle Dynamics in Niobium Nitride Superconducting Microwave
   Resonators at Single-Photon Regime
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Reliable operation of superconducting quantum circuits demands effective control over quasiparticles, which introduce energy distributions below the superconducting gap and act as a dominant source of decoherence. Here, we investigate the impact of quasiparticle dynamics on niobium nitride (NbN) microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. By performing sub-Kelvin measurements of resonance frequency and internal quality factor across temperature sweeps, we find links between quasiparticle energy and superconducting circuit performance. Calculations of the complex conductivity of the NbN film reveal the quantitative role of quasiparticle density in experimental results. These findings deepen understanding of quasiparticle-induced losses, paving the way toward engineering more resilient superconducting resonators, with broad implications for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

TI Dissipative preparation and stabilization of many-body quantum states in
   a superconducting qutrit array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present and analyze a protocol for driven-dissipatively preparing and stabilizing a manifold of quantum many-body entangled states with symmetry-protected topological order. Specifically, we consider the experimental platform consisting of superconducting transmon circuits and linear microwave resonators. We perform theoretical modeling of this platform via pulse-level simulations based on physical features of real devices. In our protocol, transmon qutrits are mapped onto spin-1 systems. The qutrits' sharing of nearest-neighbor dispersive coupling to a dissipative microwave resonator enables elimination of state population in the Stotal = 2 subspace for each adjacent pair, and thus, the stabilization of the many-body system into the Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki state up to the edge mode configuration. We also analyze the performance of our protocol as the system size scales up to four qutrits, in terms of its fidelity as well as the stabilization time. Our work shows the capacity of driven-dissipative superconducting cQED systems to host robust and self-corrected quantum many-body states that are topologically nontrivial.

TI QUANTUM OTTO MACHINES POWERED BY A SINGLE QUBIT IN A SPIN STAR
   ENVIRONMENT
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB This paper examines the performance analysis of quantum Otto machines (QOM) driven by a single qubit system embedded within a spin star environment. We investigate various thermodynamic correlations during the operation of these machines, including work performed, heat absorbed, and heat emissions. For the sake of simplicity, our exploration centers around two scenarios: one where the central qubit interacts with a single spin and another where it interacts with four qubits. Our findings reveal that QOM employing this system exhibit unique thermodynamic properties. Notably, we observe that the QOM can achieve enhanced levels of work performed as the number of spins in the environment increases. Furthermore, both the work performed and the efficiency of the QOM are influenced by the variation in detuning and coupling strength parameters across the four stages of its operation. Additionally, we demonstrate that careful selection of these parameters enables the optimization of QOM performance. In certain instances, the performance of the Otto cycle can be stabilized to emulate the behaviour of a heat engine by manipulating the coupling values while simultaneously controlling the frequency of the central qubit.

TI Adjusting Optical Polarization with Machine Learning for Enhancing
   Practical Security of Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO ELECTRONICS
AB An available trick to mitigate the interference of environmental noise in quantum communications is to modulate signals with time-polarization multiplexing. Conversely, due to effects of the atmospheric turbulence in free space, the polarization of signals fluctuates randomly, resulting in feasible information leakage when direct polarization demultiplexing is carried out at the receiver, drowning out the noise-contained signals. For enhancing the practical security of the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for optimization of the dynamic polarization control (DPC) of signals transmitted through atmospheric turbulence. An optimal DPC scheme can be adaptively adjusted with ML algorithms, which is based on the received signals at the receiver for solving the loophole problem of information leakage since it provides an accurate response to the polarization changes regarding the anamorphic signals. The performance of the CVQKD system can be increased in terms of secret key rates and maximal transmission distance as well. Numerical simulation shows the positive effect of the ML-based DPC while taking into account the secret key rate of the CVQKD system. The ML-based DPC effectively reduces the feasibility of information leakage and hence results in an increased secret key rate of the practical CVQKD system.

TI Unitary Design of Quantum Spin Networks for Robust Routing, Entanglement
   Generation, and Phase Sensing
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spin chains can be used to describe a wide range of platforms for quantum computation and quantum information. They enable the understanding, demonstration, and modeling of numerous useful phenomena, such as high fidelity transfer of quantum states, creation and distribution of entanglement, and creation of resources for measurement-based quantum processing. In this paper, a more complex spin system, a 2D spin network (SN) engineered by applying suitable unitaries to two uncoupled spin chains, is studied. Considering only the single-excitation subspace of the SN, it is demonstrated that the system can be operated as a router, directing information through the SN. It is also shown that it can serve to generate maximally entangled states between two sites. Furthermore, it is illustrated that this SN system can be used as a sensor device able to determine an unknown phase applied to a system spin. A detailed modeling investigation of the effects of static disorder in the system shows that this system is robust against different types of disorder.

TI Electrical control of the hole spin qubit in Si and Ge nanowire quantum
   dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Strong, direct Rashba spin-orbit coupling in Si, Ge, and the Ge/Si core/shell nanowire quantum dot (QD) allows for all electrical manipulation of the hole spin qubit. Motivated by this fact, we analyze different fabrication-dependent properties of nanowires, such as orientation, cross section, and the presence of strain, with the goal being to find the material and geometry that enables the fastest qubit manipulation, whose speed can be identified using the Rabi frequency. We show that QD in nanowires with a circular cross section (cNWs) enables much weaker driving of the hole spin qubit than QDs embedded in square profile nanowires (sNWs). Assuming the orientation of the Si nanowire that maximizes the spin-orbit effects, our calculations predict that the Rabi frequencies of the hole spin qubits inside Ge and Si sNW QD have comparable strengths for weak electric fields. The global maximum of the Rabi frequency is found in Si sNW QD for strong electric fields, putting this setup ahead of others in creating the hole spin qubit. Finally, we demonstrate that strain in the Si/Ge core/shell nanowire QD decreases the Rabi frequency. In cNW QD, this effect is weak; in sNW QD, it is possible to optimize the impact of strain with the appropriate tuning of the electric field strength.

TI Quantum Probabilistic Model Checking for Time-Bounded Properties
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is a verification technique for analyzing the properties of probabilistic systems. However, existing techniques face challenges in verifying large systems with high accuracy. PMC struggles with state explosion, where the number of states grows exponentially with the size of the system, making large system verification infeasible. While statistical model checking (SMC) avoids PMC's state explosion problem by using a simulation approach, it suffers from runtime explosion, requiring numerous samples for high accuracy.
   To address these limitations in verifying large systems with high accuracy, we present quantum probabilistic model checking (QPMC), the first method leveraging quantum computing for PMC with respect to time-bounded properties. QPMC addresses state explosion by encoding PMC problems into quantum circuits that superpose states within qubits. Additionally, QPMC resolves runtime explosion through Quantum Amplitude Estimation, efficiently estimating the probabilities of specified properties. We prove that QPMC correctly solves PMC problems and achieves a quadratic speedup in time complexity compared to SMC.

TI Real-time millikelvin thermometry in a semiconductor-qubit architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We report local time-resolved thermometry in a silicon-nanowire quantum dot device designed to host a linear array of spin qubits. Using two alternative measurement schemes based on rf reflectometry, we are able to probe either local electron or bosonic bath temperatures with microsecond time scale resolution and a noise-equivalent temperature of 3 mK/root Hz. Following the application of short microwave pulses, causing local periodic heating, time-dependent thermometry can track the dynamics of thermal excitation and relaxation, revealing clearly different characteristic time scales. This work opens important prospects to investigate the out-of-equilibrium thermal properties of semiconductor quantum electronic devices operating at very low temperature. In particular, it may provide a powerful handle to understand heating effects recently observed in semiconductor spin-qubit systems.

TI Entanglement constraint on wave-particle duality for tripartite systems

AB A global multi-partite entanglement may place a constraint on the wave-particle duality. We investigate this constraint relation of the global entanglement and the quantitative wave-particle duality in tripartite systems. We perform quantum state tomography to reconstruct the reduced density matrix by using the OriginQ quantum computing cloud platform. As a result, we show that, theoretically and experimentally, the quantitative wave-particle duality is indeed constrained by the global tripartite entanglement. The present constraint relation can not only provide the foundational explanation for experimentally testing wave-particle duality, and also give the global entanglement a motivated physical meaning from the point of view of the quantitative wave-particle duality.

TI Experimental entanglement generation using multiport beam splitters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Multipartite entanglement plays a central role in optical quantum technologies. One way to entangle two photons is to prepare them in orthogonal internal states, for example, in two polarisations, and then send them through a balanced beam splitter. Post-selecting on the cases where there is one photon in each output port results in a maximally entangled state. This idea can be extended to schemes for the post-selected generation of larger entangled states. Typically, switching between different types of entangled states requires different arrangements of beam splitters and so a new experimental setup. Here, we demonstrate a simple and versatile scheme to generate different types of genuine tripartite entangled states with only one experimental setup. We send three photons through a three-port splitter and vary their internal states before post-selecting on certain output distributions. This results in the generation of tripartite W, G and GHZ states. We obtain fidelities of up to (87.3 +/- 1.1)% with regard to the respective ideal states, confirming a successful generation of genuine tripartite entanglement.

TI Efficient quantum simulation of QCD jets on the light front
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3 & thorn; 1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.

AB Petri nets have found widespread use among many application domains, not least due to their human-friendly graphical syntax for the composition of interacting distributed and asynchronous processes and services, based in partial-order dependencies and concurrent executions. Petri nets also come with abstract semantics, and mathematical methods for compositional synthesis, structural checks and behavioural analysis. These have led to the use of various kinds of nets for real-time, distributed and parallel programming languages, software and services systems, with a view to their interfaces and interaction protocols. These affordances make Petri nets invaluable for distributed software architecture approaches focused on components, their mutual dependencies and environment-facing interactions. Quantum computing - and in particular quantum software engineering - is in its infancy and could benefit from the accumulated insights of software architecture research and of net theory, its methods, and its applications.
   In this paper, we establish a connection between Petri nets and quantum systems, such that net theory and the component architecture of nets may help in the synthesis and analysis of abstract software models and their interface protocols in hybrid classical-and-quantum programming languages and services systems. We leverage some insights from net formalisms for software specification for a versatile recipe to bake quantum into extant Petri net flavours, and prove universality and compositionality of Petri nets for quantum programming.

The required quantum resources for these configurations are then estimated, identifying not only qubit-optimized and depth-optimized circuits but also those achieving a balanced trade-off between qubit and circuit depth. Building on these optimized DES designs, TDES circuits are constructed, and the corresponding cost of a Grover-based attack on the TDES is estimated.

TI Quantum states generation and manipulation in a programmable
   silicon-photonic four-qubit system with high-fidelity and purity
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We present a programmable silicon photonic four-qubit integrated circuit for the generation and manipulation of diverse quantum states. The silicon photonic chip integrates photon-pair sources, pump-reducing filters, wavelength-division-multiplexing filters, Mach-Zehnder interferometer switches, and single-qubit arbitrary gates, enabling versatile state preparation and tomography. We measure Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with an impressive 98% visibility using four-photon coincidence, laying the foundation for high-purity qubits. Our analysis involves estimating the fidelity and purity of distinct quantum states through maximum-likelihood estimation applied to tomographic measurements. In our experimental results, we showcase the following achievements: a heralded single qubit achieving 98.2% fidelity and 98.3% purity, a Bell state reaching 95.2% fidelity and 94.8% purity, and a four-qubit system with two simultaneous Bell states exhibiting 87.4% fidelity and 84.6% purity. Finally, a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state demonstrates 85.4% fidelity and 81.7% purity. In addition, we certify the entanglement of the four-photon GHZ state through Bell's inequality violations and a negative entanglement witness. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Quantum-inspired algorithms for multivariate analysis: from
   interpolation to partial differential equations
SO QUANTUM
AB In this work we study the encoding of smooth, differentiable multivariate function in quantum registers, using quantum computers or tensor-network representations. We show that a large family of distributions can be encoded as low-entanglement states of the quantum register. These states can be efficiently created in a quantum computer, but they are also efficiently stored, manipulated and probed using Matrix-Product States techniques. Inspired by this idea, we present eight quantum-inspired numerical analysis algorithms, that include Fourier sampling, interpolation, differentiation and integration of partial derivative equations. These algorithms combine classical ideas-finite-differences, spectral methods-with the efficient encoding of quantum registers, and well known algorithms, such as the Quantum Fourier Transform. When these heuristic methods work, they provide an exponential speed-up over other classical algorithms, such as Monte Carlo integration, finite-difference and fast Fourier transforms (FFT). But even when they don't, sonic of these algorithms can be translated back to a quantum computer to implement a similar task.

TI Thermal Fisher and Wigner-Yanase information correlations in two-qubit
   Heisenberg XYZ chain
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Using Wigner-Yanase and Fisher information [including local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI)] as well as log-negativity, we investigate the thermal non-local correlations of two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ non-X states produced in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. The two-spin XYZ-Heisenberg non-local correlation decay can be weakened by increasing the DM interaction as well as the spin-spin XYZ-Heisenberg interactions. The LQFI correlation has greater resistance to thermal degradation. The spin-spin y-component antiferromagnetic coupling has a higher ability to protect the generated spin-spin nonlocal correlations against high temperatures. The emergence of the phenomena of the sudden death of log-negativity and the sudden change of the LQFI and LQU depend on the spin-spin XYZ-Heisenberg and DM interactions as well as on the bath temperature. The generated asymmetric correlations resulting due to the x, y-component spin interactions confirm that the antiferromagnetic coupling has a high ability to generate a maximally correlated two-qubit state. While the generated correlations, due to two-spin z-component interaction, present symmetric dynamics, and its amount depends on the x-component spin interaction.

TI Field Test of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution through
   Sending-or-Not-Sending over 428 km
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum key distribution endows people with information-theoretical security in communications. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has attracted considerable attention because of its outstanding key rates over long distances. Recently, several demonstrations of TF-QKD have been realized. Nevertheless, those experiments are implemented in the laboratory, and therefore a critical question remains about whether the TF-QKD is feasible in real-world circumstances. Here, by adopting the sending-or-not-sending twin-field QKD (SNS-TF-QKD) with the method of actively odd parity pairing (AOPP), we demonstrate a field-test QKD over 428 km of deployed commercial fiber and two users are physically separated by about 300 km in a straight line. To this end, we explicitly measure the relevant properties of the deployed fiber and develop a carefully designed system with high stability. The secure key rate we achieved breaks the absolute key rate limit of repeaterless QKD. The result provides a new distance record for the field test of both TF-QKD and all types of fiber-based QKD systems. Our work bridges the gap of QKD between laboratory demonstrations and practical applications and paves the way for an intercity QKD network with measurement-device-independent security.

TI Sign-problem free quantum stochastic series expansion algorithm on a
   quantum computer
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A quantum implementation of the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) Monte Carlo method is proposed, and is shown to offer significant advantages over classical implementations of SSE. In particular, for problems where classical SSE encounters the sign problem, the cost of implementing a Monte Carlo iteration scales only linearly with system size in quantum SSE, while it may scale exponentially with system size in classical SSE. In cases where classical SSE can be efficiently implemented, quantum SSE still offers an advantage by allowing for more general observables to be measured.

TI High-fidelity laser-free universal control of trapped ion qubits
SO NATURE
AB Universal control of multiple qubits-the ability to entangle qubits and to perform arbitrary individual qubit operations(1)-is a fundamental resource for quantum computing(2), simulation(3) and networking(4). Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations(5-7) and single-qubit rotations(8) so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams(9-12) or by moving ions with respect to laser beams(13-15), but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods(16-20) may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of 1-0.0017+0 and 0.9977-0.0013+0.0010, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics(21,22) and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout(23,24) provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.

TI Noisy-intermediate-scale quantum power system state estimation
SO IENERGY
AB Quantum power system state estimation (QPSSE) offers an inspiring direction for tackling the challenge of state estimation through quantum computing. Nevertheless, the current bottlenecks originate from the scarcity of practical and scalable QPSSE methodologies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This paper devises a NISQ-QPSSE algorithm that facilitates state estimation on real NISQ devices. Our new contributions include: (1) A variational quantum circuit (VQC)-based QPSSE formulation that empowers QPSSE analysis utilizing shallow-depth quantum circuits; (2) A variational quantum linear solver (VQLS)-based QPSSE solver integrating QPSSE iterations with VQC optimization; (3) An advanced NISQ-compatible QPSSE methodology for tackling the measurement and coefficient matrix issues on real quantum computers; (4) A noise-resilient method to alleviate the detrimental effects of noise disturbances. The encouraging test results on the simulator and real-scale systems affirm the precision, universality, and scalability of our QPSSE algorithm and demonstrate the vast potential of QPSSE in the thriving NISQ era.

TI Synthesis and Quantum Metrology of Metal-Organic Framework-Coated
   Nanodiamonds Containing Nitrogen Vacancy Centers
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs) containing nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) have promising applications in quantum sensing, quantum computing, catalytic, and imaging applications. Functionalization of NDs with an ordered, porous coating can provide well-defined sites for ND immobilization and analyte interaction with the ND surface, furnishing a tunable environment for quantum applications and catalysis. Here, a facile strategy for functionalizing NV NDs with the biocompatible zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) metal-organic framework (MOF) is demonstrated. The composites were structurally characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating the formation of well-dispersed ND three-dimensional structures supported by a MOF matrix. Crucially, the fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance properties were preserved following ZIF-8 encapsulation, while spin relaxometry studies indicate that MOF functionalization lengthens the spin longitudinal relaxation time T-1, a critical quantum parameter for sensing applications. We further demonstrate that the average number of NDs per MOF can be controlled by increasing the concentration of NDs used in the synthesis. The tunable design of NDs@MOF materials has important implications for quantum sensing, quantum computing, and related applications, and the synthetic strategy and optical characterization data presented here provide a foundation for future exploration of ND@MOF systems.

TI Some Classes of New Quantum MDS and Synchronizable Codes Constructed
   From Repeated-Root Cyclic Codes of Length 6ps
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we use the CSS and Steane's constructions to establish quantum error-correcting codes (briefly, QEC codes) from cyclic codes of length 6p(s) over F-p(m). We obtain several new classes of QEC codes in the sense that their parameters are different from all the previous constructions. Among them, we identify all quantumMDS(briefly, qMDS) codes, i.e., optimal quantum codes with respect to the quantum Singleton bound. In addition, we construct quantum synchronizable codes (briefly, QSCs) from cyclic codes of length 6p(s) over F-p(m). Furthermore, we give many new QSCs to enrich the variety of available QSCs. A lot of them are QSCs codes with shorter lengths and much larger minimum distances than known non-primitive narrow-sense BCH codes.

TI Nonlocal correlation in quantum network near a Schwarzschild black hole
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We transfer the scenario of quantum network nonlocal correlation to the vicinity of a black hole's event horizon, aiming to evaluate the impact of Hawking effect on network nonlocality within this specific context. In an entanglement swapping network with two bipartite resources and three parties, we examine two scenarios with distinct Hawking radiation locations: one where it affects the endpoint parties' system and another where it impacts all parties' system. In both cases, network nonlocality decays due to Hawking radiation and disappears entirely when the Hawking temperature reaches a critical threshold. However, we observe a striking phenomenon: when resource states are maximally entangled and the affected system belongs to the endpoint participants, network nonlocality diminishes but does not vanish throughout the radiation process. Subsequently, we extend our investigation to star and chain networks to evaluate how resource quantity and distribution influence network nonlocality under Hawking radiation. Our results indicate that star networks exhibit greater resilience against Hawking radiation in maintaining nonlocality.

TI Neural Network-Based Prediction for Secret Key Rate of Underwater
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution through a Seawater Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) plays an important role in quantum communications, because of its compatible setup for optical implementation with low cost. For this paper, we considered a neural network approach to predicting the secret key rate of CVQKD with discrete modulation (DM) through an underwater channel. A long-short-term-memory-(LSTM)-based neural network (NN) model was employed, in order to demonstrate performance improvement when taking into account the secret key rate. The numerical simulations showed that the lower bound of the secret key rate could be achieved for a finite-size analysis, where the LSTM-based neural network (NN) was much better than that of the backward-propagation-(BP)-based neural network (NN). This approach helped to realize the fast derivation of the secret key rate of CVQKD through an underwater channel, indicating that it can be used for improving performance in practical quantum communications.

TI Polarization-correction device with liquid crystals for
   quantum-key-distribution satellite systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In this paper, we present a device, designed to be used in a space payload, capable of correcting any arbitrary polarization state. The device consists of a set of three liquid-crystal variable-retarder (LCVR) cells, in which by selecting the appropriate values of the voltage to be applied in each of them, it can correct the undesirable effects. In particular, the degradation effects of the polarization states, such as ellipticity and rotation with respect to the reference system, are compensated. Among many other potential applications, this device has been conceived to be used in quantum-key-distribution (QKD) intersatellite link or satellite-ground polarization-coding protocols as a polarization-correction device (PCD). To demonstrate that these effects are corrected, we have carried out an experiment in which we have tested how the BB84 protocol states are compensated after being strongly perturbed, achieving polarization extinction ratio (PER) values around 39 dB. Our solution offers the advantage of being small and mechanism free, being the ideal solution to be implemented in small satellites. These satellites are the core to be used in future constellations required for a global quantum communications network.

TI Multilayered quantum computing and simulation system for enhanced image
   representation of HSI based Fourier transform and adjacency matrix
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum image processing, as a convergence of quantum computing and image processing, necessitates extensive research into quantum image representations (QIRs), which are among the most significant topics shaping the field of quantum computing (QC) due to their potential opportunities and challenges. This study introduces a novel QIR model based on the hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) colour model. Our model advances image encoding by uniquely integrating an adjacency matrix to capture spatial pixel relationships with a Fourier transform (FT) representation for pixel intensity. Based on the HSI color space, AFQIRHSI uses a dual-entanglement structure; one state links the adjacency and intensity information, while another efficiently encodes hue and saturation. Named the adjacency Fourier quantum image representation of HSI (AFQIRHSI), this model utilises \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2 n+p+3$$\end{document} qubits to store a colour digital image of size \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>n \times 2<^>n$$\end{document}. AFQIRHSI enhances storage capacity by factors of four and two compared to earlier models, such as QIRHSI and EQIRHSI. In this paper, we also present several quantum image operations, including complement colour transformation \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\left( U_{C C}\right)$$\end{document}, global colour transformation \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\left( U_{s t}\right)$$\end{document}, quantum image retrieval \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\left( S_{c t}\right)$$\end{document}, and quantum image detection (QED). Comparative analyses of various quantum image representations are provided, highlighting their similarities and differences. AFQIRHSI offers a robust foundation for advanced quantum image processing applications, particularly in medical imaging and AI-based image classification.

TI Two-step phantom relaxation of out-of-time-ordered correlations in
   random circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) functions in various random quantum circuits and show that the average dynamics is governed by a Markovian propagator. This is then used to study relaxation of OTOC to its long-time average value in circuits with random single-qubit unitaries, finding that relaxation in general proceeds in two steps: In the first phase that lasts upto an extensively long time the relaxation rate is given by a phantom eigenvalue of a nonsymmetric propagator, whereas in the second phase the rate is determined by the true 2nd largest propagator eigenvalue. We also obtain exact OTOC dynamics on the lightcone and an expression for the average OTOC in finite random circuits with random two-qubit gates.

TI Room-temperature plexcitonic strong coupling: Ultrafast dynamics for
   quantum applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Strong light-matter interaction is at the heart of modern quantum technological applications and is the basis for a wide range of rich optical phenomena. Coupling a single quantum emitter strongly with electromagnetic fields provides an unprecedented control over its quantum states and enables high-fidelity quantum operations. However, single-emitter strong coupling is exceptionally fragile and has been realized mostly at cryogenic temperatures. Recent experiments have, however, demonstrated that single-emitter strong coupling can be realized at room temperature by using plasmonic nanocavities that confine optical fields via surface plasmons strongly on metal surfaces and facilitate sub-picosecond light-matter interaction. Here, we outline recent theoretical developments and experimental demonstrations of room-temperature strong coupling in the plasmonic platform, from emitter ensembles down to the single emitter limit, before placing a focus on selective studies that explore and provide insight into applications of plexcitonic strong coupling including sensing of single biological molecules, qubit entanglement generation, and reconfigurable single-photon sources and provide an outline of research directions in quantum sensing, quantum information processing, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

TI Proximity-Induced Exchange Interaction: A New Pathway for Quantum
   Sensing Using Spin Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional van der Waals material, have attracted a great deal of interest because of its potential in various quantum applications. Due to hBN's two-dimensional nature, the spin center in hBN can be engineered in the proximity of the target material, providing advantages over its three-dimensional counterparts, such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Here we propose a novel quantum sensing protocol driven by exchange interaction between the spin center in hBN and the underlying magnetic substrate induced by the magnetic proximity effect. By first-principles calculation, we demonstrate that the induced exchange interaction dominates over the dipole-dipole interaction by orders of magnitude when in the proximity. The interaction remains antiferromagnetic across all stacking configurations between the spin center in hBN and the target van der Waals magnets. Additionally, we explored the scaling behavior of the exchange field as a function of the spatial separation between the spin center and the targets.

TI Dynamic Quantum Federated Learning for Satellite-Ground Integrated
   Systems Using Slimmable Quantum Neural Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent advances in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have made it possible to achieve zero blind spots on Earth. Considering the give locations of these devices, this makes satellite-ground links between quantum devices a practical possibility. This paper proposes the first quantum federated learning (QFL) application in satellite-ground communication. To improve communication and computing performance, this paper adopts slimmable quantum federated learning (SQFL) and slimmable quantum neural networks (sQNN), which allow for two different configurations in quantum neural networks: the angle and pole configurations. This paper also employs superposition coding and successive decoding to increase communication opportunities. Through extensive experiments, the proposed satellite-ground SQFL framework performs well and is both computationally and communicationally efficient compared to classical federated learning and QFL.

TI High Rate CV-QKD Secured Mobile WDM Fronthaul for Dense 5G Radio
   Networks
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB A coherent transmission methodology for a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system based on quantum-heterodyne measurement through a coherent intradyne receiver is experimentally demonstrated in the framework of 5G mobile fronthaul links. Continuous optical carrier synchronization is obtained through training information, which is multiplexing to the quantum signal as pilot tone in both, frequency and polarization. Spectral tailoring by means of optical carrier suppression and single-sideband modulation is adopted to simultaneously mitigate crosstalk into the quantum channel and self-interference for the pilot tone, thus allowing for a high signal-to-noise ratio for this training signal. Frequency offset correction and optical phase estimation for the free-running local oscillator of the receiver is accurately performed and guarantees low-noise quantum signal reception at high symbol rates of 250 MHz and 500 MHz with additional Nyquist pulse shaping. A low excess noise in the order of 0.1% to 0.5% of shot-noise units is obtained for fiber-based transmission over a fronthaul link reach of 13.2 km. Moreover, co-existence with 11 carrier-grade classical signals is experimentally investigated. Joint signal transmission in the C-band of both, quantum signal and classical signals, is successfully demonstrated. Secure-key rates of 18 and 10 Mb/s are obtained under strict security assumptions, where Eve has control of the receiver noise, for a dark and a lit fiber link, respectively. Moreover, rates of 85 and 72 Mb/s are resulting for a trusted receiver scenario. These secure-key rates are well addressing the requirements for time-shared CV-QKD system in densified 5G radio access networks with cloud-based processing.

TI Characterization of intensity correlation via single-photon detection in
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the most significant vulnerabilities in the source unit of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the correlation between quantum states after modulation, which shall be characterized and evaluated for its practical security performance. In this work, we propose a methodology to characterize the intensity correlation according to the single-photon detection results in the measurement unit without modifying the configuration of the QKD system. In contrast to the previous research that employs extra classical optical detector to measure the correlation, our method can directly analyse the detection data generated during the raw key exchange, enabling to characterize the feature of correlation in real-time system operation. The basic method is applied to a BB84 QKD system and the characterized correlation decreases the secure key rate shown by the security proof. Furthermore, the method is extended and applied to characterize the correlation from the result of Bell-state measurement, which demonstrates its applicability to a running full-scheme MDI QKD system. This study provides an approach for standard certification of a QKD system. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Linear optical deterministic and reconfigurable SWAP gate
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a deterministic SWAP gate for dual-rail-encoded single photon qubits. The gate is constructed from waveguide crossings, Mach-Zehnder interferometers and phase shifters which provide the gate reconfigurability. Through manipulating the phase of the phase shifters, we can apply either the SWAP or identity gates. As an essential element of nearest neighbor qubit networks, the SWAP gate has a simple structure and presents minimal overhead. Providing an efficient solution to the geometric restrictions of on-chip dual-rail qubit circuits, our design may be utilized in applying large scale arbitrary unitary transformations.

AB In this work we explore how the relationship between one subordinate reporting to two leaders influences the alignment of the latter with the company's strategic objectives in an Industry 4.0 environment. We do this through the implementation of quantum circuits that represent decision networks. This is done for two cases: One in which the leaders do not communicate with each other, and one in which they do. Through the quantum simulation of strategic organizational design configurations (QSOD) through 500 quantum circuit simulations, we conclude that in the first case both leaders are not simultaneously in alignment, and in the second case that both reporting nodes need to have an alignment probability higher than 90% to support the leader node.

TI Efficient Dimensionality Reduction Strategies for Quantum Reinforcement
   Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum neural networks constitute one of the most promising applications of Quantum Machine Learning, as they leverage both the capabilities of classical neural networks and the unique advantages of quantum mechanics. Moreover, quantum mechanics has demonstrated its ability to detect atypical patterns in data that are challenging for classical approaches to recognize. However, despite their potential, there are still open questions such as barren plateau phenomenon and the challenges of scalability and the curse of dimensionality, which become particularly relevant in Reinforcement Learning (RL) when working in environments with high-dimensional state and action spaces. This study delves into the critical realm of representing classical data as quantum states, a topic of keen interest across the scientific community. The aim is to construct streamlined circuits for efficient execution on quantum computers and simulators using minimal qubits and entanglement gates to evade barren plateau phenomena and reducing computational times. Our investigation examines and validates the efficacy of three strategies for data management and dimensionality reduction in real-world, large-scale environments for Quantum Reinforcement Learning, particularly in energy efficiency scenarios. The techniques encompass amplitude encoding, linear layer preprocessing, and data reuploading, supplemented by trainable parameters. This research sheds light on the potential of quantum machine learning in enhancing real-world environments, including energy efficiency scenarios and showcases the capabilities of quantum neural networks in the reinforcement learning landscape.

TI Amplification of entangled beam based on four-wave mixing process
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Two-mode entangled state is an important quantum resource for quantum information. In this paper, the amplification of a single mode of two-mode entangled state (single-mode amplification scheme) and two modes of two-mode entangled state (two-mode amplification scheme) are theoretically proposed. Here, the optical beam splitter model is used to simulate the vacuum noise introduced by the loss in the optical transmission process. By utilizing the positivity under partial transpose criterion, we analyze the effect of the gain of the four-wave mixing process on the entanglement degree of the initial two-mode entangled state in two different amplification schemes. In these two schemes, we set the gain of the initial two-mode entangled state generation process to be 1.5, 2.5 and 50.0 respectively, and then change the gain of the amplification process in a certain range. We also set the transmission efficiency of the amplified beams for each of the two schemes to be a definite value. The results show that the entanglement of the initial two-mode entangled state decreases with the gain increasing under the condition of specific transmission loss in two schemes. When the gain does not exceed a certain value, the entanglement of the initial two-mode entangled state can be maintained. Then, with the increase of the gain, the entanglement of the initial two-mode entangled state will disappear. Moreover, the entanglement of the initial two-mode entangled state of the two-mode amplification scheme disappears faster than that of the single-mode amplification scheme. Our theoretical results pave the way for the experimental realization of the amplification of two-mode entangled state based on four-wave mixing process.

TI Sub-10 nm Precision Engineering of Solid-State Defects via Nanoscale
   Aperture Array Mask
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Engineering a strongly interacting uniform qubit cluster would be a major step toward realizing a scalable quantum system for quantum sensing and a node-based qubit register. For a solid-state system that uses a defect as a qubit, various methods to precisely position defects have been developed, yet the large-scale fabrication of qubits within the strong coupling regime at room temperature continues to be a challenge. In this work, we generate nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond with sub-10 nm scale precision using a combination of nanoscale aperture arrays (NAAs) with a high aspect ratio of 10 and a secondary E-beam hole pattern used as an ion-blocking mask. We perform optical and spin measurements on a cluster of NV spins and statistically investigate the effect of the NAAs during an ion-implantation process. We discuss how this technique is effective for constructing a scalable system.

TI Security analysis of mode-pairing quantum key distribution with flexible
   pairing strategy
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) is advantageous for long-distance secure communication, leveraging its simple implementation and quadratic scaling capacity. The post-measurement pairing in MP-QKD alleviates the photon-coincidence demands, which are essential for surpassing the fundamental limit to the key-rate transmission. In this work, we propose an improved decoy-state MP-QKD protocol featuring a flexible and efficient pairing strategy. We prove the security of the proposed scheme by presenting an entanglement model for decoy-state MP-QKD. The simulation results show that the secret key rate (SKR) can be enhanced among all distances. Notably, compared with the original scheme [Nature Communication 13, 3903 (2022)], the improvement of SKR is greater than 65% within 375 km in the asymptotic case and greater than 50% within 400 km in the finite case. And the achievable distance can be extended in the finite case, especially with a small block length. The simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed scheme, which is expected to promote the practical applicability of MP-QKD. Furthermore, the entanglement model could provide a theoretical framework for further security and performance analysis of decoy-state MP-QKD.

TI Experimental Test of Nonlocality Limits from Relativistic Independence
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum correlations, like entanglement, represent the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics and pose essential issues and challenges to the interpretation of this pillar of modern physics. Although quantum correlations are largely acknowledged as a major resource to achieve quantum advantage in many tasks of quantum technologies, their full quantitative description and the axiomatic basis underlying them are still under investigation. Previous works have suggested that the origin of nonlocal correlations is grounded in principles capturing (from outside the quantum formalism) the essence of quantum uncertainty. In particular, the recently introduced principle of relativistic independence has given rise to a new bound intertwining local and nonlocal correlations. Here, we test such a bound by realizing together sequential and joint weak measurements on entangled photon pairs, allowing us to simultaneously quantify both local and nonlocal correlations by measuring incompatible observables on the same quantum system without collapsing its state, a task typically forbidden in the traditional (projective) quantum measurement framework. Our results demonstrate the existence of a fundamental limit on the extent of quantum correlations, shedding light on the profound role of uncertainty in both enabling and balancing them.

TI Quantum Entanglement in Classical Systems: so what is the Subquantum
   Medium Made of?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB As astounding as it may still seem to many, Bell's theorems do not prove nonlocality. Non separable multipartite objects exist classically, meaning with local physics, the statistical state measurement of which violates the famous inequalities. Alleviating the almost century old confusion, the correct laws of statistics and logic pinpoint the true oddity of quantum objects: duality. As it is shown in the first part of this short essay, duality plus conservation laws allow the violation of Bell's inequalities for any spatio-temporal separation. To dig deeper into particle dualism, in the second part, a class of models is proposed as a working framework. It encompasses some chaotic excitable reaction-diffusion systems, whose generalized susceptibilities make them compatible with quantized fields and excitations, of any desired symmetry group including the renormalization semigroup. Particles are supposed topological in nature. Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization takes place thanks to topological invariants stemming from densely dispersed defects generated by a multifractal background. Entanglement phenomenology arises because latent variables exist that are carried away, along with the moving particles that have interacted, and by which correlations are preserved. Conservation is assumed to be born in the phase, just as momentum is for instance. In other words, all known phenomena in physics are deterministic, classical and real, in the sense that information does propagate locally and experiments conducted statistically do hide latent variables.

TI Application of the quantum Fourier transform in a harmonic balance
   solver for Burgers' equation
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB This paper explores the potential of quantum computing for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, with a focus on turbomachinery CFD. A harmonic balance solver is developed for Burgers' equation, in which discrete Fourier transforms are approximated using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Three novel algorithms are presented to estimate Fourier coefficients, providing complete knowledge of their amplitudes and phases, which is not possible with the standard QFT. Their behaviour is studied theoretically and numerically, under noiseless and noisy conditions. The algorithms, whose performance is limited by the extensive sampling required to achieve a small error on the Fourier coefficients, tolerate low levels of depolarising noise. The behaviour of the hybrid solver is investigated for a baseline case with a Reynolds number of 1000, 7 harmonics and 100 grid cells, using the best performing algorithm in a noiseless setting with up to 108 samples per QFT. Residuals decrease until errors introduced by statistical uncertainty dominate the total error on the solution. Nevertheless, the hybrid solutions match the classical one closely, with RMS residuals as low as 10-4. The impact of several solver parameters on convergence and solution quality is also assessed, including the effect of noise. Although the latter rapidly degrades the solution, the solver achieves satisfactory approximations to the classical solution with 0.001% of depolarising noise. Without seeking to demonstrate a quantum advantage, this work offers valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges of quantum computing, helping readers understand how to design, implement and study quantum algorithms, as well as evaluate their impact in CFD applications.

TI Strain Relaxation of Si/SiGe Heterostructures by a Geometric Monte Carlo
   Approach
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Solid-state-based quantum technologies, such as electronic spin-qubits, constitute a leading approach to the realization of quantum computation. Electronic spin-qubits hosted in semiconductor heterostructures demand the highest crystalline quality, specifically with respect to the structure and formation of in-plane misfit dislocations (MDs). Here, the formation mechanisms of MD networks in such Si/SiGe heterostructures are investigated. For this purpose, strained Si layers on relaxed Si0.7Ge0.3 with thicknesses above the critical thickness are grown by molecular beam epitaxy to allow for the formation of MDs. MDs are mapped out by electron channeling contrast imaging and the experimental results are compared to MD networks calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations show that the ratio between the threading dislocation density (TDD) and the average length of MDs is a constant for a given set of parameters, here 2.9 for sufficiently large dislocation statistics and simultaneous extension of MDs. Further, the fractal dimension of the MD network determined by the box-counting method as an alternative quantity to characterize MD networks is introduced. This allows to infer the formation mechanism of MDs in real devices and hence the quantification of resulting average relaxation within the Si-quantum well.

TI Efficient Lindblad synthesis for noise model construction
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Effective noise models are essential for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of quantum systems, particularly in applications like quantum error mitigation and correction. However, even when noise processes are well-characterized in isolation, the effective noise channels impacting target quantum operations can differ significantly, as different gates experience noise in distinct ways. Here, we present a noise model construction method that builds an effective model from a Lindbladian description of the physical noise processes acting simultaneously to the desired gate operation. It employs the Magnus expansion and Dyson series, and can be utilized for both low-order symbolic and high-order numerical approximations of the noise channel of a multi-qubit quantum gate. We envision multiple use cases of our noise construction method, such as (i) computing the corresponding noise channel from a learned Lindbladian, and (ii) generating the noise channel starting with physically motivated Lindbladians for a given hardware architecture. In doing so, we close the gap between physical Lindbladians and operational-level noise model parameters. We demonstrate a strong agreement between our symbolic noise construction and full numerical Lindblad simulations for various two-qubit gates, in isolation and in three- and four-qubit scenarios, for a variety of physically motivated noise sources. Our symbolic construction provides a useful breakdown of how noise model parameters depend on the underlying physical noise parameters, which gives qualitative insight into the structure of errors. For instance, our theory provides insight into the interplay of Lindblad noise with the intended gate operations, and can predict how local Lindblad noise can effectively spread into multi-qubit error.

AB As the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS) continues to advance, there is an increased need for a quantum-smart workforce to address the needs of the growing quantum industry. As institutions begin to expand their course offerings, there is a unique opportunity for discipline-based education researchers to have an impact on the curricular and pedagogical choices being made in these courses. As a first step, it is necessary for education researchers to have a representative picture of what QIS education currently looks like. We reviewed recent course catalogues from a large sample of institutions in the United States looking for courses focused on QIS content. Our conservative analysis reveals that roughly a quarter of the institutions we reviewed offer QIS courses. While encouraging for such an emerging field, we found disparities in the types of institutions offering these courses as the vast majority were Doctoral-granting institutions. Additionally, we found that some classifications of minority serving institutions were much less likely to offer a QIS course (for example Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Predominantly Black Institutions), while Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander serving institutions were more likely than the national average to offer a QIS course. These disparities may lead to further racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparity in the future quantum workforce. We also found that there was no single department that offered a majority of the QIS courses, indicating that the best efforts to improve QIS education will need to consider the multi-disciplinary nature of the field of quantum information science.

TI Asymptotic security of discrete-modulation protocols for
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider discrete-modulation protocols for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) that employ a modulation constellation consisting of a finite number of coherent states and that use a homodyne-or a heterodyne-detection receiver. We establish a security proof for collective attacks in the asymptotic regime, and we provide a formula for an achievable secret-key rate. Previous works established security proofs for discrete-modulation CV-QKD protocols that use two or three coherent states. The main constituents of our approach include approximating a complex, isotropic Gaussian probability distribution by a finite-size Gauss-Hermite constellation, applying entropic continuity bounds, and leveraging previous security proofs for Gaussian-modulation protocols. As an application of our method, we calculate secret-key rates achievable over a lossy thermal bosonic channel. We show that the rates for discrete-modulation protocols approach the rates achieved by a Gaussian-modulation protocol as the constellation size is increased. For pure-loss channels, our results indicate that in the high-loss regime and for sufficiently large constellation size, the achievable key rates scale optimally, i.e., proportional to the channel's transmissivity.

TI Edge coloring lattice graphs
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We develop the theory of the edge coloring of lattice graphs. A central role is played by a necessary and sufficient condition for a proper edge coloring of a patch of a lattice graph to induce a proper edge coloring of the entire lattice graph by translation. Using this condition, we introduce a method that finds nearly minimal or minimal edge colorings of lattice graphs. For a nearly minimal edge coloring, the running time is O(mu D-2(4)), where mu is the number of edges in one cell (or "basis graph") of the lattice graph and D is the maximum distance between two cells connected by an edge. Crucially, this complexity depends only on local properties of the lattice graph, making it independent of the total graph size. As a result, the method applies even to infinite lattice graphs with finite maximum degree. For minimal edge coloring, we lack a rigorous upper bound on the running time, which we find poses no limitation in practice; we use the method to minimally edge color the meshes of all k-uniform tilings of the plane for k <= 6 with modest computational resources. We find that all these lattice graphs belong to Vizing class I. By relating edge colorings to quantum circuits, our work has direct applications in quantum computation, including quantum simulation of condensed matter, cluster-state preparation, error characterization, and error correction.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model for Stock Price Prediction Using
   Quantum-Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory
SO ENTROPY
AB The stock markets have become a popular topic within machine learning (ML) communities, with one particular application being stock price prediction. However, accurately predicting the stock market is a challenging task due to the various factors within financial markets. With the introduction of ML, prediction techniques have become more efficient but computationally demanding for classical computers. Given the rise of quantum computing (QC), which holds great promise for being exponentially faster than current classical computers, it is natural to explore ML within the QC domain. In this study, we leverage a hybrid quantum-classical ML approach to predict a company's stock price. We integrate classical long short-term memory (LSTM) with QC, resulting in a new variant called QLSTM. We initially validate the proposed QLSTM model by leveraging an IBM quantum simulator running on a classical computer, after which we conduct predictions using an IBM real quantum computer. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of our model using the root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy. Additionally, we perform a comparative analysis, evaluating the prediction performance of the QLSTM model against several other classical models. Further, we explore the impacts of hyperparameters on the QLSTM model to determine the best configuration. Our experimental results demonstrate that while the classical LSTM model achieved an RMSE of 0.0693 and a prediction accuracy of 0.8815, the QLSTM model exhibited superior performance, achieving values of 0.0602 and 0.9736, respectively. Furthermore, the QLSTM outperformed other classical models in both metrics.

TI Phase-locking an interferometer with single-photon detections
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report on a novel phase-locking technique for fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometers based on discrete single-photon detections, and demonstrate this in a setup. Our interferometer decodes relative-phase-encoded optical pulse pairs for quantum key distribution applications and requires no locking laser in addition to the weak received signal. Our new simple locking scheme is shown to produce an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic and achieve optimal phase noise for a given count rate. In case of wavelength drifts that arise during the reception of Doppler-shifted satellite signals, the arm-length difference gets continuously readjusted to keep the interferometer phase stable.

TI Anisotropic electron-nuclear interactions in a rotating quantum spin
   bath
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The interaction between a central qubit spin and a surrounding bath of spins is critical to spin-based solid-state quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Spin-bath interactions are typically strongly anisotropic, and rapid physical rotation has long been used in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance to simulate motional averaging of anisotropic interactions, such as dipolar coupling between nuclear spins. Here, we show that the interaction between electron spins of nitrogen-vacancy centers and a bath of C-13 nuclear spins in a diamond rotated at up to 300 000 rpm introduces decoherence into the system via frequency modulation of the nuclear spin Larmor precession. The presence of an off-axis magnetic field necessary for averaging of the dipolar coupling leads to a rotational dependence of the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction, which cannot be averaged out with experimentally achievable rotation speeds. Our findings offer new insights into the use of physical rotation for quantum control with implications for quantum systems having motional and rotational degrees of freedom that are not fixed.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hole-spin qubits in semiconductors represent a mature platform for quantum technological applications. Here we consider their use as quantum sensors, and specifically for inferring the presence and estimating the distance from the qubit of a remote charge. Different approaches are considered, based on the use of single or double quantum dots, ground and out-of-equilibrium states, Rabi and Ramsey measurements, and comparatively analyzed by means of the discrimination probability, and of the classical and quantum Fisher information. Detailed quantitative aspects result from the multiband character of the hole states, which we account for by means of the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian. Furthermore, general conclusions can be drawn on the relative efficiency of the above options, and analytical expressions are derived for the Fisher information of a generic qubit within the Rabi and Ramsey schemes.

Outlined are key steps necessary to fabricate arrays of on-demand quantum dot sources of entangled photon pairs; the principles are (1) foundry fabrication of arrays of isolated quantum dots, (2) generation of localized sub-surface shear strain in a semiconductor stack, (3) a cryogenic anvil cell, (4) channeling entangled photons into single-mode optical fibers, (5) unconditionally secure decryption key distribution over the fiber network, (6) resonant excitation of a Josephson tunnel junction qubits from classical bits, and (7) conversion of quantum nondemolition measurements of qubit states into a classical bit.

TI Single-tone pulse sequences and robust two-tone shaped pulses for three
   silicon spin qubits with always-on exchange
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum computation requires high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates on a scalable platform. Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform toward realization of this goal. In this paper we show how to perform single-qubit and controlled-Z (CZ) gates in a linear chain of three spin qubits with always-on exchange coupling, which is relevant for certain dot- and donor-based silicon devices. We also show how to make the CZ gate robust against both charge noise and pulse length error using a two-tone pulse shaping method. The robust pulse maintains a fidelity of 99.99% at 3.5% fluctuations in exchange or pulse amplitude, which is an improvement over the uncorrected pulses where this fidelity can only be maintained for fluctuations in exchange up to 2% or up to 0.2% in amplitude.

TI Qubit-controlled directional edge states in waveguide QED
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose an in-situ tunable chiral quantum system, composed of a quantum emitter coupled to a waveguide based on the Rice-Mele model (where we alternate both the on-site potentials and tunnel couplings between sites in the waveguide array). Specifically, we show that the chirality of photonic bound state, that emerges in the bandgap of the waveguide, depends only on the energy of the qubit; a parameter that is easy to tune in many artificial atoms. In contrast to previous proposals that have either shown imperfect chirality or fixed directionality, our waveguide quantum electrodynamics scheme achieves both perfect chirality and the capability to switch the directionality on demand with just one tunable element in the device. We also show that our model is easy to implement in both state-of-the-art superconducting circuit and quantum dot architectures. The results show technological promise in creating long-range couplers between qubits while maintaining, in principle, zero crosstalk.

TI Recent research progress of ultracold-atom quantum simulation of
   Fermi-Hubbard model
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Fermi-Hubbard model is a fundamental lattice model describing correlated electron systems in condensed matter physics and is closely related to high-temperature superconductivity. In recent years, cold-atom quantum simulations have become an important paradigm for studying the Fermi-Hubbard model, and advances in quantum many-body computations have contributed to our understanding of its fundamental properties. Notably, a recent ultracold-atom experiment achieving the well-known antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition in the three-dimensional (3D) Hubbard model represents a key step in quantum simulation, laying a foundation for exploring the link between the quantum magnetism and high-temperature superconductivity. In this paper, the experimental and theoretical research progress of Fermi-Hubbard model in 3D systems is reviewed, the development history and present status in this field are discussed, and the future development direction is also prospected. The paper is organized as follows. To begin with, recent progress of observing AFM phase transitions in the 3D Hubbard model is reviewed, focusing on an ultracold-atom experiment conducted by the research group at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Next, a theoretical introduction to the fundamental properties of the 3D Hubbard model is provided, in which prior theoretical studies is summarized, the current research status is outlined, and some unresolved or under-explored problems are discussed. In Section 3, the quantum simulation of the Hubbard model using ultracold atoms in optical lattices is discussed, and the basic principle, historical developments and key challenges are outlined. The USTC team overcame these challenges through innovative techniques such as atom cooling, large-scale uniform box traps, and precise measurements of the AFM structure factor. Their work successfully confirms the AFM phase transition via the critical scaling analysis. Finally, the significance of this achievement is emphasized, and the future research prospects of the 3D Hubbard model are discussed, including experimental studies on the doped regions and related theoretical benchmarks.

TI Classical and quantum computing of shear viscosity for (2+1) D SU(2)
   gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for (2 & thorn; 1)-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density eta s is consistent with a wellknown holographic result 4 pi 1 at several temperatures on a 4 x 4 honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at jmax = 12. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency rho xy & eth;omega) exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small. Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond jmax = 12 on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including jmax truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.

TI Sarnak's conjecture in quantum computing, cyclotomic unitary group
   coranks, and Shimura curves
SO JOURNAL OF THE LONDON MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY-SECOND SERIES
AB Sarnak's conjecture in quantum computing concerns when the groups PU2 and PSU(2 )over cyclotomic rings Z[zeta(n), 1/2] with zeta(n )= e(2 pi i/n), 4|n, are generated by the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set. We previously settled this using Euler-Poincare characteristics. A generalization of Sarnak's conjecture is to ask when these groups are generated by torsion elements. An obstruction to this is provided by the corank: a group G has corank G > 0 only if G$G$ is not generated by torsion elements. In this paper, we study the corank of these cyclotomic unitary groups in the families n = 2(s )n = 2(s) and n = 3<middle dot>2(s), n = {3<middle dot>2(s), n >= 8, by letting them act on Bruhat-Tits trees. The quotients by this action are finite graphs whose first Betti number is the corank of the group. Our main result is that for the families n = 2(s) and n = 3<middle dot>2(s), the corank grows doubly exponentially in s as s -> infinity; it is 0 precisely when n = 8, 12, 16, 24, and indeed, the cyclotomic unitary groups are generated by torsion elements (in fact by Clifford-cyclotomic gates) for these n. We give explicit lower bounds for the corank in two different ways. The first is to bound the isotropy subgroups in the action on the tree by explicit cyclotomy. The second is to relate our graphs to Shimura curves over F-n = Q(zeta(n))(+)via interchanging local invariants and applying a result of Selberg and Zograf. We show that the cyclotomy arguments give the stronger bounds. In a final section, we execute a program of Sarnak to show that our results for the n = 2(s) and n = 3<middle dot>2(s )families are sufficient to give a second proof of Sarnak's conjecture.

TI Superconducting Qubit Network as a Single Microwave Photon Detector for
   Galactic Axion Search
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Experimental search of galactic axions requires detection of single photons in the microwave range. We work on a novel approach to detect single microwave photons based on a coherent collective response of quantum states occurring in a superconducting qubit network (SQN) embedded in a low-dissipative superconducting resonator. We propose a two resonators detector configuration with two parallel resonators without common part and with separated input and output terminals. The device consists of a low-dissipative resonator with embedded SQN in which microwave photons arrive ("signal resonator"), and a transmission line for measuring the frequency dependent transmission coefficient demonstrating resonant drops at the qubit frequencies ("readout resonator"). In comparison with T-type three terminal device recently proposed and investigated by us, the device with two resonators with separated input and output terminals doesn't contain common part of both resonators and exclude an unwanted noise from measurement readout circuits to the signal resonator. A layout of two resonators four terminal SQN detectors containing 5 flux qubits weakly coupled to a low-dissipative signal and readout resonator was developed and optimized. The samples were fabricated by Manhattan Al-based technology with Nb resonator circuits. The SQN detector was experimentally tested in terms of microwave measurements of scattering parameters of both resonators and crosstalk properties. Comparison of experimental data with results of the simulations permits one to conclude that the electromagnetic conditions of the fundamental resonant peak of 8.5 GHz of both resonators aren't affected by the crosstalk phenomenon and their performances provided by the design remain not altered for correct device operation.

TI Observation of Discrete Charge States of a Coherent Two-Level System in
   a Superconducting Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report observations of discrete charge states of a coherent two-level system (TLS) that is strongly coupled to an offset-charge-sensitive superconducting transmon qubit. We measure an offset charge of 0.072e associated with the two TLS eigenstates, which have a transition frequency of 2.9 GHz and a relaxation time exceeding 3 ms. Combining measurements in the strong dispersive and resonant regime, we quantify both transverse and longitudinal coupling of the TLS-qubit interaction. We further perform joint tracking of TLS transitions and quasiparticle tunneling dynamics but find no intrinsic correlations. This Letter demonstrates microwave-frequency TLS as a source of low-frequency charge noise.

TI Phonon- and magnon-mediated decoherence of a magnonic qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the decoherence of magnonic qubits in small ferromagnetic insulators and compute the relaxation and dephasing rates due to magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. We combine a BlochRedfield description with Keldysh nonequilibrium field theory to find explicit expressions for the rates. For a quadratic dispersion and assuming a uniform mode defines the qubit, we find that decay into two phonons is the only allowed relaxation process at zero temperature. The low resonance frequency and heavy unit cell strongly suppress this process in yttrium iron garnet. We also find that the dephasing rate scales with the inverse of size and damping of the magnet and could become large for small and clean magnets. Our calculation thus provides additional insight into the viability of magnon-based quantum devices.

TI Scalable quantum optical tap for the distribution of quantum information
   encoded in entangled fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study two squeezed-state-dependent schemes of the quantum optical tap for information encoded in quantum-correlated fields from a two-mode entangled source. We find that, by using two independent squeezed beam splitters, the quantum information encoded in entangled dual beams can be divided into four parts without noise increase. We calculate the corresponding transfer coefficients to confirm that quantum optical tapping is achieved. As a variation to the original tapping schemes, we consider parametric amplifiers to replace beam splitters as tapping devices and find that they work equally well and have the advantage of tolerance to external losses. We also analyze the scalability of the schemes by cascading two outputs into the next stage and find that the output signals of the first stage can be further split noiselessly by the second stage. This shows that the scheme is cascadable and scalable for efficient quantum information distribution in an optical network.

TI Unmasking the polygamous nature of quantum nonlocality
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables. Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that if two observers violate a Bell inequality, then none of them can violate any Bell inequality with the third observer, a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to the nosignaling principle, and the inability of simultaneous violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here, we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the only monogamous situation exists for only three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for identifying quantum states, measurements, and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified polygamous inequalities enable any subset of (N - 1) observers to reveal nonlocality, which is also shown experimentally by measuring Bell-type correlations of six-photon Dicke states. Our findings may be exploited for multiparty quantum key distribution as well as simultaneous self-testing of multiple nodes in quantum networks.

TI Few-Copy Entanglement Detection in the Presence of Noise
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Although the realization of useful quantum computers poses significant challenges, swift progress in emerging quantum technologies is making this goal realistically approachable. In this context, one of the essential resources is quantum entanglement, which allows for quantum computations outperforming their classical counterparts. However, the task of entanglement detection is not always straightforward for several reasons. One of the main challenges is that standard methods rapidly become unfeasible when dealing with quantum states containing more than a few qubits. Typically, this is due to the fact that a vast number of measurements are needed on many copies of the state. Generally, it is not unusual to deal with a very limited number of state copies in experimental settings-in fact, this may be the case for many large quantum systems. In this article, an overview is provided of a probabilistic approach that enables high-confidence genuine multipartite entanglement detection using an exceptionally low number of state copies. Additionally, a study is presented that shows that this protocol remains efficient also in the presence of noise, thus confirming the practicality of the method for near-term quantum devices and its suitability for complex experimental settings.

TI Efficient qubit phase estimation using adaptive measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB Estimating correctly the quantum phase of a physical system is a central problem in quantum parameter estimation theory due to its wide range of applications from quantum metrology to cryptography. Ideally, the optimal quantum estimator is given by the so-called quantum Cramer-Rao bound, so any measurement strategy aims to obtain estimations as close as possible to it. However, more often than not, the current state-of-the-art methods to estimate quantum phases fail to reach this bound as they rely on maximum likelihood estimators of non-identifiable likelihood functions. In this work we thoroughly review various schemes for estimating the phase of a qubit, identifying the underlying problem which prohibits these methods to reach the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and propose a new adaptive scheme based on covariant measurements to circumvent this problem. Our findings are carefully checked by Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the method we propose is both mathematically and experimentally more realistic and more efficient than the methods currently available.

TI Novel Hybrid Quantum Architecture-Based Lung Cancer Detection Using
   Chest Radiograph and Computerized Tomography Images
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB Lung cancer, the second most common type of cancer worldwide, presents significant health challenges. Detecting this disease early is essential for improving patient outcomes and simplifying treatment. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework that combines deep learning (DL) with quantum computing to enhance the accuracy of lung cancer detection using chest radiographs (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) images. Our system utilizes pre-trained models for feature extraction and quantum circuits for classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various metrics. Not only does our system achieve an overall accuracy of 92.12%, it also excels in other crucial performance measures, such as sensitivity (94%), specificity (90%), F1-score (93%), and precision (92%). These results demonstrate that our hybrid approach can more accurately identify lung cancer signatures compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the incorporation of quantum computing enhances processing speed and scalability, making our system a promising tool for early lung cancer screening and diagnosis. By leveraging the strengths of quantum computing, our approach surpasses traditional methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and efficiency. This study highlights the potential of hybrid computational technologies to transform early cancer detection, paving the way for wider clinical applications and improved patient care outcomes.

TI Quantum information entropy of heavy mesons in the presence of a
   point-like defect
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Using Schrodinger's formalism, we investigate the quantum eigenstates of the heavy mesons trapped by a point-like defect and by Cornell's potential. One implements this defect to the model considering a spherical metric profile coupled to it. Furthermore, the Nikiforov-Uvarov method is applied to theory to study the quantum eigenstates of the heavy mesons. To calculate the quantum information entropy (QIE), one considers the wave functions that describe the charmonium and bottomonium states. To explore the QIE, we use the well-known Shannon's entropy formulated at the position and reciprocal space. The analysis of the QIE gives us relevant information about how the quantum information change with the variation of the point-like defect. Consequently, considering the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski (BBM) relation, we show how this defect influences the quarkonium position and momentum uncertainty measures.

AB Simulating quantum many-body systems is crucial for advancing physics but poses substantial challenges for classical computers. Quantum simulations overcome these limitations, with analog simulators offering unique advantages over digital methods, such as lower systematic errors and reduced circuit depth, making them efficient for studying complex quantum phenomena. However, unlike their digital counterparts, analog quantum simulations face significant limitations due to the absence of effective error mitigation techniques. This work introduces two novel error mitigation strategies-Hamiltonian reshaping and Hamiltonian rescaling-in analog quantum simulation for tasks like eigen-energy evaluation. Hamiltonian reshaping uses random unitary transformations to generate new Hamiltonians with identical eigenvalues but varied eigenstates, allowing error reduction through averaging. Hamiltonian rescaling mitigates errors by comparing eigenvalue estimates from energy-scaled Hamiltonians. Numerical calculations validate both methods, demonstrating their significant practical effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of analog quantum simulators.

   Applications with Sub-diffractional Spatial Resolution
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Quantum sensors find applications ranging from material science to biophysics. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been successfully implemented for measuring various types of signals. Optical NV center readout, routinely used in confocal microscopes, allows achieving high spatial resolution down to the diffraction limit. This work describes in detail the combined confocal-atomic-force microscope (confocal-AFM), which takes advantage of sharp AFM cantilevers, and shows its possible applications for nanoscale resolution. It demonstrates the sub-diffractional localization of NV centers with platinum-coated cantilevers and the ability to separately address optically unresolved sensors using cantilevers with ferromagnetic coating. The presented setup exhibits a lateral resolution of 13 nm, providing a tool for nanoscale quantum sensing.

TI Gatemon Qubit Based on a Thin InAs-Al Hybrid Nanowire
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We study a gate-tunable superconducting qubit (gatemon) based on a thin InAs-Al hybrid nanowire. Using a gate voltage to control its Josephson energy, the gatemon can reach the strong coupling regime to a microwave cavity. In the dispersive regime, we extract the energy relaxation time.. 1 similar to 0.56 similar to s and the dephasing time.. * 2 similar to 0.38 similar to s. Since thin InAs-Al nanowires can have fewer or single sub-band occupation and recent transport experiment shows the existence of nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks, our result holds relevancy for detecting Majorana zero modes in thin InAs-Al nanowires using circuit quantum electrodynamics.

TI Analysing quantum systems with randomised measurements
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Measurements with randomly chosen settings determine many important properties of quantum states without the need for a shared reference frame or calibration. They naturally emerge in the context of quantum communication and quantum computing when dealing with noisy environments, and allow the estimation of properties of complex quantum systems in an easy and efficient manner. In this review, we present the advancements made in utilising randomised measurements in various scenarios of quantum information science. We describe how to detect and characterise different forms of entanglement, including genuine multipartite entanglement and bound entanglement. Bell inequalities are discussed to be typically violated even with randomised measurements, especially for a growing number of particles and settings. Furthermore, we also present an overview on the estimation of non-linear functions of quantum states and shadow tomography from randomised measurements. Throughout the review, we complement the description of theoretical ideas by explaining key experiments. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Entanglement breaking channels, stochastic matrices, and primitivity
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We consider the important class of quantum operations (completely positive trace-preserving maps) called entanglement breaking channels. We show how every such channel induces stochastic matrix representations that have the same non-zero spectrum as the channel. We then use this to investigate when entanglement breaking channels are primitive, and prove this depends on primitivity of the matrix representations. This in turn leads to tight bounds on the primitivity index of entanglement breaking channels in terms of the primitivity index of the associated stochastic matrices. We also present examples and discuss open problems generated by the work. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Parameterised Quantum SVM with Data-Driven Entanglement for Zero-Day
   Exploit Detection
SO COMPUTERS
AB Zero-day attacks pose a persistent threat to computing infrastructure by exploiting previously unknown software vulnerabilities that evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs). To address this limitation, machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising approach for enhancing anomaly detection in network traffic. This study evaluates several ML models on a labeled network traffic dataset, with a focus on zero-day attack detection. Ensemble learning methods, particularly eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), achieved perfect classification, identifying all 6231 zero-day instances without false positives and maintaining efficient training and prediction times. While classical support vector machines (SVMs) performed modestly at 64% accuracy, their performance improved to 98% with the use of the borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE + edited nearest neighbours (SMOTEENN). To explore quantum-enhanced alternatives, a quantum SVM (QSVM) is implemented using three-qubit and four-qubit quantum circuits simulated on the aer_simulator_statevector. The QSVM achieved high accuracy (99.89%) and strong F1-scores (98.95%), indicating that nonlinear quantum feature maps (QFMs) can increase sensitivity to zero-day exploit patterns. Unlike prior work that applies standard quantum kernels, this study introduces a parameterised quantum feature encoding scheme, where each classical feature is mapped using a nonlinear function tuned by a set of learnable parameters. Additionally, a sparse entanglement topology is derived from mutual information between features, ensuring a compact and data-adaptive quantum circuit that aligns with the resource constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our contribution lies in formalising a quantum circuit design that enables scalable, expressive, and generalisable quantum architectures tailored for zero-day attack detection. This extends beyond conventional usage of QSVMs by offering a principled approach to quantum circuit construction for cybersecurity. While these findings are obtained via noiseless simulation, they provide a theoretical proof of concept for the viability of quantum ML (QML) in network security. Future work should target real quantum hardware execution and adaptive sampling techniques to assess robustness under decoherence, gate errors, and dynamic threat environments.

TI Bespoke mirror fabrication for quantum simulation with light in
   open-access microcavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, we use focused ion beam (FIB) milling to generate custom mirror shapes for quantum simulation in optical microcavities. In the paraxial limit, light in multimode optical microcavities follows an equation of motion which is equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, with the surface topography of the mirrors playing the role of the potential energy landscape. FIB milling allows us to engineer a wide variety of trapping potentials for microcavity light, through exquisite control over the mirror topography, including 2D box, 1D waveguide, and Mexican hat potentials. The 2D box potentials are sufficiently flat over tens of microns, that the optical modes of the cavity, found by solving Schrodinger's equation on the measured cavity topography, are standing-wave modes of the box, rather than localised to deviations. The predicted scattering loss due to surface roughness measured using atomic force microscopy is found to be 177 parts per million, which corresponds to a cavity finesse of 2.2 x 10(4) once other losses have been taken into account. Spectra from dye-filled microcavities formed using these features show thermalised light in flat 2D potentials close to dye resonance, and spectrally-resolved cavity modes at the predicted frequencies for elliptical potentials. These results also represent a first step towards realising superfluid light and quantum simulation in arbitrary-shaped optical microcavities using FIB milling.

TI Graph-Theoretic Approach for Self-Testing in Bell Scenarios
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Self-testing is a technology to certify states and measurements using only the statistics of the exper-iment. Self-testing is possible if some extremal points in the set BQ of quantum correlations for a Bell experiment are achieved, up to isometries, with specific states and measurements. However, BQ is diffi-cult to characterize, so it is also difficult to prove whether or not a given matrix of quantum correlations allows for self-testing. Here, we show how some tools from graph theory can help to address this prob-lem. We observe that BQ is strictly contained in an easy-to-characterize set associated with a graph, 0(G). Therefore, whenever the optimum over BQ and the optimum over 0(G) coincide, self-testing can be demonstrated by simply proving self-testability with 0(G). Interestingly, these maxima coincide for the quantum correlations that maximally violate many families of Bell-like inequalities. Therefore, we can apply this approach to prove the self-testability of many quantum correlations, including some that are not previously known to allow for self-testing. In addition, this approach connects self-testing to some open problems in discrete mathematics. We use this connection to prove a conjecture [M. Araujo et al., Phys. Rev. A, 88, 022118 (2013)] about the closed-form expression of the Lovasz theta number for a family of graphs called the Mobius ladders. Although there are a few remaining issues (e.g., in some cases, the proof requires the assumption that measurements are of rank 1), this approach provides an alternative method to self-testing and draws interesting connections between quantum mechanics and discrete mathematics.

TI Optimizing Resource Efficiencies for Scalable Full-Stack Quantum
   Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In the race to build scalable quantum computers, minimizing the resource consumption of their full stack to achieve a target performance becomes crucial. It mandates a synergy of fundamental physics and engineering: the former for the microscopic aspects of computing performance and the latter for the macroscopic resource consumption. For this, we propose a holistic methodology dubbed metric noise resource (MNR) that is able to quantify and optimize all aspects of the full-stack quantum computer, bringing together concepts from quantum physics (e.g., noise on the qubits), quantum information (e.g., computing architecture and type of error correction), and enabling technologies (e.g., cryogenics, control electronics, and wiring). This holistic approach allows us to define and study resource efficiencies as ratios between performance and resource cost. As a proof of concept, we use MNR to minimize the power consumption of a full-stack quantum computer, performing noisy or fault-tolerant computing with a target performance for the task of interest. Comparing this with a classical processor performing the same task, we identify a quantum energy advantage in regimes of parameters distinct from the commonly considered quantum computational advantage. This provides a previously overlooked practical argument for building quantum computers. While our illustration uses highly idealized parameters inspired by superconducting qubits with concatenated error correction, the methodology is universal-it applies to other qubits and error-correcting codes-and it provides experimenters with guidelines to build energy-efficient quantum computers. In some regimes of high energy consumption, it can reduce this consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, our methodology lays the theoretical foundation for resource-efficient quantum technologies.

TI Developing a Predictive Platform for Salmonella Antimicrobial
   Resistance Based on a Large Language Model and Quantum Computing
SO ENGINEERING
AB As a common foodborne pathogen, Salmonella poses risks to public health safety, common given the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains. However, there is currently a lack of systematic platforms based on large language models (LLMs) for Salmonella resistance prediction, data presentation, and data sharing. To overcome this issue, we firstly propose a two-step feature-selection process based on the chisquare test and conditional mutual information maximization to find the key Salmonella resistance genes in a pan-genomics analysis and develop an LLM-based Salmonella antimicrobial-resistance predictive (SARPLLM) algorithm to achieve accurate antimicrobial-resistance prediction, based on Qwen2 LLM and low-rank adaptation. Secondly, we optimize the time complexity to compute the sample distance from the linear to logarithmic level by constructing a quantum data augmentation algorithm denoted as QSMOTEN. Thirdly, we build up a user-friendly Salmonella antimicrobial-resistance predictive online platform based on knowledge graphs, which not only facilitates online resistance prediction for users but also visualizes the pan-genomics analysis results of the Salmonella datasets.

TI Security bounds for decoy-state quantum key distribution with arbitrary
   photon-number statistics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The decoy-state method is a standard enhancement to quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that has enabled countless QKD experiments with inexpensive light sources. However, new technological advancements might require further theoretical study of this technique. In particular, the decoy-state method is typically described under the assumption of a Poisson statistical distribution for the number of photons in each QKD pulse. This is a practical choice, because prepare-and-measure QKD is often implemented with attenuated lasers, which produce exactly this distribution. However, sources that do not meet this assumption are not guaranteed to be compatible with decoy states. In this work, we provide security bounds for decoy-state QKD using a source with an arbitrary photon emission statistic. We consider both the asymptotic limit of infinite key and the finite-size scenario, and evaluate two common decoy-state schemes: the vacuum + weak and one-decoy protocols. We numerically evaluate the performance of the bounds, comparing three realistic statistical distributions (Poisson, thermal, and binomial), showing that they are all viable options for QKD.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with passive
   time-dependent source side channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB While measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two trusted parties to establish a shared secret key from a distance without needing to trust a central detection node, their quantum sources must be well characterized, with side channels at the source posing the greatest loophole to the protocol's security. In this paper, we identify a time-dependent side channel in a common polarization-based QKD source that employs a Faraday mirror for phase stabilization. We apply a recently developed numerical proof technique [Phys. Rev. A 99, 062332 (2019)] to quantify the sensitivity of the secret key rate to the quantum optical model for the side channel, and to develop strategies to mitigate the information leakage. In particular, we find that the MDI three-state and BB84 protocols, while yielding the same key rate under ideal conditions, have diverging results in the presence of a side channel, with BB84 proving more advantageous. While we consider only a representative case example, we expect the strategies developed and key rate analysis method to be broadly applicable to other leaky sources.

TI Experimental decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution
   through a turbulent channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) in turbulent conditions, scattering and beam wandering cause intensity fluctuations which decrease the detected signal-to-noise ratio. This effect can be mitigated by rejecting received bits when the channel's transmittance is below a threshold. Thus, the overall error rate is reduced and the secure key rate increases despite the deletion of bits. In this work, we implement recently proposed selection methods focusing on the prefixed-threshold real-time selection (P-RTS) where a cutoff can be chosen prior to data collection and independently of the transmittance distribution. We perform finite-size decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 QKD in a laboratory setting where we simulate the atmospheric turbulence using an acousto-optical modulator. We show that P-RTS can yield considerably higher secure key rates for a wide range of the atmospheric channel parameters. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the P-RTS method for a realistically finite sample size. We demonstrate that a near-optimal selection threshold can be predetermined even with imperfect knowledge of the channel transmittance distribution parameters.

TI Finite-size security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution
   with digital signal processing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In comparison to conventional discrete-variable (DV) quantum key distribution (QKD), continuous-variable (CV) QKD with homodyne/heterodyne measurements has distinct advantages of lower-cost implementation and affinity to wavelength division multiplexing. On the other hand, its continuous nature makes it harder to accommodate to practical signal processing, which is always discretized, leading to lack of complete security proofs so far. Here we propose a tight and robust method of estimating fidelity of an optical pulse to a coherent state via heterodyne measurements. We then construct a binary phase modulated CV-QKD protocol and prove its security in the finite-key-size regime against general coherent attacks, based on proof techniques of DV QKD. Such a complete security proof is indispensable for exploiting the benefits of CV QKD. While continuous-variable QKD presents many experimental advantages, a full security proof that addresses the most general attacks and digitized signals in the finite-size regime has so far been lacking. Here, the authors fill this gap in the case of a protocol with a binary phase modulation.

TI Quantum key distribution: a survey on current vulnerability trends and
   potential implementation risks
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that enables secure private key exchange between geographically distant parties over an insecure channel, protecting confidentiality against potential eavesdroppers. QKD has evolved significantly since its inception with the BB84 protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984. Its theoretical foundation relies on quantum physics, particularly the uncertainty principle, the no-cloning theorem, and particle entanglement, which ensures its information-theoretic security when combined with the one-time-pad cryptographic algorithm. However, certain security loopholes persist in terms of practical implementation in commercial devices. Some vulnerabilities are associated with side-channel vectors linked to commonly used optical subcomponents, while others are more related to how existing protocols handle encoding and communication pipelines. In this work, we aim to comprehensively study the current state of security loopholes affecting QKD technology in commercial devices. We also provide a concise overview of the existing types of QKD implementations. Additionally, we offer insights into current trends and vulnerability countermeasures, paving the way for future research and novel mechanisms to enhance the implementation security of commercial QKD devices.

TI Driven Radical Motion Enhances Cryptochrome Magnetoreception: Toward
   Live Quantum Sensing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The mechanism underlying magnetoreception has long eluded explanation. A popular hypothesis attributes this sense to the quantum coherent spin dynamics and spin selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the protein cryptochrome. However, concerns about the validity of the hypothesis have been raised because unavoidable inter radical interactions, such as the strong electron-electron dipolar coupling, appear to suppress its sensitivity. We demonstrate that sensitivity can be restored by driving the spin system through a modulation of the inter-radical distance. It is shown that this dynamical process markedly enhances geomagnetic field sensitivity in strongly coupled radical pairs via Landau- Zener-Stu''ckelberg-Majorana transitions between singlet and triplet states. These findings suggest that a "live" harmonically driven magnetoreceptor can be more sensitive than its "dead" static counterpart.

TI Quantum counterfactuality with identical particles
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum self-interference enables the counterfactual transmission of information, whereby the transmitted bits involve no particles traveling through the channel. In this work, we show how counterfactuality can be realized even when the self-interference is replaced by interference between identical particles. Interestingly, the facet of indistinguishability called forth here is associated with first-order coherence, and is different from the usual notion of indistinguishability associated with the (anti-)commutation relations of mode operators. From an experimental perspective, the simplest implementation of the proposed idea can be realized by slight modifications to existing protocols for differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution or interaction-free measurement.

TI Quantum superposing algorithm for quantum encoding
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Efficient encoding of classical data into quantum state-currently referred to as quantum encoding-holds crucial significance in quantum computation. For finite-size databases and qubit registers, a common strategy of the quantum encoding entails establishing a classical mapping that correlates machine-recognizable data addresses with qubit indices that are subsequently superposed. Herein, the most imperative lies in casting an algorithm for generating the superposition of any given number of qubit indices. This algorithm is formally known as quantum superposing algorithm. In this work, we present an efficient quantum superposing algorithm, affirming its effectiveness and superior computational performance in a practical quantum encoding scenario. Our theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate a substantial enhancement in computational efficiency compared to existing algorithms. Notably, our algorithm has a maximum of 2n - 3 controlled-not (CNOT) counts, representing the most optimized result to date.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network for Detection and
   Identification of Power Quality Disturbance
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Power quality disturbances (PQDs) pose significant challenges to modern power systems, necessitating precise detection and identification to mitigate their impacts and enhance grid robustness. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network model (PQDs-QC-CNN) for detecting and identifying power quality disturbances with high efficiency. The model employs a hierarchical framework consisting of quantum convolutional layers, fully connected layers and softmax regression, which can effectively extract multiscale features from disturbance data while mitigating overfitting. Utilising quantum bits, the model achieves a time complexity of and a space complexity of , ensuring scalability and efficiency. By conducting experiments on the datasets generated in compliance with IEEE Std 1159-2019, the results show a 100% detection accuracy and 99.56% identification accuracy, even with minimal quantum bits and simple configurations. Additionally, the model demonstrates robust noise resistance, maintaining approximately 98% identification accuracy across various noise scenarios. PQDs-QC-CNN not only shows promise for power system applications but also explores new avenues for quantum algorithm integration in smart grid technologies.

However, as there is yet no rigorous proof of convergence for the QAOA, we provide one in this paper. The proof involves retracing the connection between the quantum adiabatic algorithm and the QAOA, and naturally suggests a refined definition of the 'phase separator' and 'mixer' keywords.

TI Mid-Circuit Cavity Measurement in a Neutral Atom Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Subsystem readout during a quantum process, or mid-circuit measurement, is crucial for error correction in quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Ideal mid-circuit measurement should be faster than the decoherence of the system, high-fidelity, and nondestructive to the unmeasured qubits. Here, we use a strongly coupled optical cavity to read out the state of a single tweezer-trapped 87Rb atom within a small tweezer array. Measuring either atomic fluorescence or the transmission of light through the cavity, we detect both the presence and the state of an atom in the tweezer, within only tens of microseconds, with state preparation and measurement infidelities of roughly 0.5% and atom loss probabilities of around 1%. Using a two-tweezer system, we find measurement on one atom within the cavity causes no observable hyperfine -state decoherence on a second atom located tens of microns from the cavity volume. This high-fidelity mid -circuit readout method is a substantial step toward quantum error correction in neutral atom arrays.

TI Composable finite-size effects in free-space continuous-variable
   quantum-key-distribution systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Free-space channels provide the possibility of establishing continuous-variable quantum key distribution in global communication networks. However, the fluctuating nature of transmissivity in these channels introduces an extra noise which reduces the achievable secret key rate. We consider two classical postprocessing strategies, postselection of high-transmissivity data and data clusterization, to reduce the fluctuation-induced noise of the channel. We undertake the investigation of such strategies utilizing a composable security proof in a realistic finite-size regime against both collective and individual attacks. We also present an efficient parameter estimation approach to estimate the effective Gaussian parameters over the postselected data or the clustered data. Although the composable finite-size effects become more significant with the postselection and clusterization both reducing the size of the data, our results show that these strategies are still able to enhance the finite-size key rate against both individual and collective attacks with a remarkable improvement against collective attacks, even moving the protocol from an insecure regime to a secure regime under certain conditions.

TI Graph-state representation of the tonic code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Given their potential for fault-tolerant operations, topological quantum states are currently a focus of intense activity. Of particular interest are topological quantum error correction codes, such as the surface and planar stabilizer codes that are equivalent to the celebrated toric code. While every stabilizer state maps to a graph state under local Clifford operations, the graphs associated with topological stabilizer codes remain unknown. We show that the toric code graph is composed of only two kinds of subgraphs: star graphs (which encode Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states) and half graphs. The topological order is identified with the existence of multiple star graphs, which reveals a connection between the repetition and toric codes. The graph structure readily yields a log-depth quantum circuit for state preparation, assuming geometrically nonlocal gates, which can be reduced to a constant depth including ancillae and measurements at the cost of increasing the circuit width. The results provide a graph-theoretic framework for the investigation of topological order and the development of topological error correction codes.

TI Multi-Layered QCA Content-Addressable Memory Cell Using Low-Power
   Electronic Interaction for AI-Based Data Learning and Retrieval in
   Quantum Computing Environment
SO SENSORS
AB In this study, we propose a quantum structure of an associative memory cell for effective data learning based on artificial intelligence. For effective learning of related data, content-based retrieval and storage rather than memory address is essential. A content-addressable memory (CAM), which is an efficient memory cell structure for this purpose, in a quantum computing environment, is designed based on quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA). A CAM cell is composed of a memory unit that stores information, a match unit that performs a search, and a structure, using an XOR gate or an XNOR gate in the match unit, that shows good performance. In this study, we designed an XNOR gate with a multilayer structure based on electron interactions and proposed a QCA-based CAM cell using it. The area and time efficiency are verified through a simulation using QCADesigner, and the quantum cost of the proposed XOR gate and CAM cell were reduced by at least 70% and 15%, respectively, when compared to the latest research. In addition, we physically proved the potential energy owing to the interaction between the electrons inside the QCA cell. We also proposed an additional CAM circuit targeting the reduction in energy dissipation that overcomes the best available designs. The simulation and calculation of power dissipation are performed by QCADesigner-E and it is confirmed that more than 27% is reduced.

In this work, we develop a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on quantum computers. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfest trajectories and Monte Carlo sampling of their thermal distribution. We test the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator, and the results match quantitatively with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and can be extended to anharmonic system-bath interactions and multistate systems.

TI Noiseless linear amplification in quantum target detection using
   Gaussian states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum target detection aims to utilise quantum technologies to achieve performances in target detection not possible through purely classical means. Quantum illumination is an example of this, based on signal-idler entanglement, promising a potential 6 dB advantage in error exponent over its optimal classical counterpart. So far, receiver designs achieving this optimal reception remain elusive with many proposals based on Gaussian processes appearing unable to utilise quantum information contained within Gaussian state sources. This paper considers the employment of a noiseless linear amplifier at the detection stage of a quantum illumination-based quantum target detection protocol. Such a non-Gaussian amplifier offers a means of probabilistically amplifying an incoming signal without the addition of noise. Considering symmetric hypothesis testing, the quantum Chernoff bound is derived and limits on detection error probability is analysed for both the two-mode squeezed vacuum state and the coherent state classical benchmark. Our findings show that in such a scheme the potential quantum advantage is amplified even in regimes where quantum illumination alone offers no advantage, thereby extending its potential use. The same cannot be said for coherent states, whose performances are generally bounded by that without amplification.

AB We considered a nanoelectromechanical system consisting of a movable Cooper-pair box qubit, which is subject to an electrostatic field, and coupled to the two bulk superconductors via tunneling processes. We suggest that qubit dynamics is related to that of a quantum oscillator and demonstrate that a bias voltage applied between superconductors generates states represented by the entanglement of qubit states and coherent states of the oscillator if certain resonant conditions are fulfilled. It is shown that a structure of this entanglement may be controlled by the bias voltage in a way that gives rise to the entanglement incorporating so-called cat-states-the superposition of coherent states. We characterize the formation and development of such states analyzing the entropy of entanglement and corresponding Wigner function. The experimentally feasible detection of the effect by measuring the average current is also considered.

The present thought experiment describes a measurement to determine the localization of an electron inside a box. The present work assumes that the determination of information (about the localization of the electron) induces a wave-function collapse.

TI Model for optimizing quantum key distribution with continuous-wave
   pumped entangled-photon sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows unconditionally secure communication based on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than assumptions about computational hardness. Optimizing the operation parameters of a given QKD implementation is indispensable in order to achieve high secure key rates. So far, there exists no model that accurately describes entanglement-based QKD with continuous-wave pump lasers. We analyze the underlying mechanisms for QKD with temporally uniform pair-creation probabilities and develop a simple but accurate model to calculate optimal tradeoffs for maximal secure key rates. In particular, we find an optimization strategy of the source brightness for given losses and detection-time resolution. All experimental parameters utilized by the model can be inferred directly in standard QKD implementations, and no additional assessment of device performance is required. Comparison with experimental data shows the validity of our model. Our results yield a tool to determine optimal operation parameters for already existing QKD systems, to plan a full QKD implementation from scratch, and to determine fundamental key rate and distance limits of given connections.

It can accommodate a large class of models with modified quantum wave dynamics, correlations beyond entanglement or general probabilistic postulates.

TI Dissipative stabilization of high-dimensional GHZ states for neutral
   atoms
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement characterizes the entanglement of quantum systems within a larger Hilbert space, introducing more intricate and complex correlations among the entangled particles' states. The high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, symbolic of this type of entanglement, is of significant importance in various quantum information processing applications. This study proposes integrating a neutral atom platform with quantum reservoir engineering to generate a high-dimensional GHZ state deterministically. Leveraging the advantages of neutral atoms in a modified unconventional Rydberg pumping mechanism, combined with controlled dissipation, we achieve a three-dimensional GHZ state with a fidelity surpassing 99% through multiple pump and dissipation cycles. This innovative approach paves the way for experimentally feasible, deterministic preparation of high-dimensional GHZ states in Rydberg atom systems, thereby advancing the capabilities of quantum information processing.

TI Tomography of entangling two-qubit logic operations in exchange-coupled
   donor electron spin qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal one- and two-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity 91.3 +/- 3.0%, and concurrence 0.87 +/- 0.05. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.
   Donors spins in silicon are coherent, high-performance qubits, but scale-up has been challenging. Here the authors present the first experimental demonstration of exchange-based, entangling two qubit gates between electrons bound to 31P donors in Si.

TI Weak measurement as a tool for characterizing coherence and quantum
   correlations in bipartite systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this article, we study quantum coherence of bipartite state from the perspective of weak measurement, which generalizes the notion of coherence relative to measurement. This is being illustrated by computing coherence for the well-known Bell diagonal and Werner states. Further, we have expanded the notion of coherence to encompass correlations, exploring its connections with other quantifications of nonlocality. We have determined that this coherence measure can be perceived as a generalized version of the Wigner-Yanese skew information measure and several other nonlocal measures. As a natural extension, we introduce uncertainty relations within the context of weak measurements. Additionally, we propose a novel form of variance by considering the weak value of an observable within a comprehensive framework.

TI Heralded single-photon source based on an ensemble of Raman-active
   molecules
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Light with high mutual correlations at different frequencies can be used to create heralded single-photon sources, which may serve as the basic elements of existing quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation schemes. One of the important examples in natural systems of light with high mutual correlations is the light produced by spontaneousRaman scattering on an ensemble of molecules. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of usingRaman light to create a heralded single-photon source. We show that when using Stokes scattered light for postselection of anti-Stokes scattered light, the latter may possess single-photon properties. We analyze the influence of various negative factors on the characteristics of such a heralded single-photon source, which include a time delay between Stokes and anti-Stokes photons, the finiteness of the correlation radius of an external source, and background radiation. We show that the low value of the second-order autocorrelation function of the single-photon source is preserved even when the flow of uncorrelated photons exceeds the flow of correlated photons in scattered Raman light by an order of magnitude.

TI Fastest Local Entanglement Scrambler, Multistage Thermalization, and a
   Non-Hermitian Phantom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We study random quantum circuits and their rate of producing bipartite entanglement, specifically with respect to the choice of 2-qubit gates and the order (protocol) in which these are applied. The problem is mapped to a Markovian process, and we prove that there are large spectral equivalence classes-different configurations have the same spectrum. Optimal gates and the protocol that generate entanglement with the fastest theoretically possible rate are identified. Relaxation towards the asymptotic thermal entanglement proceeds via a series of phase transitions in the local relaxation rate, which is a consequence of nonHermiticity. In particular, non-Hermiticity can cause the rate to be either faster or, even more interestingly, slower than predicted by the matrix eigenvalue gap. This result is caused by expansion coefficients that grow exponentially with system size, resulting in a "phantom" eigenvalue and is due to nonorthogonality of non-Hermitian eigenvectors. We numerically demonstrate that the phenomenon also occurs in random circuits with nonoptimal generic gates, random U(4) gates, and also without spatial or temporal randomness, suggesting that it could be of wide importance in other non-Hermitian settings, including correlations.

TI Quantum-enhanced gradient boosting neural networks for optimizing PFOS
   removal with nanofiltration membranes
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB Nanofiltration technology stands as an efficient means for eradicating perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) from aqueous solutions; however, its efficacy is contingent upon an array of operational variables. Quantum computing, distinguished by its unparalleled parallel processing prowess and formidable analytical skills, has emerged as a revolutionary tool across diverse scientific fields, catalyzing novel discoveries. Nevertheless, the potential for leveraging quantum computing to optimize membrane filtration performance, specifically for PFOS removal, remains largely unexplored terrain. This groundbreaking study delves into the mechanics of PFOS removal, utilizing quantum computing to forecast membrane filtration performance. By seamlessly amalgamating classical algorithms, we have formulated a Quantum-Enhanced Gradient Boosting Neural Network (QGBNN). The experimental outcomes showcase that the QGBNN model attains an impressive determination coefficient of 0.9929 and a minimal root mean square error of 2.1739. A comprehensive analysis of the importance of the features highlighted that pore size and MWCO played a key role in influencing the removal performance of the membrane, while cations (especially divalent and trivalent cations) significantly improved the removal efficiency (with a shap value of about 30). Furthermore, membrane type, pH level, and pressure are crucial determinants of removal effectiveness. The interpretability analysis further validates the study's insights into the mechanism underlying PFOS removal by nanofiltration membranes. The remarkable success of the QGBNN model underscores the immense potential of quantum computing in propelling advancements in membrane filtration technologies.

TI Local Control of a Single Nitrogen-Vacancy Center by Nanoscale
   Engineered Magnetic Domain Wall Motion
SO ACS NANO
AB Effective control and readout of qubits form the technical foundation of next-generation, transformative quantum information sciences and technologies. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, an intrinsic three-level spin system, is naturally relevant in this context due to its excellent quantum coherence, high fidelity of operations, and remarkable functionality over a broad range of experimental conditions. It is an active contender for the development and implementation of cutting-edge quantum technologies. Here, we report magnetic domain wall motion driven local control and measurements of the NV spin properties. By engineering the local magnetic field environment of an NV center via nanoscale reconfigurable domain wall motion, we show that NV photoluminescence, spin level energies, and coherence time can be reliably controlled and correlated to the magneto-transport response of a magnetic device. Our results highlight the electrically tunable dipole interaction between NV centers and nanoscale magnetic structures, providing an attractive platform to realize interactive information transfer between spin qubits and nonvolatile magnetic memory in hybrid quantum spintronic systems.

TI Cryogenic in-memory computing using magnetic topological insulators
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Machine learning algorithms have proven to be effective for essential quantum computation tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum control. Efficient hardware implementation of these algorithms at cryogenic temperatures is essential. Here we utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic topological memristors) and introduce a cryogenic in-memory computing scheme based on the coexistence of a chiral edge state and a topological surface state. The memristive switching and reading of the giant anomalous Hall effect exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability and low stochasticity. We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies. Our results not only showcase a new application of chiral edge states but also may inspire further topological quantum-physics-based novel computing schemes.

TI Josephson Junction-Based Compact Notch Purcell Filters for
   Superconducting Qubit Readout
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB High-fidelity qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) requires suppressing relaxation due to the Purcell effect, typically achieved through the use of Purcell filters. A key limitation of existing Purcell filter implementations is their large footprint. In this work, we propose a compact notch Purcell filter based on a Josephson junction chain embedded in series with the readout resonator. We analytically derive the conditions for operation in the dispersive regime using a lumped-element model, and validate the concept through an example design that is analyzed through both lumped-element and full electromagnetic simulations. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves a Purcell decay time exceeding 1 ms, with a dispersive shift and resonator linewidth of approximately 10 MHz, enabling fast, high signal-to-noise ratio readout. As typical of notch filters, also this solution exhibits an inherent parameter sensitivity. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUIDs) can be used for postfabrication frequency tuning, at the expense of an increase of the number of required control lines.

TI Error Suppression for Arbitrary-Size Black Box Quantum Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Efficient suppression of errors without full error correction is crucial for applications with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Error mitigation allows us to suppress errors in extracting expectation values without the need for any error correction code, but its applications are limited to estimating expectation values, and cannot provide us with high-fidelity quantum operations acting on arbitrary quantum states. To address this challenge, we propose to use error filtration (EF) for gate-based quantum computation, as a practical error suppression scheme without resorting to full quantum error correction. The result is a general-purpose error suppression protocol where the resources required to suppress errors scale independently of the size of the quantum operation, and does not require any logical encoding of the operation. The protocol provides error suppression whenever an error hierarchy is respected-that is, when the ancillary controlled -SWAP operations are less noisy than the operation to be corrected. We further analyze the application of EF to quantum random access memory, where EF offers hardware-efficient error suppression.

TI Simplified intensity- and phase-modulated transmitter for modulator-free
   decoy-state quantum key distribution
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows secret key exchange between two users with unconditional security. For QKD to be widely deployed, low cost and compactness are crucial requirements alongside high performance. Currently, the majority of QKD systems demonstrated rely on bulk intensity and phase modulators to generate optical pulses with precisely defined amplitude and relative phase difference-i.e., to encode information as signal states and decoy states. However, these modulators are expensive and bulky, thereby limiting the compactness of QKD systems. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a novel optical transmitter design to overcome this disadvantage by generating intensity- and phase-tunable pulses at GHz clock speeds. Our design removes the need for bulk modulators by employing directly modulated lasers in combination with optical injection locking and coherent interference. This scheme is, therefore, well suited to miniaturization and photonic integration, and we implement a proof-of-principle QKD demonstration to highlight potential applications.

TI Topological Phase Transitions in a Constrained Two-Qubit Quantum Control

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In optimal quantum control, control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) indicate sharp changes occurring in the set of optimal protocols, as a physical model parameter is varied. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration. We demonstrate how topological CLPTs can be detected in modern-day experiments.

TI Enhanced feature encoding and classification on distributed quantum
   hardware
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The steady progress of quantum hardware is motivating the search for novel quantum algorithm optimization strategies for near-term, real-world applications. In this study, we propose a novel feature map optimization strategy for quantum support vector machines (QSVMs), designed to enhance binary classification while taking into account backend-specific parameters, including qubit connectivity, native gate sets, and circuit depth, which are critical factors in noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. The dataset we utilised belongs to the neutrino physics domain, with applications in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. A key contribution of this work is the parallelization of the classification task to commercially available superconducting quantum hardware to speed up the genetic search processes. The study was carried out by partitioning each quantum processing unit (QPU) into several sub-units with the same topology to implement individual QSVM instances. We conducted parallelization experiments with three IBM backends with more than 100 qubits, ranking the sub-units based on their susceptibility to noise. Data-driven simulations show how, under certain restrictions, parallelized genetic optimization can occur with the tested devices when retaining the top 20% ranked sub-units in the QPU.

AB Silicon carbide (SiC) hosts various color centers with emission lines from visible to near-infrared, with promising applications in quantum communication. Metasurfaces made using SiC can enhance the emission rate of inherent color centers to achieve on-demand single photon emission with a high emission rate. This is possible by engineering the amplitude and phase of the excited multipolar scattering moments in metasurfaces. The numerical simulations and analytical calculations are used to study the emission rate enhancement from an embedded single silicon vacancy (V-Si(-)) center in SiC metasurface. The optimized metasurface balances multipolar moments at the zero-phonon line wavelength of 862 nm with 40 times field intensity confinement. The confinement provides substantial emission rate enhancement for the V-Si(-) center, making it a bright single photon emitter at 862 nm. The significant emission enhancement offers new insights into the metasurface to achieve on-demand single-photon sources and efficient spin-photon interfaces.
   Manipulating the quantum states of a single emitter using metasurfaces is envisioned to revolutionize quantum technology. The generation of bright single photon emission is reported with an enhanced emission rate from a single silicon-vacancy center in a SiC metasurface by balancing the multi-polar moments at the zero-phonon line wavelength of 862 nm, which is useful for an efficient spin-photon interface.image

TI Classifying Two-Body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research has been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.

TI Bridging physical intuition and hardware efficiency for correlated
   electronic states: the local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz for
   electronic structure
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB A prominent goal in quantum chemistry is to solve the molecular electronic structure problem for ground state energy with high accuracy. While classical quantum chemistry is a relatively mature field, the accurate and scalable prediction of strongly correlated states found, e.g., in bond breaking and polynuclear transition metal compounds remains an open problem. Within the context of a variational quantum eigensolver, we propose a new family of ansatzes which provides a more physically appropriate description of strongly correlated electrons than a unitary coupled cluster with single and double excitations (qUCCSD), with vastly reduced quantum resource requirements. Specifically, we present a set of local approximations to the unitary cluster Jastrow wavefunction motivated by Hubbard physics. As in the case of qUCCSD, exactly computing the energy scales factorially with system size on classical computers but polynomially on quantum devices. The local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz removes the need for SWAP gates, can be tailored to arbitrary qubit topologies (e.g., square, hex, and heavy-hex), and is well-suited to take advantage of continuous sets of quantum gates recently realized on superconducting devices with tunable couplers. The proposed family of ansatzes demonstrates that hardware efficiency and physical transparency are not mutually exclusive; indeed, chemical and physical intuition regarding electron correlation can illuminate a useful path towards hardware-friendly quantum circuits.

TI Frequency-comb-induced radiation pressure force in dense atomic clouds
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the frequency-comb-induced radiation pressure force acting on a cloud of cold Rb-87 atoms. Reduction and spectral broadening of the frequency comb force are observed as the cloud's optical thickness is increased. Since the radiation pressure force is uniquely determined by light scattered by an atomic cloud, we discuss different scattering mechanisms and point to the shadow effect as the dominant mechanism affecting the FC-induced force in resonantly excited dense atomic clouds. Our results improve the understanding of the interaction of frequency comb light with many-atom ensembles, which is essential for novel frequency comb applications in simultaneous multispecies cooling and self-ordering, multimode quantum memories, and quantum computing.

TI Assessment of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Application to the
   Heisenberg Model
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We present and analyze large-scale simulation results of a hybrid quantum-classical variational method to calculate the ground state energy of the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Using a massively parallel universal quantum computer simulator, we observe that a low-depth-circuit ansatz advantageously exploits the efficiently preparable Neel initial state, avoids potential barren plateaus, and works for both one- and two-dimensional lattices. The analysis reflects the decisive ingredients required for a simulation by comparing different ansatze, initial parameters, and gradient-based versus gradient-free optimizers. Extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit accurately yields the analytical value for the ground state energy, given by the Bethe ansatz. We predict that a fully functional quantum computer with 100 qubits can calculate the ground state energy with a relatively small error.

TI How to Compute an Isogeny on the Extended Jacobi Quartic Curves?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB Computing isogenies between elliptic curves is a sig-nificant part of post-quantum cryptography with many practical applications (for example, in SIDH, SIKE, B-SIDH, or CSIDH algorithms). Comparing to other post-quantum algorithms, the main advantages of these protocols are smaller keys, the similar idea as in the ECDH, and a large basis of expertise about elliptic curves. The main disadvantage of the isogeny-based cryptosystems is their computational efficiency -they are slower than other post-quantum algorithms (e.g., lattice-based). That is why so much effort has been put into improving the hitherto known methods of computing isogenies between elliptic curves. In this paper, we present new formulas for computing isogenies between elliptic curves in the extended Jacobi quartic form with two methods: by transforming such curves into the short Weierstrass model, computing an isogeny in this form and then transforming back into an initial model or by computing an isogeny directly between two extended Jacobi quartics. the Weierstrass such To one alternative and tween Weierstrass

TI Two-Party Quantum Private Comparison Protocol Based on Rotational
   Encryption
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we introduce a two-party quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol that employs single photons as quantum resources and utilizes rotational encryption to safeguard the privacy of the inputs. This protocol enables two parties to compare their private data without disclosing any information beyond the outcome of the comparison. The participants' private data are encoded as single photons, which are encrypted using a rotational encryption method. These encrypted single photons are then transmitted to a semi-honest third party (TP), who conducts single-particle measurements to determine if the users' private data are equal and subsequently announces the results to the participants. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, we ensure robust protection against potential eavesdropping and participant attacks. In contrast to numerous existing QPC protocols that rely on multi-qubit or d-dimensional quantum states, our method exhibits superior efficiency and practicality. Specifically, our protocol achieves a qubit efficiency of 50% by using two single photons to compare one bit of classical information, and single photons are easier to prepare than multi-qubit and d-dimensional quantum states.

TI Scrambling for precision: optimizing multiparameter qubit estimation in
   the face of sloppiness and incompatibility
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Multiparameter quantum estimation theory plays a crucial role in advancing quantum metrology. Recent studies focused on fundamental challenges such as enhancing precision in the presence of incompatibility or sloppiness, yet the relationship between these features remains poorly understood. In this work, we explore the connection between sloppiness and incompatibility by introducing an adjustable scrambling operation for parameter encoding. Using a minimal yet versatile two-parameter qubit model, we examine the trade-off between sloppiness and incompatibility and discuss: (1) how information scrambling can improve estimation, and (2) how the correlations between the parameters and the incompatibility between the symmetric logarithmic derivatives impose constraints on the ultimate quantum limits to precision. Through analytical optimization, we identify strategies to mitigate these constraints and enhance estimation efficiency. We also compare the performance of joint parameter estimation to strategies involving successive separate estimation steps, demonstrating that the ultimate precision can be achieved when sloppiness is minimized. Our results provide a unified perspective on the trade-offs inherent to multiparameter qubit statistical models, offering practical insights for optimizing experimental designs.

TI A Quantum Proxy Signature Scheme Without Restrictions on the Identity
   and Number of Verifiers
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum digital signatures (QDS) establish a framework for information-theoretically secure authentication in quantum networks. As a specialized extension of QDS, quantum proxy signatures facilitate secure delegation of signing privileges in distributed quantum environments. However, existing schemes require the predefinition of verifier identities at the system setup phase, which fundamentally constrains their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this constraint, we propose a quantum proxy signature scheme supporting verification by arbitrary parties without pre-registration while maintaining information-theoretic security guarantees. This work presents a constructive approach to mitigating verification constraints in quantum proxy signature architectures.

TI Security of Decoy-State Quantum Key Distribution with Correlated
   Intensity Fluctuations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB One of the most prominent techniques to enhance the performance of practical quantum key distribution (QKD) systems with laser sources is the decoy-state method. Current decoy-state QKD setups operate at gigahertz repetition rates, a regime where memory effects in the modulators and electronics that control them create correlations between the intensities of the emitted pulses. This translates into information leakage about the selected intensities, which cripples a crucial premise of the decoy-state method, thus invalidating the use of standard security analyzes. To overcome this problem, a security proof that exploits the Cauchy-Schwarz constraint has been introduced recently. Its main drawback is, however, that the achievable key rate is significantly lower than that of the ideal scenario without intensity correlations. Here, we improve this security proof technique by combining it with a fine-grained decoy-state analysis, which can deliver a tight estimation of the relevant parameters that determine the secret key rate. This results in a notable performance enhancement, being now the attainable distance double that of previous analyzes for certain parameter regimes. Also, we show that when the probability density function of the intensity fluctuations, conditioned on the current and previous intensity choices, is known, our approach provides a key rate very similar to the ideal scenario, which highlights the importance of an accurate experimental characterization of the correlations.

AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum algorithm described as ansatzes that represent both the problem and the mixer Hamiltonians. Both are parameterizable unitary transformations executed on a quantum machine/simulator and whose parameters are iteratively optimized using a classical device to optimize the problem's expectation value. To do so, in each QAOA iteration, most of the literature uses a quantum machine/simulator to measure the QAOA outcomes. However, this poses a severe bottleneck considering that quantum machines are hardly constrained (e.g. long queuing, limited qubits, etc.), likewise, quantum simulation also induces exponentiallyincreasing memory usage when dealing with large problems requiring more qubits. These limitations make today's QAOA implementation impractical since it is hard to obtain good solutions with a reasonably-acceptable time/resources. Considering these facts, this work presents a new approach with two main contributions, including (I) removing the need for accessing quantum devices or large-sized classical machines during the QAOA optimization phase, and (II) ensuring that when dealing with some k-bounded pseudo-Boolean problems, optimizing the exact problem's expectation value can be done in polynomial time using a classical computer.

TI Quantum Sensing for Detection of Zinc-Triggered Free Radicals in
   Endothelial Cells
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Oxidative stress originating from the overproduction of free radicals poses a major threat to cell fate, therefore it is of great importance to address the formation of free radicals in cells subjected to various pathological stimuli. Here we investigate the free radical response of endothelial cells to biodegradable zinc. In addition to the standard free radical assays, relaxometry was used for determining the production of free radicals in cells exposed to non-physiological concentrations of zinc ions. The cellular morphology, intracellular zinc accumulation, as well as the levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, are determined using standard fluorescent methods. For endothelial cells subjected to 50% zinc extracts, deviations from the normal cell shape and cell agglomeration tendency are observed. The culture medium containing the highest amount of zinc ions caused nuclei fragmentation, blebbing, and cell shrinkage, indicating cell death. A potential explanation for the observed phenomena is an overproduction of free radicals. In the case of 1% and 10% zinc extracts, the formation of free radicals is clearly confirmed by relaxometry, while the results obtained by using fluorescent techniques are unambiguous. It is revealed that high concentrations of zinc ions released from biodegradable samples induce a deleterious effect on endothelial cells.
   Zinc based implant material are attractive biomaterials. The aim of this article is to assess the possible impact such a material may have on the surrounding endothelial cells. More specifically, the impact on oxidative stress is investigated with diamond based quantum sensing as well as conventional methods.image

TI Exponentially-enhanced quantum sensing with many-body phase transitions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors based on critical many-body systems are known to exhibit enhanced sensing capability. Such enhancements typically scale algebraically with the probe size. Going beyond algebraic advantage and reaching exponential scaling has remained elusive when all the resources, such as the preparation time, are taken into account. In this work, we show that many-body systems featuring first order quantum phase transitions can indeed achieve exponential scaling of sensitivity, thanks to their exponential energy gap closing. Remarkably, even after considering the preparation time using local adiabatic driving, the exponential scaling is sustained. Our results are demonstrated through comprehensive analysis of three paradigmatic models exhibiting first order phase transitions, namely Grover, p-spin, and biclique models. We show that this scaling survives moderate decoherence during state preparation and also can be optimally measured in experimentally available basis. Our findings comply with the fundamental bounds and we show that one can harness the exponential advantage through an adaptive strategy even away from the phase transition point.

TI A Performance Comparison of Post-Quantum Algorithms in Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOCIATION
AB Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies have triggered widespread research and interest. This is due to their ability to create redundant, transparent, and accountable connections in various application domains while utilising asymmetric cryptography, digital signature, and hash functions. However, the current blockchain system exhibits vulnerability to attacks, especially those staged and actualised using quantum computers leveraging Grover's and Shor's algorithms. There is a need to examine the various algorithms of digital signatures, post-quantum generations of public-key cryptography, and their performance to gain insights into the most suitable way to address the issue. In our review, we examine the performance of different post-quantum public-key generation and digital signature algorithms in blockchain and provide a performance comparison of computing time and memory usage. The research presented here includes application domains where post-quantum blockchain may be used.Disclaimer: Nothing in this paper can be interpreted as constituting financial advice.

TI Entropic analysis of optomechanical entanglement for a nanomechanical
   resonator coupled to an optical cavity field
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB We investigate entanglement dynamics for a nanomechanical resonator coupled to an optical cavity field through the analysis of the associated entanglement entropies. The effects of time variation of several parameters, such as the optical frequency and the coupling strength, on the evolution of entanglement entropies are analyzed. We consider three kinds of entanglement entropies as the measures of the entanglement of subsystems, which are the linear entropy, the von Neumann entropy, and the Renyi entropy. The analytic formulae of these entropies are derived in a rigorous way using wave functions of the system. In particular, we focus on time behaviors of entanglement entropies in the case where the optical frequency is modulated by a small oscillating factor. We show that the entanglement entropies emerge and increase as the coupling strength grows from zero. The entanglement entropies fluctuate depending on the adiabatic variation of the parameters and such fluctuations are significant especially in the strong coupling regime. Our research may deepen the understanding of the optomechanical entanglement, which is crucial in realizing hybrid quantum-information protocols in quantum computation, quantum networks, and other domains in quantum science.

TI Carleman linearization approach for chemical kinetics integration toward
   quantum computation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, known as the pioneering algorithm for solving linear equations in quantum computers, is expected to accelerate solving large-scale linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To efficiently combine classical and quantum computers for high-cost chemical problems, non-linear ODEs (e.g., chemical reactions) must be linearized to the highest possible accuracy. However, the linearization approach has not been fully established yet. In this study, Carleman linearization was examined to transform nonlinear first-order ODEs of chemical reactions into linear ODEs. Although this linearization theoretically requires the generation of an infinite matrix, the original nonlinear equations can be reconstructed. For the practical use, the linearized system should be truncated with finite size and the extent of the truncation determines analysis precision. Matrix should be sufficiently large so that the precision is satisfied because quantum computers can treat such huge matrix. Our method was applied to a one-variable nonlinear y? = -y(2) system to investigate the effect of truncation orders and time step sizes on the computational error. Subsequently, two zero-dimensional homogeneous ignition problems for H-2-air and CH4-air gas mixtures were solved. The results revealed that the proposed method could accurately reproduce reference data. Furthermore, an increase in the truncation order improved accuracy with large time-step sizes. Thus, our approach can provide accurate numerical simulations rapidly for complex combustion systems.

TI Quantum Information: Systems, Their States, and the Use of Variances
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum information mobilizes the description of quantum systems, their states, and their behavior. Since a measurement postulate introduced by von Neumann in 1932, if a quantum system has been prepared in two different mixed states represented by the same density operator rho, these preparations are said to have led to the same mixture. For more than 50 years, there has been a lack of consensus about this postulate. In a 2011 article, considering variances of spin components, Fratini and Hayrapetyan tried to show that this postulate is unjustified. The aim of the present paper is to discuss major points in this 2011 article and in their reply to a 2012 paper by Bodor and Diosi claiming that their analysis was irrelevant. Facing some ambiguities or inconsistencies in the 2011 paper and in the reply, we first try to guess their aim, establish results useful in this context, and finally discuss the use or misuse of several concepts implied in this debate.

TI Optically coherent nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   high-pressure-high-temperature-treated diamonds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB As a point defect with unique spin and optical properties, nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers in diamond have attracted considerable attention in the fields of quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and quantum networks. The optical properties of an N-V center are crucial for all these quantum applications. However, N-V centers fabricated by destructive methods, such as electron irradiation or ion implantation, usually exhibit poor optical coherence. In this work, we demonstrate a nondestructive method to fabricate optically coherent N-V centers. High-purity single-crystal diamonds are annealed under highpressure and high-temperature conditions (>= 1750 degrees C, 5.5 GPa), and individually resolvable N-V centers with narrow PLE linewidth (<100 MHz) are produced. These N-V centers have excellent spin coherence and charge environment and are suitable for the most advanced quantum applications. The high-pressure condition prevents the conversion of diamond to graphite during high-temperature annealing, significantly expanding the parameter space for creating high-performance artificial defects. These findings deepen our understanding of N-V center formation in diamond and have implications for the optimization of color centers in solids, including silicon carbide and other wide-band-gap semiconductors.

TI Imaginary-time evolution using forward and backward real-time evolution
   with a single ancilla: First-quantized eigensolver algorithm for quantum
   chemistry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a quantum computer is a promising formalism for obtaining the ground state of a quantum system. The probabilistic ITE (PITE) exploits measurements to implement nonunitary operations, and it can avoid the restriction of dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace imposed by variational parameters unlike other types of ITE. In this paper, we propose a PITE approach that uses only one ancillary qubit. Unlike the existing PITE approaches, the one proposed here constructs, under a practical approximation, the circuit from forward and backward real-time evolution (RTE) gates as black boxes for the original Hamiltonian. Thus all efficient unitary algorithms for RTE can be transferred to the ITE without any modifications. Our approach can be used to obtain the Gibbs state at a finite temperature and partition function. We validate the approach via several illustrative systems where the trial states are found to converge rapidly to the ground states. In addition, we discuss its applicability to quantum chemistry by focusing on the scaling of computational cost; this leads to the development of a framework referred to as a first-quantized eigensolver. The nonvariational generic approach will expand the scope of practical quantum computation for versatile objectives.

TI Heterodyne sensing of microwaves with a quantum sensor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Diamond quantum sensors are sensitive to weak microwave magnetic fields resonant to the spin transitions. However, the spectral resolution in such protocols is ultimately limited by the sensor lifetime. Here, we demonstrate a heterodyne detection method for microwaves (MW) leading to a lifetime independent spectral resolution in the GHz range. We reference the MW signal to a local oscillator by generating the initial superposition state from a coherent source. Experimentally, we achieve a spectral resolution below 1Hz for a 4GHz signal far below the sensor lifetime limit of kilohertz. Furthermore, we show control over the interaction of the MW-field with the two-level system by applying dressing fields, pulsed Mollow absorption and Floquet dynamics under strong longitudinal radio frequency drive. While pulsed Mollow absorption leads to improved sensitivity, the Floquet dynamics allow robust control, independent from the system's resonance frequency. Our work is important for future studies in sensing weak microwave signals in a wide frequency range with high spectral resolution.

TI Optimization of Reversible Circuits Using Toffoli Decompositions with
   Negative Controls
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits are essential for the construction of quantum computers. This paper proposes two methods to reduce the quantum cost of 3-bit reversible circuits. The first method utilizes basic building blocks of gate pairs using different Toffoli decompositions. These gate pairs are used to reconstruct the quantum circuits where further optimization rules will be applied to synthesize the optimized circuit. The second method suggests using a new universal library, which provides better quantum cost when compared with previous work in both cost015 and cost115 metrics; this proposed new universal library "Negative NCT" uses gates that operate on the target qubit only when the control qubit's state is zero. A combination of the proposed basic building blocks of pairs of gates and the proposed Negative NCT library is used in this work for synthesis and optimization, where the Negative NCT library showed better quantum cost after optimization compared with the NCT library despite having the same circuit size. The reversible circuits over three bits form a permutation group of size 40,320 (23!), which is a subset of the symmetric group, where the NCT library is considered as the generators of the permutation group.

TI Riemann zeros from Floquet engineering a trapped-ion qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are central objects in number theory. In particular, they enable one to reproduce the prime numbers. They have also attracted the attention of physicists working in random matrix theory and quantum chaos for decades. Here we present an experimental observation of the lowest non-trivial Riemann zeros by using a trapped-ion qubit in a Paul trap, periodically driven with microwave fields. The waveform of the driving is engineered such that the dynamics of the ion is frozen when the driving parameters coincide with a zero of the real component of the zeta function. Scanning over the driving amplitude thus enables the locations of the Riemann zeros to be measured experimentally to a high degree of accuracy, providing a physical embodiment of these fascinating mathematical objects in the quantum realm.

TI Quantum Crosstalk Analysis for Simultaneous Gate Operations on
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Maintaining or even improving gate performance with growing numbers of parallel controlled qubits is a vital requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing. For superconducting quantum processors, though isolated one- or two-qubit gates have been demonstrated with high fidelity, implementing these gates in parallel commonly shows worse performance. Generally, this degradation is attributed to various crosstalks between qubits, such as quantum crosstalk due to residual inter-qubit coupling. An understanding of the exact nature of these crosstalks is critical to figuring out respective mitigation schemes and improved qubit architecture designs with low crosstalk. Here we give a theoretical analysis of quantum crosstalk impact on simultaneous gate operations in a qubit architecture, where fixed-frequency transmon qubits are coupled via a tunable bus, and sub-100-ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates can be realized by applying a baseband flux pulse on the bus. Our analysis shows that for microwave-driven single-qubit gates, the dressing from the qubit-qubit coupling can cause non-negligible cross-driving errors when qubits operate near frequency collision regions. During CZ gate operations, although unwanted nearest-neighbor interactions are nominally turned off, sub-MHz parasitic next-nearest-neighbor interactions involving spectator qubits can still exist, causing considerable leakage or control error when one operates qubit systems around these parasitic resonance points. To ensure high-fidelity simultaneous operations, a request could be raised to figure out a better way to balance the gate error from target qubit systems themselves and the error from nonparticipating spectator qubits. Overall, our analysis suggests that towards useful quantum processors, the qubit architecture should be examined carefully in the context of high-fidelity simultaneous gate operations in a scalable qubit lattice.

TI Generation of High-Order Vortex States From Two-Mode Squeezed States
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We report a scheme for generation of high-order quadrature vortex states using two-mode photon-number squeezed states, generated via the non-linear process of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion. By applying a parametric rotation in the quadratures ((X) over cap,(Y) over cap), using a. converter, the Gaussian profile of the photon-number squeezed input state can be mapped into a superposition of Laguerre-Gauss modes in the quadratures with N vortices or singularities, for an input state containing 2N photons, thus mapping photon-number fluctuations to interference effects in the quadratures. Our scheme has the potential to improve measurement sensitivity beyond the Standard uantum Limit (SQL proportional to root N), by exploiting the advantages of optical vortices, such as high dimensionality or topological properties, for applications requiring reduced uncertainty, such as quantum cryptography, quantum metrology and sensing.

TI High-Performance Intermediate-Frequency Balanced Homodyne Detector for
   Local Local Oscillator Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system with a local local oscillator (LLO), the center frequency of the sender and the receiver's source are not exactly the same and a certain frequency drift exists over time, resulting in the frequency of the signal received near the intermediate frequency. Therefore, the LLO system needs an intermediate-frequency balanced homodyne detector (BHD), which needs better symmetry of the arms of the BHD, to obtain the less-common mode noise. Moreover, the traditional intermediate-frequency receiver in classical communication is not available in the CV-QKD system because of the low quantum-to-classical noise ratio. In view of this, in this paper, we construct a broadband intermediate-frequency BHD based on ratio frequency and integrated circuit technology, whose bandwidth can exceed 270 MHz and whose quantum-to-classical noise ratio can reach 14.9 dB. Meanwhile, the BHD has an excellent linear performance with a gain of 22.4 k. By adopting our intermediate-frequency BHD, the secret key rate of the pilot-sequential Gaussian modulated coherent state CV-QKD system with an LLO can reach over 430.8 kbps of 60 km at the standard fiber length, which paves the way to achieve a high-performance LLO CV-QKD system with intermediate-frequency BHD.

TI Interference in Complex Canonical Variables Is Not Quantum
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We formally represent the quantum interference of a single qubit embodied by a photon in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer using the classical Hamiltonian framework but with complex canonical variables. Although all operations on a single qubit can be formally expressed using complex classical Hamiltonian dynamics, we show that the resulting system is still not a proper qubit. The reason for this is that it is not capable of getting entangled to another bona fide qubit and hence it does not have the information-processing capacity of a fully-fledged quantum system. This simple example powerfully illustrates the difficulties faced by hybrid quantum-classical models in accounting for the full range of behaviour of quantum systems.

TI Efficient quantum circuit research and implementation for 16-bit S-boxes
   based on composite field
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB With the development of quantum computing technology, efficiently implementing the core component S-box of block ciphers in quantum environments has become an important research direction in the field of cryptographic engineering. Due to the limitations of the no-cloning theorem of quantum states, the implementation of S-boxes in quantum circuits faces the dual challenges of exponential growth in space complexity and excessive consumption of quantum resources, especially in 16-bit and larger S-boxes. To address these problems, this paper proposes a construction framework for 16-bit S-box quantum circuits based on composite fields. This method relies on normal bases representation to construct composite field structures, decomposing high-dimensional multiplicative inverse into low-dimensional subdomain operations through isomorphic mapping, thereby significantly reducing the quantum cost of nonlinear component. In the linear component, a dynamic optimal pivot selection strategy is proposed to effectively optimize the Gaussian elimination process while maintaining the row echelon form of the matrix, thereby reducing the number of CNOT gates. Taking the 16-bit S-box in the MK-3 algorithm as an example, experimental results show that the proposed method maintains correct circuit structure while reducing CNOT gate consumption in the linear component by more than 32.8%, and the utilization of quantum resources in the nonlinear component is more advantageous. This study provides theoretical support and an implementation path for the high-performance implementation of block ciphers in practical quantum computing environments.

TI Error threshold in active steering protocols for few-qubit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study active steering protocols for weakly measured qubits in the presence of error channels due to amplitude and phase noise. If the error rate is sufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure target state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous state stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two qubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as an example. As a function of the error rate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from a strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At the threshold, the purity gap closes.

TI Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to
   Neutral Atom Hardware
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 21st International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 15-19, 2024
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single-qubit rotations and an additional entangling two-qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom-based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize (multi-) controlled phase gates using ZX-calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph-like ZX-diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi-controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom-based hardware with native support of multi-controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state-of-the-art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary-sized multi-controlled phase gates.

TI Security analysis of continuous variable quantum key distribution based
   on entangled states with biased correlations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states can significantly enhance the secret key rate and secure distance of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). In practical imperfections always exist in the preparation of two-mode squeezing (entangled states), which present an asymmetrical variance for the two quadratures. The imperfections induced by the bias effect of the entangled states are commonly treated as part of the untrusted channel to decrease the performance of the system. Here, we theoretically quantify the influence of bias effect on the secret key rate and secure distance, and propose a solution of generating unbiased entangled states protocol. The results demonstrated that the unbiased entangled states protocol guarantees the longest secure distance and highest key rate compared to that of coherent and biased entangled states.

TI Self-induced manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically
   distinct
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.

TI Continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity with Rydberg state
   wave-function engineering
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Extending optical nonlinearity into the extremely weak light regime is at the heart of quantum optics, since it enables the efficient generation of photonic entanglement and implementation of photonic quantum logic gate. Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to similar to 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.

TI Experimental Factoring Integers Using Fixed-Point-QAOA with a
   Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Factoring integers is considered as a computationally hard problem for classical methods, whereas there exists polynomial-time Shor's quantum algorithm for solving this task. However, requirements for running Shor's algorithm for realistic tasks, which are beyond the capabilities of existing and upcoming generations of quantum computing devices, motivate to search for alternative approaches. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate factoring of the integer with a trapped ion quantum processor using the Schnorr approach and a modified version of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The key difference of our approach in comparison with the recently proposed QAOA-based factoring method is the use of the fixed-point feature, which relies on the use of universal parameters. We present experimental results on factoring 1591 = 37 x 43 using 6 qubits as well as simulation results for 74425657 = 9521 x 7817 with 10 qubits and 35183361263263 = 4194191 x 8388593 with 15 qubits. Although we present all the necessary details for reproducing our results and analysis of the performance of the factoring method, the scalability of this approach in both the classical and quantum domains still requires further studies.

AB This paper introduces QRANE, a tool that produces the affine intermediate representation (IR) from a quantum program expressed in Quantum Assembly language such as OpenQASM. QRANE finds subsets of quantum gates prescribed by the same operation type and linear relationships, and constructs a structured program representation expressed with polyhedral iteration domains and access relations, all while preserving the original semantics of the quantum program. We explore various policies for deciding amongst different delinearization strategies and discuss their effect on the quality of the reconstruction. Our evaluation demonstrates the high coverage and efficiency obtained with QRANE while enabling research on the benefits of affine transformations for large quantum circuits. Specifically, QRANE reconstructs affine iteration domains of up to 6 dimensions and up to 184 points per domain.

TI Strong parametric dispersive shifts in a statically decoupled two-qubit
   cavity QED system
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Efficient control and measurement of qubits requires them to be strongly coupled to other degrees of freedom, but this can introduce additional decoherence. Now, parametric driving makes it possible to controllably introduce and remove interactions.
   Qubits in cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) architectures are often operated in the dispersive regime, in which the operating frequency of the cavity depends on the energy state of the qubit, and vice versa. The ability to tune these dispersive shifts provides additional options for performing either quantum measurements or logical manipulations. Here we couple two transmon qubits to a lumped-element cavity through a shared superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Our design balances the mutual capacitive and inductive circuit components so that both qubits are statically decoupled from the cavity with low flux sensitivity, offering protection from decoherence processes. Parametric driving of the SQUID flux enables independent, dynamical tuning of each qubit's interaction with the cavity. As a practical demonstration, we perform pulsed parametric dispersive readout of both qubits. The dispersive frequency shifts of the cavity mode follow the theoretically expected magnitude and sign. This parametric approach creates an extensible, tunable cavity QED framework with various future applications, such as entanglement and error correction via multi-qubit parity readout, state and entanglement stabilization, and parametric logical gates.

TI A Framework for Fully Programmable Frequency-Encoded Quantum Networks
   Harnessing Multioutput Quantum Pulse Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Linear optical quantum networks, consisting of a quantum input state and a multiport interferometer, are an important building block for many quantum technological concepts, e.g., Gaussian boson sampling. Here, we propose the implementation of such networks based on frequency conversion by utilizing a socalled multioutput quantum pulse gate (MQPG). This approach allows the resource-efficient and therefore scalable implementation of frequency-bin-based, fully programmable interferometers in a single spatial and polarization mode. Quantum input states for this network can be provided by utilizing the strong frequency entanglement of a type-0 parametric down-conversion (PDC) source. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe linear networks based on an MQPG and PDC and utilize it to investigate the limits and scalabilty of our approach.

TI Quantum Privacy Comparison with Ry Rotation Operation
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper presents a novel quantum privacy comparison (QPC) protocol that employs Ry rotation operations to enable two participants to securely compare their binary secrets without disclosing the actual data to any party except for the comparison result. In this protocol, classical bits 0 and 1 are encoded as rotation angles 0 and pi, respectively, using the Ry rotation operation. The participants apply these rotations to quantum sequences received from a semi-honest third party (TP) and return the encoded sequences to the TP. The TP then performs quantum measurements to determine the comparison result and announces it to the participants, ensuring fairness and privacy throughout the process. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, the protocol is resistant to various quantum attack strategies, providing robust security against both external adversaries and insider threats. The protocol utilizes Bell states as quantum resources, Ry rotation operations for encoding classical information, and quantum measurements to derive the comparison result, making it experimentally feasible with current quantum technologies. Simulations conducted on a quantum platform validate the protocol's practicality. Furthermore, each Bell state is used to compare one bit of binary information, achieving a qubit efficiency of 50%.

TI Enhanced Coexistence of Quantum Key Distribution and Classical
   Communication over Hollow-Core and Multi-Core Fibers
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we investigate the impact of classical optical communications in quantum key distribution (QKD) over hollow-core fiber (HCF), multi-core fiber (MCF) and single-core fiber (SCF) and propose wavelength allocation schemes to enhance QKD performance. Firstly, we theoretically analyze noise interference in QKD over HCF, MCF and SCF, such as spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave mixing (FWM). To mitigate these noise types and optimize QKD performance, we propose a joint noise suppression wavelength allocation (JSWA) scheme. FWM noise suppression wavelength allocation and Raman noise suppression wavelength allocation are also proposed for comparison. The JSWA scheme indicates a significant enhancement in extending the simultaneous transmission distance of classical signals and QKD, reaching approximately 100 km in HCF and 165 km in MCF under a classical power per channel of 10 dBm. Therefore, MCF offers a longer secure transmission distance compared with HCF when classical signals and QKD coexist in the C-band. However, when classical signals are in the C-band and QKD operates in the O-band, the performance of QKD in HCF surpasses that in MCF. This research establishes technical foundations for the design and deployment of QKD optical networks.

TI Universal quantum control of an atomic spin qubit on a surface
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) enables the bottom-up fabrication of tailored spin systems on a surface that are engineered with atomic precision. When combining STM with electron spin resonance (ESR), these single atomic and molecular spins can be controlled quantum-coherently and utilized as electron-spin qubits. Here we demonstrate universal quantum control of such a spin qubit on a surface by employing coherent control along two distinct directions, achieved with two consecutive radio-frequency (RF) pulses with a well-defined phase difference. We first show transformations of each Cartesian component of a Bloch vector on the quantization axis, followed by ESR-STM detection. Then we demonstrate the ability to generate an arbitrary superposition state of a single spin qubit by using two-axis control schemes, in which experimental data show excellent agreement with simulations. Finally, we present an implementation of two-axis control in dynamical decoupling. Our work extends the scope of STM-based pulsed ESR, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum gate operations of electron-spin qubits on a surface.

TI Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum Electromagnetic Transients Program
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB Quantum-empowered electromagnetic transients program (QEMTP) is a promising paradigm for tackling EMTP's computational burdens. Nevertheless, no existing studies truly achieve a practical and scalable QEMTP operable on today's noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The strong reliance on noise-free and fault-tolerant quantum devices-which appears to be decades away- hinder practical applications of current QEMTP methods. This paper devises a NISQ-QEMTP methodology which for the first time transitions the QEMTP operations from ideal, noise-free quantum simulators to real, noisy quantum computers. The main contributions lie in: (1) design of shallow-depth QEMTP quantum circuits for mitigating noises on NISQ quantum devices; (2) practical QEMTP linear solvers incorporating executable quantum state preparation and measurements for nodal voltage computations; (3) a noise-resilient QEMTP algorithm leveraging quantum resources logarithmically scaled with power system dimension; (4) a quantum shifted frequency analysis (QSFA) for accelerating QEMTP by exploiting dynamic phasor simulations with larger time steps; (5) a systematical analysis on QEMTP's performance under various noisy quantum environments. Extensive experiments systematically verify the accuracy, efficacy, universality and noise-resilience of QEMTP on both noise-free simulators and IBM real quantum computers.

TI Phases of matrix product states with symmetric quantum circuits and
   symmetric measurements with feedforward
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two matrix product states (MPS) are in the same phase in the presence of symmetries if they can be transformed into one another via symmetric short-depth circuits. We consider how symmetry-preserving measurements with feedforward alter the phase classification of MPS in the presence of global on-site symmetries. We demonstrate that, for all finite Abelian symmetries, any two symmetric MPS belong to the same phase. We give an explicit protocol that achieves a transformation between any two phases and that uses only a depth-two symmetric circuit, a single round of symmetric measurements, and a constant number of auxiliary systems per site. In the case of non-Abelian symmetries, symmetry protection prevents one from deterministically transforming symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states to product states directly via measurements, thereby complicating the analysis. Nonetheless, we provide protocols that allow for asymptotically deterministic transformations between the trivial phase, SPT phases, and GHZ phases of some non-Abelian nilpotent groups.

AB We present an extension of the chaos-assisted tunneling mechanism to spatially periodic lattice systems. We demonstrate that driving such lattice systems in an intermediate regime of modulation maps them onto tight-binding Hamiltonians with chaos-induced long-range hoppings t(n) proportional to 1 / n between sites at a distance n. We provide a numerical demonstration of the robustness of the results and derive an analytical prediction for the hopping term law. Such systems can thus be used to enlarge the scope of quantum simulations to experimentally realize long-range models of condensed matter.

TI Entanglement devised barren plateau mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms are one of the most propitious implementations of quantum computing on near-term devices, offering classical machine-learning support to quantum scale solution spaces. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the rate at which this space grows in qubit number could preclude learning in deep quantum circuits, a phenomenon known as barren plateaus. In this work, we implicate random entanglement, i.e., entanglement that is formed due to state evolution with random unitaries, as a source of barren plateaus and characterize them in terms of many-body entanglement dynamics, detailing their formation as a function of system size, circuit depth, and circuit connectivity. Using this comprehension of entanglement, we propose and demonstrate a number of barren plateau ameliorating techniques, including initial partitioning of cost function and non-cost function registers, meta-learning of low-entanglement circuit initializations, selective inter-register interaction, entanglement regularization, the addition of Langevin noise, and rotation into preferred cost function eigenbases. We find that entanglement limiting, both automatic and engineered, is a hallmark of high-accuracy training and emphasize that, because learning is an iterative organization process whereas barren plateaus are a consequence of randomization, they are not necessarily unavoidable or inescapable. Our work forms both a theoretical characterization and a practical toolbox; first defining barren plateaus in terms of random entanglement and then employing this expertise to strategically combat them.

TI Efficient Unitary Designs with a System-Size Independent Number of
   Non-Clifford Gates
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Many quantum information protocols require the implementation of random unitaries. Because it takes exponential resources to produce Haar-random unitaries drawn from the full n-qubit group, one often resorts to t-designs. Unitary t-designs mimic the Haar-measure up to t-th moments. It is known that Clifford operations can implement at most 3-designs. In this work, we quantify the non-Clifford resources required to break this barrier. We find that it suffices to inject O(t(4) log(2)(t) log(1/epsilon)) many non-Clifford gates into a polynomial-depth random Clifford circuit to obtain an epsilon-approximate t-design. Strikingly, the number of non-Clifford gates required is independent of the system size - asymptotically, the density of non-Clifford gates is allowed to tend to zero. We also derive novel bounds on the convergence time of random Clifford circuits to the t-th moment of the uniform distribution on the Clifford group. Our proofs exploit a recently developed variant of Schur-Weyl duality for the Clifford group, as well as bounds on restricted spectral gaps of averaging operators.

AB To face the quantum era and the prospect or threat of quantum computing, especially in a disaggregated network environment, the design and implementation of efficient quantum secure communication systems facilitating their integration in the optical network infrastructure is crucial. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the most promising technologies to ensure long-term security. In particular, continuous-variable QKD results as an efficient solution more compatible and suitable to be integrated with conventional optical systems. In this work, quantum secure systems based on QKD for enabling a smooth and sustainable integration in optical networks are introduced, considering the related challenges, towards future secure 6G networks.

TI Guided graph compression for quantum graph neural networks
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, quantum GNNs (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the guided graph compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. We compare GGC to a model that uses the autoencoder as a preprocessing step and to a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

TI A matrix product state model for simultaneous classification and
   generation
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.

TI Engineering long-lived entanglement through dissipation in quantum
   hybrid solid-state platforms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spin squeezing, a form of many-body entanglement, is a crucial resource in quantum metrology and information processing. While experimentally viable protocols for generating stable spin squeezing have been proposed in quantum optics setups, there is growing interest in quantum hybrid solid-state systems as alternative platforms for both engineering and exploring many-body quantum phenomena. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate long-lived spin squeezing in an ensemble of solid-state qubits interacting with electromagnetic noise emitted by a squeezed solid-state bath. We identify the conditions under which quantum correlations within the bath can be transferred to the qubit array, driving it into an entangled state independently of its initial configuration. To assess the experimental feasibility of our approach, we analyze the dynamics of an array of solid-state spin defects coupled to a common ferromagnetic bath, which is driven into a non-equilibrium squeezed state through its interaction with a surface acoustic wave mode. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble can exhibit steady-state spin squeezing under suitable conditions, opening new pathways for the generation of robust many-body entanglement in solid-state spin ensembles.

TI Quantum-inspired optimization for wavelength assignment
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Problems related to wavelength assignment (WA) in optical communications networks involve allocating transmission wavelengths for known transmission paths between nodes that minimize a certain objective function, for example, the total number of wavelengths. Playing a central role in modern telecommunications, this problem belongs to NP-complete class for a general case so that obtaining optimal solutions for industry-relevant cases is exponentially hard. In this work, we propose and develop a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the wavelength assignment problem. We propose an advanced embedding procedure to transform this problem into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form, having a improvement in the number of iterations with price-to-pay being a slight increase in the number of variables ( "spins "). Then, we compare a quantum-inspired technique for solving the corresponding QUBO form against classical heuristic and industrial combinatorial solvers. The obtained numerical results indicate on an advantage of the quantum-inspired approach in a substantial number of test cases against the industrial combinatorial solver that works in the standard setting. Our results pave the way to the use of quantum-inspired algorithms for practical problems in telecommunications and open a perspective for further analysis of the use of quantum computing devices.

TI Erasure conversion in a high-fidelity Rydberg quantum simulator
SO NATURE
AB Minimizing and understanding errors is critical for quantum science, both in noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices1 and for the quest towards fault-tolerant quantum computation2,3. Rydberg arrays have emerged as a prominent platform in this context(4) with impressive system sizes(5,6) and proposals suggesting how error-correction thresholds could be significantly improved by detecting leakage errors with single-atom resolution(7,8), a form of erasure error conversion(9-12). However, two-qubit entanglement fidelities in Rydberg atom arrays(13,14) have lagged behind competitors(15,16) and this type of erasure conversion is yet to be realized for matter-based qubits in general. Here we demonstrate both erasure conversion and high-fidelity Bell state generation using a Rydberg quantum simulator(5,6,17,18). When excising data with erasure errors observed via fast imaging of alkaline-earth atoms(19-22), we achieve a Bell state fidelity of >= 0.9971(- 13)(+10), which improves to >= 0.9985(- 12)(+7) when correcting for remaining state-preparation errors. We further apply erasure conversion in a quantum simulation experiment for quasi-adiabatic preparation of long-range order across a quantum phase transition, and reveal the otherwise hidden impact of these errors on the simulation outcome. Our work demonstrates the capability for Rydberg-based entanglement to reach fidelities in the 0.999 regime, with higher fidelities a question of technical improvements, and shows how erasure conversion can be utilized in NISQ devices. These techniques could be translated directly to quantum-error-correction codes with the addition of long-lived qubits(7,22-24).

TI Weak Measurement of a Superconducting Qubit Reconciles Incompatible
   Operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Traditional uncertainty relations dictate a minimal amount of noise in incompatible projective quantum measurements. However, not all measurements are projective. Weak measurements are minimally invasive methods for obtaining partial state information without projection. Recently, weak measurements were shown to obey an uncertainty relation cast in terms of entropies. We experimentally test this entropic uncertainty relation with strong and weak measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. A weak measurement, we find, can reconcile two strong measurements' incompatibility, via backaction on the state. Mathematically, a weak value-a preselected and postselected expectation value-lowers the uncertainty bound. Hence we provide experimental support for the physical interpretation of the weak value as a determinant of a weak measurement's ability to reconcile incompatible operations.

AB We consider a stochastic dynamics describing the evolution of a qubit controlled by an external field and subject to continuous-time measurements. Motivated by stabilization techniques recently developed in, e.g., [10], [11], we investigate the support of the corresponding solution, which is a random variable taking values on the space of two-by-two density matrices. By making use of the Strook-Varadhan support theorem and by classical geometric control arguments we compute the support for two possible choices of the measurement and Hamiltonian operators. In one case we show that, in Bloch coordinates, the support is always contained inside an ellipsoid depending on the physical parameters of the system. More precisely, a solution starting from the ellipsoid never exit it, with probability one, and every open subset of the ellipsoid is visited with nonzero probability for some choice of the control function. In the second case the support coincides with (the interior of) the Bloch ball: every open subset of the Bloch ball is visited with nonzero probability up to suitably choosing the control function.

TI Topological order and entanglement dynamics in the measurement-only XZZX
   quantum code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We examine the dynamics of a (1 + 1)-dimensional measurement-only circuit defined by the stabilizers of the [[5,1,3]] quantum error correcting code interrupted by single-qubit Pauli measurements. The code corrects arbitrary single-qubit errors and it stabilizes an area law entangled state with a D-2 = Z(2) x Z(2) symmetry protected topological (SPT) order, as well as a symmetry breaking (SB) order from a twofold bulk degeneracy. The Pauli measurements break the topological order and induce a phase transition into a trivial area law phase. Allowing more than one type of Pauli measurement increases the measurement-induced frustration and the SPT and SB order can be broken either simultaneously or separately at nonzero measurement rate. This yields a rich phase diagram and unanticipated critical behavior at the phase transitions. Although the correlation length exponent nu = 4/3 and the dynamical critical exponent z = 1 are consistent with bond percolation, the prefactor of the logarithmic entanglement growth may take noninteger multiples of the percolation value. Remarkably, we identify a robust transient scaling regime for the purification dynamics of L qubits. It reveals a modified dynamical critical exponent z* not equal z, which is observable up to times t similar to L-z* and is reminiscent of the relaxation of critical systems into a prethermal state.

TI Spectral analysis of product formulas for quantum simulation

AB We consider the time-independent Hamiltonian simulation using the first order Lie-Trotter-Suzuki product formula under the assumption that the initial state is supported on a low-dimension subspace. By comparing the spectral decomposition of the original Hamiltonian and the effective Hamiltonian, we obtain better upper bounds for various conditions. Especially, we show that the Trotter step size needed to estimate an energy eigenvalue within precision epsilon using quantum phase estimation can be improved in scaling from epsilon to epsilon(1/2) for a large class of systems. Our results also depend on the gap condition of the simulated Hamiltonian.

TI Fast-forward scaling theory
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Speed is the key to further advances in technology. For example, quantum technologies, such as quantum computing, require fast manipulations of quantum systems in order to overcome the effect of decoherence. However, controlling the speed of quantum dynamics is often very difficult due to both the lack of a simple scaling property in the dynamics and the infinitely large parameter space to be explored. Therefore, protocols for speed control based on understanding of the dynamical properties of the system, such as non-trivial scaling property, are highly desirable. Fast-forward scaling theory (FFST) was originally developed to provide a way to accelerate, decelerate, stop and reverse the dynamics of quantum systems. FFST has been extended in order to accelerate quantum and classical adiabatic dynamics of various systems including cold atoms, internal state of molecules, spins and solid-state artificial atoms. This paper describes the basic concept of FFST and reviews the recent developments and its applications such as fast state-preparations, state protection and ion sorting. We introduce a method, called inter-trajectory travel, recently derived from FFST. We also point out the significance of deceleration in quantum technology.This article is part of the theme issue 'Shortcuts to adiabaticity: theoretical, experimental and interdisciplinary perspectives'.

We present a general calculation of entanglement entropy in Dicke states, which we use to describe the |DNk ) entropy cone. We demonstrate that all |DNk ) entropy vectors emerge symmetrized and use this to define a min-cut protocol on star graphs which realizes |DNk ) entropy vectors. We identify the stabilizer group for all |DNk ), under the action of the N-qubit Pauli group and two-qubit Clifford group, which we use to construct |DNk ) reachability graphs. We use these reachability graphs to analyze and bound evolution of |DNk ) entropy vectors in Clifford circuits.

TI Long-Term Secure Distributed Storage Using Quantum Key Distribution
   Network With Third-Party Verification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The quantum key distribution (QKD) network with Vernam's one-time pad encryption and secret sharing are powerful security tools to realize an information theoretically secure (ITS) distributed storage system. In the work of Fujiwara et al., a single-password-authenticated secret sharing (SPSS) scheme based on the QKD network and Shamirs secret sharing was experimentally demonstrated; it confirmed ITS data transmission, storage, authentication, and integrity. To achieve data integrity, an ITS message authentication code (MAC) tag is employed, and a data owner of the secret sharing performs both the MAC tag generation and verification. However, for a scenario in which the data owner and end users are different entities, the above approach may not work, since the data owner can cheat the end users. In this article, we resolve this problem by proposing an ITS integrity protection scheme employing a third-party verification with time-stamp. The ITS integrity protection is realized by two steps: integrity check by the data owner at data reconstruction and data integrity certification by the data owner, the end user, and the third-party verifier using a MAC based on universal2 hash function and random number provided from the QKD network. In addition to introducing the third-party verifier, we institute "a trusted calculator," which computes shares of the data andMAC tags and sendsMAC tags to the third-party verifier. The random number used in calculation is stored in the trusted calculator. We implement this scheme on the SPSS system installed in the Tokyo QKD Network.

Different modulations are inversely designed from inverse engineering, counter-diabatic driving, and genetic algorithm, for achiev-ing optimally large values of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a nanosecond scale. By comparison, we demonstrate that our protocols outperform the usual periodic modulations on pointer state separa-tion and SNR. Finally, we show a possible implementation considering state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, estimating the minimal time allowed for the measurement process.

TI Sparse quantum Gaussian processes to counter the curse of dimensionality
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Gaussian processes are well-established Bayesian machine learning algorithms with significant merits, despite a strong limitation: lack of scalability. Clever solutions address this issue by inducing sparsity through low-rank approximations, often based on the Nystrom method. Here, we propose a different method to achieve better scalability and higher accuracy using quantum computing, outperforming classical Bayesian neural networks for large datasets significantly. Unlike other approaches to quantum machine learning, the computationally expensive linear algebra operations are not just replaced with their quantum counterparts. Instead, we start from a recent study that proposed a quantum circuit for implementing quantum Gaussian processes and then we use quantum phase estimation to induce a low-rank approximation analogous to that in classical sparse Gaussian processes. We provide evidence through numerical tests, mathematical error bound estimation, and complexity analysis that the method can address the "curse of dimensionality," where each additional input parameter no longer leads to an exponential growth of the computational cost. This is also demonstrated by applying the algorithm in a practical setting and using it in the data-driven design of a recently proposed metamaterial. The algorithm, however, requires significant quantum computing hardware improvements before quantum advantage can be achieved.

TI NISQ computing: where are we and where do we go?

AB In this short review article, we aim to provide physicists not working within the quantum computing community a hopefully easy-to-read introduction to the state of the art in the field, with minimal mathematics involved. In particular, we focus on what is termed the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era of quantum computing. We describe how this is increasingly seen to be a distinct phase in the development of quantum computers, heralding an era where we have quantum computers that are capable of doing certain quantum computations in a limited fashion, and subject to certain constraints and noise. We further discuss the prominent algorithms that are believed to hold the most potential for this era, and also describe the competing physical platforms on which to build a quantum computer that have seen the most success so far. We then talk about the applications that are most feasible in the near-term, and finish off with a short discussion on the state of the field. We hope that as non-experts read this article, it will give context to the recent developments in quantum computers that have garnered much popular press, and help the community understand how to place such developments in the timeline of quantum computing.

TI Application of quantum-inspired tensor networks to optimize federated
   learning systems
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Federated learning (FL) has gained significant traction across diverse industries, which allows multiple clients or institutions to enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy collaboratively. In recent years, tensor networks (TNs) have become important in machine learning because they allow the compact representation of high-dimensional tensors by decomposing them into lower-dimensional components with polynomial complexity. The application of TNs in FL is a natural extension because of its flexible framework for representing and optimizing models. Inspired by quantum computing principles, we have integrated a quantum-inspired tensor network into the FL framework. This framework focuses on a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) tensor network (TN) in a federated setting (FedTN), with data distributed across homogeneous and heterogeneous partitions among clients. Our experiments demonstrate that tensor network-based federated learning can be made practical, as FedTN is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions typically encountered in such settings. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of comparing quantum-inspired TN and conventional methods, evaluating their performance, and exploring the benefits of incorporating quantum principles in FL settings. Furthermore, we have investigated its performance when training for many local epochs (large E) between the averaging steps.

TI Electromagnetic simulation and microwave circuit approach of heat
   transport in superconducting qubits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The study of quantum heat transport in superconducting circuits is significant for further understanding the connection between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and for possible applications for quantum information. The first experimental realisations of devices demonstrating photonic heat transport mediated by a qubit have already been designed and measured. Motivated by the analysis of such experimental results, and for future experimental designs, we numerically evaluate the photonic heat transport of qubit-resonator devices in the linear circuit regime through electromagnetic simulations using Sonnet software, and compare with microwave circuit theory. We show that the method is a powerful tool to calculate heat transport and predict unwanted parasitic resonances and background.

TI Quantum approximated cloning-assisted density matrix exponentiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Classical information loading is an essential task for many processing quantum algorithms, constituting a cornerstone in the field of quantum machine learning. In particular, the embedding techniques based on Hamiltonian simulation techniques enable the loading of matrices into quantum computers. A representative example of these methods is the Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost (LMR) protocol, which efficiently implements matrix exponentiation when multiple copies of a quantum state are available. However, this is a quite ideal setup, and in a realistic scenario, the copies are limited and the noncloning theorem prevents one from producing more exact copies in order to increase the accuracy of the protocol. Here, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation by introducing imperfect quantum copies, which significantly improve the performance of the LMR when the eigenvectors are known.

TI Spin-blockade and state lifetimes of many-hole spin states in silicon
   quantum dots
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Hole spins in silicon quantum dots (QDs) are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To achieve the high-fidelity readout and high coherence required for fault tolerance, the evaluation of spin-blockade and state lifetimes is important because they can limit the qubit fidelities. In this study, we characterize these two figures of merit of many-hole qubits in silicon QDs. We report a spin-blockade lifetime of 5.1 mu s, which is comparable with the values reported previously, and a spin-state lifetime of 0.91 ms, which is longer than the one measured in a few-hole silicon QD in a previous study. We furthermore provide insights into a many-hole spin state based on the estimated tunneling rate ratio.

TI Quantum density peak clustering
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Clustering algorithms are of fundamental importance when dealing with large unstructured datasets and discovering new patterns and correlations therein, with applications ranging from scientific research to medical imaging and marketing analysis. In this work, we introduce a quantum version of the density peak clustering algorithm, built upon a quantum routine for minimum finding. We prove a quantum speedup for a decision version of density peak clustering depending on the structure of the dataset. Specifically, the speedup is dependent on the heights of the trees of the induced graph of nearest-highers, i.e. the graph of connections to the nearest elements with higher density. We discuss this condition, showing that our algorithm is particularly suitable for high-dimensional datasets. Finally, we benchmark our proposal with a toy problem on a real quantum device.

TI A Pair of Coupled Waveguides as a Classical Analogue for a Solid-State
   Qubit
SO SENSORS
AB We have determined conditions when a pair of coupled waveguides, a common element for integrated room-temperature photonics, can act as a qubit based on a system with a double-well potential. Moreover, we have used slow-varying amplitude approximation (SVA) for the "classical" wave equation to study the propagation of electromagnetic beams in a couple of dielectric waveguides both analytically and numerically. As a part of an extension of the optical-mechanical analogy, we have considered examples of "quantum operations" on the electromagnetic wave state in a pair of waveguides. Furthermore, we have provided examples of "quantum-mechanical" calculations of nonlinear transfer functions for the implementation of the considered element in optical neural networks.

TI Simple framework for systematic high-fidelity gate operations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Semiconductor spin qubits demonstrated single-qubit gates with fidelities up to 99.9% benchmarked in the single-qubit subspace. However, tomographic characterizations reveal non-negligible crosstalk errors in a larger space. Additionally, it was long thought that the two-qubit gate performance is limited by charge noise, which couples to the qubits via the exchange interaction. Here, we show that coherent error sources such as a limited bandwidth of the control signals, diabaticity errors, microwave crosstalk, and non-linear transfer functions can equally limit the fidelity. We report a simple theoretical framework for pulse optimization that relates erroneous dynamics to spectral concentration problems and allows for the reuse of existing signal shaping methods on a larger set of gate operations. We apply this framework to common gate operations for spin qubits and show that simple pulse shaping techniques can significantly improve the performance of these gate operations in the presence of such coherent error sources. The methods presented in the paper were used to demonstrate two-qubit gate fidelities with F > 99.5% in Xue et al (2022 Nature 601 343). We also find that single and two-qubit gates can be optimized using the same pulse shape. We use analytic derivations and numerical simulations to arrive at predicted gate fidelities greater than 99.9% with duration less than, 4/(?E-z) where ?E-z is the difference in qubit frequencies.

TI Flicker Noise (1/f) in 45-nm PDSOI N-Channel FETs at Cryogenic
   Temperatures for Quantum Computing Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we have investigated the flicker noise (1/f ) in 45-nm RFSOI NFETs for quantum computing applications. 1/f noise characterization and analysis were performed in linear region at cryogenic temperatures down to 10K. A Lorentzian-like noise is also observed depending on bias conditions, possibly due to the floating body of PDSOI. The extracted frequency exponent (gamma) shows an inverted U-shape behavior with temperature mainly attributed to non-uniform energy distribution of traps in the gate dielectric. The dominant source of 1/f noise is carrier number fluctuation. Thermal-activation behavior of 1/f noise is studied, which shows the traps responsible for noise are not thermally activated. Volume trap densities are also extracted from 300K down to 10K. The volume trap density increases with a decrease in temperature, but no significant increase in normalized noise is observed at cryogenic temperatures in the measured NFETs. The non-uniform distribution along with the thermal inactive behavior of traps over the studied temperature range is expected to be a plausible reason for the temperature-independent behavior of normalized noise.

TI Chiral spin-phonon bound states and spin-spin interactions with phononic
   lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Designing unconventional interactions between single phonons and spins is fascinating for its applications in quantum phononics. Here we propose a reliable scheme for coupling spins and phonons in phononic dimer and trimer lattices, with the combination of solid-state defects and diamond phononic (optomechanical) crystals. The dimer and trimer lattices used are an array of coupled phononic cavities with spatially modulated hopping rates. We predict a series of unconventional sound-matter interaction phenomena in this hybrid quantum system. In the dimer lattice we show the formation of chiral spin-phonon bound states and topology-dependent phononic collective radiation. While in the trimer lattice, chiral bound states still exist and the spin relaxation is sublattice dependent. The chiral bound states existing in both types of lattices are robust to a large amount of disorder, which can mediate chiral and robust spin-spin interactions. This work provides a promising platform for phonon-based quantum information processing and quantum simulation.

TI Coherent Quantum Network of Superconducting Qubits as a Highly Sensitive
   Detector of Microwave Photons for Searching of Galactic Axions
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB We propose a novel approach to detect a low power microwave signal with a frequency of the order of several GHz based on a coherent collective response of quantum states occurring in a superconducting qubits network (SQN). An SQN composes of a large number of superconducting qubits embedded in a low-dissipative superconducting resonator. Our theory predicts that an SQN interacting with the off-resonance microwave radiation, demonstrates the collective alternating current Stark effect that can be measured even in the limit of single photon counting. A design of the layout of three terminals SQN detectors containing 10 flux qubits weakly coupled to a low-dissipative R-resonator and T-transmission line was developed. The samples were fabricated by Al-based technology with Nb resonator. The SQN detector was tested in terms of microwave measurements of scattering parameters and two-tone spectroscopy. A substantial shift of the frequency position of the transmission coefficient drop induced by a second tone pump signal was observed, and this effect clearly manifests a nonlinear multiphoton interaction between the second-tone microwave pump signal and an array of qubits.

TI Minimal port-based teleportation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB There are two types of port-based teleportation (PBT) protocols: deterministic-when the state always arrives to the receiver but is imperfectly transmitted and probabilistic-when the state reaches the receiver intact with high probability. We introduce the minimal set of requirements that define a feasible PBT protocol and construct a simple PBT protocol that satisfies these requirements: it teleports an unknown state of a qubit with success probability p(succ) = 1- N+2 /2(N+1) and fidelity 1- O(1/N) with the resource state consisting of N maximally entangled states. This protocol is not reducible from either the deterministic or probabilistic PBT protocol. We define the corresponding efficient superdense coding protocols which transmit more classical bits with fewer maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we introduce rigorous methods for comparing and converting between different PBT protocols.

TI Demonstrate chiral spin currents with nontrivial interactions in

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum many-body systems in which time-reversal symmetry is broken give rise to a wealth of exotic phases, and thus constitute one of the frontiers of modern condensed matter physics. Quantum simulation allows us to better understand many-body systems with huge Hilbert space, where classical simulation is usually inefficient. With superconducting quantum circuit as a platform for quantum simulation, we realize synthetic Abelian gauge fields by using microwave drive and tunable coupling in loop configurations to break the time-reversal symmetry of the system. Based on high-precision manipulation and readout of circuit-QED architecture, we demonstrate the chiral ground spin current of a time-reversal symmetry broken system with nontrivial interactions. Our work is a significant attempt to simulate quantum many-body systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking in multi-qubit superconducting processors.

TI Experimental quantum imaging distillation with undetected light
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Imaging based on the induced coherence effect makes use of photon pairs to obtain information of an object without detecting the light that probes it. While one photon illuminates the object, only its partner is detected, so no measurement of coincidence events is needed. The sought-after object's information is revealed, observing a certain interference pattern on the detected photon. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that this imaging technique can be made resilient to noise. We introduce an imaging distillation approach based on the interferometric modulation of the signal of interest. We show that our scheme can generate a high-quality image of an object even against noise levels up to 250 times the actual signal of interest. We also include a detailed theoretical explanation of our findings.

AB Robust qubit-qubit interactions mediated by bosonic modes are central to many quantum technologies. Existing proposals combining fast oscillator-mediated gates with dynamical decoupling require strong pulses or fast control over the qubit-boson coupling. Here, we present a method based on dynamical decoupling techniques that leads to faster-than-dispersive entanglement gates with low-intensity pulses. Our method is general, i.e., it is applicable to any quantum platform that has qubits interacting with bosonic mediators via longitudinal coupling. Moreover, the protocol provides robustness to fluctuations in qubit frequencies and control fields, while also being resistant to common errors such as frequency shifts and heating in the mediator as well as crosstalk effects. We illustrate our method with an implementation for trapped ions coupled via magnetic field gradients. With detailed numerical simulations, we show that entanglement gates with infidelities of 10(-3) or 10(-4) are possible with current or near-future experimental setups, respectively.
   The generation of entanglement in qubit-oscillator systems is often hindered by low-intensity driving fields, and limited control of qubit-oscillator coupling. The authors design a general method to achieve robust entanglement gates using low-intensity dynamical-decoupling pulses with non-tuneable qubit-oscillator coupling.

TI Geometric quantum information structure in quantum fields and their
   lattice simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB An upper limit to distillable entanglement between two disconnected regions of massless noninteracting scalar field theory has an exponential decay defined by a geometric decay constant. When regulated at short distances with a spatial lattice, this entanglement abruptly vanishes beyond a dimensionless separation, defining a negativity sphere. In two spatial dimensions, we determine this geometric decay constant between a pair of disks and the growth of the negativity sphere toward the continuum through a series of lattice calculations. Making the connection to quantum field theories in three-spatial dimensions, assuming such quantum information scales appear also in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a new relative scale may be present in effective field theories describing the low-energy dynamics of nucleons and nuclei. We highlight potential impacts of the distillable entanglement structure on effective field theories, lattice QCD calculations and future quantum simulations.

TI One-dimensional pseudoharmonic oscillator: classical remarks and
   quantum-information theory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Motion along semi-infinite straight line in a potential that is a combination of positive quadratic and inverse quadratic functions of the position is considered with the emphasis on the analysis of its quantum-information properties. Classical measure of symmetry of the potential is proposed and its dependence on the particle energy and the factor a describing a relative strength of its constituents is described; in particular, it is shown that a variation of the parameter a alters the shape from the half harmonic oscillator (HHO) at a = 0 to the perfectly symmetric one of the double frequency oscillator (DFO) in the limit of huge a. Quantum consideration focuses on the analysis of information theoretical measures, such as standard deviations, Shannon, Renyi and Tsallis entropies together with Fisher information, Onicescu energy and non-Gaussianity. For doing this, among others, a method of calculating momentum waveforms is proposed that results in their analytic expressions in form of the confluent hypergeometric functions. Increasing parameter a modifies the measures in such a way that they gradually transform into those corresponding to the DFO what, in particular, means that the lowest orbital saturates Heisenberg, Shannon, Renyi and Tsallis uncertainty relations with the corresponding position and momentum non-Gaussianities turning to zero. A simple expression is derived of the orbital-independent lower threshold of the semi-infinite range of the dimensionless Renyi/Tsallis coefficient where momentum components of these one-parameter entropies exist which shows that it varies between 1/4 at HHO and zero when a tends to infinity. Physical interpretation of obtained mathematical results is provided.

TI Polarizing electron spins with a superconducting flux qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Electron-spin resonance is a useful tool to investigate properties of materials in magnetic fields where high spin polarization of target electron spins is required in order to obtain high sensitivity. However, the smaller the magnetic fields becomes, the more difficult it is to obtain high polarization by thermalization. Here, we propose to employ a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) to polarize electron spins actively. We have to overcome a large energy difference between the FQ and electron spins for efficient energy transfer among them. For this purpose, we adopt a spin-lock technique on the FQ where the Rabi frequency associated with the spin-locking can match the resonance (Larmor) one of the electron spins. We find that adding dephasing on the spins is beneficial to obtain high polarization of them, because otherwise the electron spins are trapped in dark states that cannot be coupled with the FQ. We show that our scheme can achieve high polarization of electron spins in realistic experimental conditions.

TI Quantum Rayleigh problem and thermocoherent Onsager relations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The role of quantum coherence and correlations in heat flow and equilibration is investigated by exploring the Rayleigh's dynamical problem to equilibration in the quantum regime and following Onsager's approach to thermoelectricity. Specifically, we consider a qubit bombarded by two-qubit projectiles from a side. For arbitrary collision times and initial states, we develop the master equation for sequential and collective collisions. By deriving the Fokker-Planck equation out of the master equation, we identify the quantum version of the Rayleigh's heat conduction equation. We find that quantum discord and entanglement shared between the projectiles can contribute to genuine heat flow only when they are associated with so-called heat-exchange coherences. Analogous to Onsager's use of Rayleigh's principle of least dissipation of energy, we use the entropy production rate to identify the coherence current. Both coherence and heat flows can be written in the form of quantum Onsager relations, from which we predict coherent Peltier and coherent Seebeck effects. The effects can be optimized by the collision times and collectivity. Finally, we discuss some of the possible experimental realizations and technological applications of the thermocoherent phenomena in different platforms.

TI Deep Learning-Based Optimization of Underwater QKD Systems With
   Time-Gated SPADs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we consider underwater quantum key distribution (QKD) systems with time-gated single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) and present a comprehensive performance analysis and optimization. We utilize a deep learning model for the system optimization. We first perform Monte Carlo simulations for a subset of possible scenarios and train the deep learning model on them. Then, we use this model to instantly extract the optimum values for possible underwater scenarios. Our study provides critical insights on determining the optimal bit time, field of view (FoV), and gate time in underwater QKD. Through a meticulous analysis of the propagation delay and angle of arrival results, we determine the bit time and FoV, respectively, by striking a balance between the average number of received photons and background noise. Afterwards, using the proper bit time and FoV from the previous steps, we determine the optimal gate times in the sense of minimizing the quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our findings reveal that the proposed method significantly improves QBER, with enhancements reaching up to two orders of magnitude across different link lengths.

TI Experimental full calibration of quantum devices in a
   semi-device-independent way
SO OPTICA
AB Semi-device-independent (SDI) methods offer a credible way to calibrate preparation and measurement devices simultaneously in quantum information processing, using only prior knowledge such as the Hilbert space dimension. To date, the SDI method is restricted to a few state paradigms, which impedes its broader applications. Recently, Tavakoli [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 150503 (2020)] proposed an SDI scheme to certify t-designs with discrete and symmetric structures. In this work, we bridge the gap between discrete and continuous structures with a concept termed "covering angle," while maintaining the SDI feature. This concept enables us to evaluate a quantum device's ability to generate arbitrary quantum states in a Hilbert space via calibrating a certain t-design. This so-called full calibration method is further tailored to be tolerant of errors in realistic state production. We demonstrate this full calibration scheme for a qubit system with various t-designs and show that it renders SDI certificates for quantum key distribution, quantum random number generation, and magic state distillability.

TI Mechanical Control of a Single Nuclear Spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Nuclear spins interact weakly with their environment and therefore exhibit long coherence times. This has led to their use as memory qubits in quantum information platforms, where they are controlled via electromagnetic waves. Scaling up such platforms comes with challenges in terms of power efficiency, as well as cross-talk between devices. Here, we demonstrate coherent control of a single nuclear spin using surface acoustic waves. We use mechanically driven Ramsey and spin-echo sequences to show that the nuclear spin retains its excellent coherence properties. We estimate that this approach requires 2-3 orders of magnitude less power than more conventional control methods. Furthermore, this technique is scalable because of the possibility of guiding acoustic waves and reduced cross-talk between different acoustic channels. This work demonstrates the use of mechanical waves for complex quantum control sequences, offers an advantageous alternative to the standard electromagnetic control of nuclear spins, and opens prospects for incorporating nuclear spins in mechanically interfaced hybrid quantum architectures.

TI Gravity, Quantum Fields and Quantum Information: Problems with Classical
   Channel and Stochastic Theories
SO ENTROPY
AB In recent years an increasing number of papers have attempted to mimic or supplant quantum field theory in discussions of issues related to gravity by the tools and through the perspective of quantum information theory, often in the context of alternative quantum theories. In this article, we point out three common problems in such treatments. First, we show that the notion of interactions mediated by an information channel is not, in general, equivalent to the treatment of interactions by quantum field theory. When used to describe gravity, this notion may lead to inconsistencies with general relativity. Second, we point out that in general one cannot replace a quantum field by a classical stochastic field, or mock up the effects of quantum fluctuations by that of classical stochastic sources (noises), because in so doing important quantum features such as coherence and entanglement will be left out. Third, we explain how under specific conditions semi-classical and stochastic theories indeed can be formulated from their quantum origins and play a role at certain regimes of interest.

TI Circuit complexity as a novel probe of quantum entanglement: A study
   with black hole gas in arbitrary dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this article, we investigate the quantum circuit complexity and entanglement entropy in the recently studied black hole gas framework using the two-mode squeezed states formalism written in arbitrary dimensional spatially flat cosmological Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker background space-time. We compute the various complexity measures and study the evolution of these complexities by following two different prescriptions viz the covariant matrix method and Nielsen's method. Independently, using the two-mode squeezed states formalism we also compute the Renyi and von-Neumann entanglement entropy, which show an inherent connection between the entanglement entropy and quantum circuit complexity. We study the behavior of the complexity measures and entanglement entropy separately for three different spatial dimensions and observe various significant different features in three spatial dimensions on the evolution of these quantities with respect to the scale factor. Furthermore, we also study the underlying behavior of the equilibrium temperature with two of the most essential quantities i.e., rate of change of complexity with scale factor and the entanglement entropy. We observe that irrespective of the spatial dimension, the equilibrium temperature depends quartically on entanglement entropy.

TI Use of Quantum Differential Equations in Sonic Processes
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES
AB Emerging as a new field, quantum computation has reinvented the fundamentals of Computer Science and knowledge theory in a manner consistent with quantum physics. The fact that quantum computation has superior features and new events than classical computation provides benefits in proving mathematical theories. With advances in technology, the nonlinear partial differential equations are used in almost every area, and many difficulties have been overcome by the solutions of these equations. In particular, the complex solutions of KdV and Burgers equations have been shown to be used in modeling a simple turbulence flow. In this study, Burger-like equation with complex solutions is defined in Hilbert space and solved with an example. In addition, these solutions were analyzed. Thanks to the Quantum Burgers-Like equation, the nonlinear differential equation is solved by linearizing. The pattern changes of time made the result linear. This means that the Quantum Burgers-Like equation can be used to smoothen the sonic processing.

TI Wigner quasi-probability distribution of a resonator coherent field
   interacting with a flux qubit via two-photon coupling
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The Wigner quasi-probability distribution function is an important tool for estimating the quantumness of quantum states. The Wigner distribution function (WDF) is related monotonically to the coherent field state density operator and their probability distributions. In this paper, we analyze the time-dependent resonator coherent field states produced by a flux qubit's interaction with a resonator-field through a two-photon coupling. The WDF dynamics of the coherent field states is investigated under the effects of the qubit-resonator detuning and the intrinsic decoherence. The WDF non-classicality associated with the mixedness resonator entropy dynamics can be controlled by varying the qubit-resonator interaction, detuning as well as the decoherence. The intrinsic decoherence clearly affects the WDF non-classicality, identified by the negative values of the WDF. Finally, by fixing one or both of the complex phase space components, we are able to explore the dynamics of the Wigner-distribution functions.

TI dc atomtronic quantum interference device: Quantum superposition of
   persistent-current states and a parity-protected qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A generalized Bose-Hubbard model in a two-mode approximation is applied to study the rotational dynamics of a direct-current atomtronic quantum interference device. Modified values of on-site interaction and pairtunneling parameters of the Hamiltonian, derived from the small-oscillation periods of the Josephson modes, are shown to provide an excellent agreement to the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation results for the whole rotational frequency range, reaching also the critical values of imbalance and current. This amounts to a full validation of the semiclassical approximation of the modified Hamiltonian, whose quantization is employed to investigate the quantum features of the stationary states. Focusing on the frequency interval where the potential energy presents two minima, it is shown that the central frequency, at which such minima are symmetric, yields an atom number parity-protected qubit with a maximum entanglement of both persistent-current states, similar to those of superconducting circuits threaded by a half quantum of applied flux. Such a parity protection scheme survives within a small interval around the central frequency, which sets the minimum rotational frequency precision that should be required to implement the qubit. It is found that such a maximum admissible error in the frequency determination turns out to be inversely proportional to the qubit quality factor that measures the gap between the qubit energy levels and the following levels. It is shown that the chemical potential or condensate particle number could be employed as suitable control parameters to achieve the best trade-off between such qubit characteristics.

TI Universal Fidelity Reduction of Quantum Operations from Weak Dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum information processing is in real systems often limited by dissipation, stemming from remaining uncontrolled interaction with microscopic degrees of freedom. Given recent experimental progress, we consider weak dissipation, resulting in a small error probability per operation. Here, we find a simple formula for the fidelity reduction of any desired quantum operation, where the ideal evolution is confined to the computational subspace. Interestingly, this reduction is independent of the specific operation; it depends only on the operation time and the dissipation. Using our formula, we investigate the situation where dissipation in different parts of the system has correlations, which is detrimental for the successful application of quantum error correction. Surprisingly, we find that a large class of correlations gives the same fidelity reduction as uncorrelated dissipation of similar strength.

TI Topological Quantum State Control through Exceptional-Point Proximity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the quantum evolution of a non-Hermitian qubit realized as a submanifold of a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Real-time tuning of the system parameters to encircle an exceptional point results in nonreciprocal quantum state transfer. We further observe chiral geometric phases accumulated under state transport, verifying the quantum coherent nature of the evolution in the complex energy landscape and distinguishing between coherent and incoherent effects associated with exceptional point encircling. Our work demonstrates an entirely new method for control over quantum state vectors, highlighting new facets of quantum bath engineering enabled through dynamical non-Hermitian control.

TI Large-Scale On-Chip Integration of Gate-Voltage Addressable Hybrid
   Superconductor-Semiconductor Quantum Wells Field Effect Nano-Switch
   Arrays
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Stable, reproducible, scalable, addressable, and controllable hybrid superconductor-semiconductor (S-Sm) junctions and switches are key circuit elements and building blocks of gate-based quantum processors. The electrostatic field effect produced by the split gate voltages facilitates the realization of nano-switches that can control the conductance or current in the hybrid S-Sm circuits based on 2D semiconducting electron systems. Here, a novel realization of large-scale scalable, and gate voltage controllable hybrid field effect quantum chips is experimentally demonstrated. Each chip contains arrays of split gate field effect hybrid junctions, that work as conductance switches, and are made from In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells integrated with Nb superconducting electronic circuits. Each hybrid junction in the chip can be controlled and addressed through its corresponding source-drain and two global split gate contact pads that allow switching between their (super)conducting and insulating states. A total of 18 quantum chips are fabricated with 144 field effect hybrid Nb- In0.75Ga0.25As 2DEG-Nb quantum wires and the electrical response, switching voltage (on/off) statistics, quantum yield, and reproducibility of several devices at cryogenic temperatures are investigated. The proposed integrated quantum device architecture allows control of individual junctions in a large array on a chip useful for emerging cryogenic quantum technologies.
   Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor integrated circuits are vital in quantum technology. Researchers have demonstrated scalable and addressable quantum hardware featuring large-scale split gate field effect hybrid nanojunctions made from quantum wells integrated with superconducting circuits. The fabrication of 18 quantum chips with 144 such junctions is reported. This technology holds promise for robust cryogenic nanoelectronic circuits and fault-tolerant quantum applications.image

TI Quantum state preparation and nonunitary evolution with diagonal
   operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Realizing nonunitary transformations on unitary-gate-based quantum devices is critically important for simu-lating a variety of physical problems, including open quantum systems and subnormalized quantum states. We present a dilation-based algorithm to simulate nonunitary operations using probabilistic quantum computing with only one ancilla qubit. We utilize the singular-value decomposition (SVD) to decompose any general quantum operator into a product of two unitary operators and a diagonal nonunitary operator, which we show can be implemented by a diagonal unitary operator in a one-qubit dilated space. While dilation techniques increase the number of qubits in the calculation, and thus the gate complexity, our algorithm limits the operations required in the dilated space to a diagonal unitary operator, which has known circuit decompositions. We use this algorithm to prepare random subnormalized two-level states on a quantum device with high fidelity. Furthermore, we present the accurate nonunitary dynamics of two-level open quantum systems in a dephasing channel and an amplitude-damping channel computed on a quantum device. The algorithm presented will be most useful for implementing general nonunitary operations when the SVD can be readily computed, which is the case for most operators in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era.

TI Quantum Kernels for Real-World Predictions Based on Electronic Health
   Records
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Research on near-term quantum machine learning has explored how classical machine learning algorithms endowed with access to quantum kernels (similarity measures) can outperform their purely classical counterparts. Although theoretical work has shown a provable advantage on synthetic data sets, no work done to date has studied empirically whether the quantum advantage is attainable and with what data. In this article, we report the first systematic investigation of empirical quantum advantage (EQA) in healthcare and life sciences and propose an end-to-end framework to study EQA. We selected electronic health records data subsets and created a configuration space of 5-20 features and 200-300 training samples. For each configuration coordinate, we trained classical support vector machine models based on radial basis function kernels and quantum models with custom kernels using an IBM quantum computer, making this one of the largest quantum machine learning experiments to date. We empirically identified regimes where quantum kernels could provide an advantage and introduced a terrain ruggedness index, a metric to help quantitatively estimate how the accuracy of a given model will perform. The generalizable framework introduced here represents a key step toward a priori identification of data sets where quantum advantage could exist.

TI Geometric conditions for saturating the data processing inequality
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The data processing inequality (DPI) is a scalar inequality satisfied by distinguishability measures on density matrices. For some distinguishability measures, saturation of the scalar DPI implies an operator equation relating the arguments of the measure. These results are typically derived using functional analytic techniques. In a complementary approach, we use geometric techniques to derive a formula that gives an operator equation from DPI saturation for any distinguishability measure; moreover, for a broad class of distinguishability measures, the derived operator equation is sufficient to imply saturation as well. Our operator equation coincides with known results for the sandwiched Renyi relative entropies, and gives new results for alpha-z Renyi relative entropies and a family of of quantum f-divergences, which we compute explicitly.

TI Quantum sensing of paramagnetic analytes by nanodiamonds in levitated
   microdroplets and aqueous solutions
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Nanodiamonds (ND) hosting negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) color centers have received attention for applications in magnetic field, electric field, chemical, and bio-sensing. The versatility of these probes is their excellent room-temperature optical and spin properties, along with their small size, functionalized surfaces and resistance to bleaching, making them ideal as nanoscopic sensors in picoliter volumes (e.g. single cells, but also microcompartments and aerosols). For quantitative ND-NV- sensing of paramagnetic analytes in such contexts, however, there remains an incomplete understanding of how factors related to the aqueous phase environment control detection efficiency. To address this, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is measured in bulk macroscale solutions and single levitated microdroplets as a function of Gd+3 concentration (340 nM to 1.5 mM), nanodiamond size, pH, competitor ions, and ligands. The ODMR response to [Gd+3] is found to be nonlinear, and pH, ND and sample volume dependent; indicating the detection of Gd+3 requires efficient adsorption of the analyte to the diamond surface. Langmuir adsorption isotherms embedded in a quantitative photophysical model links the ODMR response to adsorption thermodynamics of Gd+3. The equilibrium constant for Gd+3 adsorption to a carboxylated ND surface is determined to be (1 +/- 0.5) x 105 M-1 corresponding to a free energy of adsorption of (-28 +/- 1) kJ mol-1. These results provide general insight into how complex aqueous and microscale environments impact nanodiamond based quantum sensing modalities, and portend their application as quantitative chemical sensors in microenvironments.

TI Flat-Band (De)localization Emulated with a Superconducting Qubit Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.

TI Gate operations for superconducting qubits and non-Markovianity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While the accuracy of qubit operations has been greatly improved in the last decade, further development is demanded to achieve the ultimate goal: a fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve real-world problems more efficiently than classical computers. With growing fidelities even subtle effects of environmental noise such as qubit-reservoir correlations and non-Markovian dynamics turn into the focus for both circuit design and control. To guide progress, we disclose, in a numerically rigorous manner, a comprehensive picture of the single-qubit dynamics in presence of a broad class of noise sources and for entire sequences of gate operations. Thermal reservoirs ranging from Ohmic to deep 1/f epsilon-like sub-Ohmic behavior are considered to imitate realistic scenarios for superconducting qubits. Apart from dynamical features, fidelities of the qubit performance over entire sequences are analyzed as a figure of merit. The relevance of retarded feedback and long-range qubit- reservoir correlations is demonstrated on a quantitative level, thus, providing a deeper understanding of the limitations of performances for current devices and guiding the design of future ones.

TI Classification of four qubit states and their stabilisers under SLOCC
   operations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We classify four qubit states under SLOCC operations, that is, we classify the orbits of the group SL(2, C)(4) on the Hilbert space H-4 = (C-2)(circle times 4). We approach the classification by realising this representation as a symmetric space of maximal rank. We first describe general methods for classifying the orbits of such a space. We then apply these methods to obtain the orbits in our special case, resulting in a complete and irredundant classification of SL(2, C)(4)-orbits on H-4. It follows that an element of (C-2)(circle times 4) is conjugate to an element of precisely 87 classes of elements. Each of these classes either consists of one element or of a parameterised family of elements, and the elements in the same class all have equal stabiliser in SL(2, C)(4). We also present a complete and irredundant classification of elements and stabilisers up to the action of Sym4 (sic) SL(2, C)(4) where Sym4 permutes the four tensor factors of (C-2)(circle times 4).

TI Toward liquid cell quantum sensing: Ytterbium complexes with ultranarrow
   absorption
SO SCIENCE
AB The energetic disorder induced by fluctuating liquid environments acts in opposition to the precise control required for coherence-based sensing. Overcoming fluctuations requires a protected quantum subspace that only weakly interacts with the local environment. We report a ytterbium complex that exhibited an ultranarrow absorption linewidth in solution at room temperature with a full width at half maximum of 0.625 milli-electron volts. Using spectral hole burning, we measured an even narrower linewidth of 410 pico-electron volts at 77 kelvin. Narrow linewidths allowed low-field magnetic circular dichroism at room temperature, used to sense Earth-scale magnetic fields. These results demonstrated that ligand protection in lanthanide complexes could substantially diminish electronic state fluctuations. We have termed this system an "atomlike molecular sensor" (ALMS) and proposed approaches to improve its performance.

TI Quasiparticle tunneling and 1/f charge noise in ultrastrongly
   coupled superconducting qubit and resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We report on an experimentally observed doubly split spectrum and its split-width fluctuation due to charge fluctuation in an ultrastrongly coupled superconducting qubit and resonator. From an analysis of the circuit model Hamiltonian, we found that the doubly split spectrum and split-width fluctuation are caused by discrete charge hops due to quasiparticle tunneling and a continuous background charge fluctuation in islands of a flux qubit. During 70 h of spectrum measurement, the split width fluctuated but the middle frequency of the split was constant. This observation indicates that the quasiparticles in our device mainly tunnel in one particular junction, as expected from the energy difference between quasiparticle states, during this 70 h. The background offset charge obtained from the split width has the 1/f noise characteristic.

TI Trotter Errors from Dynamical Structural Instabilities of Floquet Maps
   in Quantum Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the behavior of errors in the quantum simulation of spin systems with long-range multibody interactions resulting from the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the time-evolution operator. We identify a regime where the Floquet operator underlying the Trotter decomposition undergoes sharp changes even for small variations in the simulation step size. This results in a time evolution operator that is very different from the dynamics generated by the targeted Hamiltonian, which leads to a proliferation of errors in the quantum simulation. These regions of sharp change in the Floquet operator, referred to as structural instability regions, appear typically at intermediate Trotter step sizes and in the weakly interacting regime, and are thus complementary to recently revealed quantum chaotic regimes of the Trotterized evolution [L. M. Sieberer et al. npj Quantum Inf. 5, 78 (2019); M. Heyl, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller, Sci. Adv. 5, eaau8342 (2019)]. We characterize these structural instability regimes in p -spin models, transverse-field Ising models with all-to-all p -body interactions, and analytically predict their occurrence based on unitary perturbation theory. We further show that the effective Hamiltonian associated with the Trotter decomposition of the unitary time-evolution operator, when the Trotter step size is chosen to be in the structural instability region, is very different from the target Hamiltonian, which explains the large errors that can occur in the simulation in the regions of instability. These results have implications for the reliability of near-term gate-based quantum simulators, and reveal an important interplay between errors and the physical properties of the system being simulated.

TI Degeneracy-breaking and long-lived multimode microwave electromechanical
   systems enabled by cubic silicon-carbide membrane crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cubic silicon-carbide crystals (3C-SiC), known for their high thermal conductivity and in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality (Q) mechanical oscillators. We reveal degeneracy-breaking phenomena in 3C-phase crystalline silicon-carbide membrane and present high-Q mechanical modes in pairs or clusters. The 3C-SiC material demonstrates excellent microwave compatibility with superconducting circuits. Thus, we can establish a coherent electromechanical interface, enabling precise control over 21 high-Q mechanical modes from a single 3C-SiC square membrane. Benefiting from extremely high mechanical frequency stability, this interface enables tunable light slowing with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of an hour. Coherent energy transfer between distinct mechanical modes are also presented. In this work, the studied 3C-SiC membrane crystal with their significant properties of multiple acoustic modes and high-quality factors, provide unique opportunities for the encoding, storage, and transmission of quantum information via bosonic phonon channels.

TI Locality of three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-symmetric states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The hierarchy of nonlocality and entanglement in multipartite systems is one of the fundamental problems in quantum physics. We study this topic in three-qubit systems considering the entanglement classification of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). The equivalence under SLOCC divides threequbit states into separable, biseparable, W, and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) classes. The W and GHZ are two subclasses of genuine tripartite entanglement. We adopt the family of GHZ-symmetric states as a research subject, which share the symmetries of the GHZ state and have a complete characterization of SLOCC classes. In the biseparable region (with bipartite entanglement), there exist GHZ-symmetric states that are found to be fully local. In addition, there are bilocal states in both the W and GHZ classes. That is, neither of the subclasses of genuine tripartite entanglement can ensure genuinely tripartite nonlocality.

TI Tight scaling of key rate for differential-phase-shift quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The performance of quantum key distribution protocols is evaluated based on the ease of implementation and key generation rate. Among major protocols, the differential-phase-shift (DPS) protocol has the advantage of simple implementation using a train of coherent pulses and a passive detection unit. Unfortunately, however, its key rate is known to be at least proportional to ri2 with respect to channel transmission ri -> 0. If one can only prove the rate proportional to ri2 and cannot improve the analysis beyond that, then the DPS protocol will be deemed inferior to other major protocols, such as the decoy BB84 protocol. In this paper, we consider a type of DPS protocol in which the phase of each emitted block comprising n pulses is randomized and significantly improves the analysis of its key rate. Specifically, we reveal that the key rate is proportional to ri1+1 n-2 and this scaling is tight. This implies that the DPS protocol can achieve a key rate proportional to ri for a large number of n, which is the same scaling as the decoy BB84 protocol. Our result suggests that the DPS protocol can achieve a combination of both advantages of ease of implementation and a high key generation rate.

TI Magnetic, Mechanically Interlocked Porphyrin-Carbon Nanotubes for
   Quantum Computation and Spintronics
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Atomic-scale reproducibility and tunability endorse magnetic molecules as candidates for spin qubits and spintronics. A major challenge is to implant those molecular spins into circuit geometries that may allow one, two, or a few spins to be addressed in a controlled way. Here, the formation of mechanically bonded, magnetic porphyrin dimeric rings around carbon nanotubes (mMINTs) is presented. The mechanical bond places the porphyrin magnetic cores in close contact with the carbon nanotube without disturbing their structures. A combination of spectroscopic techniques shows that the magnetic geometry of the dimers is preserved upon formation of the macrocycle and the mMINT. Moreover, the metallic core selection determines the spin location in the mMINT. The suitability of mMINTs as qubits is explored by measuring their quantum coherence times (T-m). Formation of the dimeric ring preserves the T-m found in the monomer, which remains in the mu s scale for mMINTs. The carbon nanotube is used as vessel to place the molecules in complex circuits. This strategy can be extended to other families of magnetic molecules. The size and composition of the macrocycle can be tailored to modulate magnetic interactions between the cores and to introduce magnetic asymmetries (heterometallic dimers) for more complex molecule-based qubits.

TI Quantum measurement encoding for quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Preserving the precision of the parameter of interest in the presence of environmental decoherence is an important yet challenging task in dissipative quantum sensing. In this work, we study quantum metrology when the decoherence effect is unraveled by a set of quantum measurements, dubbed quantum measurement encoding. In our case, the estimation parameter is encoded into a quantum state through a quantum measurement, unlike the parameter encoding through a unitary channel in the decoherence-free case or trace-preserving quantum channels in the case of decoherence. We identify conditions for a precision-preserving measurement encoding. These conditions can be employed to transfer metrological information from one subsystem to another through quantum measurements. Furthermore, postselected non-Hermitian sensing can also be viewed as quantum sensing with measurement encoding. When the precision-preserving conditions are violated in non-Hermitian sensing, we derive a universal formula for the loss of precision.

TI Entanglement degradation in the presence of Markovian noise: A

AB Adopting a statistical approach we study the degradation of entanglement of a quantum system under the action of an ensemble of randomly distributed Markovian noise. This enables us to address scenarios where only limited information is available on the mechanisms that rule the noisy evolution of the model. As an application, we characterize the statistic of entanglement deterioration for a quantum memory formed by n qudits that undergo randomly distributed local, uniform, Markovian noise evolution.

TI Origin of Low-Frequency Noise in Si n-MOSFET at Cryogenic Temperatures:
   The Effect of Interface Quality
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study investigates the origin of low-frequency (LF) 1/f noise in Si n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (n-MOSFETs) under cryogenic operation. The fluctuation of the drain current increased with decreasing temperature, exhibiting LF 1/f noise of more than two orders of magnitude higher at 2.5 K compared with that at 300 K. As revealed by the temperature dependence of the normalized current spectral density, the LF 1/f noise at 2.5 K is primarily governed by carrier number fluctuations. To obtain insight into the carrier trapping centers under cryogenic operation, we investigate the effect of oxide/Si interface states on the LF 1/f noise by utilizing Si n-MOSFETs with different surface orientations, i.e., different interface trap densities (D-it). The LF 1/f noise is comparable between the surface orientations at 300 K, whereas excess noise was observed at 2.5 K for the surface orientation with higher D-it in the order of (100)<(120)<=(110)-orientations. This indicates that the LF 1/f noise at cryogenic temperatures originates from oxide/Si interface defects and disorders, that is, the interface states and band tail states. These states are localized at the conduction-band edge, which contributes to noise generation as the Fermi level approaches the conduction-band edge at cryogenic temperatures. This study demonstrates the significance of the oxide/Si interface quality in suppressing the LF 1/f noise in Si MOS devices operated at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Clock-offset recovery with sublinear complexity enables synchronization
   on low-level hardware for quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We introduce iQSync, a clock-offset recovery method designed for implementation on low-level hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays or microcontrollers, for quantum key distribution (QKD). iQSync requires minimal memory, only a simple instruction set (e.g., no floating-point operations), and can be evaluated with sublinear time complexity, typically involving no more than a few thousand iterations of a simple loop. Furthermore, iQSync allows for a precise clock-offset recovery within a few seconds, even for large offsets, and is well suited for scenarios with high channel loss and low signal-to-noise ratio, irrespective of the prepare-and-measure QKD protocol used. We implemented the method on our QKD platform, demonstrating its performance and conformity with analytically derived success probabilities for channel attenuations exceeding 70 dB.

TI Modular Synthesis of Efficient Quantum Uncomputation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB A key challenge of quantum programming is uncomputation: the reversible deallocation of qubits. And while there has been much recent progress on automating uncomputation, state-of-the-art methods are insufficient for handling today's expressive quantum programming languages. A core reason is that they operate on primitive quantum circuits, while quantum programs express computations beyond circuits, for instance, they can capture families of circuits defined recursively in terms of uncomputation and adjoints. In this paper, we introduce the first modular automatic approach to synthesize correct and efficient uncomputation for expressive quantum programs. Our method is based on two core technical contributions: (i) an intermediate representation (IR) that can capture expressive quantum programs and comes with support for uncomputation, and (ii) modular algorithms over that IR for synthesizing uncomputation and adjoints. We have built a complete end-to-end implementation of our method, including an implementation of the IR and the synthesis algorithms, as well as a translation from an expressive fragment of the Silq programming language to our IR and circuit generation from the IR. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can handle programs beyond the capabilities of existing uncomputation approaches, while being competitive on the benchmarks they can handle. More broadly, we show that it is possible to benefit from the greater expressivity and safety offered by high-level quantum languages without sacrificing efficiency.

TI Implementation of Fault-Tolerant Encoding Circuit Based on Stabilizer
   Implementation and "Flag" Bits in Steane Code
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is an effective way to overcome quantum noise and de-coherence, meanwhile the fault tolerance of the encoding circuit, syndrome measurement circuit, and logical gate realization circuit must be ensured so as to achieve reliable quantum computing. Steane code is one of the most famous codes, proposed in 1996, however, the classical encoding circuit based on stabilizer implementation is not fault-tolerant. In this paper, we propose a method to design a fault-tolerant encoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code based on stabilizer implementation and "flag" bits. We use the Steane code as an example to depict in detail the fault-tolerant encoding circuit design process including the logical operation implementation, the stabilizer implementation, and the "flag" qubits design. The simulation results show that assuming only one quantum gate will be wrong with a certain probability p, the classical encoding circuit will have logic errors proportional to p; our proposed circuit is fault-tolerant as with the help of the "flag" bits, all types of errors in the encoding process can be accurately and uniquely determined, the errors can be fixed. If all the gates will be wrong with a certain probability p, which is the actual situation, the proposed encoding circuit will also be wrong with a certain probability, but its error rate has been reduced greatly from p to p(2) compared with the original circuit. This encoding circuit design process can be extended to other CSS codes to improve the correctness of the encoding circuit.

TI Non-Parametric Semi-Supervised Learning in Many-Body Hilbert Space with
   Rescaled Logarithmic Fidelity
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, a key step is to embed the data in the quantum space known as Hilbert space. Studying quantum kernel function, which defines the distances among the samples in the Hilbert space, belongs to the fundamental topics in this direction. In this work, we propose a tunable quantum-inspired kernel function (QIKF) named rescaled logarithmic fidelity (RLF) and a non-parametric algorithm for the semi-supervised learning in the quantum space. The rescaling takes advantage of the non-linearity of the kernel to tune the mutual distances of samples in the Hilbert space, and meanwhile avoids the exponentially-small fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. Being non-parametric excludes the possible effects from the variational parameters, and evidently demonstrates the properties of the kernel itself. Our results on the hand-written digits (MNIST dataset) and movie reviews (IMDb dataset) support the validity of our method, by comparing with the standard fidelity as the QIKF as well as several well-known non-parametric algorithms (naive Bayes classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, and spectral clustering). High accuracy is demonstrated, particularly for the unsupervised case with no labeled samples and the few-shot cases with small numbers of labeled samples. With the visualizations by t-stochastic neighbor embedding, our results imply that the machine learning in the Hilbert space complies with the principles of maximal coding rate reduction, where the low-dimensional data exhibit within-class compressibility, between-class discrimination, and overall diversity. The proposed QIKF and semi-supervised algorithm can be further combined with the parametric models such as tensor networks, quantum circuits, and quantum neural networks.

TI MODEL OF A THREE-QUBIT CLUSTER IN A THERMAL BATH
SO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE STUDY OF CLUSTERS NANOSTRUCTURES
   AND NANOMATERIALS
AB This work studies a mathematical model of a quantum cluster consisting of three qubits and being in thermal equilibrium with the environment. The effective Hamiltonian is invariant under permutations of qubits and consists of two parts. The first part is similar to the Heisenberg XYZ-model with internal two-qubit interaction, while the second includes three-qubit interaction with the thermostat. Such a quantum system admits a fully analytical investigation and is considered in the context of mathematical modeling of quantum metamaterials, in which nanoclusters are elementary structural units with the strong internal interaction of qubits and the relatively weak coupling with the environment. For the Hamiltonian, we construct an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, which includes the maximally entangled W-state. We also obtain the density operator of the cluster state in explicit form, and study the temperature dependences of the thermodynamic characteristics of the cluster: the partition function, entropy, and free energy. It is shown that the conditions of thermal equilibrium in this quantum system are satisfied at temperatures from 0,2 K to microkelvins, which correspond to the operating range of modern quantum logic elements and quantum simulators.

TI Decentralized key distribution versus on-demand relaying for QKD
   networks
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the distribution of secret keys for quantum-secure communication between two distant parties, vital in the quantum computing era in order to protect against quantum-enabled attackers. However, overcoming rate-distance limits in QKD and the establishment of quantum key distribution networks necessitate key relaying over trusted nodes. This process may be resource-intensive, consuming a substantial share of the scarce QKD key material to establish end-to-end secret keys. Hence, an efficient scheme for key relaying and the establishment of end-to-end key pools is essential for practical and extended quantum-secured networking. In this paper, we propose and compare two protocols for managing, storing, and distributing secret key material in QKD networks, addressing challenges such as the success rate of key requests, key consumption, and overhead resulting from relaying. We present an innovative, fully decentralized key distribution strategy as an alternative to the traditional hop-by-hop relaying via trusted nodes, where three experiments are considered to evaluate performance metrics under varying key demand. Our results show that the decentralized pre-flooding approach achieves higher success rates as application demands increase. This analysis highlights the strengths of each approach in enhancing QKD network performance, offering valuable insights for developing robust key distribution strategies in different scenarios.

AB Real-time decoding is a key ingredient in future fault-tolerant quantum systems, yet many decoders are too slow to run in real time. Prior work has shown that parallel window decoding can scalably meet throughput requirements in the presence of increasing decoding times. However, windowed decoding require that some decoding tasks be delayed until others have completed, which can be problematic during time-sensitive operations such as T gate teleportation, leading to suboptimal program runtimes. To alleviate this, we introduce SWIPER, a speculative window decoder. Taking inspiration from branch prediction in classical computer architecture, SWIPER utilizes a light-weight speculation step to predict data dependencies between adjacent decoding windows, allowing multiple layers of decoding tasks to be resolved simultaneously. Through a state-of-the-art compilation pipeline and a detailed open-source simulator, we find that SWIPER reduces application runtimes by 40% on average compared to prior parallel window decoders.

TI Statistical Study of the Entanglement for Qubit Interacting with an

SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB A statistical method is applied to predict the behaviour of a quantum model consisting of a qubit interacting with a single-mode cavity field. The qubit is prepared in excited state while the field starts from the binomial distribution state. The wave function of the proposed model is obtained. A von Neumann entropy is used to investigate the behaviour of the entanglement between the field and the qubits. Moreover, the atomic Q and Wigner functions are used to identify the behaviour of the distribution in a phase space. The simulation method is used to estimate the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best results. A numerical study is performed to estimate the specific dependency of the binomial distribution state. The results of entanglement were compared with the atomic Q and Wigner functions. The results showed that there are many maximum values of entanglement periodically. The results also confirmed a correlation between von Neumann entropy, the atomic Q, and Wigner functions.

TI Certificateless threshold signature from lattice

AB Threshold signature has been widely used in electronic wills, electronic elections, cloud computing, secure multi-party computation and other fields. Until now, certificateless threshold signature schemes are all based on traditional mathematic theory, so they cannot resist quantum computing attacks. In view of this, we combine the advantages of lattice-based cryptosystem and certificateless cryptosystem to construct a certificateless threshold signature from lattice (LCLTS) that is efficient and resistant to quantum algorithm attacks. LCLTS has the threshold characteristics and can resist the quantum computing attacks, and the analysis shows that it is unforgeable against the adaptive Chosen-Message Attacks (UF-CMA) with the difficulty of Inhomogeneous Small Integer Solution (ISIS) problem. In addition, LCLTS solves the problems of the certificate management through key escrow.

TI Quantum imaging of a polarisation sensitive phase pattern with
   hyper-entangled photons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A transparent polarisation sensitive phase pattern makes a polarisation dependent transformation of quantum state of photons without absorbing them. Such an invisible pattern can be imaged with quantum entangled photons by making joint quantum measurements on photons. This paper shows a long path experiment to quantum image a transparent polarisation sensitive phase pattern with hyper-entangled photon pairs involving momentum and polarisation degrees of freedom. In the imaging configuration, a single photon interacts with the pattern while the other photon, which has never interacted with the pattern, is measured jointly in a chosen polarisation basis and in a quantum superposition basis of its position which is equivalent to measure its momentum. Individual photons of each hyper-entangled pair cannot provide a complete image information. The image is constructed by measuring the polarisation state and position of the interacting photon corresponding to a measurement outcome of the non-interacting photon. This paper presents a detailed concept, theory and free space long path experiments on quantum imaging of polarisation sensitive phase patterns.

TI Multilayered logical qubits and synthesized quantum bits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum error correction is likely to be key in obtaining near term quantum advantage. We propose a novel method for providing multiple logical qubits in the correction of quantum errors using classical computers. The core idea of our work is built upon two main pillars: dividing the Hilbert space into reduced Hilbert spaces with individual logical qubits and synthesizing the reduced Hilbert spaces through a mathematical collaborating between classical bits and logical quantum states. We demonstrate that our method supports at least 20 logical qubits in a surface code with a code distance of 3. Furthermore, we generate entangled states of multiple logical qubits from lattice surgery-based surface codes using only physical qubit operations. This approach enables classical computers to support a larger number of logical qubits using less memory and perform faster simulations.

TI Polyadic Braid Operators and Higher Braiding Gates
SO UNIVERSE
AB A new kind of quantum gates, higher braiding gates, as matrix solutions of the polyadic braid equations (different from the generalized Yang-Baxter equations) is introduced. Such gates lead to another special multiqubit entanglement that can speed up key distribution and accelerate algorithms. Ternary braiding gates acting on three qubit states are studied in detail. We also consider exotic non-invertible gates, which can be related with qubit loss, and define partial identities (which can be orthogonal), partial unitarity, and partially bounded operators (which can be non-invertible). We define two classes of matrices, star and circle ones, such that the magic matrices (connected with the Cartan decomposition) belong to the star class. The general algebraic structure of the introduced classes is described in terms of semigroups, ternary and 5-ary groups and modules. The higher braid group and its representation by the higher braid operators are given. Finally, we show, that for each multiqubit state, there exist higher braiding gates that are not entangling, and the concrete conditions to be non-entangling are given for the obtained binary and ternary gates.

TI Coupling two charge qubits via a superconducting resonator operating in
   the resonant and dispersive regimes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A key challenge for semiconductor quantum-dot charge qubits is the realization of long-range qubit coupling and performing high-fidelity gates based on it. Here, we describe a different type of charge qubit formed by an electron confined in a triple-quantum-dot system, enabling single and two-qubit gates working in the dipolar and quadrupolar detuning sweet spots. We further present the form for the long-range dipolar coupling between the charge qubit and the superconducting resonator. Based on the hybrid system composed of the qubits and the resonator, we present two types of entangling gates: the dynamical iSWAP gate and holonomic entangling gate, which are operating in the dispersive and resonant regimes, respectively. We find that the fidelity for the iSWAP gate can reach a fidelity higher than 99% for the noise level typical in experiments. Meanwhile, the fidelity for the holonomic gate can surpass 98% if the anharmonicity in the resonator is large enough. Our proposal offers an alternative, useful way to build up high-fidelity quantum computation for charge qubits in the semiconductor quantum dot.

TI Batched Line Search Strategy for Navigating through Barren Plateaus in
   Quantum Circuit Training
SO QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum algorithms are viewed as promising candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices. These approaches typically involve the training of parameterized quantum circuits through a classical optimization loop. However, they often encounter challenges attributed to the exponentially diminishing gradient components, known as the barren plateau (BP) problem. This work introduces a novel optimization approach designed to alleviate the adverse effects of BPs during circuit training. In contrast to conventional gradient descent methods with a small learning parameter, our approach relies on making a finite hops along the search direction determined on a randomly chosen subsets of the free parameters. The optimization search direction, together with the range of the search, is determined by the distant features of the cost-function landscape. This enables the optimization path to navigate around barren plateaus without the need for external control mechanisms. We have successfully applied our optimization strategy to quantum circuits comprising 21 qubits and 15000 entangling gates, demonstrating robust resistance against BPs. Additionally, we have extended our optimization strategy by incorporating an evolutionary selection framework, enhancing its ability to avoid local minima in the landscape. The modified algorithm has been successfully utilized in quantum gate synthesis applications, showcasing a significantly improved efficiency in generating highly compressed quantum circuits compared to traditional gradient-based optimization approaches.

TI Tailored cluster states with high threshold under biased noise
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Fault-tolerant cluster states form the basis for scalable measurement-based quantum computation. Recently, new stabilizer codes for scalable circuit-based quantum computation have been introduced that have very high thresholds under biased noise where the qubit predominantly suffers from one type of error, e.g. dephasing. However, extending these advances in stabilizer codes to generate high-threshold cluster states for biased noise has been a challenge, as the standard method for foliating stabilizer codes to generate fault-tolerant cluster states does not preserve the noise bias. In this work, we overcome this barrier by introducing a generalization of the cluster state that allows us to foliate stabilizer codes in a bias-preserving way. As an example of our approach, we construct a foliated version of the XZZX code which we call the XZZX cluster state. We demonstrate that under a circuit-level-noise model, our XZZX cluster state has a threshold more than double the usual cluster state when dephasing errors are more likely than errors that cause bit flips by a factor of order similar to 100 or more.

TI Cryo-CMOS Bias-Voltage Generation and Demultiplexing at mK Temperatures
   for Large-Scale Arrays of Quantum Devices
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The rapidly growing number of qubits in semiconductor quantum computers requires a scalable control interface, including the efficient generation of dc bias voltages for gate electrodes. To avoid unrealistically complex wiring between any room-temperature electronics and the cryogenic qubits, this article presents an integrated cryogenic solution for the bias-voltage generation and distribution for large-scale semiconductor spin-qubit quantum processors. A dedicated cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) demultiplexer and a cryo-CMOS dc digital-to-analog converter (DAC) have been developed in a 22-nm fin field-effect transistor process to control a codeveloped 2-D array designed with 648 single-hole transistors. Thanks to the dissipation below 120 mu W, the whole system operates at temperatures below 70mK in a custom-built electrical/mechanical infrastructure embedded in a standard single-pulse-tube dilution refrigerator. The bias voltages generated by the cryo-CMOS DAC are demultiplexed to sample-and-hold structures, allowing to store 96 unique bias voltages over a 3V range with a voltage drift between 60 mu V/s and 18mV/s. This work demonstrates a tight integration at mK temperatures of cryo-CMOS bias generation and distribution with a dedicated large-scale quantum device. This showcases how this approach simplifies the wiring to the electronics, thus facilitating the scaling up of quantum processors toward the large number of qubits required for a practical quantum computer.

This study tackles the complex and computationally demanding task of simulating power system transients through solving differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). We introduce two novel Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs): the Sinusoidal-Friendly QNN and the Polynomial-Friendly QNN, proposing them as effective alternatives to conventional simulation techniques. Our application of these QNNs successfully simulates two small power systems, demonstrating their potential to achieve good accuracy. We further explore various configurations, including time intervals, training points, and the selection of classical optimizers, to optimize the solving of DAEs using QNNs. This research not only marks a pioneering effort in applying quantum computing to power system simulations but also expands the potential of quantum technologies in addressing intricate engineering challenges.

TI Non-iterative disentangled unitary coupled-cluster based on
   lie-algebraic structure
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ans & auml;tze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce k-non-iterative disentangled unitary coupled cluster (NI-DUCC), a fixed and non-iterative disentangled UCC compact ansatz, based on specific 'k' sets of 'qubit' excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ( O(n)) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with n being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs 'k' products of the exponential of O(n)- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each single Pauli string has a length p. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit scaling, O(knp), suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H6 and BeH2, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact full configuration interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, yet the classical computational cost of constructing the O(n) set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set, able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.

TI Performance Evaluation of Quantum-Based Machine Learning Algorithms for
   Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common technique used to diagnose heart diseases. The electrical signals produced by the heart are recorded by chest electrodes and by the extremity electrodes placed on the limbs. Many diseases, such as arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, can be diagnosed by examining ECG signals. The interpretation of these signals by experts may take a long time, and there may be differences between expert interpretations. Since technological developments are intertwined with the medical sciences, computer-assisted diagnostic methods have recently come forward. In computer science, machine learning techniques are often preferred for automatic detection. Quantum-based structures have emerged to increase the machine learning algorithm's speed and classification performance. In this study, a quantum-based machine learning algorithm is applied to classify heart rhythms. The ECG properties were converted to qubit structure using principal component analysis (PCA). The resulting qubits are classified using the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) algorithm. Quantum computer simulation over Qiskit was used for classification studies. Within the scope of experimental studies, comparisons between classical SVM and QSVM were made using different data amounts and qubit numbers. In the results of the analysis, classical SVM achieved 86.96% accuracy, and QSVM achieved 84.64% accuracy. Despite the fact that the entire dataset was not used due to various limitations, these successful performances were achieved. Classification of medical data such as that from ECG has shown that quantum-based machine learning frameworks perform well despite current resource constraints. In this respect, the study includes essential contributions to the use of quantum-based machine learning methods on signal data in medicine.

TI Qubit based on spin-singlet Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The local magnetic moment of an interacting quantum dot occupied by a single electron can be screened by binding a Bogoliubov quasiparticle from a nearby superconductor. This gives rise to a long-lived discrete spin-singlet state inside the superconducting gap, known as the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state. We study the nature of the subgap states induced by a quantum dot embedded between two small superconducting islands. We show that this system has two spin-singlet subgap states with different spatial charge distributions. These states can be put in a linear superposition and coherently manipulated using electric-field pulses applied on the gate electrode. Such a YSR qubit could be implemented using present-day technology.

TI Trapping a free-propagating single-photon into an atomic ensemble as a
   quantum stationary light pulse
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Efficient photon-photon interaction is one of the key elements for realizing quantum information processing. The interaction, however, must often be mediated through an atomic medium due to the bosonic nature of photons, and the interaction time, which is critically linked to the efficiency, depends on the properties of the atom-photon interaction. While the electromagnetically induced transparency effect does offer the possibility of photonic quantum memory, it does not enhance the interaction time as it fully maps the photonic state to an atomic state. The stationary light pulse (SLP) effect, on the contrary, traps the photonic state inside an atomic medium with zero group velocity, opening up the possibility of enhanced interaction time. In this work, we report the first experimental demonstration of trapping a free-propagating single-photon into a cold atomic ensemble via the quantum SLP (QSLP) process. We conclusively show that the quantum properties of the single-photon state are preserved well during the QSLP process. Our work paves the way for new approaches for efficient photon-photon interactions, exotic photonic states, and many-body simulations in photonic systems.

TI Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving
   SU(2) matrix models
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric SU(2) matrix models at different couplings using the variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of SU(2) matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.

TI Quantum Logic Enhanced Sensing in Solid-State Spin Ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate quantum logic enhanced sensitivity for a macroscopic ensemble of solid-state, hybrid two-qubit sensors. We achieve over a factor of 30 improvement in the single-shot signal-to-noise ratio, translating to an ac magnetic field sensitivity enhancement exceeding an order of magnitude for time averaged measurements. Using the electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as sensors, we leverage the on-site nitrogen nuclear spins of the NV centers as memory qubits, in combination with homogeneous and stable bias and control fields, ensuring that all of the similar to 109 two-qubit sensors are sufficiently identical to permit global control of the NV ensemble spin states. We find quantum logic sensitivity enhancement for multiple measurement protocols with varying optimal sensing intervals, including XY8 and DROID-60 dynamical decoupling, as well as correlation spectroscopy, using an applied ac magnetic field signal. The results are independent of the nature of the target signal and broadly applicable to measurements using NV centers and other solid-state spin ensembles. This work provides a benchmark for macroscopic ensembles of quantum sensors that employ quantum logic or quantum error correction algorithms for enhanced sensitivity.

TI Nonreciprocal Entanglement of Frequency-Distinct Qubits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Entanglement is the linchpin of quantum mechanics and a pivotal enabler of quantum technologies, wherein the states of particles are intrinsically correlated, such that the state of one instantaneously influences the other, regardless of the distance between them. Reciprocal entanglement and coupling between qubits often lead to unwanted bidirectional interactions and reflections, which degrade quantum states and reduce quantum coherence. This paper introduces a cryogenic-compatible metasurface that leverages space-time modulation to enable nonreciprocal entanglement between frequency-distinct superconducting qubits. This functionality is achieved through a reflective quantum state-converting metasurface, specifically designed for millikelvin-temperature quantum technologies. The metasurface utilizes cascaded space-time-modulated Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs), offering a transformative platform for advanced quantum state manipulation and entanglement. This spatiotemporal superconductor-semiconductor metasurface transcends the limitations of traditional linear space-time metasurfaces by incorporating gate-controlled Josephson junctions, offering highly efficient spurious-free state-frequency conversion. This study demonstrates that spatiotemporal superconducting metasurfaces, particularly those leveraging JoFETs, enable highly efficient quantum state conversion even for superconducting qubits with a high frequency distinction ratio.

TI The General Theory of Scientific Variability for Technological Evolution
SO SCI
AB The proposed general theory of scientific variability for technological evolution explains one of the drivers of technological change for economic progress in human society. Variability is the predisposition of the elements in systems to assume different values over time and space. In biology, the variability is basic to explaining differences and development in organisms. In economics of technical change, the effects of variability within research fields on evolutionary dynamics of related technologies are unknown. In a broad analogy with the principles of biology, suggested theoretical framework here can clarify a basic driver of technological evolution: the variability within research fields can explain the dynamics of scientific development and technological evolution. The study sees whether statistical evidence supports the hypothesis that the rate of growth of scientific and technological fields can be explained by the level of variability within scientific fields. The validation is based on emerging research fields in quantum technologies: quantum imaging, quantum meteorology, quantum sensing, and quantum optics. Statistical evidence seems in general to support the hypothesis stated that the rate of growth can be explained by the level of scientific variability within research fields, measured with the relative entropy (indicating the dispersion of scientific topics in a research field underlying a specific technology). Nonparametric correlation with Spearman's rho shows a positive coefficient of 0.80 between entropy measures and rates of growth between scientific and technological fields. The linear model of the relation between rate of growth and scientific variability reveals a coefficient of regression equal to 1.63 (R2 = 0.60). The findings here suggest a general law that variability within research fields positively drives scientific development and technological evolution. In particular, a higher variability within research fields can support a high rate of growth in scientific development and technological evolution. The proposed general theory of scientific variability is especially relevant in turbulent environments of technology-based competition to clarify a basic determinant of technological development to design strategies of technological forecasting and management of promising innovations.

TI Choi representation of completely positive maps in brief
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION A-A JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES
AB The Choi representation of completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) maps, i.e. quantum channels is often used in the context of quantum information and computation as it is easy to work with. It is a correspondence between CPTP maps and quantum states also termed as the Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski isomorphism. It is especially useful if a parametrization of the set of CPTP maps is needed in order to consider a general map or optimize over the set of these. Here we provide a brief introduction to this topic, focusing on certain useful calculational techniques which are presented in full detail.

TI Toolchain for faster iterations in quantum software development
SO COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.

TI Weak measurements, non-classicality and negative probability
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This paper establishes a direct, robust, and intimate connection among (i) non-classicality tests for various quantum features, e.g. non-Boolean logic, quantum coherence, nonlocality, quantum entanglement, quantum discord; (ii) negative probability, and, (iii) anomalous weak values. It has been shown (Adhikary et al. Eur Phys J D 74(68):68, 2020; Asthana et al. Quantum Inform Process 20(1):1-33, 2021) that the nonexistence of a classical joint probability scheme gives rise to sufficiency conditions for nonlocality, a nonclassical feature not restricted to quantum mechanics. The conditions for nonclassical features of quantum mechanics are obtained by employing pseudo-probabilities, which are expectation values of the parent pseudo-projections. The crux of the paper is that the pseudo-probabilities, which can take negative values, can be directly measured as anomalous weak values. We expect that this opens up new avenues for testing nonclassicality via weak measurements and also gives deeper insight into negative pseudo-probabilities, which become measurable. A quantum game, based on violation of a classical probability rule, is also proposed that can be played by employing weak measurements.

TI Separation between entanglement criteria and entanglement detection
   protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement detection is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum information science, playing vital roles in theoretical studies and quantum system benchmarking. Researchers have proposed many powerful entanglement criteria with high detection capabilities and small observable numbers. Nonetheless, entanglement criteria only represent mathematical rules deciding the existence of entanglement. The relationship between a good entanglement criterion and an effective experimental entanglement detection protocol (EDP) is poorly understood. In this study, we introduce postulates for EDPs about their detection capabilities and robustness and use them to show the difference between entanglement criteria and EDPs. Specifically, we design an entanglement detection task for unknown pure bipartite states and demonstrate that the sample complexity of any EDP and the number of observables for a good entanglement criterion can have exponential separation. Furthermore, we discover that the optimal EDP with the lowest sample complexity does not necessarily correspond to an entanglement criterion constructed by a small number of observables. Our results can be used to prove the exponential speedups achieved through quantum memory and be generalized to multipartite entanglement detection. By highlighting the significance and independence of EDP design, our work holds practical implications for entanglement detection experiments.

TI Teleportation of discrete-variable qubits via continuous-variable lossy
   channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The continuous-variable (CV) quantum state of light allows for the teleportation of a discrete-variable (DV) photonic qubit. Such an operation is useful in the realm of hybrid quantum networks. However, it is known that the teleportation of a DV qubit via a Gaussian CV resource state is severely limited under channel loss, with a teleportation fidelity beyond the classical limit unattainable for losses exceeding a small threshold. In this paper, we present a nondeterministic teleportation protocol that combines a Gaussian CV resource state with a modified form of the Bell state measurement that accommodates significantly improved DV-qubit fidelity over a wide range of channel losses. Beyond this improvement, we also show how the use of non-Gaussian operations on the CV resource state can lead to a DV-qubit fidelity approaching unity for any channel loss.

TI Thermodynamic limit in the two-qubit quantum Rabi model with spin-spin
   coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The occurrence of a second-order superradiant quantum phase transition is brought to light in a quantum system consisting of two interacting qubits coupled to the same quantized field mode. We introduce an appropriate thermodynamic limit for the integrable two-qubit quantum Rabi model with spin-spin interaction. Namely, this limit is determined by the infinite ratios of the spin-spin and the spin-mode couplings to the mode frequency, regardless of the spin-to-mode frequency ratios.

TI Even Quantum Advice is Unlikely to Solve PP
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING
AB We give a corrected proof that if PP subset of BQP/qpoly (probabilistic polynomial time can be efficiently simulated by quantum circuits with quantum advice), then the Counting Hierarchy collapses, as originally claimed by Aaronson (CCC'06). This recovers the related unconditional claim that PP does not have circuits of any fixed-polynomial size nk even with quantum advice. Our result is based on proving that YQP & lowast;, an oblivious version of QMA boolean AND coQMA, is contained in APP, a PP-low subclass of PP with an arbitrarily small but nonzero promise gap.

TI Circuit-Based Leakage-to-Erasure Conversion in a Neutral-Atom Quantum
   Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Atom-loss errors are a major limitation of current state-of-the-art neutral-atom quantum computers and pose a significant challenge for scalable systems. In a quantum processor with cesium atoms, we demonstrate proof-of-principle circuit-based conversion of this form of leakage error to erasure errors via leakage-detection units (LDUs), which nondestructively map information about the presence or absence of the qubit onto the state of an ancilla. We benchmark the performance of the LDU using a three-outcome low-loss state-detection method and find that the LDU detects atom-loss errors with approximately 93.4% accuracy, limited by technical imperfections of our apparatus. We further compile and execute a SWAP LDU, wherein the roles of the original data atom and ancilla atom are exchanged under the action of the LDU, providing "free refilling" of atoms in the case of atom loss. This circuit-based leakage-to-erasure error conversion is a critical component of a neutral-atom quantum processor where the quantum information may significantly outlive the lifetime of any individual atom in the quantum register. Finally, we demonstrate that LDUs may also be used to handle other forms of leakage errors where population moves to states outside of the computational subspace.

TI Solving the Independent Domination Problem by the Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO ENTROPY
AB In the wake of quantum computing advancements and quantum algorithmic progress, quantum algorithms are increasingly being employed to address a myriad of combinatorial optimization problems. Among these, the Independent Domination Problem (IDP), a derivative of the Domination Problem, has practical implications in various real-world scenarios. Despite this, existing classical algorithms for the IDP are plagued by high computational complexity, and quantum algorithms have yet to tackle this challenge. This paper introduces a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)-based approach to address the IDP. Utilizing IBM's qasm_simulator, we have demonstrated the efficacy of the QAOA in solving the IDP under specific parameter settings, with a computational complexity that surpasses that of classical methods. Our findings offer a novel avenue for the resolution of the IDP.

TI Simulation of Charge Stability Diagrams for Automated Tuning Solutions
   (SimCATS)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum dots (QDs) must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the QDs, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust technology-independent algorithms.

TI Deploying the Qline System for a QKD Metropolitan Network on the Berlin
   OpenQKD Testbed
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems have the potential to provide secure communication by offering unconditionally secure key exchange between distant parties. However, the integration of QKD into existing communication networks presents challenges, particularly when it comes to the deployment of trusted nodes and the establishment of secure connections over metropolitan distances. In this study, we present a novel approach to address these issues by introducing a trusted-node-free design on a metropolitan scale for the seamless integration of a QKD system into the Berlin OpenQKD optical fiber testbed. Our innovative design leverages conventional telecom modulators and a standard Wavelength-Division Multiplexing - Arrayed Waveguide Grating (WDM-AWG), offering a practical solution for flexible multi-partner communication and enabling full connectivity between non-adjacent nodes. In this study, we not only observed relatively low QBER ($< $ 5.5%) but also a rather stable key rate between nodes in the Qline system over approximately 130 hours ($\approx$ 5.4 days) for a lab-based back-to-back setup. Later on, a more complex experimental scheme is integrated into Berlin OpenQKD optical fiber testbed encompassing multiple C-band frequencies (191.75-195.75 THz) and extending over metropolitan distances (up to 39.8 km), providing a foundation for secure quantum communication networks with enhanced scalability and versatility.

AB Deployment of ultracold atom interferometers (AI) into space will capitalize on quantum advantages and the extended freefall of persistent microgravity to provide high-precision measurement capabilities for gravitational, Earth, and planetary sciences, and to enable searches for subtle forces signifying physics beyond General Relativity and the Standard Model. NASA's Cold Atom Lab (CAL) operates onboard the International Space Station as a multi-user facility for fundamental studies of ultracold atoms and to mature space-based quantum technologies. We report on pathfinding experiments utilizing ultracold 87Rb atoms in the CAL AI. A three-pulse Mach-Zehnder interferometer was studied to understand the influence of ISS vibrations. Additionally, Ramsey shear-wave interferometry was used to manifest interference patterns in a single run that were observable for over 150 ms free-expansion time. Finally, the CAL AI was used to remotely measure the Bragg laser photon recoil as a demonstration of the first quantum sensor using matter-wave interferometry in space.
   NASA's Cold Atom Lab has operated on the International Space Station since 2018 to study quantum gases and mature quantum technologies in Earth's orbit. Here, Williams et al., report on a series of pathfinding experiments exploring the first quantum sensor using atom interferometry in space.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Magnetic and topological properties along with quantum correlations in terms of several entanglement measures have been investigated for an antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-1/2 XY model in the presence of transverse magnetic field and XZX-YZY type of three-spin interactions. Symmetries of the spin Hamiltonian have been identified. Under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the spin Hamiltonian converted into spinless superconducting model with nearest neighbor (NN) hopping and Cooper pairing terms in addition to next NN Cooper pairing potential. Long range AFM order has been studied in terms of staggered spin-spin correlation functions, while the topological orders have been characterized by winding numbers. Magnetic and topological phase diagrams have been prepared. Faithful coexistence of magnetic and topological superconducting phases is found in the entire parameter regime. Boundaries of various quantum phases have been marked and positions of bicritical points have been identified.

AB We propose energy-saving fast-forward scaling. Fast-forward scaling is a method which enables us to speed up (or slow down) given dynamics in a certain measurement basis. We introduce energy costs of fast-forward scaling, and find possibility of energy-saving speedup for time-independent measurement bases. As concrete examples, we show such energy-saving fast-forward scaling in a two-level system and quantum annealing of a general Ising spin glass. We also discuss the influence of a time-dependent measurement basis, and give a remedy for unwanted energy costs. The present results pave the way for realization of energy-efficient quantum technologies.

TI Quantum computing tools for fast detection of gravitational waves in the
   context of LISA space mission
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The missed event corresponds to the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) source, indicating that model sensitivity improvements are needed for weak signals. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes. Compared with a recurrent neural network baseline, the QNN achieves comparable accuracy on higher-SNR events while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. These results demonstrate the feasibility of QNNs for GW detection and motivate further investigation of quantum-enhanced data analysis techniques for LISA.

TI Remote preparation of a general single-photon hybrid state
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We present a technique for remotely preparing an arbitrary single-photon hybrid state between two distant nodes. This remote state preparation (RSP) is accomplished with a hyper-entangled state in polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom (DoFs) using some experimentally available optical elements and devices. In our RSP, the sender performs unitary operations on her hyper-entangled photon in accordance with her knowledge of the desired state to be transmitted. By performing a single-photon projective measurement and classical communication, the target state will be reconstructed at the remote receiver's quantum system. Furthermore, we discuss the RSP via a partially hyper-entangled state. We expect our study can pave the way towards the investigation of long-distance quantum communication scenarios.

TI Resource-efficient high-dimensional subspace teleportation with a
   quantum autoencoder
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum autoencoders serve as efficient means for quantum data compression. Here, we propose and demonstrate their use to reduce resource costs for quantum teleportation of subspaces in high-dimensional systems. We use a quantum autoencoder in a compress-teleport-decompress manner and report the first demonstration with qutrits using an integrated photonic platform for future scalability. The key strategy is to compress the dimensionality of input states by erasing redundant information and recover the initial states after chip-to-chip teleportation. Unsu-pervised machine learning is applied to train the on-chip autoencoder, enabling the compression and teleportation of any state from a high-dimensional subspace. Unknown states are decompressed at a high fidelity (-0.971), obtain-ing a total teleportation fidelity of-0.894. Subspace encodings hold great potential as they support enhanced noise robustness and increased coherence. Laying the groundwork for machine learning techniques in quantum systems, our scheme opens previously unidentified paths toward high-dimensional quantum computing and networking.

TI Simulation of random photon loss in boson sampling ofdifferent optical
   networks
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Boson sampling is a candidate for quantum protocols to truly realize the quantum computation advantageand to be used in advanced fields where complex computations are needed, such as quantum chemistry.However, this proposal is hard to achieve due to the existence of noise sources such as photon losses. In order toquantificationally analyze the influences of photon losses in optical networks, boson sampling is classicallysimulated based on the equivalent beam splitter mechanism, where the photon loss happening in optical units isequivalent to the photon transmission into the environmental paths through a virtual beam splitter. In oursimulation, networks corresponding to random unitary matrices are made up, considering both the Reckstructure and the Clements structure. The photon loss probability in an optical unit is well controlled byadjusting the parameters of the virtual beam splitter. Therefore, to simulate boson sampling with photon lossesin optical networks is actually to simulate ideal boson sampling with more modes. It is found that when thephoton loss probability is constant, boson sampling with Clements structures distinctly performs much betterthan that with Reck structures. Furthermore, the photon loss probability is also set to follow the normaldistribution, which is thought to be closer to the situation in reality. It is found that when the mean value ofphoton loss probability is constant, for both network structures, errors of outputs become more obvious withthe increase of standard deviation. It can be inferred that the increase of error rate can be explained by thenetwork depth and the conclusion is suitable for larger-scale boson sampling. Finally, the number of outputphotons is taken into consideration, which is directly related to the classical computation complexity. It is foundthat with the photon loss probability, the ratio of output combinations without photon losses decreases sharply,implying that photon losses can obviously affect the quantum computation advantage of boson sampling. Ourresults indicate that photon losses can result in serious errors for boson sampling, even with a stable networkstructure such as that of Clements. This work is helpful for boson sampling experiments in reality and it isdesired to develop a better protocol, for example, a well-designed network or excellent optical units, to wellsuppress photon losses

AB Post-quantum cryptography represents a category of cryptosystems resistant to quantum algorithms. Such schemes are under the scrutiny of their mathematical security in the context of the NIST standardization process, but they are not side-channel secure at the algorithm level. That is why their side-channel vulnerabilities must be assessed by the research community. In this paper, we present a non-profiled correlation electromagnetic analysis against an FPGA implementation of the standard key-encapsulation mechanism, CRYSTALS-Kyber. The attack correlates an electromagnetic radiation model of the polynomial multiplication execution with the captured traces. With 166,620 traces, this attack correctly recovers 100% of the subkeys. Furthermore, a countermeasure is presented for securing the target implementation against the presented attack.

TI Self-testing maximally-dimensional genuinely entangled subspaces within
   the stabilizer formalism
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Self-testing was originally introduced as a device-independent method of certification of entangled quantum states and local measurements performed on them. Recently, in (Baccari et al 2020 Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 260507) the notion of state self-testing has been generalized to entangled subspaces and the first self-testing strategies for exemplary genuinely entangled subspaces have been given. The main aim of our work is to pursue this line of research and to address the question how 'large' (in terms of dimension) are genuinely entangled subspaces that can be self-tested, concentrating on the multiqubit stabilizer formalism. To this end, we first introduce a framework allowing to efficiently check whether a given stabilizer subspace is genuinely entangled. Building on it, we then determine the maximal dimension of genuinely entangled subspaces that can be constructed within the stabilizer subspaces and provide an exemplary construction of such maximally-dimensional subspaces for any number of qubits. Third, we construct Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by any entangled state from those subspaces and thus also any mixed states supported on them, and we show these inequalities to be useful for self-testing. Interestingly, our Bell inequalities allow for identification of higher-dimensional face structures in the boundaries of the sets of quantum correlations in the simplest multipartite Bell scenarios in which every observer performs two dichotomic measurements.

TI An On-Chip Picoampere-Level Leakage Current Sensor for Quantum
   Processors in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS
AB In this brief, we present an embedded picoampere-level leakage current sensor of low hardware complexity for quantum computing applications. It senses a leakage current on capacitors comprising a capacitive DAC (CDAC) intended for the control of energy confinement levels and quantum states of a nearby quantum dot structure integrated on the same die. As the quantum states exhibit an exponential sensitivity to the control voltages, any changes in the output voltage of the CDAC due to noise, ripples or leakage current should be monitored and characterized accurately. For this purpose, we exploit a 1-bit continuous-time comparator to digitize the slope of the CDAC output voltage due to the leakage current. The proposed system occupies 0.013 mm2 and measures the leakage current over varied temperature from 3.8 K to 270 K. The average leakage current of the CDAC at 3.8 K was measured at 3.57 pA.

TI Realizing quantum speed limit in open system with a PT -symmetric
   trapped-ion qubit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum speed limit (QSL), the lower bound of the time for transferring an initial state to a target one, is of fundamental interest in quantum information processing. Despite that the speed limit of a unitary evolution could be well analyzed by either the Mandelstam-Tamm or the Margolus-Levitin bound, there are still many unknowns for the QSL in open systems. A particularly exciting result is about that the evolution time can be made arbitrarily small without violating the time-energy uncertainty principle, whenever the dynamics is governed by a parity-time ( PT ) symmetric Hamiltonian. Here we study the QSLs with both PT and anti- PT Hamiltonians, and pose the QSL as a brachistochrone problem on a non-Hermitian Bloch sphere. We then use dissipative trapped-ion qubits to construct the Hamiltonians, where the state evolutions reach the QSL governed by a generalized Margolus-Levitin bound of the non-Hermitian system. We find that the evolution time monotonously decreases with the increase of the dissipation strength and exhibits chiral dependence on the Bloch sphere. These results enable a well-controlled knob for speeding up the state manipulation in open quantum systems, which could be used for quantum control and simulation with non-unitary dynamics.

TI Finite-key security analysis of differential-phase-shift quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the major QKD protocols that can be implemented with a simple setup using a laser source and a passive detection unit. Recently, an information -theoretic security proof of this protocol was established by Mizutani et al. [npj Quantum Inf. 5, 87 (2019)], assuming an infinitely large number of emitted pulses. To implement the DPS protocol in a real-life world, it is indispensable to analyze the security with the finite number of emitted pulses. The extension of the security proof to the finite-size regime requires the accommodation of the statistical fluctuations to determine the amount of privacy amplification. In doing so, Azuma's inequality is often employed, but unfortunately we show that in the case of the DPS protocol, this results in a substantially low key rate. This low key rate is due to a loose estimation of the sum of probabilities regarding three-photon emission whose probability of occurrence is very small. The main contribution of our work is to show that this obstacle can be overcome by exploiting the recently found novel concentration inequality, Kato's inequality. As a result, the key rate of the DPS protocol is drastically improved. For instance, assuming typical experimental parameters, a 3-Mbit secret key can be generated over 77 km for 8.3 hours, which shows the feasibility of DPS QKD under a realistic setup.

TI Hardware-Encoding Grid States in a Nonreciprocal Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We present a circuit design composed of two Josephson junctions coupled by a nonreciprocal element, the gyrator, whose ground space is doubly degenerate. The ground states are approximate code words of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code. We determine the low-energy dynamics of the circuit by working out the equivalence of this system to the problem of a single electron in a crystal, confined to a two-dimensional plane, and subjected to a strong, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that the circuit is naturally protected against the common noise channels in superconducting circuits, such as charge and flux noise, implying that it can be used for passive quantum error correction. We also propose realistic design parameters for an experimental realization, and we describe possible protocols to perform logical one- and two-qubit gates, state preparation, and readout.

TI Decoherence of quantum local fisher and uncertainty information in
   two-qubit NV centers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study aims to investigate the decoherence of the quantum correlation dynamics of two qubit nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres through local quantum uncertainty (LQU), local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), and concurrence. Using an intrinsic decoherence model, our study investigates how increasing zero-field splitting, external magnetic fields, external electric control fields, dipole-dipole coupling and decoherence affect the generated correlations between two NV centers. It is shown that the system with two nitrogen-vacancy centres can generate strong correlations with certain parameters of zero-field splitting, external magnetic fields, external electric control fields and dipole-dipole coupling. With weak intrinsic decoherence, the generated LQFI, LQU and concurrence exhibit oscillating generations with the same frequency. Most of the time, LQFI and LQU exhibit the same Wigner-Yanase-Fisher correlation, except during strong entanglement intervals. Furthermore, the ability of interactions within a two-qubit system of NV centers to generate two-qubit correlations is weakened by increasing external magnetic fields and zero-field splitting fields. Conversely, increasing external electric control fields and dipole-dipole couplings strengthen the ability of the interactions to generate correlations. Finally, we investigated how an increase in intrinsic decoherence coupling significantly degrades the generated correlations. We also investigated how increasing the external magnetic field, the external electric control field and the dipole-dipole coupling significantly affects these correlation degradations.

TI Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation for the Post-Quantum Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB It is a matter of time before quantum computers will break the cryptosystems like RSA and ECC underpinning today's internet protocols. As Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is a low-cost approach compared to others like quantum key distribution, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently reviewed and analyzed numerous approaches to PQC. As a PQC candidate, Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) is expected to be standardized as a general-purpose Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) by NIST. However, it lacks a comprehensive review of BIKE associated with technical analysis. This paper aims to present an in-depth review and analysis of the BIKE scheme with respect to relevant attacks. We provide a comprehensive review of the original McEliece (ME) scheme and present a detailed discussion on its practical challenges. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth study on the challenges of ME and BIKE cryptosystems in achieving the Indistinguishability under Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA) security. We provide an analysis of these cryptosystems and their security against several attacks before pointing out the research gaps for strengthening BIKE.

TI BB84 quantum key distribution transmitter utilising broadband sources
   and a narrow spectral filter
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The secure nature of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols makes it necessary to ensure that the single photon sources are indistinguishable. Any spectral, temporal or spatial discrepancy between the sources would lead to a breach in the security proofs of the QKD protocols. Traditional, weak-coherent pulse implementations of polarization-based QKD protocols have relied on identical photon sources obtained through tight temperature control and spectral filtering. However, it can be challenging to keep the temperature of the sources stable over time, particularly in a real-world setting, meaning photon sources can become distinguishable. In this work, we present an experimental demonstration of a QKD system capable of achieving spectral indistinguishability, over a 10 degrees C range, using a combination of broadband sources, super-luminescent light emitting diodes (SLEDs), along with a narrow band-pass filter. The temperature stability could be useful in a satellite implementation, where there may be temperature gradients over the payload, particularly on a CubeSat.Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Power Network Optimization: A Quantum Approach
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Optimization of electricity surplus is a crucial element for transmission power networks since it leads to reducing costs as well as increasing efficiency across the network as a whole. In this paper, we show how to optimize such network costs using a quantum annealing approach. First, we define the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem for network partitioning. To achieve this, we introduce a method to translate inequality constraints with real-valued coefficients into approximate penalty functions. Next, we test the implementation on purely quantum and quantum-classical hybrid architectures. We then solve the problem using the D-Wave hybrid Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver, the D-Wave hybrid Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) solver, as well as classical solvers available on Azure Quantum Cloud. Finally, we find that the value of the objective function obtained with the quantum-classical hybrid solvers is always lower compared to the classical approaches across a range of different problem sizes. This demonstrates that the quantum-classical hybrid methods outperform the classical methods in terms of solution quality.

TI Entangled Qubit States and Linear Entropy in the Probability
   Representation of Quantum Mechanics
SO ENTROPY
AB The superposition states of two qubits including entangled Bell states are considered in the probability representation of quantum mechanics. The superposition principle formulated in terms of the nonlinear addition rule of the state density matrices is formulated as a nonlinear addition rule of the probability distributions describing the qubit states. The generalization of the entanglement properties to the case of superposition of two-mode oscillator states is discussed using the probability representation of quantum states.

TI Deterministic submanifolds for the backward-evolving quantum state
   concerning a monitored qubit
SO IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB The evolution of a quantum system subject to continuous weak measurement is described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). It has been shown that the conventional density matrix rho t$\rho _t$ characterized by such SDE, under experimentally relevant settings, remains within a deterministically evolving manifold of low dimension, whose associated equations can be computed explicitly. In this paper, as a complement, it is demonstrated that the effect matrix Et$E_t$, associated to a quantum system at the time t to express its measurement during the interval [t,T]$[t,T]$, also remains confined to a deterministically evolving manifold. In particular, by using the Bloch sphere representation together with the properties of Pauli matrices (as the quantum representation of quaternions), deterministic submanifolds for the effect matrix concerning a monitored qubit are given explicitly. The qubit stays on a deterministically evolving curve in the homodyne amplitude detection scenario, and on a deterministically moving surface under heterodyne amplitude detection. This deterministic characterization should be of interest for parameter estimation and towards obtaining computationally efficient quantum filters for real-time quantum control.

TI The Iontronic Quantum Dot
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for quantum technologies with applications in quantum computation, communication, and sensing. QD device architectures rooted in conventional solid-state device fabrication paradigms are grappled with complex protocols to balance ease of realization, scalability, and transport properties. Using ion gating, we demonstrate a novel paradigm of quantum device engineering, that enables the realization and control of the iontronic QD. Clear Coulomb blockade peaks and their dependence on an externally applied magnetic field are reported, together with the impact of device architecture and confinement potential on QD quality. Devices incorporating two identical iontronic QDs in series are realized, addressing the reproducibility of the approach. A novel class of zero-dimensional quantum devices, iontronic QDs, overcome the need for thin dielectric layers, facilitating single-step device fabrication. This approach holds the potential to impact the development of quantum materials and devices in the context of solid-state quantum technologies.

TI Optimizing SIKE for blockchain-based IoT ecosystems with resource
   constraints
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Blockchain technology offers a robust framework for integration with the Internet of Things (IoT), enhancing interoperability, security, privacy, and scalability in modern technological ecosystems. However, traditional cryptographic protocols used in blockchain systems are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks due to advancements in quantum computing. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has prioritized research in post-quantum cryptography, presenting challenges and opportunities for developing blockchain-based applications tailored to IoT devices. Among the post-quantum cryptographic schemes evaluated in NIST's third standardization round, the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) protocol stands out for its relatively small public and private key sizes. Despite this advantage, SIKE faces challenges related to high latency, necessitating efficient implementations to make it viable for real-world applications. This research focuses on optimizing the cryptographic foundations of blockchain networks to securely and efficiently integrate resource-constrained IoT ecosystems. By enhancing the SIKE protocol, which exhibits strong resistance to brute-force and whitewashing attacks, the study achieves significant performance improvements. Our FPGA-based implementation on the VIRTEX-6 XC6VLX760 demonstrates reduced latency, achieving a key generation time of 24 ms, encapsulation time of 72 ms, and decapsulation time of 73 ms for SIKEp434. These results highlight the feasibility of deploying SIKE-optimized blockchain networks in IoT environments with stringent resource constraints.

TI Nonadiabatic coupled-qubit Otto cycle with bidirectional operation and
   efficiency gains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study a quantum Otto cycle that uses a 2-qubit working substance whose Hamiltonian does not commute with itself at different times during unitary strokes. We investigate how the cycle responds to the loss of quantum adiabaticity when these strokes are operated with a finite duration. We find that qualitative features such as the possibility of counter-rotating cycles operating as heat engines, or a cycle efficiency that can increase with a decrease in the temperature difference between the baths, are resilient even to highly nonadiabatic strokes. However, cycle efficiency rapidly decreases, although it can still remain above the standard Otto value for small degrees of quantum nonadiabaticity.

TI Quantum molecular unfolding
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Molecular docking is an important step of the drug discovery process which aims at calculating the preferred position and shape of one molecule to a second when they are bound to each other. During such analysis, 3D representations of molecules are manipulated according to their degree of freedoms: rigid roto-translation and fragment rotations along the rotatable bonds. In our work, we focussed on one specific phase of the molecular docking procedure i.e. molecular unfolding (MU), which is used to remove the initial bias of a molecule by expanding it to an unfolded shape simpler to manipulate within the target cavity. The objective of the MU problem is to find the configuration that maximizes the molecular area, or equivalently, that maximizes the internal distances between atoms inside the molecule. We propose a quantum annealing approach to MU by formulating it as a high-order unconstrained binary optimization which was possible to solve on the latest D-wave annealing hardware (2000Q and advantage). Results and performances obtained with quantum annealers are compared with state of art classical solvers.

AB Security is a major concern of digital society, and quantum key distribution (QKD) can contribute with an unconditional secure mechanism for symmetric key distribution. Satellites have the opportunity to overcome the range limit of quantum communications based on fiber networks. This paper presents a method for performance evaluation of QKD based on satellites, exemplified with a case study that considers small satellites (CubeSats) in low Earth orbits (LEO), to illustrate a flexible configuration of the quantum range extender use case. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a system evaluation derived from orbital propagation data is conducted while also considering QKD with a finite key statistics approach. This evaluation aims to match with the shortness and variability of visibility intervals typical of LEO orbits. The results confirm the feasibility of proposed case study and show the impact of relevant systems and orbital parameters in the key generation performance, such as system characteristics, uplink or downlink configuration, satellite altitude and orbital inclination. The estimated performance is then scaled to a year along with some sensitivity scenarios. The presented results may guide the design of future QKD satellite mission proposals.

TI Multicore fiber beacon system for reducing back-reflection in satellite
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical beaconing is an important part of the acquisition, pointing and tracking system necessary for free-space quantum key distribution (QKD). However, uplink beacon back-reflections from the receiver architecture can result in noise. Wavelength-and time-division multiplexing has been used, but neither is yet sufficient to make back-reflection negligible. The use of additional telescopes increases complexity and pointing error. Here, we propose the use of a 2-by-2 multicore fiber, to act as an optical uplink beacon source. This spatially separates the QKD channel and optical uplink beacon. Up to 50 dB improvement in noise rejection over a purely spectrally divided system was demonstrated. The route to further improvements through greater fiber core separation is described. Beacon systems designed in this way could provide a combination of reduced complexity and improved noise performance to free-space and satellite QKD and optical communications.

TI An Explainable MRI-Radiomic Quantum Neural Network to Differentiate
   Between Large Brain Metastases and High-Grade Glioma Using Quantum
   Annealing for Feature Selection
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING
AB Solitary large brain metastases (LBM) and high-grade gliomas (HGG) are sometimes hard to differentiate on MRI. The management differs significantly between these two entities, and non-invasive methods that help differentiate between them are eagerly needed to avoid potentially morbid biopsies and surgical procedures. We explore herein the performance and interpretability of an MRI-radiomics variational quantum neural network (QNN) using a quantum-annealing mutual-information (MI) feature selection approach. We retrospectively included 423 patients with HGG and LBM (> 2 cm) who had a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1) MRI between 2012 and 2019. After exclusion, 72 HGG and 129 LBM were kept. Tumors were manually segmented, and a 5-mm peri-tumoral ring was created. MRI images were pre-processed, and 1813 radiomic features were extracted. A set of best features based on MI was selected. MI and conditional-MI were embedded into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that was mapped to an Ising-model and submitted to D'Wave's quantum annealer to solve for the best combination of 10 features. The 10 selected features were embedded into a 2-qubits QNN using PennyLane library. The model was evaluated for balanced-accuracy (bACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) on the test set. The model performance was benchmarked against two classical models: dense neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Shapley values were calculated to interpret sample-wise predictions on the test set. The best 10-feature combination included 6 tumor and 4 ring features. For QNN, DNN, and XGB, respectively, training ROC-AUC was 0.86, 0.95, and 0.94; test ROC-AUC was 0.76, 0.75, and 0.79; and test bACC was 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72. The two most influential features were tumor Laplacian-of-Gaussian-GLRLM-Entropy and sphericity. We developed an accurate interpretable QNN model with quantum-informed feature selection to differentiate between LBM and HGG on CE-T1 brain MRI. The model performance is comparable to state-of-the-art classical models.

TI Direct entanglement detection of quantum systems using machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement plays a crucial role in advancing quantum technologies and exploring quantum many-body simulations. Here, we introduce a protocol aided by neural networks for measuring entanglement in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium states of local Hamiltonians, with a favorable amount of training data. Our numerical simulations across various Hamiltonian models and qubit configurations reveal that this approach can predict comprehensive entanglement metrics, such as R & eacute;nyi entropy, for up to 100 qubits using only single-qubit and two-qubit Pauli measurements. Excitingly, future entanglement dynamics beyond the measurement window can be predicted based solely on previous single-qubit traces. Experimentally, we utilize a nuclear spin quantum processor and a neural network to measure entanglement in the ground and dynamical states of a one-dimensional spin chain. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our method in practical experiments. Therefore, our approach offers a promising method for experimentally measuring entanglement in systems with dozens to hundreds of qubits.

TI Pinned quantum Merlin-Arthur: The power of fixing a few qubits in proofs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB What could happen if we pinned a single qubit of a system and fixed it in a particular state? First, we show that this leads to difficult static questions about the ground-state properties of local Hamiltonian problems with restricted types of terms. In particular, we show that the pinned commuting and pinned stoquastic Local Hamiltonian problems are quantum-Merlin-Arthur-complete. Second, we investigate pinned dynamics and demonstrate that fixing a single qubit via often repeated measurements results in universal quantum computation with commuting Hamiltonians. Finally, we discuss variants of the ground-state connectivity (GSCON) problem in light of pinning, and show that stoquastic GSCON is quantum-classical Merlin-Arthur-complete.

TI State Readout of a Trapped Ion Qubit Using a Trap-Integrated
   Superconducting Photon Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report high-fidelity state readout of a trapped ion qubit using a trap-integrated photon detector. We determine the hyperfine qubit state of a single Be-9(+) ion held in a surface-electrode rf ion trap by counting state-dependent ion fluorescence photons with a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector fabricated into the trap structure. The average readout fidelity is 0.9991(1), with a mean readout duration of 46 mu s, and is limited by the polarization impurity of the readout laser beam and by off-resonant optical pumping. Because there are no intervening optical elements between the ion and the detector, we can use the ion fluorescence as a self-calibrated photon source to determine the detector quantum efficiency and its dependence on photon incidence angle and polarization.

TI Application of quantum computing to temporal aggregation for efficient
   capacity expansion in power systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB Capacity expansion planning (CEP) requires full-year, hourly time series to capture variability in load and renewable generation, but this temporal resolution makes optimization problems computationally challenging. a quantum-classical temporal aggregation framework has been proposed that formulates representative-day selection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solves it using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). To keep each QUBO within practical simulator or near-term hardware limits (about 15 qubits), the year is partitioned into 24 half-month windows; each window is reduced to k representative days via QAOA-based clustering and assigned non-uniform weights proportional to the sizes of their clusters. The weighted days are then integrated into a CEP model built on PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis) with linearized optimal power flow. Evaluations on IEEE 9, 30, and 118 bus systems show that small sets of QAOA-selected, non-uniformly weighted representative days preserve planning-cost fidelity within 4%-6% of the full-resolution benchmark while reducing the temporal dimension by over 75%. This yields substantially faster CEP solves after a onetime clustering step. Our contribution is a structured, optimization-based approach to temporal aggregation that embeds a QUBO-QAOA subroutine within a conventional CEP workflow. By bridging QUBO-based temporal aggregation with conventional CEP modeling, this work presents a proof-of-concept framework that can be adapted as quantum hardware and hybrid solvers mature. Novelty: Unlike previous representative-day methods that rely solely on heuristic clustering, QUBO-QAOA has been integrated into a structured, optimization-based temporal reduction within a CEP workflow. Similar quantum techniques have been explored for related power-system problems (e.g., unit commitment, market optimization), but their direct use for temporal aggregation in CEP has been limited.

TI Quantum Simulation of Molecules in Solution
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers have been focused mostly on simulating molecules in the gas phase. Molecules in liquid solution are, however, most relevant for chemistry. Continuum solvation models represent a good compromise between computational affordability and accuracy in describing solvation effects within a quantum chemical description of solute molecules. In this work, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver to simulate solvated systems using the polarizable continuum model. To account for the state dependent solute-solvent interaction we generalize the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to treat non-linear molecular Hamiltonians. We show that including solvation effects does not impact the algorithmic efficiency. Numerical results of noiseless simulations for molecular systems with up to 12 spin-orbitals (qubits) are presented. Furthermore, calculations performed on a simulated noisy quantum hardware (IBM Q, Mumbai) yield computed solvation free energies in fair agreement with the classical calculations.

TI Coherently driven quantum features using a linear optics-based
   polarization-basis control
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum entanglement generation is generally known to be impossible by any classical means. According to Poisson statistics, coherent photons are not considered quantum particles due to the bunching phenomenon. Recently, a coherence approach has been applied for quantum correlations such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, Franson-type nonlocal correlation, and delayed-choice quantum eraser to understand the mysterious quantum features. In the coherence approach, the quantum correlation has been now understood as a direct result of selective measurements between product bases of phase-coherent photons. Especially in the HOM interpretation, it has been understood that a fixed sum-phase relation between paired photons is the bedrock of quantum entanglement. Here, a coherently excited HOM model is proposed, analyzed, and discussed for the fundamental physics of two-photon correlation using linear optics-based polarization-basis control. For this, polarization-frequency correlation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is coherently excited using synchronized acousto-optic modulators, where polarization-basis control is conducted via a selective measurement process of the heterodyne signals. Like quantum operator-based destructive interference in the HOM theory, a perfectly coherent analysis shows the same HOM effects of the paired coherent photons on a beam splitter, whereas individual output intensities are uniform.

TI Coherence of a field gradient driven singlet-triplet qubit coupled to
   multielectron spin states in 28Si/SiGe
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Engineered spin-electric coupling enables spin qubits in semiconductor nanostructures to be manipulated efficiently and addressed individually. While synthetic spin-orbit coupling using a micromagnet is widely investigated for driving and entangling qubits based on single spins in silicon, the baseband control of encoded spin qubits with a micromagnet in isotopically purified silicon has been less well investigated. Here, we demonstrate fast singlet-triplet qubit oscillation (similar to 100 MHz) in a gate-defined double quantum dot in Si-28/SiGe with an on-chip micromagnet with which we show the oscillation quality factor of an encoded spin qubit exceeding 580. The coherence time T-2* is analyzed as a function of potential detuning and an external magnetic field. In weak magnetic fields, the coherence is limited by frequency-independent noise whose time scale is faster than the typical data acquisition time of similar to 100 ms, which limits the T-2* below 1 mu s in the ergodic limit. We present evidence of sizable and coherent coupling of the qubit with the spin states of a nearby quantum dot, demonstrating that appropriate spin-electric coupling may enable a charge-based two-qubit gate in a (1,1) charge configuration.

TI Securing Modbus in legacy industrial control systems: A decentralized
   approach using proxies, Post-Quantum Cryptography and Self-Sovereign
   Identity
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats due to their reliance on legacy protocols like Modbus TCP/IP, which lack built-in security mechanisms. Despite these risks, replacing or upgrading ICS components remains costly and impractical for many critical infrastructures, such as manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. This highlights the urgent need for security solutions that enhance protection without requiring disruptive system overhauls. Building on our previous work, this paper introduces a decentralized security framework based on dedicated proxies that manage cryptographic operations for legacy devices and facilitate secure communication. The architecture leverages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for node identity management, storing DID Documents containing post-quantum public keys in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The DHT, composed of proxy nodes, is specifically modified to function as a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), ensuring data integrity and availability. To support authorization, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are issued by an operator-controlled Issuer Node, activated solely during new device installations, or maintenance operations. The proposed solution eliminates reliance on a central authority, enhances communication security against quantum threats, and improves resilience through decentralized identity management. Performance evaluations on both physical testbeds and simulated environments analyze handshake latency and system efficiency. Results demonstrate that our approach effectively secures legacy ICSs with an acceptable operational impact, paving the way for more robust and future-proof industrial networks.

TI Arbitrary unitaries in orbital angular momentum of single photons
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A simple argument is presented that explicitly shows how to construct an arbitrary quantum gate acting on orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons. The scheme can be applied to implement subspace multiplexing, where a single high-dimensional OAM qudit represents effectively a stack of multiple independent lower-dimensional qudits. A special subclass of unitaries composed of single-photon controlled gates is studied in detail and notable examples of the general approach are discussed. The generalization of the simple argument leads to the parallelization scheme, which results in the savings of resources. The presented schemes utilize only conventional optical elements and apply not only to single photons but also to classical light.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver with reduced circuit complexity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms to find eigenstates of a given Hamiltonian on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQ). The practical realization is limited by the complexity of quantum circuits. Here we present an approach to reduce quantum circuit complexity in VQE for electronic structure calculations. Our ClusterVQE algorithm splits the initial qubit space into clusters which are further distributed on individual (shallower) quantum circuits. The clusters are obtained based on mutual information reflecting maximal entanglement between qubits, whereas inter-cluster correlation is taken into account via a new "dressed" Hamiltonian. ClusterVQE therefore allows exact simulation of the problem by using fewer qubits and shallower circuit depth at the cost of additional classical resources, making it a potential leader for quantum chemistry simulations on NISQ devices. Proof-of-principle demonstrations are presented for several molecular systems based on quantum simulators as well as IBM quantum devices.

TI Quantum mutual information in time
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB While the quantum mutual information is a fundamental measure of quantum information, it is only defined for spacelike separated quantum systems. Such a limitation is not present in the theory of classical information, where the mutual information between two random variables is well-defined irrespective of whether or not the variables are separated in space or separated in time. Motivated by this disparity between the classical and quantum mutual information, we employ the pseudo-density matrix formalism to define a simple extension of quantum mutual information into the time domain. As in the spatial case, we show that such a notion of quantum mutual information in time serves as a natural measure of correlation between timelike separated systems, while also highlighting ways in which quantum correlations distinguish between space and time. We also show how such quantum mutual information is time-symmetric with respect to quantum Bayesian inversion, and then we conclude by showing how quantum mutual information in time yields a Holevo bound for the amount of classical information that may be extracted from sequential measurements on an ensemble of quantum states.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Circuit Transformation With QKNOB Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Current superconducting quantum devices impose strict connectivity constraints on quantum circuit execution, necessitating circuit transformation before executing quantum circuits on physical hardware. Numerous quantum circuit transformation (QCT) algorithms have been proposed. To enable faithful evaluation of state-of-the-art QCT algorithms, this article introduces qubit mapping benchmark with known near-optimality (QKNOB), a novel benchmark construction method for QCT. QKNOB circuits have built-in transformations with near-optimal (close to the theoretical optimum) swap count and depth overhead. QKNOB provides general and unbiased evaluation of QCT algorithms. Using QKNOB, we demonstrate that SABRE, the default Qiskit compiler, consistently achieves the best performance on the 53-qubit IBM Q Rochester and Google Sycamore devices for both swap count and depth objectives. Our results also reveal significant performance gaps relative to the near-optimal transformation costs of QKNOB. Our construction algorithm and benchmarks are open-source.

   nonlinearity-to-loss ratio
SO OPTICA
AB Optical nonlinearity plays a pivotal role in quantum information processing using photons, from heralded single-photon sources and coherent wavelength conversion to long-sought quantum repeaters. Despite the availability of strong dipole coupling to quantum emitters, achieving strong bulk optical nonlinearity is highly desirable. Here, we realize quantum nanophotonic integrated circuits in thin-film InGaP with, to our knowledge, a record-high ratio of 1.5% between the single-photon nonlinear coupling rate (g/2 pi = 11.2 MHz) and cavity-photon loss rate. We demonstrate second-harmonic generation with an efficiency of 71200 +/- 10300%/W in the InGaP photonic circuit and photon-pair generation via degenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion with an ultrahigh rate exceeding 27.5 MHz/mu W-an order of magnitude improvement of the state of the art-and a large coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 1.4 x 10(4). Our work shows InGaP as a potentially transcending platform for quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information applications.

Furthermore, the extension of machine learning to quantum computers has given rise to the emerging field of quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose the quantum complete graph neural network (QCGNN), which is a variational quantum algorithm- based model designed for learning on complete graphs. The QCGNN with deep parametrized operators offers a polynomial speedup over its classical and quantum counterparts, leveraging the property of quantum parallelism. We investigate the application of the QCGNN with the challenging task of jet discrimination, where the jets are represented as complete graphs. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical models to establish a performance benchmark.

TI Kelly Betting with Quantum Payoff: a continuous variable approach
SO QUANTUM
AB The main purpose of this study is to introduce a semi-classical model describing betting scenarios in which, at variance with conventional approaches, the payoff of the gambler is encoded into the internal degrees of freedom of a quantum memory element. In our scheme, we assume that the invested capital is explicitly associated with the quantum analog of the free-energy (i.e. ergotropy functional by Allahverdyan, Balian, and Nieuwenhuizen) of a single mode of the electromagnetic radiation which, depending on the outcome of the betting, experiences attenuation or amplification processes which model losses and winning events. The resulting stochastic evolution of the quantum memory resembles the dynamics of random lasing which we characterize within the theoretical setting of Bosonic Gaussian channels. As in the classical Kelly Criterion for optimal betting, we define the asymptotic doubling rate of the model and identify the optimal gambling strategy for fixed odds and probabilities of winning. The performance of the model are hence studied as a function of the input capital state under the assumption that the latter belongs to the set of Gaussian density matrices (i.e. displaced, squeezed thermal Gibbs states) revealing that the best option for the gambler is to devote all their initial resources into coherent state amplitude.

TI Quantum Nonlocality in Any Forked Tree-Shaped Network

AB In the last decade, much attention has been focused on examining the nonlocality of various quantum networks, which are fundamental for long-distance quantum communications. In this paper, we consider the nonlocality of any forked tree-shaped network, where each node, respectively, shares arbitrary number of bipartite sources with other nodes in the next "layer". The Bell-type inequalities for such quantum networks are obtained, which are, respectively, satisfied by all (tn-1)-local correlations and all local correlations, where tn denotes the total number of nodes in the network. The maximal quantum violations of these inequalities and the robustness to noise in these networks are also discussed. Our network can be seen as a generalization of some known quantum networks.

TI Evaluation of alternative safe nucleic acid staining dyes for DNA
   quantification with a qubit Fluorometer
SO RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Some of the common dyes used for DNA visualization are known for their potential to cause teratogenic and mutagenic effects. Although safer alternatives are widely available, cost-effective, eco-friendly DNA quantification techniques remain underutilized in some biolabs. This study evaluated nine safe staining dyes for DNA quantification using the common Qubit fluorometer to reduce costs in an environmentally friendly DNA assay. We investigated the effects of dye concentration on sensitivity and the dynamic range for various amounts of DNA. Two quantification assays were developed that were high-sensitivity or broad-range for DNA quantification. With the optimized dyes and protocols, the developed methods achieved sensitivity levels comparable to the Qubit dsDNA BR (Broad Range, 2-1000 ng) Assay Kit and the Qubit dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity, 0.2-100 ng) Assay Kit at reduced cost. The results presented here provide an alternative, low-cost fluorometric assay for DNA quantification using available fluorometers. With a cost per sample of less than a cent, this approach is highly advantageous for resource-limited settings and low-budget laboratories.

We establish an analytic relationship between entanglement and correlation energy and show how entanglement monogamy determines whether many-body corrections to the pair potential are attractive, repulsive, or zero.

Recently, new superconducting devices have achieved an engineered two-photon dissipation rate exceeding all other relevant timescales. In particular, they have proven most useful in preventing transitions between the logical states | +/- alpha > of a cat qubit. Here, we present three key applications of strong two-photon dissipation for quantum measurement and control, beyond cat qubit stabilization. Firstly, we demonstrate its efficacy in overcoming limitations encountered in Wigner tomography at high photon numbers. Secondly, we showcase its potential for realizing universal gates on cat qubits, exploiting the coherent mapping between cat qubit states and superpositions of 0 and 1 photons. Finally, we harness the transient dynamics of a cat state under two-photon dissipation to prepare squeezed cat states with a squeezing factor exceeding 3.96 +/- 0.07 dB.

TI Template-Based Minor Embedding for Adiabatic Quantum Optimization
SO INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB Quantum annealing (QA) can be used to quickly obtain near-optimal solutions for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. In QA hardware, each decision variable of a QUBO should be mapped to one or more adjacent qubits in such a way that pairs of variables defining a quadratic term in the objective function are mapped to some pair of adjacent qubits. However, qubits have limited connectivity in existing QA hardware. This has spurred work on preprocessing algorithms for embedding the graph representing problem variables with quadratic terms into the hardware graph representing qubits adjacencies, such as the Chimera graph in hardware produced by D-Wave Systems. In this paper, we use integer linear programming to search for an embedding of the problem graph into certain classes of minors of the Chimera graph, which we call template embeddings. One of these classes corresponds to complete bipartite graphs, for which we show the limitation of the existing approach based on minimum odd cycle transversals (OCTs). One of the formulations presented is exact and thus can be used to certify the absence of a minor embedding using that template. On an extensive test set consisting of random graphs from five different classes of varying size and sparsity, we can embed more graphs than a state-of-the-art OCT-based approach, our approach scales better with the hardware size, and the runtime is generally orders of magnitude smaller.
   Summary of Contribution: Our work combines classical and quantum computing for operations research by showing that integer linear programming can be successfully used as a preprocessing step for adiabatic quantum optimization. We use it to determine how a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem can be solved by a quantum annealer in which the qubits are coupled as in a Chimera graph, such as in the quantum annealers currently produced by D-Wave Systems. The paper also provides a timely introduction to adiabatic quantum computing and related work on minor embeddings.

TI Quantum simulation of cosmic inflation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we generalize Jordan-Lee-Preskill, an algorithm for simulating flat-space quantum field theories, to 3 + 1 dimensional inflationary spacetime. The generalized algorithm contains the encoding treatment, the initial state preparation, the inflation process, and the quantum measurement of cosmological observables at late time. The algorithm is helpful for obtaining predictions of cosmic non-Gaussianities, serving as useful benchmark problems for quantum devices, and checking assumptions made about interacting vacuum in the inflationary perturbation theory. Components of our work also include a detailed discussion about the lattice regularization of the cosmic perturbation theory, a detailed discussion about the in-in formalism, a discussion about encoding using the Hamilton-Kabat-Lifschytz-Lowe-type formula that might apply for both dS and AdS spacetimes, a discussion about bounding curvature perturbations, a description of the three-party Trotter simulation algorithm for time-dependent Hamiltonians, a ground state projection algorithm for simulating gapless theories, a discussion about the quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis, and a discussion about simulating cosmic reheating in quantum devices.

TI A complete characterization of the optimal unitary attacks in quantum
   cryptography with a refined optimality criteria involving the attacker's
   Hilbert space only
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Fuchs et al. (Phys Rev A 56:1163, 1997, ) suggested an optimal attack on the BB84 protocol, where the necessary and sufficient condition for optimality involves the joint Hilbert space of the sender and the attacker. In this work, we propose a refined optimality criteria involving the Hilbert space of the attacker only. It reveals that the optimal (non-zero) overlaps between the attackers post-interactions states must be equal and numerically the same as the difference between the fidelity and the disturbance at the receiving end. That amount turns out to be the same as the reduction (factor) in Bell violation when estimated for the equivalent entanglement-based protocol. Further, a series of necessary and sufficient conditions unveil the structure of the optimal states which therefore are the only and all possible optimal interactions. These optimal states are the same as the outputs of an optimal phase-covariant cloner. We also demonstrate various methods to derive optimal unitary evolutions that an eavesdropper is interested to know in order to mount an optimal attack. The final key-rate is computed and plotted as well.

TI Error-robust quantum signal processing using Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Rydberg atom arrays have recently emerged as one of the most promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. However, as is the case for other experimental platforms, the longer-term success of the Rydberg atom arrays in implementing quantum algorithms depends crucially on their robustness to gate-induced errors. Here we show that, for an idealized biased-error model based on Rydberg atom dynamics, the implementation of quantum signal processing (QSP) protocols can be made error robust, in the sense that the asymptotic scaling of the gate-induced error probability is slower than that of gate complexity. Moreover, our numerical results that use experimentally accessible parameters indicate that QSP iterates made out of more than 100 gates can be implemented with constant error probability. To showcase our approach, we provide a concrete blueprint to implement QSP-based near-optimal Hamiltonian simulation on the Rydberg atom platform. The proposed protocol substantially improves both the scaling and the overhead of gate-induced errors in comparison to those protocols that implement a fourth-order product formula.

TI An intelligent threshold selection method to improve orbital angular
   momentum-encoded quantum key distribution under turbulence
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) encoded by orbital angular momentum (OAM) presents significant advantages in terms of information capacity. However, perturbations caused by free-space atmospheric turbulence decrease the performance of the system by introducing random fluctuations in the transmittance of OAM photons. Currently, the theoretical performance analysis of OAM-encoded QKD systems exists a gap when concerning the statistical distribution under the free-space link. In this article, we analyzed the security of QKD systems by combining probability distribution of transmission coefficient (PDTC) of OAM with decoy-state BB84 method. To address the problem that the invalid key rate is calculated in the part transmittance interval of the post-processing process, an intelligent threshold method based on neural network is proposed to improve OAM-encoded QKD, which aims to conserve computing resources and enhance system efficiency. Our findings reveal that the ratio of root mean square (RMS) OAM-beam radius to Fried constant plays a crucial role in ensuring secure key generation. Meanwhile, the training error of neural network is at the magnitude around 10-3, indicating the ability to predict optimization parameters quickly and accurately. Our work contributes to the advancement of parameter optimization and prediction for free-space OAM-encoded HD-QKD systems. Furthermore, it provides valuable theoretical insights to support the development of free-space experimental setups.

TI Dynamical blockade of a reservoir for optimal performances of a quantum
   battery
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The development of fast and efficient quantum batteries is crucial for the prospects of quantum technologies. In the present paper we demonstrate that both requirements are accomplished in the paradigmatic model of a harmonic oscillator strongly coupled to a highly non-Markovian thermal reservoir. We show that at short times, a dynamical blockade of the reservoir prevents the leakage of energy towards its degrees of freedom, promoting a significant accumulation of energy in the battery with high efficiency. The possibility of implementing these conditions in LC quantum circuits opens up new avenues for solid-state quantum batteries.

AB Should quantum computers become available, they will reduce the effective key length of basic secret-key primitives, such as blockciphers. To address this we will either need to use blockciphers with inherently longer keys or develop key-length extension techniques to amplify the security of a blockcipher to use longer keys.
   We consider the latter approach and revisit the FX and double encryption constructions. Classically, FX was proven to be a secure key-length extension technique, while double encryption fails to be more secure than single encryption due to a meet-in-the-middle attack. In this work we provide positive results, with concrete and tight bounds, for the security of both of these constructions against quantum attackers in ideal models.
   For FX, we consider a partially-quantum model, where the attacker has quantum access to the ideal primitive, but only classical access to FX. This is a natural model and also the strongest possible, since effective quantum attacks against FX exist in the fully-quantum model when quantum access is granted to both oracles. We provide two results for FX in this model. The first establishes the security of FX against nonadaptive attackers. The second establishes security against general adaptive attackers for a variant of FX using a random oracle in place of an ideal cipher. This result relies on the techniques of Zhandry (CRYPTO '19) for lazily sampling a quantum random oracle. An extension to perfectly lazily sampling a quantum random permutation, which would help resolve the adaptive security of standard FX, is an important but challenging open question. We introduce techniques for partially-quantum proofs without relying on analyzing the classical and quantum oracles separately, which is common in existing work. This may be of broader interest.
   For double encryption, we show that it amplifies strong pseudorandom permutation security in the fully-quantum model, strengthening a known result in the weaker sense of key-recovery security. This is done by adapting a technique of Tessaro and Thiruvengadam (TCC '18) to reduce the security to the difficulty of solving the list disjointness problem and then showing its hardness via a chain of reductions to the known quantum difficulty of the element distinctness problem.

TI AccelerQ: Accelerating Quantum Eigensolvers with Machine Learning on
   Quantum Simulators
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We present AccelerQ, a framework for automatically tuning quantum eigensolver (QE) implementations-these are quantum programs implementing a specific QE algorithm-using machine learning and search-based optimisation. Rather than redesigning quantum algorithms or manually tweaking the code of an already existing implementation, AccelerQ treats QE implementations as black-box programs and learns to optimise their hyperparameters to improve accuracy and efficiency by incorporating search-based techniques and genetic algorithms (GA) alongside ML models to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space of QE implementations and avoid local minima. Our approach leverages two ideas: 1) train on data from smaller, classically simulable systems, and 2) use program-specific ML models, exploiting the fact that local physical interactions in molecular systems persist across scales, supporting generalisation to larger systems. We present an empirical evaluation of AccelerQ on two fundamentally different QE implementations: ADAPT-QSCI and QCELS. For each, we trained a QE predictor model, a lightweight XGBoost Python regressor, using data extracted classically from systems of up to 16 qubits. We deployed the model to optimise hyperparameters for executions on larger systems of 20-, 24-, and 28-qubit Hamiltonians, where direct classical simulation becomes impractical. We observed a reduction in error from 5.48% to 5.3% with only the ML model and further to 5.05% with GA for ADAPT-QSCI, and from 7.5% to 6.5%, with no additional gain with GA for QCELS. Given inconclusive results for some 20-and 24-qubit systems, we recommend further analysis of training data concerning Hamiltonian characteristics. Nonetheless, our results highlight the potential of ML and optimisation techniques for quantum programs and suggest promising directions for integrating software engineering methods into quantum software stacks.

TI Quantum deep learning-based anomaly detection for enhanced network
   security
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Identifying and mitigating aberrant activities within the network traffic is important to prevent adverse consequences caused by cyber security incidents, which have been increasing significantly in recent times. Existing research mainly focuses on classical machine learning and deep learning-based approaches for detecting such attacks. However, exploiting the power of quantum deep learning to process complex correlation of features for anomaly detection is not well explored. Hence, in this paper, we investigate quantum machine learning and quantum deep learning-based anomaly detection methodologies to accurately detect network attacks. In particular, we propose three novel quantum auto-encoder-based anomaly detection frameworks. Our primary aim is to create hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both quantum and deep learning methodologies for efficient anomaly recognition. The three frameworks are formed by integrating the quantum autoencoder with a quantum one-class support vector machine, a quantum random forest, and a quantum k-nearest neighbor approach. The anomaly detection capability of the frameworks is evaluated using benchmark datasets comprising computer and Internet of Things network flows. Our evaluation demonstrates that all three frameworks have a high potential to detect the network traffic anomalies accurately, while the framework that integrates the quantum autoencoder with the quantum k-nearest neighbor yields the highest accuracy. This demonstrates the promising potential for the development of quantum frameworks for anomaly detection, underscoring their relevance for future advancements in network security.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement is not a precondition for secure
   conference key agreement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement plays a crucial role in the security of quantum key distribution. A secret key can only be obtained by two parties if there exists a corresponding entanglement-based description of the protocol in which entanglement is witnessed, as shown by Curty et al. [M. Curty, M. Lewenstein, and N. Lutkenhaus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 217903 (2004)]. Here we investigate the role of entanglement for the generalization of quantum key distribution to the multipartite scenario, namely, conference key agreement. In particular, we ask whether the strongest form of multipartite entanglement, namely, genuine multipartite entanglement, is necessary to establish a conference key. We show that, surprisingly, a nonzero conference key can be obtained even if the parties share biseparable states in each round of the protocol. Moreover, we relate conference key agreement with entanglement witnesses and show that a nonzero conference key can be interpreted as a nonlinear entanglement witness that detects a class of states which cannot be detected by usual linear entanglement witnesses.

AB Combinatorial optimization is an important application targeted by quantum computing. However, near-term hardware constraints make quantum algorithms unlikely to be competitive when compared to high-performing classical heuristics on large practical problems. One option to achieve advantages with near-term devices is to use them in combination with classical heuristics. In particular, we propose using quantum methods to sample from classically intractable distributions which is the most probable approach to attain a true provable quantum separation in the near-term - which are used to solve optimization problems faster. We numerically study this enhancement by an adaptation of Tabu Search using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as a neighborhood sampler. We show that QAOA provides a flexible tool for exploration-exploitation in such hybrid settings and can provide evidence that it can help in solving problems faster by saving many tabu iterations and achieving better solutions.

AB RF reflectometry is a promising technique for spin qubit readout, suitable for large-scale integrated qubit systems by combination with multiplexing techniques and gate-based readout. However, one of the challenges in such systems would be that the accuracy of RF readout of individual qubits can be degraded by crosstalk among dense RF readout lines. In this study, we propose a mixed-mode RF reflectometry to reduce the effect of the crosstalk and verify its effectiveness by electromagnetic field simulations. The results of the simulations show the possibility of suppressing the influence of crosstalk by using mixed modes.

The Bell-type inequality for relative entropy of coherence serves as an entanglement witness for pure entangled states. However, it does not perform reliably for mixed entangled states. This paper constructs a classifier by employing the relationship between coherence and entanglement for supervised machine learning methods. This method encodes multiple Bell-type inequalities for the relative entropy of coherence into an artificial neural network to detect the entangled and separable states in a quantum dataset.

AB Ultracold polar molecules are promising candidate qubits for quantum computing and quantum simulations. Their long-lived molecular rotational states form robust qubits, and the long-range dipolar interaction between molecules provides quantum entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate dipolar spin-exchange interactions between single calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules trapped in an optical tweezer array. We realized the spin- 12 quantum XY model by encoding an effective spin- 12 system into the rotational states of the molecules and used it to generate a Bell state through an iSWAP operation. Conditioned on the verified existence of molecules in both tweezers at the end of the measurement, we obtained a Bell state fidelity of 0.89(6). Using interleaved tweezer arrays, we demonstrate single-site molecular addressability.

AB The rapid progress of quantum computing threatens the long-term security of classical public-key cryptosystems, thereby necessitating an urgent transition toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While lattice-based schemes such as CRYSTALS-Kyber have emerged as strong candidates for quantum resistance, they remain highly vulnerable to runtime side-channel attacks (SCAs). To address this dual challenge, we propose Physically-Sensed Error Signature Verification (PSESV), a dual-layer hybrid encryption framework that integrates AES-192/AES-128 segmentation with CRYSTALS-Kyber key encapsulation. Unlike conventional hybrid models, PSESV incorporates real-time monitoring through three novel modules: (i) Thermal-Electromagnetic Hash Matching (TEHM), (ii) Dynamic Differential Coefficient Validation (DDCV), and (iii) Randomized Ciphertext Replay and Response (RCRR). Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation on an FPGA-based cryptographic accelerator demonstrate that PSESV achieves up to 96.3 % leakage detection accuracy with only < 6 mW additional power consumption and <= 1.6 ms latency, significantly outperforming baseline PQC and hybrid encryption schemes. The results highlight that PSESV not only enhances robustness against EM, thermal, and fault-injection attacks but also ensures practical deployability in resource-constrained environments. In conclusion, PSESV provides a scalable and security-hardened post-quantum solution for IoT, industrial control, and cloud systems, where resilience against both quantum and physical attacks is critically required.

TI Design and Implementation of Hardware-Software Architecture Based on
   Hashes for SPHINCS
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Advances in quantum computing have posed a future threat to today's cryptography. With the advent of these quantum computers, security could be compromised. Therefore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a request for proposals to standardize algorithms for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is considered difficult to solve for both classical and quantum computers. Among the proposed technologies, the most popular choices are lattice-based (shortest vector problem) and hash-based approaches. Other important categories are public key cryptography (PKE) and digital signatures. Within the realm of digital signatures lies SPHINCS+. However, there are few implementations of this scheme in hardware architectures. In this article, we present a hardware-software architecture for the SPHINCS+ scheme. We utilized a free RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor synthesized on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), primarily integrating two accelerator modules for Keccak-1600 and the Haraka hash function. Additionally, modifications were made to the processor to accommodate the execution of these added modules. Our implementation yielded a 15-fold increase in performance with the SHAKE-256 function and nearly 90-fold improvement when using Haraka, compared to the reference software. Moreover, it is more compact compared to related works. This implementation was realized on a Xilinx FPGA Arty S7: Spartan-7.

AB Quantum calculi and formalisms are useful tools for ensuring security and computational capabilities in blockchain and cryptography. They aid in designing and analysing new cryptographic protocols for blockchain, determining the behaviour of quantum operations in blockchain-based smart contracts, assessing the feasibility and security of quantum algorithms in blockchain applications, and building a quantum-safe blockchain system. A comprehensive review of the applications of quantum calculi and formalisms in computer security and network security, along with a bibliographic analysis is presented. It is unique in that it combines bibliometric analyses with a technical review of the domain of quantum calculi and formalism. Bibliometric and biographic analysis in the field helps identify research trends, assess the influence of research, determine collaboration patterns, evaluate journals, and examine publication behaviours, among other things. It performs bibliographic and bibliometric analysis using a dataset collected from Scopus and Web of Science through different queries. The obtained results help identify important institutions, authors, organisations, collaboration networks, keywords, and more. The provided open challenges and future vision pave the way for further research in the direction of quantum calculi and formalism applications in computer security and network security.

TI Qubit control noise spectroscopy with optimal suppression of dephasing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We extend quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) of amplitude control noise to settings where dephasing noise or detuning errors make significant contributions to qubit dynamics. Previous approaches to characterize amplitude noise are limited by their vulnerability to low-frequency dephasing noise and static detuning errors, which can overwhelm the target control noise signal and introduce bias into estimates of the amplitude noise spectrum. To overcome this problem, we leverage optimal control to identify a family of amplitude control waveforms that optimally suppress low-frequency dephasing noise and detuning errors, while maintaining the spectral concentration in the amplitude filter essential for spectral estimation. The waveforms found via numerical optimization have surprisingly simple analytic forms, consisting of oscillating sine waves obeying particular amplitude and frequency constraints. In numerically simulated QNS experiments, these waveforms demonstrate superior robustness, enabling accurate estimation of the amplitude noise spectrum in regimes where existing approaches are biased by low-frequency dephasing noise and detuning errors.

TI Assessing the potential of perfect screw dislocations in SiC for
   solid-state quantum technologies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Although point defects in solids can be used as qubits, it remains challenging to position them in a deterministic array. By means of advanced ab initio calculations we show that perfect screw dislocations in 3C-SiC could be used to overcome this limitation. In addition, we show that such dislocations can change the spin configuration of a point defect located inside its core, without changing the localized nature of its defect states. Our findings represent a technological leap as they show that dislocations can be used as active building blocks in future defect-based quantum computers.

TI Post-quantum nonlocality in the minimal triangle scenario
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate network nonlocality in the triangle scenario when all three parties have no input and binary outputs. Through an explicit example, we prove that this minimal scenario supports nonlocal correlations compatible with no-signaling and independence of the three sources, but not with realisations based on independent quantum or classical sources. This nonlocality is robust to noise. Moreover, we identify the equivalent to a Popescu-Rohrlich box in the minimal triangle scenario.

TI A quantum-inspired classifier for clonogenic assay evaluations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent advances in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have provided benefits to several computational processes, drastically reducing the time complexity. Another approach of combining quantum information theory with machine learning-without involving quantum computers-is known as Quantum-inspired Machine Learning (QiML), which exploits the expressive power of the quantum language to increase the accuracy of the process (rather than reducing the time complexity). In this work, we propose a large-scale experiment based on the application of a binary classifier inspired by quantum information theory to the biomedical imaging context in clonogenic assay evaluation to identify the most discriminative feature, allowing us to enhance cell colony segmentation. This innovative approach offers a two-fold result: (1) among the extracted and analyzed image features, homogeneity is shown to be a relevant feature in detecting challenging cell colonies; and (2) the proposed quantum-inspired classifier is a novel and outstanding methodology, compared to conventional machine learning classifiers, for the evaluation of clonogenic assays.

TI Power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The manipulation of quantum states through linear maps beyond quantum operations has many important applications in various areas of quantum information processing. Current methods simulate unphysical maps by sampling physical operations according to classically determined probability distributions. In this work, we show that using quantum measurement instead leads to lower simulation costs for general Hermitian-preserving maps. Remarkably, we establish the equality between the simulation cost and the well-known diamond norm, thus closing a previously known gap and assigning diamond norm a universal operational meaning for all Hermitian-preserving maps. We demonstrate our method in two applications closely related to error mitigation and quantum machine learning, where it exhibits a favorable scaling. These findings highlight the power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations, in which quantum interference is believed to play a vital role. Our work paves the way for more efficient sampling techniques and has the potential to be extended to more quantum information processing scenarios.

TI Adversarial Perturbation Elimination with GAN Based Defense in
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Systems
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Machine learning is being applied to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems as defense countermeasures for attack classification. However, recent studies have demonstrated that most of these detection networks are not immune to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose to implement typical adversarial attack strategies against the CVQKD system and introduce a generalized defense scheme. Adversarial attacks essentially generate data points located near decision boundaries that are linearized based on iterations of the classifier to lead to misclassification. Using the DeepFool attack as an example, we test it on four different CVQKD detection networks and demonstrate that an adversarial attack can fool most CVQKD detection networks. To solve this problem, we propose an improved adversarial perturbation elimination with a generative adversarial network (APE-GAN) scheme to generate samples with similar distribution to the original samples to defend against adversarial attacks. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively defend against adversarial attacks including DeepFool and other adversarial attacks and significantly improve the security of communication systems.

TI Passive Light Source Monitoring for Sending or Not Sending Twin-Field
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) can break the repeaterless linear bound and possess the measurement-device-independent security, and thus seems very promising in practical applications of quantum secure communication. In most reported TF-QKD protocols, light sources are assumed to possess trusted and fixed photon number distributions (PND), which are unrealistic assumptions in practical applications. Fortunately, the light source monitoring (LSM) method is proposed to circumvent this problem by actively adjusting the attenuation coefficient and monitoring the photon number distribution of light sources. However, the active light source monitoring (ALSM) method may induce additional modulation errors due to imperfect attenuation devices, deteriorating practical performances of TF-QKD systems. In this manuscript, we propose a passive light source monitoring (PLSM) scheme for TF-QKD, and employ the sending-or-not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD as an example for illustration. Simulation results show that our present work can greatly exceed both the original SNS protocol and the ALSM scheme when light source fluctuations and modulation errors are taken into account.

AB In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a transformative force in the field of combinatorial optimization, offering novel approaches to tackling complex problems that have long challenged classical computational methods. Among these, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) stands out for its potential to efficiently solve the Max-Cut problem, a quintessential example of combinatorial optimization. However, practical application faces challenges due to current limitations on quantum computational resource. Our work optimizes QAOA initialization, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as a warm-start technique. This sacrifices affordable computational resource on classical computer to reduce quantum computational resource overhead, enhancing QAOA's effectiveness. Experiments with various GNN architectures demonstrate the adaptability and stability of our framework, highlighting the synergy between quantum algorithms and machine learning. Our findings show GNN's potential in improving QAOA performance, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum-classical approaches in quantum computing and contributing to practical applications.

TI Practical quantum imaging with undetected photons
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Infrared (IR) imaging is invaluable across many scientific disciplines, from material analysis to diagnostic medicine. However, applications are often limited by detector cost, resolution and sensitivity, noise caused by the thermal IR background, and the cost, portability and tunability of infrared sources. Here, we describe a compact, portable, and low-cost system that is able to image objects at IR wavelengths without an IR source or IR detector. This imaging with undetected photons (IUP) approach uses quantum interference and correlations between entangled photon pairs to transfer image information from the IR to a wavelength which can be detected with a standard silicon camera. We also demonstrate a rapid analysis approach to acquire both phase and transmission image information. These developments provide an important step towards making IUP a commercially viable technique.Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI A Quantum Approach Towards the Adaptive Prediction of Cloud Workloads
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB This work presents a novel Evolutionary Quantum Neural Network (EQNN) based workload prediction model for Cloud datacenter. It exploits the computational efficiency of quantum computing by encoding workload information into qubits and propagating this information through the network to estimate the workload or resource demands with enhanced accuracy proactively. The rotation and reverse rotation effects of the Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate serve activation function at the hidden and output layers to adjust the qubit weights. In addition, a Self Balanced Adaptive Differential Evolution (SB-ADE) algorithm is developed to optimize qubit network weights. The accuracy of the EQNN prediction model is extensively evaluated and compared with seven state-of-the-art methods using eight real world benchmark datasets of three different categories. Experimental results reveal that the use of the quantum approach to evolutionary neural network substantially improves the prediction accuracy up to 91.6 percent over the existing approaches.

TI Exploring quantum learning in the smart grid through the evolution of
   noisy finite fourier series
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The decentralization and softwarization of modern industrial control systems such as the electric grid has resulted in greater efficiency, stability and reliability but these advantages come at a price of higher likelihood of cyberattacks due to the resulting increase in cyberattack surface. Traditional cyberattack detection techniques such as rule-based anomaly detection have an important role to play in first response. However, given the data-rich environment of the modern electric grid, current research thrusts are focused on integrating data-driven machine learning techniques that automatically learn to detect anomalous modes of operation and predict the presence of new attacks. Quantum machine learning (QML) is a subset of machine learning that aims to leverage quantum computers to obtain a learning advantage by means of a training speed-up, data-efficiency, or other form of performance benefit. Questions remain regarding the practical advantages of QML, with the vast majority of existing literature pointing to its greater utility when applied to quantum data rather than classical data, which within a smart grid environment include TCP/IP packets or telemetry measurements. In this paper, we explore a scenario where quantum data may arise in the smart grid, and exploit a quantum algorithmic primitive previously proposed in the literature to demonstrate that in the best-case, QML can provide accuracy advantages of > 25 percentage points when predicting anomalies.

TI Finite-key analysis of loss-tolerant quantum key distribution based on
   random sampling theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The core of security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the estimation of a parameter that determines the amount of privacy amplification that the users need to apply in order to distill a secret key. To estimate this parameter using the observed data, one needs to apply concentration inequalities such as random sampling theory or Azuma's inequality. The latter can be straightforwardly employed in a wider class of QKD protocols, including those that do not rely on basis-independent sources such as the loss-tolerant (LT) protocol. However, when applied to real-life finite-length QKD experiments, Azuma's inequality typically results in substantially lower secret-key rates. Here we propose an alternative security analysis of the LT protocol against general attacks, for both its prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent versions, that is based on random sampling theory. Consequently, our security proof provides considerably higher secret-key rates than the previous finite-key analysis based on Azuma's inequality. This work opens up the possibility of using random sampling theory to provide alternative security proofs for other QKD protocols.

TI Quantum correlations, entanglement spectrum, and coherence of the
   two-particle reduced density matrix in the extended Hubbard model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the ground state properties of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half filling from the perspective of its particle reduced density matrix. We focus on the reduced density matrix of two fermions and perform an analysis of its quantum correlations and coherence along the different phases of the model. Specifically, we study its (i) entanglement entropy, (ii) l(i) norm of coherence, (iii) irreducible two-body cumulant matrix, and (iv) entanglement spectrum. Our results show that these different properties are complementary to each other depending on the phase of the system, exhibiting peculiar behaviors such as discontinuities and maximum or minimum values at the quantum phase transitions, thus providing a qualitative view of the phase diagram of the model. In particular, in the superconducting region, we obtain that the entanglement spectrum signals a transition from a dominant singlet (SS) to triplet (TS) pairing ordering in the system. Moreover, from the analysis of the dominant eigenvector in the reduced state, we can relate the SS-TS transition to the spatial separation between the fermion pairs in the two different pairing orderings. The entanglement gap is also able to highlight a transition-at a few-body level-in the ground state wave function, not discussed previously in the literature. While other quantifiers are less sensitive to few-body defects in the wave function, the entanglement gap can work as a magnifying glass for these, capturing such small fluctuations.

TI Post-Quantum Digital Signature: Verkle-Based HORST
SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB The security of commonly used cryptographic systems like RSA and ECC might be threatened by the future development of quantum computing. Verkle-based HORST decreases the size of signatures by 75% (from 12.8 KB to 3.2 KB) and enables O(1)-sized proofs by replacing Merkle trees with Verkle trees. Because verification shifts from O(log t) to constant time, it is ideal for blockchain and IoT applications that require short signatures and fast validation. In order to increase efficiency, this study introduces Verkle-based HORST, a hash-based signature method that uses Verkle trees. Our primary contributions are the following: a formal security analysis proving maintained protection levels under standard assumptions; a thorough performance evaluation demonstrating significant improvements in signature size and verification complexity in comparison to conventional Merkle tree approaches; and a novel signature construction employing polynomial commitments to achieve compact proofs. The proposed approach has a lot of benefits for real-world implementation, especially when dealing with situations that call for a large number of signatures or settings with limited resources. We offer comprehensive implementation instructions and parameter choices to promote uptake while preserving hash-based cryptography's quantum-resistant security features. Our findings suggest that this method is a good fit for post-quantum cryptography systems' standardization.

TI Structure of CSS and CSS-T quantum codes
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We investigate CSS and CSS-T quantum error-correcting codes from the point of view of their existence, rarity, and performance. We give a lower bound on the number of pairs of linear codes that give rise to a CSS code with good correction capability, showing that such pairs are easy to produce with a randomized construction. We then prove that CSS-T codes exhibit the opposite behaviour, showing also that, under very natural assumptions, their rate and relative distance cannot be simultaneously large. This partially answers an open question on the feasible parameters of CSS-T codes. We conclude with a simple construction of CSS-T codes from Hermitian curves. The paper also offers a concise introduction to CSS and CSS-T codes from the point of view of classical coding theory.

TI Approximate bang-bang control assisted rapid switching feedback
   stabilization for stochastic qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE
AB For stochastic qubit systems under measurement feedback, an approximate bang-bang control assisted rapid switching control scheme with fewer switching times between the two subsets of state space is proposed in this paper. An eigenstate for single-qubit systems and any GHZ entangled state for multiqubit systems are prepared successfully. In our control scheme, the state space is partitioned into two parts: a subset S-1 containing the target state and its complementary set S-2. On each subset, a Lyapunov function is selected and the corresponding control law is designed, where the control laws in S-1 are of approximate bang-bang form and therefore can speed up the control process and the control laws in S-2 ensure the strictly monotonic descent of the corresponding Lyapunov function and therefore can reduce the switching times. In particular, for multi-qubit systems with degenerate measured observables, we use two control channels to distinguish the target state from other isospectral eigenstates. By properly constructing the control Hamiltonians and using stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, we prove that the switching control laws in this paper render the system trajectory to switch at most twice on the boundary of S-1 and S-2 and to converge to the target state contained in S-1 rapidly. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and rapidity of the proposed rapid control scheme. (C) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Time-bin phase-encoding quantum key distribution using Sagnac-based
   optics and compatible electronics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, we present a new time-bin phase-encoding quantum key distribution (QKD), where the transmitter utilizes an inherently stable Sagnac-type interferometer, and has comparable electrical requirements to existing polarization or phase encoding schemes. This approach does not require intensity calibration and is insensitive to environmental disturbances, making it both flexible and high-performing. We conducted experiments with a compact QKD system to demonstrate the stability and secure key rate performance of the presented scheme. The results show a typical secure key rate of 6.2 kbps@20 dB and 0.4 kbps@30 dB with channel loss emulated by variable optical attenuators. A continuous test of 120-km fiber spool shows a stable quantum bit error rate of the time-bin basis within 0.4%& SIM;0.6% over a consecutive 9-day period without any adjustment. This intrinsically stable and compatible scheme of time-bin phase encoding is extensively applicable in various QKD experiments, including BB84 and measurement-device-independent QKD.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Atomic Hydrogen Annealing of Graphene on InAs Surfaces and Nanowires:
   Interface and Morphology Control for Optoelectronics and Quantum
   Technologies
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Folding two-dimensional graphene around one-dimensional III-V nanowires yields a new class of hybrid nanomaterials combining their excellent complementary properties. However, important for high-quality electrical and optical performance, needed in many applications, are well-controlled oxide-free interfaces and a tight folding morphology. To improve the interface chemistry between the graphene and InAs, we annealed the samples in atomic hydrogen. Using surface-sensitive imaging, we found that the III-V native oxides in the interface can be reduced at temperatures that maintain the graphene and the III-V nanostructures. Transferring both single-and multilayer graphene flakes onto InAs NWs, we found that single layers fold tightly around the NWs, while the multilayers fold weakly with a decline of only a few degrees. Annealing in atomic hydrogen further tightens the folding. Together, this indicates that high-quality morphological and chemical control of this hybrid material system is possible, opening for future devices for quantum technologies and optoelectronics.

TI High-fidelity topological quantum state transfers in a cavity-magnon
   system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We propose a scheme for realizing high-fidelity topological state transfer via the topological edge states in a one-dimensional cavity-magnon system. It is found that the cavity-magnon system can be mapped analytically into the generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with tunable cavity-magnon coupling. It is shown that the edge state can be served as a quantum channel to realize the photonic and magnonic state transfers by adjusting the coupling strength between adjacent cavity modes. Further, our scheme can realize the quantum state transfer between photonic state and magnonic state by changing the cavity-magnon coupling strength. With the numerical simulation, we quantitatively show that the photonic, magnonic and magnon-to-photon state transfers can be achieved with high fidelity in the cavity-magnon system. Spectacularly, three different types of quantum state transfer schemes can be even transformed into each other in a controllable fashion. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model based on the cavity-magnon system provides us a tunable platform to engineer the transport of photon and magnon, which may have potential applications in topological quantum processing.

TI NSEA: A Resilient ERP Framework Integrating Quantum-Safe Cryptography
   and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Industrial Adaptability
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study proposes a neurosymbolic ERP architecture (NSEA) incorporating post-quantum cryptographic protocols to enable real-time cybersecurity and adaptive operational optimization. NSEA integrates CRYSTALS-Kyber lattice-based post-quantum cryptography with temporal graph neural networks and symbolic rule engines to enhance cybersecurity, decision automation, and legacy system compatibility. On industrial IoT (IIoT) edge devices, Kyber-512 achieves sub-5 mu s encryption latency and mitigates 72% of phishing attacks through dynamic response mechanisms. In demand forecasting tasks, the hybrid reasoning model reduced mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to 6.8% and resolved 89% of inventory stockout alerts within 15 minutes. Field validation in air conditioning and automotive supply chains demonstrated a 63.4% improvement in disruption recovery time and a 62.9% reduction in logistics cost overruns, compared to baseline systems. A resilience metric based on Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (DRE = 0.81 +/- 0.05) quantifies the system's robustness under simultaneous cyber and operational stress. Backward compatibility testing showed 92% schema alignment with legacy ERP modules through API translation, enabling a low-risk migration path. NSEA offers a unified and future-proof ERP solution that integrates security, intelligence, and interoperability in complex industrial environments.

TI Routing, Core and Wavelength Allocation in Multi-Core-Fiber-Based
   Quantum-Key-Distribution-Enabled Optical Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum-key-distribution (QKD) enabled optical networks can provide secure keys for different kinds of applications to ensure the high security of communication processes. As the number of wavelength channels in a single-core fiber is limited, space division multiplexing (SDM) has been considered to be a valuable technique to provide more wavelength resources, which solves the problem of insufficient channel capacity. Due to the rapid expansion of data volume, the SDM-based QKD network has been regarded as an important paradigm. At the same time, resource allocation in multi-core optical networks is a problem worthy of studying. In this work, four routing, core, and wavelength allocation (RCWA) algorithms are proposed in the multi-core optical network for quantum service requests and classical service requests, which are referred to as RCWA without perception (RCWA-WP), RCWA with crosstalk perception (RCWA-XTP), RCWA with spectrum perception (RCWA-SP), and RCWA with core perception (RCWA-CP). Simulations are carried out to evaluate the network performance in terms of blocking probability, key utilization, and average crosstalk intensity. The comparative results indicate that the RCWA-SP algorithm can improve network performance and reduce the blocking probability, while the RCWA-XTP algorithm can reduce inter-core crosstalk during transmission.

TI Emission spectral non-Markovianity in qubit-cavity systems in the
   ultrastrong coupling regime
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the emission spectra of the dissipative Rabi and Jaynes-Cummings models in the non-Markovian and ultrastrong coupling regimes. We have derived a polaron-transformed Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation (PTNZE) to calculate the emission spectra, which eliminates the well-known limitations of the Markovian approximation and the standard second-order perturbation. Using the time-dependent variational approach with the multiple Davydov ansatz as a benchmark, the PTNZE is found to yield accurate emission spectra in certain ultrastrong coupling regimes where the standard second-order Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation breaks down. It is shown that the emission spectra of the dissipative Rabi and Jaynes-Cummings models are, in general, asymmetric under various initial conditions. Direct comparisons of spectra for the two models illustrate the essential role of the qubit-cavity counter-rotating term and the spectral features under different qubit-cavity coupling strengths and system initial conditions.

SO PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES
AB The information content of one-electron bulk and edge states in semiconductor quantum wells is calculated in the inverted regime, where edge states, topologically protected, are responsible for the conduction in Spin Quantum Hall effect experiments. To study the information content of these states we first calculate realistic two dimensional one-electron states, solving first the eight-band k center dot p Hamiltonian to obtain the bulk states and then a four band effective Hamiltonian to obtain the edge states. The behavior of information-like quantities, as a function of the different parameters that define the quantum well, is analyzed. The results presented show that the helical edge states can be singled out using different quantities that characterize the rich phenomenology of these states.

TI RETRACTED: Enhanced post-quantum key escrow system for supervised data
   conflict of interest based on consortium blockchain

However, current key escrow schemes rely on vulnerable traditional asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithms. To address this issue, we have designed and implemented an enhanced post-quantum key escrow system for consortium blockchains. Our system integrates NIST post-quantum public-key encryption/KEM algorithms and various post-quantum cryptographic tools to provide a fine-grained, single-point-of-dishonest-resistant, collusion-proof and privacy-preserving solution. We also offer chaincodes, related APIs, and invoking command lines for development. Finally, we perform detailed security analysis and performance evaluation, including the consumed time of chaincode execution and the needed on-chain storage space, and we also highlight the security and performance of related post-quantum KEM algorithms on consortium blockchain.

TI Lagrangian duality in quantum optimization: Overcoming QUBO limitations
   for constrained problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an approach to solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems based on embedding the concept of Lagrangian duality into the framework of adiabatic quantum computation. Within the setting of circuit-model fault-tolerant quantum computation, we demonstrate that this approach achieves a quadratic improvement in circuit depth and maintains a constraint-independent circuit width in contrast with the prevalent approach of solving constrained problems via reformulations based on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) framework. In this study, we include a detailed review of the limitations encountered when using QUBO for constrained optimization. We show that the proposed method overcomes these limitations by encoding the optimal solution at an energetically elevated level of a simpler problem Hamiltonian, which results in substantially more resource-efficient quantum circuits. We consolidate our strategy with a detailed analysis on how the concepts of Lagrangian duality such as duality gap and complementary slackness relate to the success probability of sampling the optimal solution. Our findings are illustrated by benchmarking the Lagrangian dual approach against the QUBO approach using the NP-complete binary knapsack problem.

TI Optimising the quantum/classical interface for efficiency and
   portability with a multi-level hardware abstraction layer for quantum
   computers
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Steady progress is being made in the development of quantum computing platforms based on different types of qubit technologies. Each platform requires bespoke strategies to maximise the efficiency of the quantum/classical interface when operating close to the qubits. At a higher level, however, a shared interface allowing portability of quantum algorithms across all the available quantum platforms is preferred. Striking the right balance between portability and performance of the algorithm as implemented on quantum hardware remains a major challenge for this field. Here, we propose a quantum hardware abstraction layer (QHAL) providing a multi-level intermediate representation of the quantum stack. A collaborative effort between software specialists and quantum hardware developers operating on four major qubit technologies (photonics, silicon, superconducting and trapped ions) led to the identification of a minimum common set of instructions and metadata allowing the QHAL to interact efficiently with multiple platforms. Access to the stack from the higher levels increases latency yet minimises the amount of hardware architecture parameters to be handled by the algorithm developer, thus simplifying code development and reducing security threats from misuse or malicious access for hardware developers. Access to the stack from the lowest-closest to the qubits-level provides the highest hardware responsiveness, suitable for algorithms requiring minimum latency for data and instruction transfer. With respect to existing quantum assembly languages, the QHAL extends further down in the stack by defining an application-binary interface to interact with the quantum hardware. By defining a standard representation of the quantum stack, a common reference framework is provided to both software and hardware developers which would ensure future integration of their R&D efforts.

TI Qubit entanglement generated by classical light driving an optical
   cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the generation of entanglement between two qubits which communicate through a single cavity mode of quantum light but have no direct interaction. We show that such entanglement can be generated simply by exchanging quanta with a third party, which is in our case the cavity mode. Exchanging only a single quantum creates maximal entanglement. A single quantum can be provided by an external quantum light source. However, we use a classical light source to pump quanta which are used for the exchange, and investigate the degree of two-qubit entanglement. We first identify a characteristic timescale of the interaction between the cavity mode and each qubit. We investigate two regimes of the driving pulse length: one is short and the other is long compared to the characteristic timescale of the interaction. In the first regime, it is known that the pulse can pump the system by generating a displacement of the cavity mode. We show that, by using a specific pulse shape, one can make the displacement essentially vanish after the pulse finishes interaction with the cavity mode. In this case, a rotation of the qubits can be invoked. In addition, higher-order effects of the pulse including a nonlocal operation on the joint system of the cavity mode and the qubits are found, and we present a formalism to compute each term up to a given order. An explicit condition on the pulse shape for each term to be nonzero or suppressed is derived to enable an experimental design for verifying the entanglement generation using a classical light source. In the opposite regime where the driving is sufficiently long, we utilize a squeezed state which may be obtained adiabatically. We study how the squeezing and the accompanied rotation of qubits affect the generated two-qubit entanglement.

TI Quantum next-generation reservoir computing and its quantum optical
   implementation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) exploits the information-processing capabilities of quantum systems to tackle time-series forecasting tasks, which is expected to be superior to their classical counterparts. By far, many QRC schemes have been theoretically proposed. However, most of these schemes involve long-time evolution of quantum systems or networks with quantum gates. This poses a challenge for practical implementation of these schemes, as precise manipulation of quantum systems is crucial, and this level of control is currently hard to achieve with the existing state of quantum technology. Here we propose a different QRC scheme, which is friendly to experimental realization. It implements the quantum version of nonlinear vector autoregression, extracting linear and nonlinear features of quantum data by measurements. Thus, the evolution of complex networks of quantum gates can be avoided. Compared to other QRC schemes, our proposal also achieves an advance by effectively reducing the necessary training data for reliable predictions in time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we experimentally verify our proposal by performing the forecasting tasks, and the observation matches well with the theoretical ones. Our work opens up a different way for complex tasks to be solved by using QRC, which can herald the next generation of QRC.

TI Improved analysis of measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution with non-phase-randomized coherent states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can remove all detector side-channel attacks, which can be implemented with phase-randomized coherent states (PRCS) or non-phase-randomized coherent states (NPRCS). In this paper, we focus on the MDI-QKD protocol with NPRCS and provide an improved analysis. In contrast with the original MDI-QKD with NPRCS which modulates the same intensity of coherent states in the key and test bases, we propose to modulate different intensities of coherent states in the key and test bases. Simulation results show that the secret key rate and transmission distance of MDI-QKD with NPRCS can be significantly improved. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the modulation of different intensities does not bring extra complexity for experimental researchers, which can be easily done by adding an intensity modulator.

TI Entanglement-based quantum communication complexity beyond Bell
   nonlocality
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficient distributed computing offers a scalable strategy for solving resource-demanding tasks, such as parallel computation and circuit optimisation. Crucially, the communication overhead introduced by the allotment process should be minimised-a key motivation behind the communication complexity problem (CCP). Quantum resources are well-suited to this task, offering clear strategies that can outperform classical counterparts. Furthermore, the connection between quantum CCPs and non-locality provides an information-theoretic insight into fundamental quantum mechanics. Here we connect quantum CCPs with a generalised non-locality framework-beyond Bell's paradigmatic theorem-by incorporating the underlying causal structure, which governs the distributed task, into a so-called non-local hidden-variable model. We prove that a new class of communication complexity tasks can be associated with Bell-like inequalities, whose violation is both necessary and sufficient for a quantum gain. We experimentally implement a multipartite CCP akin to the guess-your-neighbour-input scenario, and demonstrate a quantum advantage when multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are shared among three users.

TI Statistical characterization of discrete amplitude-modulated coherent
   states at telecom wavelengths by means of an up-conversion-based
   photon-number-resolving detector
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The successful implementation of quantum communication protocols relies on the proper encoding of information in the degrees of freedom of the employed optical states. Particular interest is devoted to amplitude-phase-shift keying coherent states, which can provide robust solutions in satellite communication systems and guarantee high values of channel capacity. In this work, we implement a sum-frequency-based photon-number-resolving detector, capable of revealing discrete amplitude modulation of coherent states produced at telecom wavelengths. The detection is performed in the visible spectral range and in the photon-number-resolving domain, thus encouraging the use of more complex alphabets in which both amplitude and phase vary.

TI Impact of visibility limiting conditions on satellite and high-altitude
   platform quantum key distribution links
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Satellite and aerial platforms are critical in the deployment of global quantum communications networks. Currently, there remain significant challenges including operation during daytime and robustness to visibility limiting conditions. In this work we investigate, through simulation, the impact of visibility limiting conditions on low-Earth orbit CubeSat dimensioned satellites, small satellites and high-altitude platform implementations. Three different operational wavelengths were considered: currently used near-infrared (at 850 nm); next-generation short-wave infrared (at 1550 nm); and a candidate longer wavelength (at 2133 nm). We present channel attenuation and consider quantum key distribution (QKD) system performance parameters. Results indicate that the "best wavelength" for an implementation depends on the minimum visibility rated and the single-photon detector technology utilized. In the cases where tolerated meteorological visibility is short, 1550 nm and 2133 nm wavelengths provide better performance. In cases when the visibility is long, the operational wavelength of 850 nm provides better QKD system performance.

The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector.

TI Quantum Sensing of Time-Dependent Electromagnetic Fields with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB In this study, we investigate the potential of electronic interferometers for probing the quantum state of electromagnetic radiation on a chip at subnanosecond timescales. We propose to use single-electron excitations propagating within an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the Aharonov-Bohmdominated regime. We discuss how information about the quantum state of the electromagnetic radiation is encoded into the interference contribution to the average outgoing electrical current. By investigating squeezed radiation and single-edge magnetoplasmons probed by leviton pulses in a realistic setup, we show that single-electron interferometers have the potential to probe quantum radiation in the time domain with subnanosecond to picosecond time resolution. Our research could have significant implications for probing the fundamental properties of light in the microwave to terahertz domains at extremely short timescales.

TI Optimizing radiotherapy plans for cancer treatment with Tensor Networks
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB We present a novel application of Tensor Network methods in cancer treatment as a potential tool to solve the dose optimization problem in radiotherapy. In particular, the intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique-that allows treating irregular and inhomogeneous tumors while reducing the radiation toxicity on healthy organs-is based on the optimization problem of the beamlets intensities that shall result in a maximal delivery of the therapy dose to cancer while avoiding the organs at risk of being damaged by the radiation. The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm. In particular, we present an anatomical scenario exemplifying a prostate cancer treatment. A similar approach can be applied to future hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, paving the way for the use of quantum technologies in future medical treatments.

TI Complementarity between quantum coherence and mixedness: a majorization
   approach
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherence is a relevant resource for various quantum information processing tasks, but it is fragile since it is generally affected by environmental noise. This is reflected in the loss of purity of the system, which in turn limits the amount of quantum coherence of it. As a consequence, a complementarity relation between coherence and mixedness arises. Previous works characterize this complementarity through inequalities between the l (1)-norm of coherence and linear entropy, and between the relative entropy of coherence and von Neumann entropy. However, coherence-mixedness complementarity is expected to be a general feature of quantum systems, regardless of the measures used. Here, an alternative approach to coherence-mixedness complementarity, based on majorization theory, is proposed. Vectorial quantifiers of coherence and mixedness, namely the coherence vector and the spectrum, respectively, are used, instead of scalar measures. A majorization relation for the tensor product of both vectorial quantifiers is obtained, capturing general aspects of the trade-off between coherence and mixedness. The optimal bound for qubit systems and numerical bounds for qutrit systems are analyzed. Finally, coherence-mixedness complementarity relations are derived for a family of symmetric, concave and additive functions. These results provide a deeper insight into the relation between quantum coherence and mixedness.

TI Magic transition in measurement-only circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Magic, or nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state from stabilizer states and serves as a resource for quantum computational advantage. Here, we investigate magic transitions in measurement-only quantum circuits comprising competing Clifford and non-Clifford measurements. Remarkably, this circuit can be mapped onto a classical model, enabling efficient large-scale numerical simulations and exact characterization of magic using measures that are additive for tensor products of single-qubit states. We identify a magic transition between two phases exhibiting extensive magic, separated by a critical point where mutual magic displays scaling analogous to entanglement entropy. Additionally, these distinct phases can be distinguished by topological magic. In contrast, with a vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, the system exhibits saturation of magic. Our results clarify the nature of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits utilizing genuine magic measures, thereby advancing our understanding of quantum complexity in monitored quantum systems.

Both the resistive and capacitive components in the equivalent circuit model for the RF MOSFET devices are calibrated based on temperature-dependent S-parameter measurements (0.25 - 40 GHz) from 298 K to 6 K. By integrating the intrinsic device model and the extrinsic parasitic parameters, a generic cryogenic device RF model is developed to capture the cutoff frequency and high-frequency performance of NMOS and PMOS transistors with varied device configurations. The establishment of validated database as functions of device size, temperature, and frequency responses lays a solid foundation for practical large-scale cryo-CMOS RF circuit design and optimization.

TI Operator dynamics and entanglement in space-time dual Hadamard lattices
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Many-body quantum dynamics defined on a spatial lattice and in discrete time-either as stroboscopic Floquet systems or quantum circuits-has been an active area of research for several years. Being discrete in space and time, a natural question arises: when can such a model be viewed as evolving unitarily in space as well as in time? Models with this property, which sometimes goes by the name space-time duality, have been shown to have a number of interesting features related to entanglement growth and correlations. One natural way in which the property arises in the context of (brickwork) quantum circuits is by choosing dual unitary gates: two site operators that are unitary in both the space and time directions. We introduce a class of models with q states per site, defined on the square lattice by a complex partition function and paremeterized in terms of q x q Hadamard matrices, that have the property of space-time duality. These may interpreted as particular dual unitary circuits or stroboscopically evolving systems, and generalize the well studied self-dual kicked Ising model. We explore the operator dynamics in the case of Clifford circuits, making connections to Clifford cellular automata (Schlingemann et al 2008 J. Math. Phys. 49 112104) and in the q ->infinity limit to the classical spatiotemporal cat model of many body chaos (Gutkin et al 2021 Nonlinearity 34 2800). We establish integrability and the corresponding conserved charges for a large subfamily and show how the long-range entanglement protocol discussed in the recent paper (Lotkov et al 2022 Phys. Rev. B 105 144306) can be reinterpreted in purely graphical terms and directly applied here.

TI Entanglement properties of superconducting qubits coupled to a
   semi-infinite transmission line
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum entanglement, a key resource in quantum information processing, is reduced by interaction between the quantum system concerned and its unavoidable noisy environment. Therefore it is of particular importance to study the dynamical properties of entanglement in open quantum systems. In this work, we mainly focus on two qubits coupled to an adjustable environment, namely a semi-infinite transmission line. The two qubits' relaxations, through individual channels or collective channel or both, can be adjusted by the qubits' transition frequencies. We examine entanglement dynamics in this model system with initial Werner state, and show that the phenomena of entanglement sudden death and revival can be observed. Due to the hardness of preparing the Werner state experimentally, we introduce a new type of entangled state called pseudo-Werner state, which preserves as much entangling property as the Werner state, and more importantly, it is experiment friendly. Furthermore, we provide detailed procedures for generating pseudo-Werner state and studying entanglement dynamics with it, which can be straightforwardly implemented in a superconducting waveguide quantum electrodynamics system.

TI Comparative Study of the Ansätze in Quantum Language Models
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum language models are the alternative to classical language models, which borrow concepts and methods from quantum machine learning and computational linguistics. While several quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods and frameworks exist for text classification and generation, there is a lack of systematic study to compare the performance across various ans & auml;tze, in terms of their hyperparameters and classical and quantum methods to implement them. Here, the performance of quantum natural language processing models based on these ans & auml;tze is evaluated at different levels in text classification tasks. A comparative study is performed and the QNLP models are optimized by fine-tuning several critical hyperparameters. These results demonstrate how the balance between simplification and expressivity affects model performance.

TI Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation by direct block
   encoding of the time-marching operator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. A direct unitary block encoding of the explicit time-marching operator is constructed, resulting in the intrinsic success probability of the squared solution norm without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. The algorithm separates the explicit time-marching operator into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation and combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.

TI Quantum geometric protocols for fast high-fidelity adiabatic state
   transfer
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Efficient adiabatic control schemes, where one steers a quantum system along an adiabatic path ensuring minimal excitations while achieving a desired final state, that enable fast, high-fidelity operations are essential for any practical quantum computation. However, current optimization protocols are not universally tractable due to stringent requirements imposed by the microscopic systems encoding the qubit, including complex energy level structures and unwanted transitions, and generally require a trade-off between speed and fidelity of the operation. Here, we address these challenges by developing a general framework for optimal control based on the quantum metric tensor. This framework allows for fast and high-fidelity adiabatic pulses, even for a dense energy spectrum, based solely on the Hamiltonian of the system instead of the time evolution propagator and independent of the size of the underlying Hilbert space. Furthermore, our framework suppresses diabatic transitions and state-dependent crosstalk effects without the need for additional control fields. As an example, we study the adiabatic charge transfer in a double quantum dot to find optimal control pulses with improved performance. We show that for the geometric protocol, the transfer fidelities are lower bounded F>99% pulses, regardless of the size of the anti-crossing, while being robust against miscalibration errors and quasistatic noise.

TI The Accuracy vs. Sampling Overhead Trade-off in Quantum Error Mitigation
   Using Monte Carlo-Based Channel Inversion
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a class of promising techniques for reducing the computational error of variational quantum algorithms. In general, the computational error reduction comes at the cost of a sampling overhead due to the variance-boosting effect caused by the channel inversion operation, which ultimately limits the applicability of QEM. Existing sampling overhead analysis of QEM typically assumes exact channel inversion, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. In this treatise, we consider a practical channel inversion strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces additional computational error that in turn may be eliminated at the cost of an extra sampling overhead. In particular, we show that when the computational error is small compared to the dynamic range of the error-free results, it scales with the square root of the number of gates. By contrast, the error exhibits a linear scaling with the number of gates in the absence of QEM under the same assumptions. Hence, the error scaling of QEM remains to be preferable even without the extra sampling overhead. Our analytical results are accompanied by numerical examples.

TI Exploring Quantum Neural Networks for Demand Forecasting
SO ENTROPY
AB Forecasting demand for assets and services can be addressed in various markets, providing a competitive advantage when the predictive models used demonstrate high accuracy. However, the training of machine learning models incurs high computational costs, which may limit the training of prediction models based on available computational capacity. In this context, this paper presents an approach for training demand prediction models using quantum neural networks. For this purpose, a quantum neural network was used to forecast demand for vehicle financing. A classical recurrent neural network was used to compare the results, and they show a similar predictive capacity between the classical and quantum models, with the advantage of using a lower number of training parameters and also converging in fewer steps. Utilizing quantum computing techniques offers a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches in training predictive models for complex market dynamics.

TI High-Fidelity Operations on Silicon Donor Qubits Using Dynamical
   Decoupling Gates
SO ENTROPY
AB Dynamic decoupling (DD) can suppress decoherence caused by environmental noise, while in hybrid system it also hinders coherent manipulation between qubits. We realized the universal high-fidelity quantum gate set and the preparation of Bell states using dynamical decoupling gates (DD gates) in a silicon-based phosphorus-doped (Si:P) system, effectively resolving the contradiction between decoherence protection and manipulation of qubits. The simulation results show that the fidelity of the universal quantum gate set are all above 99%, and the fidelity of Bell state preparation is over 96%. This work realized the compatibility between coherent protection and high-fidelity manipulation of quantum states, provided a reliable theoretical support for high-fidelity quantum computing.

TI Microscopic-scale magnetic recording of brain neuronal electrical
   activity using a diamond quantum sensor
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum sensors using solid state qubits have demonstrated outstanding sensitivity, beyond that possible using classical devices. In particular, those based on colour centres in diamond have demonstrated high sensitivity to magnetic field through exploiting the field-dependent emission of fluorescence under coherent control using microwaves. Given the highly biocompatible nature of diamond, sensing from biological samples is a key interdisciplinary application. In particular, the microscopic-scale study of living systems can be possible through recording of temperature and biomagnetic field. In this work, we use such a quantum sensor to demonstrate such microscopic-scale recording of electrical activity from neurons in fragile living brain tissue. By recording weak magnetic field induced by ionic currents in mouse corpus callosum axons, we accurately recover signals from neuronal action potential propagation while demonstrating in situ pharmacology. Our sensor allows recording of the electrical activity in neural circuits, disruption of which can shed light on the mechanisms of disease emergence. Unlike existing techniques for recording activity, which can require potentially damaging direct interaction, our sensing is entirely passive and remote from the sample. Our results open a promising new avenue for the microscopic recording of neuronal signals, offering the eventual prospect of microscopic imaging of electrical activity in the living mammalian brain.

TI Thread/State correspondence: from bit threads to qubit threads
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Starting from an interesting coincidence between the bit threads and SS (surface/state) correspondence, both of which are closely related to the holographic RT formula, we introduce a property of bit threads that has not been explicitly proposed before, which can be referred to as thread/state correspondence (see [50] for a brief pre-release version). Using this thread/state correspondence, we can construct the explicit expressions for the SS states corresponding to a set of bulk extremal surfaces in the SS correspondence, and nicely characterize their entanglement structure. Based on this understanding, we use the locking bit thread configurations to construct a holographic qubit threads model as a new toy model of the holographic principle, and show that it is closely related to the holographic tensor networks, the kinematic space, and the connectivity of spacetime.

TI A parametrically programmable delay line for microwave photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Delay lines that store quantum information are crucial for advancing quantum repeaters and hardware efficient quantum computers. Traditionally, they are realized as extended systems that support wave propagation but provide limited control over the propagating fields. Here, we introduce a parametrically addressed delay line for microwave photons that provides a high level of control over the stored pulses. By parametrically driving a three-wave mixing circuit element that is weakly hybridized with an ensemble of resonators, we engineer a spectral response that simulates that of a physical delay line, while providing fast control over the delay line's properties. We demonstrate this novel degree of control by choosing which photon echo to emit, translating pulses in time, and even swapping two pulses, all with pulse energies on the order of a single photon. We also measure the noise added from our parametric interactions and find it is much less than one photon.
   Delay lines for quantum information are key for quantum networking and hardware efficient quantum computers. Here, the authors present a virtual delay line for microwave pulses where data is stored in the excitations of a collection of resonators, demonstrating translation and swapping of data pulses.

TI Ultrastrong coupling of a qubit with a nonlinear optical resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the interaction of a two-level atom with a single-mode nonlinear electromagnetic resonator, considering coupling strengths ranging from zero to the so-called deep strong coupling regime. When the qubit-resonator coupling is very strong, the standard Kerr model for the resonator becomes questionable. Moreover, recently, it has been shown that extra care is needed when constructing gauge-independent theories in the presence of approximations as the truncation of the Hilbert space of the matter system. Such a truncation can ruin gauge invariance leading to nonphysical results, especially when the light-matter interactions strength is very high. Here we face and solve these issues to provide a consistent nonlinear-resonator quantum Rabi model satisfying the gauge principle.

TI Exploring biological neuronal correlations with quantum generative
   models
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Understanding how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters and highly task-specific architectures, which can complicate model design and scalability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.

TI Stand-alone vacuum cell for compact ultracold quantum technologies
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Compact vacuum systems are key enabling components for cold atom technologies, facilitating extremely accurate sensing applications. There has been important progress toward a truly portable compact vacuum system; however, size, weight, and power consumption can be prohibitively large, optical access may be limited, and active pumping is often required. Here, we present a centiliter-scale ceramic vacuum chamber with He-impermeable viewports and an integrated diffractive optic, enabling robust laser cooling with light from a single polarization-maintaining fiber. A cold atom demonstrator based on the vacuum cell delivers 10(7) laser-cooled Rb-87 atoms per second, using minimal electrical power. With continuous Rb gas emission, active pumping yields a 10 - 7 mbar equilibrium pressure, and passive pumping stabilizes to 3 x 10 - 6 mbar with a 17 day time constant. A vacuum cell, with no Rb dispensing and only passive pumping, has currently kept a similar pressure for more than 500 days. The passive-pumping vacuum lifetime is several years, which is estimated from short-term He throughput with many foreseeable improvements. This technology enables wide-ranging mobilization of ultracold quantum metrology.

TI A Novel Quantum Sequential Signature Protocol With Y-SNOP States
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the development of quantum technology, an arising researching point is to solve some new cipher problems with quantum technology to ensure their security. As we know, the sequential signature means to sign a contract or a document by many signers one by one. It has been widely used to realize layered authentication. In this paper, we propose a quantum sequential signature protocol with a set of strongly nonlocal orthogonal product (Y-SNOP) states. It is proved that the present protocol is secure, i.e., anyone cannot deny or forge a valid signature even some of them conspire. Compared with the existing quantum multi signature with some nonlocal orthogonal product (NOP) states, the present protocol seems more efficient and easier to be realized in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device as no entangled resources are required.

TI Room-Temperature Entanglement of the Nickel-Radical Molecular Complex
   (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] Reinforced by the Magnetic
   Field
SO INORGANICS
AB Bipartite entanglement is comprehensively investigated in the mononuclear molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)(2)L], where HL denotes 2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-oxide-1-oxyl and hfacH stands for hexafluoroacetylacetone. From the magnetic point of view, the molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)(2)L] consists of an exchange-coupled spin-1 Ni2+ magnetic ion and a spin- 1 2 nitronyl-nitroxide radical substituted nitrophenol. The nickel-radical molecular complex affords an experimental realization of a mixed spin-( 1 2 , 1) Heisenberg dimer with a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, J/ k B = 505 K, and two distinct g-factors, g(Rad) = 2.005 and g(Ni) = 2.275. By adopting this set of magnetic parameters, we demonstrate that the Zeeman splitting of a quantum ferrimagnetic ground-state doublet due to a weak magnetic field may substantially reinforce the strength of bipartite entanglement at low temperatures. The molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)(2)L] maintains sufficiently strong thermal entanglement, even at room temperature, vanishing only above 546 K. Specifically, the thermal entanglement in the nickel-radical molecular complex retains approximately 40% of the maximum value, corresponding to perfectly entangled Bell states at room temperature, which implies that this magnetic compound provides a suitable platform of a molecular qubit with potential implications for room-temperature quantum computation and quantum information processing.

TI Self-supervision with quantum classifiers
SO IEICE NONLINEAR THEORY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a novel method for learning representations from inputs without data annotations. A key challenge in SSL is avoiding the collapse of representations, leading to poor predictive models. This research proposes an SSL framework that leverages quantum classifiers to address this issue. We achieve well-stratified, nontrivial representations by embedding data into the Hilbert space via quantum classifiers. The algorithm works by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to maximize the agreement of positive pairs and minimize the agreement of negative pairs. We demonstrate the proof-of-concept in image classification tasks using MNIST, KMNIST, and FashionMNIST datasets. Classifiers trained with our framework achieve higher predictive performance than classical classifiers, with a maximum accuracy of 65% on MNIST and more than 70% on KM-NIST and FashionMNIST using unseen samples without fine-tuning. The code implementation is available at https://github.com/namhai03/QSSL

TI Efficient quantum circuit contraction using tensor decision diagrams
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Simulating quantum circuits efficiently on classical computers is crucial given the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. This paper adapts and extends two methods used to contract tensor networks within the fast tensor decision diagram (FTDD) framework. The methods, called iterative pairing and block contraction, exploit the advantages of tensor decision diagrams to reduce both the temporal and spatial cost of quantum circuit simulations. The iterative pairing method minimizes intermediate diagram sizes, while the block contraction algorithm efficiently handles circuits with repetitive structures, such as those found in quantum walks and Grover's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that, in some cases, these methods significantly outperform traditional contraction orders like sequential and cotengra in terms of both memory usage and execution time. Furthermore, simulation tools based on decision diagrams, such as FTDD, show superior performance to matrix-based simulation tools, such as Google tensor networks, enabling the simulation of larger circuits more efficiently. These findings show the potential of decision diagram-based approaches to improve the simulation of quantum circuits on classical platforms.

TI Use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for enhancing biomarker
   classification
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) combines quantum computing with machine learning, offering potential for solving intricate problems. Our research delves into QML's application in identifying gene expression biomarkers for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) metastasis. ccRCC, the primary renal cancer subtype, poses significant challenges due to its high lethality and complex metastasis process. Despite extensive research, understanding the mechanisms of cancer cell dissemination and establishment in distant sites remains elusive. Identifying metastasis biomarkers is a daunting task in machine learning. Our study addresses the need for improved execution time and accuracy in QSVC and QNN algorithms compared to SVC and NN for binary classification. Drawing inspiration from the Neural Quantum Embedding (NQE) method, we propose a two-stage approach for the binary classification problem. We aim to assess if integrating NQE with QSVC/QNN enhances performance compared to NQE with SVC/NN across diverse biomedical datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach.

TI Quantum simulation of 2D antiferromagnets with hundreds of Rydberg atoms
SO NATURE
AB Quantum simulation using synthetic systems is a promising route to solve outstanding quantum many-body problems in regimes where other approaches, including numerical ones, fail(1). Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions(2-4), superconducting circuits(5-7), neutral atoms(8-11) or molecules(12,13). All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atom strapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states(11), to implement an iconic many-body problem-the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries-square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.

TI Quantum granular-ball generation methods and their application in KNN
   classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Granular-balls reduce the data volume and enhance the efficiency of fundamental algorithms such as clustering and classification. However, generating granular-balls is a time-consuming process, posing a significant bottleneck for the practical application of granular-balls. In this paper, we propose two innovative quantum granular-ball generation methods that capitalize on the inherent properties of quantum computing. The first method employs an iterative splitting technique, while the second utilizes a predetermined number of splits. The iterative splitting method significantly reduces time complexity compared to existing classical granular-ball generation methods. Notably, the method employing a fixed number of splits delivers a substantial quadratic acceleration over the iterative technique. Moreover, we also propose a quantum k-nearest neighbors algorithm based on granular-balls (QGBkNN) and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.

TI Enhancing noise suppression of phase estimation in continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution with discrete modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Accurately estimating phase is crucial in continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems, directly impacting the final secret key rate. In previous systems that utilize the local local oscillator, phase estimation is closely tied to the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pilot signal. As SNR decreases, so does the accuracy of phase estimation, leading to increased excess noise and a potential loss of the system's secret key rate. The SNR of the pilot signal is constrained by the optical source power, which tends to approach 0 dB, particularly over long distances. Enhancing the accuracy of phase estimation under conditions of low SNR for pilot signals is highly challenging, especially in long-distance quantum key distribution. Our paper proposes two digital filter methods: the unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) and the Savitzky-Golay filtering (SGF) for phase estimation, which effectively mitigates the effects of additive noise. The approach applies to digital systems and therefore holds particular advantages in systems based on discrete-modulation (DM) protocols. Through simulations and practical implementation based on DM protocols, we find that the digital filter scheme is capable of accurately estimating phase, especially in scenarios with low SNR of the pilot signal. The conventional method fails to achieve an effective secret key rate, whereas the digital-filter-based scheme achieves a secret key rate of almost 30 kbps over a 20 km fiber link with a repetition frequency of 5 MHz under conditions where the SNR of the pilot signal is around 0 dB.

TI Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Simulator: Prelude to Spin and Photonic
   Qubits
SO ACS NANO
AB The quest for qubit operation at room temperature is accelerating the field of quantum information science and technology. Solid state quantum defects with spin-optical properties are promising spin- and photonic qubit candidates for room temperature operations. In this regard, a single boron vacancy within hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) lattice such as V-B(-) defect has coherent quantum interfaces for spin and photonic qubits owing to the large band gap of h-BN (6 eV) that can shield a computational subspace from environmental noise. However, for a V-B(-) defect in h-BN to be a potential quantum simulator, the design and characterization of the Hamiltonian involving mutual interactions of the defect and other degrees of freedom are needed to fully understand the effect of defects on the computational subspace. Here, we studied the key coupling tensors such as zero-field splitting, Zeeman effect, and hyperfine splitting in order to build the Hamiltonian of the V-B(-) defect. These eigenstates are spin triplet states that form a computational subspace. To study the phonon-assisted single photon emission in the V-B(-) defect, the Hamiltonian is characterized by electron-phonon interaction with Jahn-Teller distortions. A theoretical demonstration of how the V-B(-) Hamiltonian is utilized to relate these quantum properties to spin- and photonic-quantum information processing. For selecting promising host 2D materials for spin and photonic qubits, we present a data-mining perspective based on the proposed Hamiltonian engineering of the V-B(-) defect in which h-BN is one of four materials chosen to be room temperature qubit candidates.

AB Transition metal (TM) defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are a promising platform in quantum technology, especially because some TM defects emit in one of the telecom bands. We develop a theory for the interaction of an active electron in the D shell of a TM defect in SiC with the TM nuclear spin and derive the effective hyperfine tensor within the Kramers doublets formed by the spin-orbit coupling. Based on our theory we discuss the possibility to exchange the nuclear and electron states with potential applications for nuclear spin manipulation and long-lived nuclear-spin based-quantum memories.

TI Completeness of Graphical Languages for Mixed State Quantum Mechanics
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB There exist several graphical languages for quantum information processing, like quantum circuits, ZX-calculus, ZW-calculus, and so on. Each of these languages forms a dagger-symmetric monoidal category (dagger-SMC) and comes with an interpretation functor to the dagger-SMC of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In recent years, one of the main achievements of the categorical approach to quantum mechanics has been to provide several equational theories for most of these graphical languages, making them complete for various fragments of pure quantum mechanics.
   We address the question of how to extend these languages beyond pure quantum mechanics to reason about mixed states and general quantum operations, i.e., completely positive maps. Intuitively, such an extension relies on the axiomatisation of a discard map that allows one to get rid of a quantum system, an operation that is not allowed in pure quantum mechanics.
   We introduce a new construction, the discard construction, which transforms any dagger-symmetric monoidal category into a symmetric monoidal category equipped with a discard map. Roughly speaking this construction consists in making any isometry causal.
   Using this construction, we provide an extension for several graphical languages that we prove to be complete for general quantum operations. However, this construction fails for some fringe cases like Clifford+T quantum mechanics, as the category does not have enough isometries.

TI A cellular automaton decoder for a noise-bias tailored color code
SO QUANTUM
AB Self-correcting quantum memories demon-strate robust properties that can be exploited to improve active quantum error-correction protocols. Here we propose a cellular automa-ton decoder for a variation of the color code where the bases of the physical qubits are lo-cally rotated, which we call the XYZ color code. The local transformation means our de-co der demonstrates key properties of a two-dimensional fractal code if the noise acting on the system is infinitely biased towards dephas-ing, namely, no string-like logical operators. As such, in the high-bias limit, our local de-co der reproduces the behavior of a partially self-correcting memory. At low error rates, our simulations show that the memory time diverges polynomially with system size with-out intervention from a global decoder, up to some critical system size that grows as the er -ror rate is lowered. Furthermore, although we find that we cannot reproduce partially self-correcting behavior at finite bias, our numerics demonstrate improved memory times at real-istic noise biases. Our results therefore moti-vate the design of tailored cellular automaton decoders that help to reduce the bandwidth demands of global decoding for realistic noise models.

TI Research on Key Rate of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   Under Turbulent Channels
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective In the space channel continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), the quantum coherent state modulation system is more versatile with the classical optical communication equipment, and has better compatibility with the fiber channel. It is one of the future space channel CVQKD network construction schemes. Aiming at the effects of beam expansion, absorption, scattering, and drift of optical quantum signals in turbulent channels, as well as the phase difference jitter between local oscillator light and signal light, we construct a simulation model of CVQKD key rate under turbulent channels. The model focuses on analyzing the influence of turbulent channel parameters, phase delay and detection method on the system key rate. The results show that the total excess noise of the system is positively correlated with the transmission distance, the delay time between the local oscillator light and the signal light, and the intensity of atmospheric turbulence. Heterodyne detection has a higher key rate in short -distance transmission, and homodyne detection can achieve longer transmission distance. The simulation results can provide reference for the design and optimization of actual free -space CVQKD systems. Methods In the common time division multiplexing CVQKD system, the phase difference jitter between the local oscillator light and the signal light will increase the channel excess noise and reduce the system key rate. In this paper, the effects of turbulent channel parameters, phase delay and detection methods on system noise and key rate are studied by establishing a simulation model of CVQKD under turbulent channels. The principle of the simulation model in this paper includes key rate theory, turbulent channel transmission efficiency theory, interruption probability theory, local light and signal light phase difference jitter theory. Then, the corresponding simulation work is carried out, and the channel excess noise caused by the phase difference jitter between the local oscillator light and the signal light is discussed.Results and Discussions According to the theoretical model and under specific simulation parameters, the following simulations are carried out: the probability distribution of the system transmittance (Fig. 3), the influence of different time delays on the total system noise (Fig. 4), the influence of different turbulence intensities on the total system noise (Fig. 5), and the influence of different turbulence intensities on the system key rate (Fig. 6). It can be seen from Fig. 3 that under the condition of a fixed transmission distance, there is a peak in the transmittance distribution, and the probability density first decreases and then increases with the increase of distance. It can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 that with the increase of time delay and atmospheric turbulence intensity, the system key rate decreases. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that heterodyne detection has a higher key rate in short -distance transmission, and homodyne detection can achieve longer transmission distance.Conclusions Turbulent channel CVQKD has important applications in wide -area quantum communication networks. It is necessary to study the influence of turbulent channel structure parameters on free -space CVQKD system. In order to meet this demand, the CVQKD model of turbulent channel is established in this paper, and the effects of turbulent channel parameters, local oscillation light and signal light delay time and different detection methods on CVQKD system noise and key rate are studied.
   According to the simulation results, the total excess noise of the system increases slowly and then rapidly with the increase of distance. Increasing the delay time will increase the total noise of the system. The actual CVQKD system needs to select the delay time according to the specific situation. The increase of atmospheric turbulence intensity will increase the total noise of the system, and the phase noise spectral density is positively correlated with the product of signal transmission distance and atmospheric turbulence intensity. The enhancement of atmospheric turbulence will reduce the channel transmittance, increase the system interruption probability and excess noise, and make the system key rate drop rapidly. Heterodyne detection has a high key rate in short -distance transmission, and homodyne detection can achieve longer transmission distance. In the actual system, the receiving antenna size can be appropriately expanded, the delay time between the local oscillation light and the signal light can be optimized, or the adaptive optical system can be used for phase compensation, and the appropriate optical carrier wavelength and detection mode can be selected, so as to improve the key rate or the safe transmission distance of the system. This paper can provide reference for the design and optimization of high performance and practical CVQKD system under turbulent channels.

TI High-precision data acquisition for free-space continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Data acquisition in a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system is a necessary step to obtain secure secret keys. And the known data acquisition methods are commonly based on the assumption that the channel transmittance is constant. However, the channel transmittance in free-space CV-QKD fluctuates during the transmission of quantum signals, and the original methods are not applicable in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a data acquisition scheme based on the dual analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In this scheme, two ADCs with the same sampling frequency as the pulse repetition rate of the system and a dynamic delay module (DDM), which are used to construct a high-precision data acquisition system, eliminate the effect of transmittance fluctuation by a simple division operation of the data from the two ADCs. Simulation and proof-of-principle experimental results show that the scheme is effective for free-space channels and can achieve high-precision data acquisition under the condition of fluctuation of channel transmittance and very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, we introduce the direct application scenarios of the proposed scheme for free-space CV-QKD system and verify their feasibilities. This method is of great significance to promote the experimental realization and practical application of free-space CV-QKD.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

For this, we analyze time and frequency variables as quantum continuous variables in perfect analogy with position and momentum of massive particles or with the electromagnetic field's quadratures. We discuss how this experiment can be used to directly measure the time-frequency Wigner function and implement logical gates in these variables. We also briefly discuss the quantum/classical aspects of this experiment providing a general expression for intensity correlations that make explicit the differences between a classical Hong-Ou-Mandel-like dip and a quantum one. Throughout the manuscript, we will often focus and refer to a particular system based on AlGaAs waveguides emitting photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down conversion, but our results can be extended to other analogous experimental systems and to various degrees of freedom.

TI Quantum information scrambling in quantum many-body scarred systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum many-body scarred systems host special nonthermal eigenstates that support periodic revival dynamics and weakly break the ergodicity. Here, we study the quantum information scrambling dynamics in quantum many-body scarred systems, with a focus on the "PXP" model. We use the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and Holevo information as measures of the information scrambling and apply an efficient numerical method based on matrix product operators to compute them up to 41 spins. We find that both the OTOC and Holevo information exhibit a linear light cone and periodic oscillations inside the light cone for initial states within the scarred subspace, which is in sharp contrast to thermal or many-body localized systems. The periodic revivals of OTOCs and Holevo information signify unusual breakdown of quantum chaos and are not equivalent to the revival dynamics of state fidelity or local observables studied in the previous literature. To explain the formation of the linear light-cone structure, we provide a perturbation-type calculation based on a phenomenological model. In addition, we demonstrate that the OTOC and Holevo information dynamics of the PXP model can be measured using the Rydberg-atom quantum simulators with current experimental technologies and numerically identify the measurable signatures using experimental parameters.

TI Frequency trimming of superconducting qubits using RF-biased ICP
   annealing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a novel method for post-fabrication frequency trimming of superconducting qubits via RF-biased inductively coupled plasma (ICP) annealing. Junction resistance systematically increases with RF bias power, achieving a maximum increase of approximately 40% under O2 plasma and up to 180% under Ar plasma conditions. Specifically, oxygen-based ICP annealing notably improves qubit coherence, extending both relaxation (T1) and coherence (T2) times. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis indicates that the observed increase in junction resistance corresponds to structural changes and barrier thickening. Our results demonstrate that RF-biased ICP annealing provides a highly effective and controllable technique to tune qubit frequencies, representing a promising pathway toward improved coherence and scalability in superconducting quantum processors.

The qubit consists of the two magnetic-insensitive Cs clock states |F = 3, m(F) = 0) and |F = 4, m(F) = 0), which are coupled by microwave radiation. We observe a significant enhancement of the coherence time when employing Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling. A CPMG sequence with ten refocusing pulses increases the coherence time of 16.2(9) ms by more than one order of magnitude to 178(2) ms. In addition, we make use of the filter function formalism and utilise the CPMG sequence to measure the background noise floor affecting the qubit coherence, finding a power-law noise spectrum 1/?(a) with a = 0.89(2). This finding is in very good agreement with an independent measurement of the noise in the intensity of the trapping laser. Moreover, the measured coherence evolutions also exhibit signatures of low-frequency noise originating at distinct frequencies. Our findings point toward noise spectroscopy of engineered atomic baths through single-atom dynamical decoupling in a system of individual Cs impurities immersed in an ultracold Rb-87 bath.

TI A panoramic survey of the advanced encryption standard: from
   architecture to security analysis, key management, real-world
   applications, and post-quantum challenges
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) stands as a cornerstone in contemporary data protection, securing everything from enterprise storage and web traffic to Internet of Things (IoT) devices and high-performance cloud infrastructures. This paper offers a panoramic survey of AES, from its historical foundations and architecture through an exploration of its Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) design, mathematical foundations in Galois Field arithmetic, and evolution since NIST's public competition that selected Rijndael. Emphasis is placed on the algorithm's resistance to classical cryptanalysis such as differential and linear attacks while recognizing that side-channel threats, including power analysis and timing leakage, can undermine even robust ciphers if implementations are flawed. Practical implementations and real-world applications are examined across software libraries, specialized hardware accelerators like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and lightweight adaptations for constrained environments, illustrating how factors such as performance, cost, and energy consumption must be balanced against potential vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we compare AES with alternative block and stream ciphers (e.g., 3DES, ChaCha20), underscoring AES's continuing dominance in both regulated industries and modern cryptographic protocols. Key management emerges as a linchpin, where flawed lifecycle practices or insecure key storage can jeopardize AES's theoretical security. Finally, the paper addresses looming challenges, chief among them the advent of quantum computing, which motivates hybrid cryptographic schemes that combine AES with post-quantum algorithms. By highlighting cutting-edge research on side-channel mitigations, post-quantum integration, and advanced masking techniques, this survey reaffirms AES's pre-eminence while mapping out the critical avenues of innovation needed to preserve its resilience in an evolving threat landscape.

TI An accurate and efficient analytic model of fidelity under depolarizing
   noise oriented to large scale quantum system design
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fidelity is one of the most valuable and commonly used metrics for assessing the performance of quantum circuits on error-prone quantum processors. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate circuit fidelity without executing it on quantum hardware, but they often face limitations in scalability or accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict the fidelity of quantum circuits under depolarizing noise. Building on theoretical results, we propose an efficient fidelity estimation algorithm based on device calibration data. The method is thoroughly validated through simulation and execution on real hardware, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, with enhancements in prediction R2 ranging from 4.96% to 213.54%. The proposed approach provides a scalable and practical tool for benchmarking quantum hardware, comparing quantum software techniques such as compilation methods, obtaining computation bounds for quantum systems, and guiding hardware design decisions, making it a critical resource for developing and evaluating quantum computing technologies.

TI Target Acquisition for Collimation System of Wireless Quantum
   Communication Networks in Low Visibility
SO ENTROPY
AB In severe low-visibility environments full of smoke, because of the performance degeneration of the near-infrared (NIR) collimation system of quantum drones communication networks, the improved dual-threshold method based on trend line analysis for long-wave infrared (LWIR) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) is proposed, to achieve target acquisition. The simulation results show that smoke-scattering noise is a steeply varying medium-high-frequency modulation. At particle sizes less than 4 mu m, the traditional dual-threshold method can effectively distinguish the target information from the smoke noise, which is the advantage of the LWIR laser compared to the NIR laser. For detecting lasers with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the method can achieve good target acquisition, by setting reasonable conventional thresholds, such as 0.7 times the peak intensity and 0.8 times the peak rising velocity. At low SNRs and steep intensity variation, the method can also achieve good target acquisition, by adaptively resetting new thresholds after filtering the detecting laser, such as 0.6 times the peak intensity and 0.6 times the peak rising velocity. The results of this paper will provide a reference for the performance improvement and refinement of the collimation system for wireless quantum communication networks in low visibility.
